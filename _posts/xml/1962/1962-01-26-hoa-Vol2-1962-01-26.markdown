<heading>Commercial Attach&#x00E9; on Staff of S.A. Embassy at Brussels</heading>

<question by="#plewman" to="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<num>*I.</num>

<from>Mr. PLEWMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs:</p>

<p>Whether steps have been taken to appoint an economist on the personnel of the South African Embassy in Brussels; and, if so, (a) what are his main duties, (b) what is his name, (c) when was the appointment made and (d) what rank does he hold at the embassy.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#plewman">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>There is at present a Commercial Attach&#x00E9; on the staff of the South African Embassy at Brussels. His duties are those generally performed by the Commercial Attach&#x00E9; at the diplomatic missions of all countries.</p>

<p>For the information of the hon. member I may add that the South African Ambassador to Belgium, Mr. A. B. F. Burger, was for some years the head of the Economic Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and was specially selected for the Brussels post when it was decided to accredit the Republic&#x2019;s Ambassador also as Ambassador to the European Common Market Organization.</p>

<heading>Amounts Spent by State-controlled Undertakings under 12-Year Plan</heading>

<question by="#plewman" to="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<num>*II.</num>

<from>Mr. PLEWMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<p>Whether any portion of the estimated capital outlay of R2,000,000,000 which, as announced by the Government, is to be spent over a period of 12 years on certain State-controlled undertakings, was spent during 1961; and, if so, (a) on which undertakings, (b) what was the amount in each case and (c) from what source was the outlay financed in each case.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#plewman">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>Yes. (a), (b) and (c) As could be expected the year 1961 was mostly taken up with the preparatory planning of the expansion schemes involved and it therefore represented a period during which a relatively small capital outlay was devoted to the actual implementation of these schemes.</p>

<p>However, notable exceptions were the Electricity Supply Commission and the Phosphate Development Corporation on whose expansion programmes, which were already under way when the announcement was made, amounts of approximately R36,000,000, raised by way of public loans floated locally, and R1,400,000 from funds approved by Parliament, were respectively expended.</p>

<p>In the case of Iscor orders for machinery and equipment to a value of R12,000,000 were placed during the last quarter of 1961, but no disbursements against such orders had as yet been made by the end of that year. These purchases will be financed from funds raised by the Corporation itself.</p>

<heading>Non-Payment of UN Assessments</heading>

<question by="#suzman" to="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<num>*IV.</num>

<from>Mrs. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs:</p>

<p>Whether the Republic of South Africa has met its financial commitments to date to the United Nations Organization; and, if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>Yes. South Africa on due dates fully paid up its annual assessment for the ordinary budget of the United Nations, and also its contribution to the maintenance of the United Nations force in the Suez area. In addition, the Republic has fully paid its contributions to different voluntary funds of the United Nations, such as the Children&#x2019;s Fund; the Fund for Refugees; and the Expanded Programme for Technical Assistance.</p>

<p>As regards the costs incurred in connection with the United Nations action in the Congo, I told the General Assembly in September of 1960 when United Nations intervention in the Congo was for the first time discussed, that South Africa reserved its position in regard to the costs to be incurred. At the recent session of the Assembly, I gave formal notice that in accordance with that reservation, the Government of the Republic was not prepared to contribute to the costs of the Congo operation.</p>

<p>In view of the hon. member&#x2019;s interest in United Nations finances, she may be interested to know that as at 31 December 1961 51 Member-States were in arrear with their payments for the 1961 General Budget; 22 states were in arrear for 1960, some of which being in arrear also for 1959 and 1958; 61 Member-States had not made their contribution for the maintenance of the United Nations forces in Suez.</p>

<p>As regards the Congo, the total arrears for 1960 at the end of October 1961 totalled almost 20 million dollars. Up to 31 December 1961 no less than 83 Member-States had made no payment at all towards the 1961 assessments. With a few exceptions, these 83 Member-States had in September 1960 enthusiastically voted for United Nations action in the Congo.</p>

<p>As the result of the failure of so many Member-States to meet their commitments, the United Nations became virtually insolvent in so far as income and expenditure are concerned, and the United States Government was obliged to come to the assistance of the financially embarrassed Organization.</p>

<p>In my statement in the course of the General Debate last October, I dealt frankly with the financial plight of the United Nations, and suggested that those Member-States that supported military action by the United Nations should be obliged to pay the costs of these operations.</p>

<p>I may add that the lead given by South Africa in the matter of United Nations finances, was later followed in statements by the representatives of at least two leading Member-States.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development:</p>

<p>Whether he will consider the appointment of a judicial commission to investigate the position of persons against whom removal orders under the Native Administration Act are in force; and, if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<p>No. The appointment of such a commission is not justified as each case is fully investigated before an order is made and is thereafter periodically reviewed as a matter of course. Officers of my Department keep in touch with such persons and report on their needs. When circumstances permit, orders are relaxed or withdrawn.</p>

<heading>Difficulties Experienced by Indians in Collecting Pensions in Durban</heading>

<question by="#oldfield" to="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<num>*X.</num>

<from>Mr. OLDFIELD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports in regard to difficulties experienced by Asiatics when collecting their pensions and social benefits at the Durban office of his Department;</li>

<li>(2) whether steps have been taken or are contemplated to improve facilities for the payment of pensions and benefits at this office; if so, what steps; if not, why not; and</li>

<li>(3) whether he has given consideration to a proposal to have pensions and social benefits paid through branches of the General Post Office; if so, what is his attitude in this regard.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS:</from>

<ol>

<li><p>(1) Yes. In this connection I may state that for a number of years the Protector of Indian Immigrants has not only paid social pensions and grants to Indians in Durban on behalf of my Department, but has also been responsible, <i>inter alia,</i> for the registration and investigation of applications for social pensions.</p>

<p>During December last the office of the Protector was moved from Stanger Street, Durban, where adequate space and waiting-room facilities were available, to Tribune House, where the Protector and his staff will be temporarily housed until new offices are erected on the Stanger Street site vacated by him.</p>

<p>Tribune House does not provide similar adequate waiting-room facilities and on the morning of 21 December last, the first day of that month on which social pensions and grants were payable, considerable congestion occurred as most of the pensioners concerned called at the office of the Protector that morning as they were apparently desirous of drawing their pensions before the Christmas weekend. Steps were immediately taken to alleviate the congestion and by 1 p.m. that day the position was satisfactory.</p></li>

<li>(2) Adequate steps have been taken to provide better facilities. Suitable temporary premises have been acquired where Indian pensioners are accommodated while waiting to draw their pensions. Arrangements have also been made to enable them to draw their pensions from an earlier date in the month, thereby extending the period during which pensions are paid from four to 14 days in any one month. Adequate facilities are being provided for in the new premises to be erected in Stanger Street.</li>

<li><p>(3) This matter has received attention from time to time, but it was found that the advantage of having one central office of payment would, for various reasons, outweigh the disadvantages flowing from decentralization.</p>

<p>In addition to the registration and investigation of applications for social pension by Indians in Durban and the payment of such pensions, the Protector of Indian Immigrants and his staff also perform a variety of services on behalf of Indians, such as the registration of births, marriages and deaths and the administration of estates. All the more important records relating to Indians in Durban are consequently concentrated in the office of the Protector.</p>

<p>I feel that it is desirable to maintain the existing arrangements for payment of social pensions to Indians in Durban as administratively and otherwise, it has been found that the interest of Indian social pensioners can best be served if they are paid their pensions at the office which is equipped to provide them with such a wide variety of services.</p></li>

<p>First Order read: Adjourned debate on motion of censure to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by Sir de Villiers Graaff, adjourned on 25 January, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday afternoon I referred very briefly to what had been said in this debate by four Cabinet Ministers. I made no reference to anything that had been said by backbenchers on the Government side for the simple reason that nothing was said. One must only assume that the backbenchers of the Nationalist Party had been muzzled for the period of this debate and that the Government is so concerned that they are retaining the right of reply for duly instructed members of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>I want to get back at once to the motion before the House. It is a motion, Sir, which is designed, as you will realize, primarily to elicit from the Government its intentions in regard to race policy. The hon. the Prime Minister responded to a certain degree, to a certain extent only, to that request by this side of the House. I may observe that his response was accompanied by a quite unprecedented flood of propaganda, notably from Radio South Africa&#x2014;which becomes more like Radio Zeesen every day as far as I can see&#x2014;and I want to appeal to sensible people in the country not to fall tamely or meekly for this massive attempt to indoctrinate them, but to study the proposals for themselves very carefully and to think out their implications and to decide for themselves on their merits or otherwise. Because, Sir, this is a momentous decision which the Government has taken, a decision which, I think everybody will agree, may very well decide for ever the future of South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister has declared that the next step in the development of his colonial policy involving the dismemberment of the Republic, is self-government for the Transkei leading to complete sovereign independence for that territory. For the time being, in the normal way of colonial development, certain powers will be reserved&#x2014;Foreign Affairs, Defence and certain judicial affairs, whatever that may mean&#x2014;but only temporarily. The prospect which this House has to face is that the Government intends to give the Transkei complete sovereign independence as a sovereign state. I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House support the Government in developing local self-government in the Transkei and large capital programmes for developing the economic and population-carrying potential of the Transkei, but only as an integral and indivisible part of the Republic of South Africa. The Prime Minister proposed a measure of revolutionary development. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration yesterday denied that.</p>

<p><span class="col_231-232" refersTo="page_132"/>He said it was only the logical development of Government policy. Sir, that is surely no argument. It simply shows how far wrong logic will lead you if you start off on a false premise in a wrong direction. The steps announced by the Prime Minister involve the surrender of a large portion of South Africa to a foreign state in the first place and quite clearly envisages the surrender of a great deal more in the near future, the carving up of South Africa on a massive scale.</p>

Talking about morals, Sir, it is quite clear from the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech that he has made up his mind on this subject before the election. Why did he not tell the people? I ask myself was it morally right not to enlighten the people of his specific intentions before the election?</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>My party has not asked the people for a blank cheque. The hon. the Prime Minister had the opportunity of telling the people what he was going to do and he did not take it. I hope we shall hear no more about morals from the Government benches in the future.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance says that this is a logical development, only at an accelerated rate. He did not tell us just why the rate has been accelerated. But the reasons that have been given by the Government benches are twofold. One is that it is no longer possible to resist Bantu claims for franchise rights and, since it is no longer possible to resist those claims, the only alternatives are envisaging &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; throughout the Republic or else partitioning South Africa. The second reason is that this is a last-minute attempt to rehabilitate South Africa in the eyes of the world and to placate world opinion. The hon. the Prime Minister in very plaintive terms said that if there is still any justice left in this world the expenditure which the Government is prepared to undertake&#x2014;I may say that they did not tell us how much they were prepared to undertake; the only specific figure mentioned was &#x00A3;1,000,000 subsidy per annum to help the Transkei apart from the ordinary taxation&#x2014;and the schemes it has worked out should be able to counteract the propaganda made against the Republic. So, Sir, we are being asked to give away, and to pay globular sums for the privilege of giving away large parts of the heritage of the people of this country in order, according to the Government, first of all, to ensure the White man&#x2019;s survival and secondly, to put us right in the eyes of the world. Of course, Sir, on this side of the House we emphatically deny that there is no other way than either &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; throughout the Republic or else destroying South Africa as it is being destroyed to-day geographically, in order to cope with our racial problems.</p>

<p>For many years the Nationalist Party has thriven or did thrive on a very simple question: &#x201C;Do you want your daughter to marry a Black man? If not, vote for us.&#x201D; And they got away with it. That question is now a little bit threadbare perhaps and they have replaced it by the &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; bogy. Mr. Speaker, nobody can foretell the future. Nobody can tell with certainty what is going to happen, whether the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy is followed or anybody else&#x2019;s. I must say that, on the face of it, this proposed step of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s will bring &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; throughout Southern Africa much nearer than it is to-day. If there is any truth in the claim that the Bantu will be satisfied with nothing less than &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, then it is. reasonable to suppose that the new constitution which is in the course of being drafted for the Transkei will be based on adult franchise in some form or other. Since the present authority which is advising the Government and which is. drafting this constitution, is largely composed of nominated chiefs, one imagines that they will be primarily concerned with protecting their positions, safeguarding their own future. That may be so. But it will not last. Once you establish a voters&#x2019; roll and an electoral system, the days of feudal tribalism and feudal chiefs are numbered. In these proposals the Government has thrown overboard completely what they have been preaching during the past years that the Bantu territories must be built up and cherished and encouraged on the maintenance of the tribal system. But that quite clearly goes by the board with these proposals. Pressure to extend adult franchise will be stronger than ever because the tie-up between the Republic and the Transkei is such that there are tens of thousands of Transkeian voters living in the Republic and they are obviously going to expand and encourage and increase the pressure for the extension of the adult franchise to the Republic for all races. The Nationalist Party just will not face the fact that there is not, and there never has been and never will be, a White South Africa in the strict sense of the words. [Interjection.] No matter what the Prime Minister may say or do, White South Africans will always live in a multi-racial country and no amount of cutting up the Republic or throwing away territory will alter that fact. Surrounding ourselves with Black independent states, as is envisaged by the statement of policy of the Prime Minister, states on whom we are entirely dependent for our continued economic existence, will simply increase the pressure on us in the smaller South Africa which is envisaged. Supposing the Prime Minister&#x2019;s programme is carried out in full, what is left for the White man in South Africa? <span class="col_233-234" refersTo="page_133"/>What is left, Sir, is a shrunken, truncated South Africa containing a majority of non-Whites, in which the Whites propose to continue to exercise complete political control. There, in so far as world opinion is concerned, it seems to me we are back exactly where we started from, because world opinion disapproves of the racial policies of this country whether they are carried out in a larger South Africa or a smaller one. May I quote one extract from a speech made by the United States representative, Mr. Plimpton, at UNO last October, when a debate was taking place in the Special Committee on the question of apartheid? He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are once again faced in this Committee with the problem of the racial policies of the Government of South Africa and their consequences. I want to state in unmistakable terms that the United States abhors and actively opposes the policy of apartheid. All of the Governments represented here to-day know that the United States, in the Security Council and in this Council, expressed its uncompromising opposition to the policy of racial discrimination summed up in the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;. What is not so well known is that the United States has, in private diplomatic approaches to the Government of the Republic of South Africa, reinforced the depth and strength of its public views on apartheid by vigorous private but official representatives that a change in policy is called for. The opposition of my Government to apartheid springs from the spirit of our Declaration of Independence, the first Declaration of Independence. The United States believes that all men are created equal in the eyes of God and should be treated as equal in the eyes of the law.</block>

<p>That, I think, hon. members opposite may not agree with, but I think it represents pretty fairly the views of world opinion. Whether it is a greater or smaller South Africa, if these policies are pursued, world opinion in regard to us is not going to change.</p>

<p>That is one of those general questions one can expect from the hon. member.

<p>Irrespective of what the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) may say or think, I do not believe that this particular proposal is going to make any difference in the eyes of the world, and in deciding their opinion as to the racial policies of the Government. As I see it, Sir, after all the sacrifices which we are going to be asked to make&#x2014;and the members of the Government have been telling us for months that we must be prepared to make great sacrifices in carrying out the policy of the Government&#x2014;what will we have? We will have neither a White South Africa nor the approval of world opinion. These steps, amongst other things, are being taken to protect the White man, allegedly, although <i>I</i> must say that this Government appears to be much more concerned at the moment with giving independence to the Bantu than they are with what the White man will have to sacrifice for this particular policy. From the White man&#x2019;s point of view&#x2014;and let us consider the White man for a moment. I remember when Mr. Macmillan made his speech the Prime Minister got up to reply to him and he said he had listened to Mr. Macmillan but what about the White man? So I am quite in order in saying that for the moment we are entitled to consider the position of the White man, when considering these policies and their effect. From the White man&#x2019;s point of view, the Opposition is entitled to stress the fact that the White man is entitled to some consideration.</p>

<p>After all, we are being called upon to pay the piper in all this and the White man&#x2019;s position should be considered. From the White man&#x2019;s point of view, what are the prospects as the result of this policy? First of all, the prospects are that he will have a much smaller Republic with a non-White majority in it, not a White Republic but a multi-racial Republic, with the non-Whites increasingly demanding political rights, with the full backing of the Black independent states this Government is creating. Secondly, it means the abandonment of any idea of White leadership in Southern Africa. Thirdly, it means a series of Black, independent states around us, states which may or may not be friendly but which will certainly control the source of our labour supply. Fourthly, there will be a huge capital expenditure and current annual expenditure as well to keep these states going on lines which may very well differ increasingly from our own policies. We have had nothing from the other side as to what this capital expenditure is likely to be. The Minister of Bantu Administration mentioned that they were going to build 2,800 miles of roads in the reserves in the next five years. Has he any idea what that will cost, and would he like to tell me what it will cost?</p>

<p>It is just an unknown factor. It is just one of those things the White man will have to face, and lastly, the White man is faced with an endless series of headaches and problems dealing with these states, and with the non-Whites within our own borders, as the result of the establishment of these states. So, before surrendering vast areas of our country and incurring unknown expenditure which nobody on that side of the House is even prepared to estimate but which is big enough for the Minister of Finance to talk about getting large loans from the I.M.F., and for running the very real risk of having hostile states all around us, what is the White man gaining by these proposals? He is certainly not gaining a White South Africa. He is certainly not gaining the support and approval of our would-be friends in the world. As far as I can see, he stands to gain absolutely nothing. But what will it cost him nobody knows. I believe that the Prime Minister with this proposal has produced a monster which may very well spell the doom of the White man in South Africa, and nobody on that side has attempted to show what the White man will gain by these proposals. In fact, I think the Black man is very likely to lose by them, too, if we withdraw our control and assistance. Sir, if the Nationalist Party would only accept the fact that this is a multi-racial country and it always will be, and that nothing they can say or do can alter that fact, we might possibly get somewhere. But as long as they continue to chase this will-o&#x2019;-the-wisp and think it is possible to establish a White South Africa over which they have sole control, so long is there no hope whatever, for as long as this Government remains in power, for the future peace and development of the Republic. In truth, whilst we would welcome and support the development of the Transkei and the other reserves with all the assistance we can give them, with the investment of large capital sums and the steady growth of local self-government in those territories, all within the confines and as part and parcel of the Republic of South Africa, we cannot possibly subscribe to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposals that he put before this House. We cannot subscribe to it and we shall regard it as our duty to do our best to open the eyes of the people throughout the country to the fallacies and dangers contained in these proposals. I believe sincerely that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposals will not only solve any of the problems facing us, but I believe that they will add to and multiply the problems and the dangers already confronting us. Therefore we cannot accept the Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposals. Now, if I sit down, will the hon. the Minister answer my question and tell me what those roads will cost?</p>

I want to state clearly that a policy of colonialism means a policy whereby the mother country allows its citizens and subjects to go and settle in that colony which they colonize. It means a policy in terms of which they allow their citizens to invest money for their own advantage in that colony, and both of these are standpoints of principle which are rejected by this Government, and which show that the policy of this Government lies in the direction of the development of self-governing separate states, as the hon. member himself later admitted. But he uses these words deliberately in an attempt to arouse opposition overseas concerning this policy of the Nationalist Government which is aimed at saving the <span class="col_237-238" refersTo="page_135"/>White man in South Africa, and he does so for party-political gain. I regard that as a crime against the White man in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not really want to discuss the Indian problem here to-day. I just want to refer to it in passing, because it was mentioned in the motion and in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. All I want to say is that I hope within the near future to have the opportunity of discussing this matter fully in the Senate. The Prime Minister has referred to the principles underlying our approach to the Indian problem and he added that it was important that in the development and application of our policy we should work in consultation with the Indians themselves. Therefore our first problem is to find those Indians who can be representative leaders of the Indian community, and to discuss this policy with them, and to develop it, and therefore that is the first task to which I am devoting my attention. When I talk about Indian leaders I am of course not referring to the Indian Congress movement, because their obvious aim is to destroy our policy and everything which we are trying to do for the Indians. But we will find those Indian leaders out of the thousands who have already demonstrated their goodwill and who are willing to cooperate with us, even though they still do not want to commit themselves as to the principles of our policy and the method by which we intend implementing it, but who have intimated their readiness to have consultations. The goodwill I have experienced in the few months for which I have been responsible for the portfolio of Indian Affairs has been so unexpectedly encouraging that it has given me the fullest confidence that amongst the Indians of South Africa there is a sense of responsibility and a readiness to co-operate in order to ensure good relations, and that we are experiencing that co-operation to an ever-increasing degree. That is all I want to say about Indian affairs at this stage.</p>

<p>Before coming to my main remarks, I just want to refer to questions which have been put here and remarks made in regard to Bantu education and how it will be affected by this new policy of self-governing Bantu states. The object of the question put by Opposition members, viz. whether these Bantu governments will have the right themselves to decide about Bantu education, is of course not simply to obtain information, because it has already been said that the division of power it a matter which will be agreed upon only after consultation with the Bantu leaders. I believe that the reason why the question was asked is to cause confusion, and I come to that. But I want to state clearly that I do not believe that the Transkei or any other Bantu area at this stage will desire to have full control over all stages of education for its own people, because they realize that uniformity has to be maintained between the various areas, as well as standards, which can only be ensured through having a common examination system. They realize that full justice cannot at this stage be done in regard to higher education, which is essential for the developing Bantu areas, by having Bantu teachers only, and that it will be more difficult to make use of White teachers if education falls completely under the control of, e.g., a Bantu Parliament. Therefore we will have to assist them because the political development and the accompanying economic development of the people of that area, and we shall have to help them. How and where we are to give assistance will have to be determined in consultation with them.</p>

<p>But the object of the questions put by hon. members, as to whether the Bantu Parliament will have the right to repeal the Bantu Education Act, is to imply that although we are prepared to give the Bantu in the Transkei self-rule, it will really mean very little to them because we still retain certain, according to them, oppressive measures like the Bantu Education Act, because that is how they described that Act. That is why I say that this question is aimed at creating the impression in the minds of the Bantu and also overseas that we still want to keep the Bantu in an inferior position. So doing, they hope to destroy the good work we are busy doing. Now I want to say immediately that I am quite convinced that the Bantu, if he is given self-rule, does not desire to make radical changes in the Bantu Education Act in regard to his education. I base my conviction on the fact that the co-operation we have received from the Bantu in their areas in connection with Bantu education under this Act has been the most favourable one could have expected, and much better than what we have had from hon. members opposite. There is only one single aspect of Bantu education in regard to which there are doubts, and that is mother tongue education, and negotiations are already under way in this regard between the Transkeian representatives and my Department, from which it is apparent that the Bantu of the Transkei in principle accept mother tongue instruction, but that they just have certain doubts about certain of the ways in which it is to be applied. I have already instituted an investigation in regard to that matter, and consultations are in progress.</p>

<p>But in the second place I am convinced that the Bantu do not want to repeal or amend the Bantu Education Act, because recently a conference was held in Accra by the African states in regard to education, and according to the UNESCO publication entitled &#x201C;Conference of African States on the Development of Education in Africa, Addis Ababa, 15 to 25 May 1961&#x201D;, certain recommendations are contained under Head F entitled &#x201C;The Reform of the Content of Education&#x201D;, which reads as follows:</p>

<p>It is recommended:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) that as the present content of education in Africa is not in line with either existing African conditions, the postulate of political independence, the dominant features of an essentially technological aid, or the imperatives of balanced economic development involving <span class="col_239-240" refersTo="page_136"/>rapid industrialization, but is based on a non-African background, allowing no room for the African child&#x2019;s intelligence, powers of observation and creative imagination to develop freely and help him find his bearings in the world&#x2014;African educational authorities should revise and reform the content of education in the areas of the curricula, text books, and methods, so as to take account of African environment, child development, cultural heritage and the demand of technological progress and economic development, especially industrialization.</li>

<li>(2) that the teaching of scientific and technical subjects be developed so as to ensure the training of highly qualified staff as speedily as possible, such as research workers, engineers, science teachers, economists, financial experts and statisticians;</li>

<li>(3) that the curricula be reformed by allotting less time to the teaching of classics and ending the preferential treatment given to the teaching of non-African history and geography;</li>

<li>(4) that all aspects of humanistic education which will help in character-formation be retained, and while rooting itself in Africa&#x2019;s past, the educational content should not seal the student off from the rest of the world. The African States must make the necessary study of any changes in additional attitudes so as to achieve in their curricula the synthesis of their own values and of universal values.</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, the resolution adopted by the Conference of African States in Addis Ababa in 1961 literally supports what was done by the Bantu Education Act in South Africa, and therefore I say that in principle the Bantu education system we have given them is the very thing they themselves want in the rest of Africa, and during all these discussions, right up to this year even, the delegates from the Union of South Africa have given the lead at these discussions and have made a deep impression on the educationists of the rest of Africa. Therefore I think there is no danger that the Bantu in South Africa will desire to have a different system, as do hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>But I come to the debate itself, and I just want to say that the support received by the Government for its standpoint from the White people, not only from supporters of the Government, but also from others, as well as from the Bantu, clearly emerges from the reports we have had just recently. Anyone who reads the newspapers will have observed that. The only support the United Party receives for their standpoint comes from Albert Luthuli. I do not want to say more about that. But I think that after three days of this debate it is necessary for us, as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) said yesterday, to have clarity regarding our standpoint, and, in order to have clarity, we must contrast the two alternatives and test them, on the one hand the development of separate communities with self-government to whatever extent is possible for each group, as favoured by the National Party, and on the other hand the racial federation plan of the United Party. I think it is necessary for me briefly to refer to this racial federation plan. It is, of course, very difficult to know what they mean precisely, because the Leader of the Opposition, who now in his motion asks for greater clarity as to the policy of the Government, said the following in August last year, according to the <i>Natal Mercury,</i> when he was explaining his racial federation policy to his congress&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He emphasized that while there should be signposts in the federation plan, they should not become bogged down in detail.</block>

<p>In other words, he does not want to give details, and when, at the same congress, motions were moved by the constituencies of Constantia and Wynberg, motions on their secret agenda asking for direct representation for the Bantu, the Coloured and the Indian, we have this very interesting statement by the Leader of the Opposition when these secret motions were being discussed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At to-day&#x2019;s session Sir de Villiers Graaff, the United Party national leader, intervened and suggested that with the party&#x2019;s policy of race federation, these were matters that should be considered in time.</block>

<p>In other words, do not give details now; all these details, the blueprint for their plan must be worked out later after the voters have voted. But he could not always get away from it so easily, because he did in fact give an exposition which is of particular interest to us. In July 1961 he wrote an article in the American quarterly, <i>Foreign Affairs,</i> under the heading &#x201C;South African Prospects&#x2014;Thoughts on an Alternative Race Policy&#x201D;, and there he had to give more details. Here it is very significant, in my opinion, although I have little fault to find with the first portion of his article where he gives the factual and historical background, that in the second part of his article, where he deals with the alternative policy, viz. the United Party&#x2019;s policy, he says the following, firstly in connection with the standpoint of principle&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be a policy which will retain for the millions of White South Africans their standards and the system of values which they have proudly derived from their Western forefathers. It should at the same time be a policy which will evince the will to share the fruits of Western civilization with all those emergent peoples in our country who are eager to prove their desire to co-operate in retaining the Union of South Africa as bastion in Africa of the Western way of life.</block>

<p>After dealing with this basis of policy he comes to the details&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_241-242" refersTo="page_137"/>We are persuaded that there is a community of 1,500,000 non-White people in South Africa who already satisfy this test.</block>

<p>In other words, the test of helping to preserve Western civilization&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is composed of those of mixed blood in our country known as the Cape Coloured people. They have accepted Western standards. They are civilized. The policy of the United Party, therefore, is that they should in every way &#x2026;</block>

<p>I repeat &#x201C;in every way&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; be regarded as part of Western society in South Africa, enjoying the rights to which that status entitles them. They should be placed on a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and be free to nominate and elect their own people to Parliament on that roll. Any measure that may be necessary in the economic field to protect the higher standard of living of our civilized people should not apply to them.</block>

<p>Now, with reference to this very clear statement by the Leader of the Opposition, I want to ask him this question: If that is his standpoint, what moral right has he to discriminate between the Whites and the Coloureds in regard to franchise qualifications? He states that he wants the franchise on a Common Roll with the right of their being elected themselves, and I say that means the franchise for every male and every female Coloured in South Africa over the age of 18 years. I say he wants that, regardless of any educational or income qualifications, and he wants it for the whole of the Republic of South Africa. I now want to ask him in his reply to this debate to state clearly whether my inference from what he said here is wrong. If he denies it, he must tell us on what moral grounds he justifies distinguishing between the White and the Coloured voter if he says &#x201C;they should in every way be regarded as part of the Western society, enjoying the rights to which that status entitles them&#x201D;, and if that is his standpoint, he must also tell us on what grounds he justifies separate schools or separate residential areas between the Coloureds and the Whites, because he clearly says &#x201C;they should be regarded in every way as part of the Western society, enjoying the rights to which that status entitles them&#x201D;. And if he does not basically agree with this, if he does not agree that it means doing away with apartheid in schools, doing away with separate residential areas and absolutely equal franchise qualifications, then he must tell us on what moral grounds he justifies differences in those respects, and if he draws a distinction there he must at the same time tell us why he gives the world the impression that he is going in the direction of absolute equality if he favours another policy in South Africa.</p>

<p>But then he comes to the next point, namely the Indians, and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our 500,000 Indians are in a similar position. Attitudes to them in South Africa are bedevilled for historical reasons by the fact that they have in the past looked to India for protection&#x2026;. But when my party, the United Party, is in power it will reopen discussion with this important community with a view to re-establishing their status as citizens of South Africa.</block>

<p>I say that if words have any meaning, then this paragraph read in conjunction with the previous paragraph dealing with the Coloureds, mean that eventually he also wants to grant an equal franchise to the Indians on a Common Roll, because if he does not mean that, why did he try to mislead the world, and on what moral grounds does he justify any other standpoint?</p>

<p>Then he comes to the Bantu, and in connection with them he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be our earnest endeavour to train the people in the Reservations to accept increased responsibilities so that they may gain experience of modern administration and the ways of democracy. In this way we see that in time the development of indigenous institutions in those areas will make it possible to give a geographical content to the principle of racial federation, which we believe is the ultimate pattern of development in the Union of South Africa. In the future I can foresee a South African Parliament retaining full control over major policy but delegating as of right certain powers and functions to these local institutions on a federal basis. Representatives of these areas will naturally be elected to the Central Government. That is for the future. As an immediate step, the United Party will restore the representatives of the Native peoples to the Central Parliament of the country. Parliamentary representation, which had in the past been limited to the Cape Province, will be extended to the whole country. At least in the initial stages the representatives will be White people.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Before I analyse his speech further, I want to refer to what the hon. member for Yeoville said yesterday. He realized what an effect, what an impact, this statement by the Prime Minister of South Africa had made on the public, White and Bantu, in this country, and he realized that the idea had firmly taken root in the mind of the public that here we have a development which would make the United Party superfluous in future, which would eliminate the United Party, and therefore he made a pathetic attempt to justify the continued existence of that party by saying that the establishment of separate areas with a measure of self-rule, as is now being done, can be used to change South Africa into a federation, which is the policy of the United Party. In other words, the political struggle of the future will no longer be over the question as to whether we should have separate development of integration towards a multiracial state, but over the question whether separate development should lead to a system of good neighbourliness with mutual consultation on matters of common interest, as favoured by the National Party, or whether it should lead to a federation in which the various racial groups are to be represented in one Central Parliament, or as the hon. member for Yeoville expressed it in his latest exposition in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> in a sort of &#x201C;National Convention in permanent session&#x201D;. The important questions which arise from this are the following: The hon. member for Yeoville said that the policy favoured by the Government must necessarily result in the fact that there will continually be conflicts between states. His most important objection to our policy was that this granting of self-rule would lead to conflict between states. But if there is to be conflict&#x2014;and we foresee that it may happen&#x2014;then in an attempt to resolve them we want to have regular consultations on a high level. We are prepared to run that risk, and we have the courage and the faith that it can be surmounted in a spirit of good neighbourliness and goodwill. But what will be the position under their system? In a federal Parliament where you have the representation of the various racial groups on a racial basis, there must inevitably be continual clashes over the measure of representation. The hon. member for Yeoville says in his article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> that the measure of representation will depend on &#x201C;the stage of their civilization&#x201D;. That is his yardstick. But his leader, the Leader of the United Party, tells him in this article that &#x201C;a civilization test is an odious task; it must at its best be arbitrary and unscientific&#x201D;. Well, it is for those two to decide the matter, because the one says that a civilization test is the thing to determine how much representation they should have, but his leader tells him that one cannot apply a civilization test because it is arbitrary and unscientific.</p>

<p>But the confusion of those hon. members from the article of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself. He does not want a civilization test because it will be arbitrary and unscientific, but he wants a test based on character and &#x201C;responsible status&#x201D;. Now that is not arbitrary and it is not unscientific. The more I see of the logic of those hon. members, the more I understand why they belong to the U.P. Therefore I say that this system of the U.P. will lead to racial clashes unless and until one is prepared to give to the various race groups in their geographical units the franchise and representation in the central body equivalent to the representation given to the Whites, based on their numbers. In other words, the numerical strength of the various groups will have to be the decisive factor in the representation in the Central Parliament, otherwise one can expect nothing but constant friction and clashes.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville said that the Government&#x2019;s policy is not a solution in the Bantu areas. Now they want to give the Bantu in the White areas representation in the Central Parliament on the basis of some or other unscientific and arbitrary yardstick, as the Leader of the Opposition himself says, and there it must be the basis for clashes and friction until eventually one gives the Bantu in the White area &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; on an equal basis with the Whites, because along that road of the United Party there is no possibility of stopping at a half-way station; one simply cannot <span class="col_245-246" refersTo="page_139"/>do so. One will be driven further, as all the countries in Africa have shown us, as the Central African Federation has shown us, and as Kenya and all the other places in the world have shown. In other words, their policy cannot eliminate conflict; it can only lead to more conflict, and in addition it must result in a central Parliament with equal representation for the geographic units of the Bantu, with the mixed geographic unit in which the White man will be on the basis of numbers, and in the mixed geographic unit in which the White man will also be there will be an equal franchise for all race groups, and that can only mean the eventual total domination by the Black man in South Africa, not only in the Central Parliament but also in the mixed area favoured by them.</p>

<p>That brings me to the important argument advanced by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), namely the question of borders. He particularly referred to Zululand and asked how those borders would be determined; here the Whites are now being asked to make sacrifices, to abandon territories for the sake of the consolidation of the Bantu areas, eventually to establish an independent state there, and that he is not prepared to do. But, Mr. Speaker, their policy of race federation is based on the principal of separate geographic units, and one can only have a separate geographic unit if one has borders. In other words, the same border problem&#x2026; (Laughter.) How is the hon. member for Yeoville going to have a geographic unit without borders? There is only one thing which has no limits, and that is the total incapacity of the hon. member for Yeoville to be consistent.</p>

<p>I am not talking now about our terminology; I am talking about the terminology of the Leader of the Opposition. He talks about geographic units. He talks about separate geographic units, and a geographic unit can only exist if it is borders. In other words, the same border problem which faces us faces them as well, and therefore they do not even offer the White man the assurance that he will at least have an area in South Africa where he will be the ruler and where he will have a homeland. Therefore they offer the White man a race federation in which the Bantu will dominate him and a so-called mixed area in which he will also be dominated by the non-Whites. In other words, in regard to borders they call for the same sacrifices as we do, but they offer only death to the White man and not hope for the future, as the National Party does. Therefore I hope that the public of South Africa will realise that we are faced with problems which make it necessary for us to examine our future course, and that the leaders of the United Party who do not think clearly about the future and who only make ill-considered statements in an attempt to keep their own party together, should now be abandoned for the sake of the future of the White man, and for the sake of the peaceful co-existence of all the races in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Just on a point of explanation, when the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) asked me a question in the course of his speech, I unfortunately in my haste made a mistake. The amount required to build the 2,761 miles of roads and 71 bridges in the Bantu areas is R3,350,000. That is the estimated amount</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>I have heard many curious speeches in this House, but none as curious as the one which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education has just delivered. He started off in apparent anger with the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) because the hon. member for Constantia would not indulge with him in the pipe-dream of Bantustans. Because the hon. member for Constantia tried to introduce an air of realism into this House he is accused of sabotaging South Africa. Well, I admit that realism sabotaged the Nationalist&#x2019;s policies but it has never sabotaged South Africa yet. Sir, then he went on to the second point. He, the Minister who is responsible for apartheid as far as it affects the Indian community in this country, explained that after 14 years apartheid, as far as the Indian community is concerned, has advanced to a stage where he is looking for leaders to consult with. After 14 years that is apparently the stage which has been reached. I think that is quite a fair summing up. Then, Sir, he went on to one of the most futile bits of speculation that could ever have taken place in this House. He speculated along what lines education would develop in future independent Bantu states in this country and even went as far as Ghana for authority for his speculations. I do not suppose that the time of the House has ever been wasted so completely as with that bit of futile speculation as to what the Bantustan education is going to look like in future years.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister in his historical exposition of the policy of apartheid here also delivered&#x2014;I wonder if hon. members on the other side realize that&#x2014;a most shattering expos&#x00E9; of the weaknesses of apartheid, of its contradictions, of its impracticalities and of the fatal consequences that it will ultimately have for our national existence. Let me just indicate briefly a few of these major inconsistencies. I wonder if hon. members on the other side were aware that as the Prime Minister built up his case for apartheid as it affects the Bantu population, he systematically broke down apartheid as a policy for the Coloured and Indian communities. Let me give a few examples. The Prime Minister said that the choice before South Africa was the division of South Africa, the dismemberment of South Africa, or otherwise a multi-racial society. The Minister of Finance took the same line and said that the choice before South Africa was a multi-racial state or separate states. So far as the Bantu is concerned apparently our choice is separate states, a dismemberment of <span class="col_247-248" refersTo="page_140"/>South Africa, or otherwise a multi-racial society. But what about the Coloureds and the Indians then. I have never heard of any separate states proposed for them. Does that mean that it is a tacit admission by the Prime Minister and his Government that as far as the Coloureds and the Indians are concerned at least we are a multi-racial society? That is not necessary logic, because the only way in which you can prevent a multi-racial society (together with the Natives), is to have a separate state, and surely the same logic must apply to the Coloureds and the Indians. It is not as if the Indians and the Coloureds are a small minority in this country. They are actually increasing at a faster rate than the Europeans in this country. Last year their rate of increase was 60,000 compared with 50,000 Europeans, and the Viljoen Commission calculated that in the year 2000 there will actually be more Coloureds and Indians in South Africa than Whites. Well, it will be quite an advance if Government members will accept that at least as far as the Coloureds and the Indians are concerned we are a multi-racial society. Sir, I can give some other examples. The Prime Minister said that only in a separate state can human dignity be satisfied and could there be co-operation between the groups. The Prime Minister furthermore said that the people of the Transkei should have their own citizenship and that it was only in this way that they could apparently develop their full human dignity. Sir, what about the Coloureds and the Indians then? Must we deduce from this that they can never develop full human dignity in this State unless the Government accepts that they are part of a multi-racial society? The Prime Minister made a point that he could not allow White ownership of factories in the Transkei because he said that would mean economic colonialism. The Bantu must have opportunities to own their own factories. Again, what about the Coloureds and what about the Indians? In what countries are they going to have their own factories? Does that mean that as far as they are concerned apartheid is then a system of economic colonialism? One can only deduce, Mr. Speaker, that as far as apartheid is concerned double moral standards are applied, on the one hand to the Bantu and on the other hand to the Indians and the Coloureds, and I think nothing is more damning of apartheid as the fact that in order to be logical in its application, the Government is compelled to extend far more extensive political rights to the least westernized group in this country. By all logic one would have thought that the system of the extension of political rights should first of all apply to the most westernized group, the most educated group, the Coloureds in this country. But the logic of apartheid forces this Government into the illogical situation of extending extensive political rights in the first instance to the least developed section of the population. But I will stop flogging this dead horse of apartheid as far as the Coloureds and Indians are concerned, because I truly think that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech has killed apartheid as far as the Coloureds and Indians are concerned, and I think that many hon. members on the other side realize this too in their hearts of hearts that apartheid as far as the Coloured communities are concerned, was simply kept alive and kept going by the indomitable willpower of the Prime Minister and the way he dominates hon. members on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us then turn to Bantu apartheid, this concept of Bantu apartheid that has been sketched for us, and see whether this will really fulfil the promises that have been made. In the first place, I must admit that this plan has been described as a scheme of partition and the establishment of independent states, as is happening in other parts of Africa. Well, that is simply not the truth. Nowhere else in Africa, as far as I am aware, has there been any partition and has there been the establishment of an independent state in which the majority of the citizens of that independent state did not at least live in that state. I think it is unique in the annals of history about the establishment of a country which attained national independence, that the majority of its nationals, or the citizens to be of that country, were living outside that state. Surely, the hon. the Prime Minister and hon. members opposite will agree with me that if this policy is to fulfil the promises that they see for it, at least in the foreseeable future the bulk of the Bantu will have to live in their homeland, far and away the great bulk of the Bantu will have to live in their homeland. It is really too silly for grown-up people to argue about a state of affairs that can possibly persist for any length of time where the great bulk of the citizens do not live in their country. It is nonsensical to talk about national independence and an own national existence if the great bulk of your people do not even live in your country. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has already pointed out how the minority problems and the intense political nationalism in this twentieth century has bedevilled European politics and has caused many of the wars which have so shattered Europe during the past 50 years. No doubt that is the reason why the history that has been put to this House, I suggest, was not quite correct. It has been suggested that the whole history of Europe shows that you can only have peace if you partition national units in their own areas, whereas the whole development since the last war has been the direct opposite. Europeans have learned from their past mistakes and the whole movement of Europe to-day is towards political unity of all people with common cultural interests and the common cultural western heritage.</p>

<p>In the light of the creation of independent states in Europe where minorities led to all the trouble, surely it further proves the point that if you are going to leave the majority of your citizens outside your national state, you are never going to have peaceful relations between the two neighbouring states. If minorities have led to all these troubles that we <span class="col_249-250" refersTo="page_141"/>have seen in Europe during the past 50 years, what is going to happen here in South Africa and what are the relations going to be between the White Republic and the independent Black states round about if the majority of their populations live in the White Republic? Therefore I again say that this scheme that the hon. the Prime Minister has put before the country can only possibly work if it is possible in the foreseeable future to substantially see to it that the citizens of the Transkei live in the Transkei and not in the Republic of South Africa, that basically they live there. What are the chances of bringing that about? After all. we have had 14 years of apartheid and we found during those 14 years that far from the percentage living in the Native areas increasing. the percentage that was living outside these areas has increased steadily and again and again we have pointed out from this side that the reason for that is quite simple, namely that all investment in Southern Africa, all investment creating jobs in Southern Africa in the past, has always been in the White area, and only a substantial diversion of investment to the Native areas could possibly reverse this flow of Natives from the Native areas. And. Mr. Speaker, one can even get an assessment of the order of this diversion that will have to take place. My hon. Leader mentioned it the other day that at least three-fifths of the labour force that is added to our existing labour force every year consists of Bantu, and it surely means that at least half of the investment that takes place in what is the Republic of South Africa to-day will have to be transferred to these Native areas. But even that would not be sufficient. It is not enough as all the other undeveloped areas in Africa show, simply to pour in capital. You must build up human capabilities, technological and administrative capabilities to be able to run a modern society before you can invest and before you can really increase the carrying capacity of an under-developed area. After 14 years precious little has been done in that respect, so little that there is very little scope for rapid industrial development, even if one had the capital available. The simple truth of the matter is that we have not been able to increase the carrying capacity of the Bantu areas in the past 14 years because the White voters will simply not stand for any policy that causes such a great diversion of their capital resources to the Native areas. And in any event from the human point of view it would be completely impracticable, because in these Native areas, unless you allow White technological workers and White capitalists to go there, you will simply not have the manpower to create the industries that in turn must create the employment necessary, or reduce the flow of Africans from the Native reserves to the White area. Now under this scheme, Mr. Speaker, one gets the impression from the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Finance that it will now be easier, once you can give these areas independence, to improve their carrying capacity. I cannot see why that should be so. The financial effort involved, the human effort involved will still exactly be the same, and from the administrative point of view it will be more difficult, because in order to develop these areas one will now have to deal with two authorities; you will not have one central Government; you will now have to have agreement between your new Black government and your Republican Government to develop those areas, and surely the resistance of the Europeans who have to provide the bulk of the capital, the tax money to bring this about, will increase if these countries become independent foreign countries, because it will amount to developing industries in foreign countries that are going to compete with your own undertakings. So it will be an infinitely harder problem. The hon. the Minister of Finance quoted some authority in which it was said that basically the needs of under-developed countries were law and order and an incorruptible public service. He did not develop that theme, but surely once these areas become independent, he does not wish to imply that the public service will become more incorruptible or that law and order will be improved? If anything, your standard of administration will go down. So this very authority that he quotes also militates against the chances of developing the existing Native reserves to the standard which will be necessary if the bulk of the Bantu were to live there.</p>

<p>But of course the hon. the Prime Minister thinks he has found a way round this dilemma of diverting such a large percentage of your capital investment from your White area to your Native areas. He thinks he has found a solution in what is called the development of border industries. The idea of course is that the control of industries will then still remain in the hands of the White capitalists, and the capital will still be invested in the Republic, but the labour will be largely Bantu and will be supplied from the Bantu areas to be now established as independent states. Moreover, if I followed the hon. the Prime Minister correctly he said that whereas White capital and Black labour in the Bantu areas would be equivalent to economic colonialization (and he develops his argument and even apparently argues that a White capitalist in a Black area would be an exploiter), if he uses the Black labour in a White area he is not an exploiter. Then he makes the second point and says, and that is why he rejects all idea of partnership in the Native areas, that White capital and Black labour in White cities, like say Benoni, Boksburg, Springs and Krugersdorp, is equivalent to economic integration. But, says the Prime Minister, if you have White capital and Black labour in Pretoria North, within 13 miles of Hammanskraal. then you get neither economic colonialism, nor economic integration. Logically one would have imagined that if you go to a midway position like that, you would have elements of both&#x2014;you would have economic colonialism, and you would have economic integration. Mr. Speaker, it is really on such fantastic economic dogmas that if you simply shift a <span class="col_251-252" refersTo="page_142"/>factory from Boksburg to Pretoria North, you can neither have economic colonialism nor economic integration. It is a fantastic economic dogma and sophistry, but yet, as I say, our future economic development is apparently going to be built and planned on such a fantastic idea. What on earth makes Government members think that if industry is sited in border areas, there will be no trouble, they will avoid both the troubles of economic integration and the problems of economic colonialism? Because the siting of industries in border areas and the establishment of independent Black states will create an entirely new lot of problems for South African industry. In the first place you are going to have a political division between management and labour. What I mean by that is that one political authority will control management and the capitalists and another political authority will control labour. Which means that every dispute between labour and management will take on the aspect of an international dispute. We know how hard it is in an ordinary state where both your management and your labour are under the same political control to maintain peace. It is the great problem in Europe to-day to get both sides to act reasonably and not by excessive profit on the one hand and excessive wage demands on the other to cause inflation. That is in one political system. How much harder the problem is going to be if you have a political division&#x2014;one political authority controlling your management and another political authority controlling your labour! How difficult wage bargaining will become? And why should the Native the moment he crosses the border have the feeling of exploitation? Why should he lose that feeling of exploitation the moment he crosses the border to work in a border industry? Surely he will have the same feelings of exploitation, he will still be in the White Republic where presumably all the discriminatory labour laws will apply to him, like job reservation, where he is prohibited from developing his full skill. So he will surely have exactly the same resentment either in the Black area or in the White area. We already have had an example, Mr. Speaker, last year, when the paramount chief of the Tembus at the last session of the Territorial Authority, when the question of the independence of the Transkei was first mooted, suggested that as the Bantu dug out most of the gold in this country, once the Transkei became independent it should be quite simple to appoint economists who could determine how much of the profits made out of gold mines should be paid to each minelabourer. That is what is going to happen if the bulk of your labour is controlled by a foreign political authority. They are going to make all these types of demands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Has not Luthuli made these demands now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>This was the demand of the paramount chief of the Tembus at the last Territorial Authority meeting of the Transkei when they discussed independence. This type of demand to interfere in labour matters will surely increase. It is obvious that will happen, because imagine the position in any country in the world where two-thirds of your industrial labour, which will be the case once full independence is granted to all the Native territories in this country, where two-thirds of your labourers are under the political control of a foreign power or foreign powers? Imagine the tremendous influences and powers these foreign countries will have over your economy. If they are in any way hostile at all, imagine what they can do to disrupt your economy by withholding labour and by insisting that they should demand completely unrealistic wages. It is fantastic plans like these which are destroying the confidence of the investors both foreign and local in this country. We have already seen how as a result of the policies followed during the last 13 years, the confidence of the investors has been destroyed systematically in this country. It is reflected in the rate of our economic growth. In the most recent <i>Optima</i> of 26 December, on page 205, it is calculated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The average annual rate of growth in real income per head has for example declined from 3.5 per cent between 1945 and 1948 to 2.8 per cent between 1948 and 1954 and to 1.4 per cent between 1954 and 1960.</block>

<p>A steady downtrend in the rate in which our standard of living is rising. And more recently we had &#x201C;A Survey of Contemporary Economic Conditions and Prospects&#x201D; for 1962 by Mr. Hupkes and van der Berg, and they show on page 7 that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The rates of the annual increase per capita in various countries of the world shows that South Africa as compared with other Western countries like Western Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom, shows that whereas their rate of interest was between 3.4 per cent to 6.9 per cent, South Africa&#x2019;s rate of increase was 1.4 per cent. Only the United States and Australia had the same rate of increase as South Africa.</block>

<p>We all know how worried the United States administration is at the very low rate of increase in wealth and income per head because they realize and accept it as a fact that the whole communistic bloc is going much faster ahead and as hon. members on the other side will know, the President of the U.S.A. has recently set a target of a rate of increase of at least 3 to 4 per cent a year. So it is quite clear that we have not got a lot of fat to live on. Our rate of growth is already very slow. We cannot try new experiments that will further destroy the confidence of investors in this country. Because, Sir. this new experiment that we are going to embark on now will as surely as we stand here further destroy the confidence in this country. Because once this barrage of propaganda dies down and people <span class="col_253-254" refersTo="page_143"/>see the true consequences of this policy, it will mean a further falling-off of confidence of the people in this country. Stripped of all verbal camouflage, what does this policy really amount to? It is a policy of limited surrender, limited surrender under the pressure on the policy of apartheid from the world outside and from inside. First of all we surrender sovereignty of certain parts of what have been South Africa, the Native reserves. But that is not all that we surrender. We surrender our sovereignty over more than half our Black citizens in this country. We surrender the sovereignty over more than half our Black citizens in this country. Sir, if ever there was a policy of expediency it is this: To think that if you surrender such sovereignty bit by bit, you can somehow or other maintain the sovereignty that remains to you.</p>

<p>The Government says that this is a risk that we must take. But this surrender of sovereignty can have the most serious consequences. The very fact that we surrender sovereignty in a certain area, like the Transkei, makes international interference there far easier than it is now. The argument of South Africa at the United Nations always has been that they wanted to interfere in our affairs, a domestic matter, an internal matter. But by surrendering our sovereignty over certain parts of South Africa, we invite international interference in those parts. We cannot stop it any more.</p>

<p>Not only are we now opening the door for international interference in the Black areas by surrendering our sovereignty there, but the fact that we surrender sovereignty over the Bantu who lives in the White area also opens the door to interference here in the Republic of South Africa so far as these people are concerned. Because as far as I can follow the Government says, that is a risk that we must take. They see that there are these consequences of interference in these new Black states, but they say we must take that risk because then White South Africa will at least not become a multi-racial society. But if we cannot succeed in removing the great bulk of Bantu from the White area, how can you say that we will then not be a multi-racial society. What the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Prime Minister really say is that at the moment we turn all our Black citizens into foreigners, somehow or other, they will not be here as citizens. They will still be here but not as citizens. The fatal flaw in this whole plan is this: The hon. the Prime Minister and other hon. members on the other side seem to think that the moment all the Africans in South Africa are turned into foreigners the outside world dare not interfere anymore. Surely, Mr. Speaker, the very fact that they are turned into foreigners, and that they now have a national government that can look after their interests too, make it far easier for interference here. We do not cease to have a multi-racial society just because we change the legal status of our Black citizens and turn them from South Africans into foreign citizens! They are still here and all the obligations under international law will still apply to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the only possible claim that can then be made is that they are not entitled to political rights, but all the other discriminatory practices which are applied to Africans will still be criticized just as severely as they are to-day overseas. As I say, by opening channels, by breaching our sovereignty over the Bantu areas, we in fact invite interference by the United Nations, because never will Mr. Eric Louw be able to argue again at the United Nations that our treatment of the Africans is our own domestic affair. The moment you turn them into foreigners, it becomes an international affair. You give them far more ground. This is the type of flaw, the fatal flaw in their reasoning, and you find that even an intelligent Minister like the Minister of Transport thinks that by changing our Black citizens into foreigners, we can somehow carry on as in the past and discriminate again and then we will be left alone. The exact opposite will take place. This is the tragic situation that we have been driven to that we really have one of the most fantastic episodes in history: A country divesting the citizenship of more than half its citizens and establishing other political powers to which they can transfer their citizenship. But even assuming that the scheme can work, it can be so easily upset. A legal trick like this can easily be cancelled by another legal trick. What will happen for instance if the new independent Black states in their turn find that the great majority of their citizens who do not live in their areas but in the White area, are a political nuisance by making it impossible for those who live in the area to govern that area? What will happen if they remove their nationality from them? Where will we be? Where we are again and we will sit with a whole Black population within South Africa, with the new independent states refusing to accept them as nationals and the Republic of South Africa refusing to accept them as nationals also? Sir, this is a legal trick, trying to pretend that by creating foreigners, by making foreigners out of your own citizens, you somehow or other seem no longer to be a multi-racial society. That, Sir, is the essence of this matter. Sir, if we want to go forward in an evolutionary manner, if we want to improve the standard of living of all the people living in this country, which I am sure is the sincere desire of all the people in this House, we must start by getting back on a basis of reality, we must accept what the hon. member for Constantia and others on this side have said, namely that we must accept the reality that we are a multi-racial state whether we like it or not. No legal or constitutional tricks can change that reality. Once we have accepted that, we can make the necessary adaptations, gradually. Members always ask whether my leader will remove all racial discrimination. Of course nowhere in history have racial discriminations been removed completely. What we must do is that we must move in that direction, without at any stage imperilling the society <span class="col_255-256" refersTo="page_144"/>that we have, our Western institutions. The Western powers will accept a policy like that. They don&#x2019;t expect us to hand over political powers to-morrow or the day after to people who will destroy it. The very Western civilization that we have brought here is based on that. They will accept a movement towards breaking down injustices, breaking down discrimination gradually, but always maintaining your Western institutions and your Western society. But we can only start on that road, Mr. Speaker, if we accept the reality that we in South Africa are a multi-racial country, whether we like it or not. Once we recognize that, we can make the necessary changes and we can slowly but surely again work our way back to the community of western nations without whose support we as a White community here in Southern Africa will not endure very long.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Like the rest of his party the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) has made himself guilty of revealing a negative attitude and because of that I shall deal with his arguments in the course of my speech. I just want to refer to one thing and that is the fuss he made about the chief of the Tembus. The hon. member said that this was a danger that was being created, that he already wanted the labourers of that area to share in the gold profits, and the hon. member said that would become more insistent under our policy. But Luthuli who advocates the policy of the United Party has long since been talking about the nationalization of the gold mines, as a matter of fact all workers throughout the world, in all circumstances, have always been agitating to have a share in the profits of any industry.</p>

<p>This debate is nearing the end. As it is entitled to, the Opposition did its best to try to attack the policy of the Government. I would have thought that round about Wednesday or Thursday they would have been satisfied that they had destroyed the policy of the Government and that they would have availed themselves of the golden opportunity and stated the policy of the Opposition. The hon. member for Jeppes is one of the more sensible members and when he got up I expected him to make a positive contribution to the debate. But, Mr. Speaker, during the whole of this debate, after all their speakers had participated in it, we did not have a single word about their policy. And then the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) gets up and says that the tragedy of the situation is that they cannot convey to the voters the alternative to this Government&#x2019;s policy. Mr. Speaker, the tragedy is not that they cannot convey it to them, but the tragedy is that they do not want to convey it to them. They do not want to tell us what their policy is. We have been sitting here and with all the King&#x2019;s horses and all the King&#x2019;s men we have been unable to extract one drop of information from them on their policy. For many reasons they are probably once again changing that policy, something which will be very sensible; perhaps they are ashamed of that policy, something which will be quite normal, but unfortunately they are not quite normal. I think they want to forget about their policy. But we shall not allow them to do so. Here we are on the threshold of tremendous development in South Africa, but not a single constructive thought do we get from that side of the House. They only see the difficulties in this new development and not one of the possibilities. They are offering no assistance; they are only placing stumbling blocks in the way. They do not want to help to build up; they only want to break down.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am going to test their policy against the requirements they lay down for our policy. The first objection which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised against our policy was that it was too vague. These were his words: &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know the policy; Government speakers contradict one another. There is an unbelievable vagueness.&#x201D; That was before the Prime Minister had spoken. I am afraid his next objection will be that &#x201C;there is an unbelievable clarity&#x201D;. However, I do not believe he was serious when he asked for clarity, nor do I think he is very pleased with the details which he has received. I think, Mr. Speaker, he has far too many details and the reply which he has received is far too clear and unequivocal to be good for his political health. He reminds me of the unscrupulous young man who asked the girl to marry him, but he did not want &#x201C;yes&#x201D; for an answer; he was merely hoping to get a little cuddle out of it. When she said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, however, he found himself in difficulties. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not want the facts. He did not want &#x201C;yes&#x201D; in regard to the Transkei. He thought he could ask those questions and in that way get a little political cuddle out of it. On this occasion, however, he was dealing with the wrong girl. He got &#x201C;yes&#x201D; for an answer; he got the facts; he got the details and if he does not adapt himself to these new political developments, he will choke in those details for the rest of his political career. Whom does he think he is, to talk about &#x201C;unbelievable vagueness&#x201D;, he, who bluntly refuses to give any details about his policy? Not only does he refuse to give any details, but he elevates that vagueness which he condemns in this side of the House, to a virtue. He lays it down as their policy to be vague. Let me just read to you, Sir, what Mr. Gandar, editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> said after he had announced his policy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The race federation policy is studiously indistinct, but nobody asked for any details as the vagueness admirably suits their own vagueness.</block>

<p>But what about the Leader of the Opposition himself? When the Minister of Bantu Education quoted to us, we heard that when the Leader of the Opposition addressed his congress and came to the details, he had said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_257-258" refersTo="page_145"/>But he stressed that the policy should remain flexible and that the party should not get bogged down with too much detail at this stage.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>That would have been another millstone.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it would have been another millstone round their necks, as the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) said on one occasion. But what details did the hon. member for Yeoville suggest? In the article which he wrote in the <i>Sunday Times</i> in which he explained their federation policy, he comes to the most important aspect and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Its final details will be determined after full discussion and consultation between the Government and the various race groups of our country. As far as possible it will be implemented as a result of such consultation.</block>

<p>They tell us, therefore, that they cannot give us any details. We must first place them in power and then they will work out the details. Mr. Speaker, we must first sign the cheque, and once it has been signed, they will fill in the amount. They must think we are mad! Is it possible for vagueness to exceed that? Who are they to talk about vagueness&#x2014;they who have another policy every year. Only last year the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) got up in this House with their sixpenny policy and said: Ours is the only party who has a printed policy which gives all the details. What has happened to that printed policy today; does he still adhere to it? Where are those details? Then we had the Graaff Senate Plan. After that we had federation and now they tell us that they will give us the details once they get into power. Mr. Speaker, I maintain that is deliberate vagueness in order to lead the public by the nose. It is deliberate vagueness bordering on dishonesty.</p>

<p>Their second objection against our policy is that it cannot be put into practice because it will cost too much. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition got up here and juggled with figures&#x2014;it will cost millions and millions to develop the Bantu homelands; it will cost millions to erect factories; it will cost millions to develop agriculture in the Bantu homelands. I listened to him with increasing surprise. It will cost R500 to place one worker in employment and what will it cost to place a further 20,000 Bantu workers in employment in the Bantu homelands? Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition adds all those millions together and he gives us to understand that all that must immediately come out of the pocket of the taxpayer, and he thinks that will scare the taxpayer out of his wits. If he wants to pretend to be stupid, the taxpayer and the voter of this country are not stupid as yet. I have great respect for him. He is a successful businessman; he comes from a family that has made big economic contributions to the country, and that is why I cannot understand how he can talk the economic rubbish that he has. In the first case, whether we have Bantu homelands or not, we shall in any case have to provide employment for all those people. We shall in any case have to build factories, irrespective of where we build them. We shall in any case have to build railway lines; we shall in any case have to incur those costs, and it will be exactly the same whether we have Bantu homelands or whether we have not got Bantu homelands. Why then all this fuss about what it will cost?</p>

<p>In the second place I want to ask the Leader of the Opposition this: If the first Settler, if the Voortrekkers and if the 1820 Settlers had argued the way he is arguing where would we have been today? Had they asked: &#x201C;What will it cost to build Cape Town, what will it cost to develop the hinterland, what will it cost to plant these vineyards&#x201D;, had the 1820 Settlers asked: &#x201C;What will it cost to build Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage&#x201D; and replied: &#x201C;It will cost to many millions; we must not do anything&#x201D; where would we have been today? We would still have been a mere handful of Whites here in the Western Province and we would still have been eating harders. There would have been a handful of Whites roundabout the area which is Port Elizabeth today, and they would have tended a few goats. It cost millions and millions to build Cape Town, Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, Sasol, Iscor, undertakings such as Dorman Long and everything else, but that has not impoverished us. On the contrary it has enriched us. Why should we flinch today, today when we are on the threshold of a glorious era? Does the Leader of the Opposition realize that money breeds money; that production breeds production; consumption breeds consumption. But the Opposition have always been like that. They have never as yet had the courage to do anything; they have never wanted to tackle anything. They also told us not to build Iscor, it will cost too much money; do not build Foskor, it will cost too much money; do not build Sasol, it will cost too much money; do not develop the Transkei, it will cost too much money. The Bible says &#x201C;The slothful man saith there is a lion without &#x2026;&#x201D; I want to say to the Opposition that they are simply too lazy, physically and mentally. They have no power of perseverance. They have no faith in the Bantu; they have no faith in South Africa and they have no faith in themselves. That is why they are sitting there like a bunch of defeatists&#x2014;yes like a bunch of cowards. I just want to say this to them: What South Africa needs today are men with imagination, men with courage, pluck, men with a zest for work and men with faith. South Africa has those men, and if they do not want to co-operate, they will be brushed aside in this march towards a better and more glorious future for all the races in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_259-260" refersTo="page_146"/>I now want to deal with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s great objection against our policy. He says our policy has no moral basis. In his introductory remarks he said: &#x201C;What will be on trial is the moral basis of the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x201D;. And then he added: &#x201C;The Government will have to prove that the moral basis exists, not only to South Africa but to the world&#x201D;. The following day, after he had heard the speech of the Prime Minister, he said in the <i>Cape Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s unrealistic approach towards the urban Africans and the lack of any moral basis for the plans for the Indians and the Coloured people, makes this policy totally unacceptable.</block>

<p>I gather from this that he is indeed satisfied that there is a moral basis for our Bantu policy, because he only talks about the lack of a moral basis as far as it concerns the Coloureds and the Indians. We have, therefore, in any case made some progress, and I trust that we have also convinced him that also our approach to the Indians and the Coloureds has a moral basis. He says we must convince the world that our policy has a moral basis. I agree with him one hundred per cent, but in that case it is absolutely essential that we know by what yardstick the world measures a moral basis. I am not referring now to the yardstick used by the Afro-Asian countries, because we know only too well what they regard as moral and immoral. They regard it as immoral for any White man to govern on the Continent of Africa, no matter how well he governs; and when the Black man governs, no matter how badly he governs, they regard that as the height of morality. I am talking now about the yardstick used by the West, the yardstick used by President Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan. Mr. Macmillan told us here what that yardstick was. The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) has just told us what the American representative at UNO said when he laid down the standard for that morality. What is that standard? It is that there should be no discrimination on the ground of colour. Mr. Macmillan said that progress in the political and economic fields should be on merit and merit alone. It is not as though he practises that, but I leave it at that. In other words, it is immoral to discriminate on the ground of colour. I now want to test the policy of the Nationalist Party against that standard and then also the policy of the United Party. We admit that there is discrimination in South Africa to-day on the ground of colour. But we want to get away from that The only difference between us and the West&#x2014;the only difference between us and Mr. Macmillan and those people&#x2014;is that they want us to do away with that discrimination in a manner which must inevitably lead to discrimination against the White man. For the life of me I do not see any more morality in discrimination against the White man than in discrimination against the non-White man. We maintain that there is another way and that is that we must do away with discrimination against the non-White, but in such a way that it is not substituted by discrimination against the White man. Let us now test the policy of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I should like to know who he thinks he is to ask us for a moral basis for our policy? He says we must show that moral basis to the world. What about his policy? Should his policy not have a moral basis? Should his policy not comply with those Western standards? And, Mr. Speaker, to what extent do they comply with them? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that their policy would have kept us within the Commonwealth and that it was as a result of our policy that we are out of it. He knows that is not true and that we are out of it as a result of the unreasonable attitude adopted by Ghana, Nigeria, etc; because they wanted to force a policy down our throats as the price we had to pay to remain a member of the Commonwealth, which was as unacceptable to him as it was to us. Or was he prepared to pay that price? He says that under their policy we would have retained our friends at UNO. May I remind him of this, that in 1946, when UNO was still mainly a White body, the great General Smuts, one of the founders of UNO, were given a hiding by Mrs. Pandit of India. If General Smuts could not achieve that at UNO, how does the Leader of the Opposition think he is going to do it with the UNO of to-day? Let us go deeper into their policy and I want to assert two things. This federation plan of theirs is alive with immorality. It does not contain a grain of morality as far as the Coloureds are concerned, as far as the Indians are concerned and as far as the Bantu are concerned. I say that federation plan is a piece of political chicanery from A to Z. My second assertion is this: If that plan is put into operation, the White man will be destroyed within ten years, and within ten years we will have a predominantly Black Parliament with a Black Prime Minister in South Africa. So their plan is both immoral and deadly. Well, if being immoral is the only way in which I can save my life, I must honestly admit that the temptation will be great. But not only does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition invite me to be immoral, he also invites me to die, and to be both immoral and dead, can present dangerous implications for the world hereafter.</p>

<p>Their plan has three phases. The first is supposed to eliminate certain injustices. Amongst others, they want to re-open the universities for the non-Whites, the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians. I want to know from them whether in that case they will still continue to discriminate on the ground of colour as they discriminated in the past, namely that only a limited number of non-White students will be admitted and having been admitted, they will only be allowed to attend lectures and not to participate in any university life. Will they continue with that <span class="col_261-262" refersTo="page_147"/>discrimination on the ground of colour and is that the way in which they will conquer the world?</p>

<p>The second phase is to restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll. It is not clear, however, whether they intend extending it to the northern provinces. I wonder whether the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) could answer me? He lacks the moral courage to say it. They talk about morality but they lack the moral courage to answer that simple question. The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) lacks the moral courage to answer it, and then they are the people who come here and talk about morality! But if they do not want to extend it to the North, what morality is there in a highly educated Coloured man and a highly civilized Coloured in the Transvaal not being allowed to vote, whereas an undeveloped, practically uncivilized, uneducated Coloured in the Cape Province can? Is that the sort of morality with which they want to satisfy the world? Then we come to the Indians. Why, if they restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll, do they not want to restore the Indians as well? Not only is this discrimination on the ground of colour, but it is discrimination on the ground of race as well. But the greatest immorality lies in this that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to force a policy of separate representation on to the Indians, a policy which he himself has condemned as a doomed policy. I just want to read what he said in 1954 about separate representation, when we debated the Coloured question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wondered why he (the Prime Minister) did not refer us to the many constitutional commissions which had gone into and reported on this matter of separate representation. I believe there are at least seven authoritative commissions which have dealt with this matter.</block>

<p>He then gives the various commissions and he quotes from the report of one of those commissions, the Donoughmore Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have come unhesitatingly to the conclusion that communal representation is as it were a canker in the body politic, eating deeper and deeper into the vital energies of the people, breeding self-interests, suspicion and animosity, poisoning the new spirit of the national consciousness and effectively preventing the development of a national or corporate spirit.</block>

<p>In other words, the Leader of the Opposition now wishes to apply a system to the Indians which he himself admits is a canker in the body politic.</p>

<p>I have not got the time to read the whole of it. There is nothing that contradicts this. That, then, is his morality, to apply a policy to those people which he admits is a canker in the body politic.</p>

<p>Then we come to the third phase in their federation plan, and that is that our Constitution should be abandoned. We should now become a federation; there should be a group of separate parliaments and in addition to that there should be a federal parliament. Then they tell us on what basis there is to be representation in that federal parliament. And now we come to that fantastic proposal by the hon. member for Yeoville that representation in that federal parliament should be according to the income tax that each group pays, or according to its national income. Is there anything more immoral than that? Is there anything more medieval than that? They say that the representation of an entire group in this Central Parliament should be in proportion to the income tax which its people pay, the wealth of its people. But when it comes to individuals they discard that very yardstick as being immoral. When the Progressive Party said that income should be a qualification those hon. gentlemen said &#x201C;no,&#x201D; that was immoral because in that case you penalized the man who had no income. Here I have a letter which the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr, Hughes) wrote in the <i>East London Daily Dispatch</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think education alone means civilization.</block>

<p>The standard of civilization of an individual should not be judged according to his wealth but that of a group of people should be tested according to its wealth. I presume that they will give those Bantu areas which have the greatest number of witch-doctors the greatest representation. Are those to be the human rights with which they want to satisfy UNO? Are those the human rights with which they want to satisfy Britain and the Commonwealth, namely that representation in this House will depend on how rich or how poor a group is? What foolishness! Everybody knows that apart from the Whites the Coloureds in South Africa are the most advanced and most civilized group. If gold were to be discovered in the Transkei or in Zululand or anywhere there, those people will immediately get greater representation in the central parliament than the highly civilized Coloured. In other words, if you are poor you will have no representation, but if you are rich you will have representation. I want to ask the hon. member for Yeoville whether that is a moral basis; and is that the moral <span class="col_263-264" refersTo="page_148"/>basis which the hon. member for Jeppe (Dr. Cronje) said he would like to see in our policy? Mr. Speaker, there can be nothing more immoral than that, but the biggest immorality still lies in this. The hon. member for Yeoville says that the Bantu should be represented in the federal parliament in proportion to the income tax that they pay, and the Indians according to their income tax and the Coloureds according to theirs. But the hon. member for Yeoville knows only too well that unless a miracle happens, during the next 100, 200 or 300 years the Whites will pay the highest income tax. He admitted that yesterday. He said in his speech yesterday that they will never catch up with us in the industrial sphere. Is that not simply a flagrant attempt at deceit? Is that not simply an attempt to keep the Whites in control forever and those people subordinate to them? Is that the morality with which they want to satisfy the world; is that the morality they are looking for in us? And then the hon. member for Jeppes said the other day, after his return from America, that America would accept their policy <i>in toto</i> Once their policy is applied, investments will again be made here because then we will have a moral basis for our policy in South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, I wonder which moral basis he explained to them&#x2014;if a tribe has a large number of witch-doctors its representatives may sit here, but if it has a small number of witch-doctors, it may not have representation. [Laughter.] I maintain that their policy is the height of immorality and it is immoral from A to Z. At the same time I maintain that it is not only immoral, but if it were applied, whether they want it or not, it will be deadly for the White man in South Africa. Take in the first place what they tell the Coloureds. They are going to restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll. They will possibly extend it to the north, in spite of the fact that they lack the moral courage to tell us whether or not they are going to do so. They are also going to allow Coloureds to sit in this Parliament. But they made a further announcement, and the hon. member for Germiston (District) must tell me whether it is wrong, namely, that in future Coloureds will be able to become members of their party, to attend their congresses, sit on their committees, on their head committee&#x2014;is that their policy or not? Will the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) answer my question&#x2014;he seems such a courageous person to me.</p>

<p>Did the hon. member say that he was not a courageous person or that was not their policy? If he says that is not their policy, I want to ask him to explain the statement by Mr. A. Z. Berman in the Senate in answer to questions by the Minister of Finance. The Minister of Finance asked him this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are Coloureds free to become members of the party?</block>

<p>To which Mr. Berman replied &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. The Minister of Finance then asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I take it, therefore, that it will be possible for Coloureds to sit on the executive committees of the party.</block>

<block name="quote">*Senator Berman: Yes, if they succeed in getting elected.</block>

<block name="quote">*The Minister of Finance: If they succeed in getting elected they can serve on the committees. The United Party have no objection to that?</block>

<block name="quote">*Senator Berman: No.</block>

<p>He goes on in that vein and says that Coloureds can also attend their congresses. I now want to ask the hon. member for Germiston (District) this: When those Coloureds attend their congress, on an equal basis with them, and a Coloured man asks them at the Congress table: &#x201C;Why has your wife the franchise and my wife not?&#x201D; what moral answer will they give to that Coloured man? Surely they must give it to the eighteen-year old Coloured youths, and if they do they will be handing the Cape Province over to the Coloureds.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to go further with their federation plan. Not only are they going to allow Coloureds to sit in this House; they are also going to allow Indians to sit in this House and the Bantu as well. I take it, therefore, that they will put up candidates for the Bantu constituencies, the Indian constituencies, just as they put up candidates in the Coloured constituencies. Because surely they want to keep those people on their side. When those people sit here on an equal basis they would want them to be those who are most sympathetically inclined. When those people sit here as our equals and mix with us socially, what possible moral argument can he advance to withhold further rights from them? Surely there is no alternative but ultimately to hand the entire government over to them and to sit here as a minority.</p>

The Prime Minister envisages <span class="col_265-266" refersTo="page_149"/>that they will eventually have complete independence. But now I want to ask the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast this: If it will be impossible for us to withstand those demands of Kaiser Matanzima, how will it be possible for him to withstand the demands of Luthuli, of Dadoo, of Dr. van der Ross and of Mandela when they are on an equal footing with us in this House?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Is that your maiden speech? I trust we can expect a better contribution than that from the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson). Unfortunately I cannot extend the customary courtesy to him to-day and congratulate him on his maiden speech. Mr. Speaker, if we cannot withstand the demands of Kaiser Matanzima. I say that it will be equally impossible for them to withstand the demands of Luthuli. of Dadoo, of van der Ross and Mandela. But there will be this difference: Once we have acceded to all Kaiser Matanzima&#x2019;s demands, he will have an independent country, but we shall also still have our independent country. But once they have acceded to all the demands of Luthuli South Africa will be an independent country, but it will belong to Luthuli, and Luthuli will be Prime Minister. That is the vital difference.</p>

<p>After the hon. the Prime Minister had made his speech somebody said to me that it seemed acceptable, but that one thing was certain&#x2014;we were skating on very thin ice. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I admit the position is dangerous and that we are skating on very thin ice with our policy, but if we carry out their policy we shall not be skating on thin ice, but we shall be trying to walk on water and that is not given unto man. It is tragic to think that where we are on the threshold of this great new development in South Africa, we cannot depend on any support from the Opposition. Mr. Speaker, nothing can stop this; nothing can put it into reverse gear. The development of independent Bantu States is unavoidable. The patriotic thing for the Opposition to do would be to help to ensure that it takes place as orderly and as economically and politically sound as possible, but what is the first thing they do? They immediately start inciting the people. They do not say to Kaiser Matanzima that now that has been done we should co-operate. No, the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning tells Matanzima to make as many demands as he can; to ask for as much as he can; to force them as quickly as possible to give him what he wants. Because they do not want orderliness. I want to ask the Opposition this: When will they realize that the preservation of South Africa is more important than the preservation of their poor and miserable party.</p>

<p>This act on the part of the hon. the Prime Minister is an act of faith. It is of far greater importance than the independence of India was to England, because England is far away from India, but we are next to the Transkei. The Prime Minister has not been forced to do this. He did it of his own accord and I maintain to-day that there is not another statesman in the whole world who would have taken such a courageous step of his own accord, except he. As far as I am concerned, that places him amongst the great men of this century. This is the act for which South Africa has been waiting and for which the world has been waiting and for which the Bantu have been waiting, and we are going to develop in that direction, and whether we get assistance of the Opposition or not, we shall ensure that the development of Southern Africa takes place in an orderly manner, that development where the Bantu will get his due, where the Coloured will get his due, where the Indian will get his due and where, as sure as I am standing here, the White man will get his due.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I do not propose to waste much time dealing with the hon. member who has just sat down. I wish to deal with another matter altogether, concerning the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, but I want to say that I concur most wholeheartedly with one of the hon. member&#x2019;s very last statements, that there was not another statesman in the world who of his own free will would make an announcement of policy which the Prime Minister made in this House a few days ago. The emphasis is on &#x201C;free will&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It is only four months ago that the Prime Minister opened the Free State Congress of his party at Bloemfontein and said that it would have been easy for him to deal with what had happened in the past 13 years in this country, but he preferred to deal with the future. He said that it was essential as far as the Bantu were concerned to start off with the tribal system which they knew and then gradually to work on to the Western conception of democratic government; the peoples of Africa could not be transplanted suddenly into a Western form of society. The process must be gradual if it is to be successful and to the best advantage of the people concerned themselves. Sir, it is only a week ago, in the speech by the State President, that the same principle was announced to the members of both Houses. Dealing with the over-rapid development of the various states, the President said that this led to the over-rapid establishment of states enjoying international status, as eventually the Transkei will do. but without sufficient experience and trained leaders in all fields to enable them to fully bear the burdens and responsibilities of statehood. They were not allowed even totally to advance to good government and achieve the cultural well-being of their respective peoples, but were immediately subjected to the blandishments of outside states that sought their alignment in the cold war and for that purpose did not hesitate to inflame their nationalistic ideas. Now, those are two statements that have to be considered in relation to the statement made by the Prime <span class="col_267-268" refersTo="page_150"/>Minister a few days ago. If ever we have had a clear-cut indication of why it was necessary to hold the General Election last October, surely it is the statement of the Prime Minister a few days ago. A few days ago when the Prime Minister made his statement about the establishment of independent Bantu states, he was saying what he knew was in process of examination and discussion four months ago when he announced the general election. The Prime Minister then knew that he was being forced by international pressure to go ahead with his Transkei experiment, but he had to get the election over before he allowed the general public of South Africa to know it, because he was not prepared to face the public once they had that knowledge of the grimness of the experiment he was going to make. He could not afford to take that risk and therefore, although he knew at the time that discussions were in progress&#x2014;he has actually stated so in the form of a letter&#x2014;he withheld that information from the public. In other words, he again bluffed a large section of the public in this country into giving him a blank cheque.</p>

<p>I think sufficient has been said with regard to the establishment of the independent Bantu states from this side of the House to show the dangers of it, and I do not propose to enlarge upon that aspect at the moment. What I want to deal with more particularly is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposals with regard to the establishment of the Coloured separate development scheme and the establishment of the various Coloured autonomous municipal bodies with their self-government. There the Prime Minister again has made his intent very clear, both in the statements made publicly and published in the Press and the various documents issued by the Departments concerned. I want to touch on some of the practical aspects of it, but before doing so I want to make it quite clear that as far as the United Party is concerned our position is absolutely clear and unqualified in regard to our attitude towards the development of the Coloured people. We have stated unequivocally that we regard them as a portion of the Western civilized life of this country, that they are portion of the Whiteman&#x2019;s responsibility and that they are to be allowed and encouraged to develop to the fullest possible extent, both in the development of their own affairs and eventually to have a say in the government of the country by members in this House. That is our policy and we have not deviated from it. The difference between our policy and the policy enunciated so volubly by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) is that this party is a democratic party and our policies are published to the world and the public can discuss them. Their policies are served up to them and they are told: Do this, or else, and they have no time to discuss it. It is a policy decided for them by higher authority and they disobey at their peril. That is the difference. But with regard to the Coloureds, the whole question of the setting up of separate municipalities for the Coloureds has been examined over the past few weeks at the wish of the Prime Minister by a body of people who are not politicians, people whose object in life has been local government, who are experienced in local government and who have no political axe to grind in any way. People who are doing their work for the welfare of the country and are prepared to give reasoned and unbiased reasons for the views they adopt in regard to these proposals. They are keenly alive, also, to the best long-term interests of the Coloureds, who form part of their local government community. They have given the whole matter very careful consideration and I want to touch briefly on some of the points which have emerged as the result of their discussions and as the result of a meeting which has been held in Cape Town during November last by a committee set up by the Government in consultation with the Cape Provincial Municipal Association.</p>

<p>I want to make it quite clear, also, that the reason for the Prime Minister&#x2019;s sudden urge for this Coloured development has been made clear in a letter, viz. that as it will be necessary during this Session of the House again to amend the ill-fated and disastrous Group Areas Act, the opportunity should be taken to include in the amendments the means to enable these Coloured municipalities to be set up. After very serious consideration and examination of all the implications, the principle of separate local authorities for the Coloureds has been discussed and it was made clear that from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement it appeared that the ultimate objective of the Government was to create self-contained and fully autonomous towns and cities for Coloureds, ultimately self-supporting financially and subject only to broad governmental control, in the same way that the Provincial Administration controls the local authorities in the country. The representatives who met to consider this proposal were unanimous in their view that this policy should be pursued very gradually and with the greatest circumspection, as they felt that with the exception of a minority of well-educated professional men who were already engaged in other capacities, there were insufficient experienced and sufficiently educated Coloureds from whose ranks the members of the proposed local authorities could be recruited. They went on to say that the average Coloured person does not possess the background, the experience or the education to be able to direct his mind impartially to the solution of the complexities of modern urban government and that it will need a great deal of patient training and guidance before the Coloureds can take over the reins completely. They went on further to say that at present the Coloureds contribute relatively little to the Municipal coffers by way of rates and that the amenities they enjoy being largely subsidized by the White ratepayers, and they ask the pertinent question, which I also want to ask the Prime Minister <span class="col_269-270" refersTo="page_151"/>to-day, as to how the early stages of these local authorities, once set up, are to be financed, because that in turn raises another very important question. If the Coloured group areas as set up are now to be excised from the existing municipal areas, the burden of the capital cost for all their services, roads, drainage, water, electricity, would have to be transferred to the communities living in those areas. The question then is: How are they going to be financed? The Coloureds certainly cannot finance it themselves, even with the assistance of the board proposed to be set up to bring the financial assistance to them.</p>

<p>There are other factors which arise. In our country, as the House well knows, there is insufficient water to meet urban requirements at the moment. We had a Bill before the House only last session dealing with it. You cannot have in an area two or three bodies dabbling about in regard to water and electricity. All these things have to be co-ordinated, also roads. How on earth does the Prime Minister propose that this co-ordination should be developed and brought under one central controlling body?</p>

<p>When we come to the question of finance, this is a very pertinent point. If the State is to finance the development of these areas, and the Prime Minister talks of an area in the region of 22,000 morgen being set up for the Coloured homelands it is quite obvious that the State&#x2014;and from the correspondence exchanged this is quite obvious&#x2014;intends to take control of these Coloured bodies in the same manner as the Province at present takes control of the local authorities. The special Committee set up by the Government under the Chairman of the Group Areas Board to consider the Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposals wants to make it quite clear that the representatives of the Cape Province Municipal Association are unanimous in urging that control should be vested in the Provincial Administration as in the case of all other local authorities at present. To divest the control of some areas of the Province from the control of the Provincial Administration would be the surest means of destroying the co-ordination and orderly development of the Province as a whole, and would lead to all manner of complications in local government. There is a vital necessity to co-ordinate the planning of roads, water, light and sewerage services, fire-fighting and ambulance services on a regional basis. To divide control amongst the different governmental bodies would only introduce complicating factors and create confusion and frustration. The representatives of the Association make the strongest possible plea that the control of local government for all group areas be left in the hands of the Provincial Administration. One other point is the question of dealing with areas already developed, as compared with areas still to be developed. In the areas already developed large-scale loan programmes have been carried out for capital works and the assets owned by Coloured ratepayers have been pledged together with other local assets for the security of the loans raised. If you are now going to divide those people, you take away a portion of the surety on which some institution has advanced the loan finances and you will cause, if the Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposals are carried out, acute financial chaos and insecurity in dealing with existing loans.</p>

<p>But more than that, the Coloured people would have assisted in the development of of these services in which they share and then they will be removed into their own areas in which they would then have to start afresh to provide their own facilities. No wonder that the Municipal Association, in making its final recommendations on these matters, recommends most strongly and unanimously that there should be no interference in any shape and form with the development of these areas already partly built up and planned. Any scheme of separate development now goes under the grandiloquent title of &#x201C;separate community development&#x201D;. You know, Sir, the scheme started as group areas, until that term fell into disfavour. It then became separate development, and now it is separate community development. I suppose when that title wears out and is no longer worth a vote, we will get some other name for it, but it is the same rose by another name and it smells just as badly as it did before. The whole set-up is brought about by the obsession of the Government with regard to its racial laws. Its fear of the Coloured man, where no fear should exist. Its refusal to accept the Coloured people of the Cape and their compatriots in other parts of the country as citizens of South Africa, men who fought in two world wars, and also in this country, to defend the security of the State. The Government refuses to accept them. The whole policy is to keep them at a level where the Government considers they should be kept. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposal was started off on the basis of bringing fairplay and justice and equality to the Coloured people. There is a way he can show an earnest of that. Since the days when we had trouble with the Natives when they marched to Parliament a few years ago, members opposite eulogised the wonderful services rendered by the Coloureds to South Africa in standing firm against the blandishments of the Bantu, and spoke about the rewards they would get. But what rewards did they get? Words, words, and more words, and that is all they are likely to get. If the Government is really serious in its intention to do justice to the Coloureds, let them give an earnest of it by scrapping job reservation. How can you expect a man who is a citizen of this country and has the right to be here, to be satisfied when his livelihood is taken away from him by an Act, to protect what? Largely to protect people who are not competent to do the jobs without that protection. There is another avenue. Restore the franchise which was <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_152"/>filched from the Coloureds. Give that back to them. Restore their honour in that respect. These are tangible things it can do if the Government is really serious, and not just a lot of words and schemes of this nature, the ultimate result of which is to keep the Coloured man where the Government decides he belongs, the same as the Bantu in the Transkei.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with another matter. I am sorry the Minister of Defence is not present, but I want to touch on a matter which arises from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement about the Transkei, which makes a profound difference to the whole basis of our Defence organization. It has punched a hole in the most vulnerable part of the coastal perimeter defence of South Africa. During the recent state of emergency in Pondoland the Government had to mobilize the South African Navy to patrol that coast. It has been denied, but it is a fact. The ships had to patrol the coast in order to prevent the access of ill-disposed persons to stir up trouble and the landing of arms. They patrolled the coast steadily between Durban and East London for just over four months. If it was necessary to patrol the coast of that section of the Transkei, whilst there was this state of emergency and whilst it is an integral portion of South Africa, how much more vital will that section of the coast become to the security of South Africa when we have an independent Native state in control. A State which can choose its friends outside this country? The whole situation of defence will be changed. The Prime Minister in his statement made it quite clear that ultimately the defence of that area will devolve on the people of the Transkei themselves, and not on South Africa. If that is so, I want to ask the Minister of Defence to tell the country something about the Cabinet&#x2019;s plans to ensure that the defences of our country remain secure under this new set-up; because it will not stop there. The next step will be taken further along the East coast and we are going to open up large new independent areas through which our country will be vulnerable right down from the Portuguese Territories in the east and the Portuguese Territories in the west, right along the East coast. Has the Cabinet considered that aspect, and how do they propose to deal with it, because it is most important to the long-term security of this country? We now have to face a fact about which the U.P. has been warning South Africa about for the last ten years, that our entire defence perimeter along the eastern, the northern and the north-western boundaries of the Republic are being surrendered to the Bantu, who are incapable at the moment and will be for many years to exercise any adequate defence. In other words, the three sides of the Government&#x2019;s laager into which they are retreating to defend South Africa are going down. How do they propose to safeguard the people inside the laager when the perimeter defence is broken? The Minister of Defence went overseas on a mission to discuss various defence matters and to get assistance. He has been back in the country many months, but he has never thought fit to make one comprehensive statement to the country on the results of his mission. If silence in the Minister of Defence means that we have a good Minister, then we have an excellent one because he has told the country nothing. We do get these flamboyant statements about fighting until the blood runs up to the horse&#x2019;s bits, but that means nothing; it is only a theatrical gesture, aimed to the level of the audience he is talking to. We could ask him whose blood and where he will get the horses from, but what we want to know is what he achieved in his mission overseas? What fresh friends has he gained for South Africa? What source of supply of armaments we require has he obtained, and I am not talking about the small arms ammunition we make in the country and which is only good for internal security. I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he realises that it is not only a shooting war he has to safeguard us against now. What steps has the Government taken in view of the general hostility against this country, to deal with our defence in the event of oil sanctions being applied? Does the Minister realize that within 14 days of such an event every aircraft will be grounded and every tank and vehicle will come to a standstill, unless he makes other arrangements? It is not only the shooting war which counts; we can be brought to our knees without a shot being fired, and the Government is responsible for our defence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>This is a motion of censure on the Government and deals largely with its race policies. As a direct result of the Transkeian policy now announced by the Government the dangers which we foresaw previously have been tremendously increased, and I am merely trying to emphasize that fact.</p>

<p>There is another aspect. Two years ago the Government and the then Minister of Defence made it quite clear that the whole of the defence of South Africa depend on us obtaining possession of the Protectorates. We could not develop satisfactory defence measures without that. The result of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement announced three days ago has made it impossible for us ever to obtain those Protectorates, and therefore the whole defence position of the Republic in the Government&#x2019;s own words has been rendered untenable. How does the Government propose to meet that problem? These are questions that the people of this country who are affected, have a right to know the answers. It is not merely a question of giving a vote and independence to the Bantu; it is all the things that flow from it. I want to finish on this note. As a South African whose family is growing up in this country.</p>

<p><span class="col_273-274" refersTo="page_153"/>Sir, as an English-speaking person one can understand and admire the fight which the Afrikaans-speaking people of this country have put up for the ideals in which they believe. They have achieved a lot; they have gone a long way. They have attained their ideal of establishing a Republic. I honestly believe, after thinking seriously of the whole situation that has now developed as a result of the actions of this Government over the past couple of years culminating in this Transkei independence speech, that the hon. the Prime Minister when he made that announcement started to dig the grave of the Afrikaans-speaking people in this country, and not only for the Afrikaans-speaking people, but for all of us. The day will come, not in the too far distant future, when the men who sit in this House cheering the Prime Minister&#x2019;s remarks and jeering at our criticism will live to regret everything that they have ever said, and that they will begin to realize that they are the people who betrayed the best interests of the country and who started us down the road of no return which can only end in disaster for the Black, Brown and White people of this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down made two remarks to which I wish to refer briefly. The last one was that he confirms that his fate is connected with members on this side of the House. May that attitude sink in a little deeper with hon. members opposite and have more effect, because if they accept the close ties of fate of our whole South African nation whether English-speaking South Africans or Afrikaans-speaking South Africans, they will not try to build up this contrast of language as a basis on which a distinction must be drawn in our approach to the future. The second matter I wish to mention with reference to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech is this: he reproached the Prime Minister because the Prime Minister did not announce the plan to place the Transkei on the way to constitutional freedom before the election. Did not the hon. members know three years ago already in 1959 precisely and clearly that the fulfilment of what is now happening was the official policy of this party and Government, and did we not fight elections on this? But in addition, do the hon. members wish to pretend that one could go to the White voters with any responsibility towards South Africa and say: Vote whether the Xhosa nation may become a free nation or not. If you lost that election, in what an untenable position towards the Xhosas would the present Government not be placed, if the question were put on public platforms as a specific point? What irresponsibility wouldn&#x2019;t it then be to treat the matter in such a way, if it offered the so much desired opportunity to that party to come into power? It would have made their position untenable; it would have made South Africa&#x2019;s position impossible.</p>

<p>I do not pause any further to deal with the hon. member and in the first instance I do not wish to refer to the motion. I wish to comment on certain aspects of the hon. Prime Minister&#x2019;s announcement. It is now the third time in succession that this debate has become the occasion, not for the consideration of the trivial complaints of the Leader of the Opposition, but for the consideration of the important announcement of the Prime Minister. What has been done here is in a sense what happened when we as a nation migrated in the Great Trek. It is an unavoidable step. The existing position could not be endured. The general course is clear to us; the ultimate goal is manifest, but we realize that for the most part an unknown and difficult road lies ahead and for me this is the first meaning of this announcement. It is a challenge to the whole nation of this country to accept this Trek in the spirit of a joint action and not to try to ruin it in certain respects through weak-kneed action and righteous fear, because we are on that road. The second point I wish to make is that a radical step has now been taken, perhaps the most radical step in the constitutional history of this country. I welcome it for I believe that South Africa, in order to exist as a White homeland, will have to take many radical steps and perhaps make many radical adjustments. For years the Opposition and the Government were fond of sitting in the parlour talking about radical dreams and we have become used to having radical dreams and to live prosaically and it is an important breakthrough for South Africa to be brought to this position where we see that we must live radically, and I hope that it will grip the whole nation so that we shall be prepared to finalize and accept the radical solutions. I also wish to state that the essential nature of our policy of development is now laid bare to the Opposition, who did not wish to believe it, and to the whole world; in the first instance our belief in the right of self-determination of other nations, the right of self-determination of the Xhosa nation and after them, of other Bantu races, but also the right of self-determination of our White republican nation in this land. In the second instance it is now the fulfilment of our acknowledgement of human dignity, where it does not imply the possible destruction of other human dignities. If we, as the hon. Prime Minister has shown, should try to acknowledge the human dignity of the Bantu by allowing him to share the political power in our country together with us, as the Opposition wish to do, then it will eventually lead to the destruction of our human dignity, but this step shows that the human dignity of every individual in this country is respected; and finally this step has uncovered the intrinsic nature of our policy, in so far that it results in division of territory, not necessarily an immediate division of races so that there will be an immediate sorting out of Black and White, but that a fundamental division of territory will follow which is the prerequisite to a division of races which must <span class="col_275-276" refersTo="page_154"/>take place according to the economic possibilities. And this is a territorial division which will not only define the Bantu territory but it is a territorial division which has been commenced to determine also our White homeland. Mr. Speaker, it is enormous progress which we have made, that we are coming to the final determination also of what our White homeland is and will remain to be.</p>

<p>Then, finally, I wish to make this remark on the nature of this step, that it is a unique Christian step in ending the guardianship over a dependent race. This step can be criticized, as much as the Opposition and the enemies of our country wish to do; there may be attempts to ridicule it but nobody can deny that in the history of the world there is no parallel for the liberation of a dependent race as has happened here, because this Government has faithfully endeavoured to preserve the own language and culture of the dependent race until the trusteeship is ended. We did not try to take it from them. We tried to preserve the remains of their own system of government so that they may establish their new freedom by their own choice according to the nature of their own system of government. Our announcement is coupled with a guarantee of unconditional economic protection regarding their public expenditure and the handling of the responsibilities of Government in their years of becoming established, and I say without fear of contradiction that nowhere in the world has a guardianship over a dependent nation been ended in such a Christian, moral and decent manner, and this has happened solely because our actions have been motivated by the belief in the right of existence of each individual nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, how should this step be received? How ought it in the first instance to be received by our enemies, the African states? I say that the African states can, as a result of this step, only acknowledge South Africa as a friend or they could acknowledge that they are irrational haters of White people, that their policy is born out of hatred of the White man, whether there is reason for it or not. And as regards the great powers, those who have so far supported the African states, they are to-day placed in the position that they must admit of the highest morality of this step, or they must admit that in the international sphere they will continue to act as lackeys of those states who are inspired by racialism. My faith in international affairs is such that I believe that the responsible world powers, the leaders of the world, must be impressed by the spiritual content of this step and the material possibilities which it offers. And in South Africa, what should the reaction be; what should the reaction be of the leaders of our opponents among the Bantu? Isn&#x2019;t it that new peace prophet, Luthuli himself, who only recently stated in Norway at the occasion of the homage paid to him: &#x201C;Our people everywhere from north to south of the Continent are reclaiming their land, their right to participate in government, their dignity as men, their nationhood&#x201D;. Isn&#x2019;t this what the Transkei has received&#x2014;&#x201C;their land, their right to participate in government, their dignity as men, their nationhood&#x201D;? If there had been any honesty in these prophets, then they should have been the people who should now get up and confess &#x201C;we were wrong in our judgment&#x201D;, but instead of this we get, just as I expected, a declaration of rejection which is nothing else but a declaration of acknowledgment that the so-called anti-White leaders do not ask for their land and their liberty but that they ask for our land and our submission.</p>

<p>What had to be the reaction of the Progressives? Their reaction was what I expected of them. They are the people who emphatically reject the idea of a White nationhood. They have a national philosophy which is supposed to be holistic, which includes everybody, but which is actually atomistic in essence because it is the grouping together of all in South Africa who have no common national bonds. They reject the idea of a separate White nation, and for that reason this development must be acceptable to them, and for that reason I welcome the rather too modest criticism of this step by the Progressive Party because it is entirely in conflict with their views. Then I come to the other little party. They unluckily did not get an opportunity to speak, but I wish to speak on their behalf. I refer to the party of one and ten, the lightbearer of Bezuidenhout, the fire-fly of Bezuidenhout Valley. The policy in connection with the Bantu homelands was desribed by the National Union as follows: They believe that &#x201C;the large-scale and rapid economic development of the Bantu areas is essential in the interests of all racial groups&#x201D;. And then they proceed: &#x201C;In the present circumstances no definite statement can be made on what the eventual constitutional relationship between the Bantu areas and the rest of the Union will be but that, as these areas develop, the most suitable constitutional link will have to be considered carefully with a view to furthering common interests&#x201D;. Therefore that little party is also undoubtedly totally satisfied because their programme of policy has been fully realized.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, we come to the United Party. What should their reaction be? Their reaction ought to be, as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has conceded to some extent, that they welcome the development of the Bantu homelands. They say they also want these Bantu homelands to develop. They even want the same rights to devolve on the Bantu homelands as is the case now. In his article of 3 December in the <i>Sunday Times</i> he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There will be a devolution of the functions of government so that each race will assume control in constituent Government agencies of those matters intimately affecting <span class="col_277-278" refersTo="page_155"/>itself, while matters of common interest like defence, postal services, foreign affairs, interracial relations, international trade, will remain in the hands of the Central Government.</block>

<p>This is the position meanwhile and one would expect them at least to welcome the development on this basis, but no, the hon. member for Yeoville says this is a dangerous development because South Africa is being split up. Under their racial federation system the devolution of powers would take place within one South Africa. I now wish to ask them the simple question: If their racial federation system were now to be implemented and all local powers&#x2014;agriculture, education, roads and those things which are now under discussion&#x2014;were given to the Transkei territory and that Transkei territory came into conflict with the federal government which for the moment is perhaps still mainly White and that federal government appealed to the other powers of Africa and the powers which are represented in UNO to assist it to become independent, how would the hon. member for Yeoville withstand the pressure which he himself creates in this manner by means of his federal scheme? Their criticism indeed has no foundation. The United Party&#x2019;s reaction and criticism on this important announcement must be tested by the principle as to whether it suits an Opposition in their position to express such criticism. The United Party must remember that they and not we stand before the tribunal as to whether people have faith in them; whether there is faith in them as an Opposition. They are only the usufructuaries of the right to oppose. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) says she represents the heirs of the real Opposition, and the United Party must be careful how they exercise that right of opposition.</p>

<p>Then we come to the crucial question in connection with the acceptance or rejection of the step which the Prime Minister has announced, and that is: Do we believe in a separate White nation in South Africa or don&#x2019;t we? What is our conception of the state and of the nation? Is our national philosophy that the geographical and ethnological unity of South Africa should be preserved at all costs, or is our national philosophy that the state must exist for the benefit of the nation? And if we say that the state must exist for the benefit of the nation, then we ask: Who is the nation for whom the state must exist? To this question the National Party can give a clear answer immediately. The National Party says this state must be in the first instance for the English- and Afrikaans-speaking White Afrikanerdom of this country, and the state must exist for the related Western groups in this country, and the state must also provide, by means of separate states, for the Bantu races of this country. But this national philosophy and therefore this conception of the state is evidently not the idea of the United Party, and it is time they chose sides very decisively on this matter. An attempt is nowadays being made in South Africa to make contrast between the Afrikanerdom and South Africans who embrace different views. I refer e.g. to an expression of this view in the <i>Star</i> of 15 December in their commentary on the remarks of the Minister of External Affairs in connection with Luthuli&#x2019;s speech, and they refer to the clash between Mr. Louw and Luthuli and they have this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is as unfortunate as it is inevitable that Mr. Luthuli&#x2019;s visit to Scandinavia should have ended as it began with a flurry of recrimination between him and the Government.</block>

<p>They then refer to Mr. Louw and say what Mr. Louw&#x2019;s view is and what Mr. Luthuli&#x2019;s view is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; inevitable because Mr. Luthuli, whether at home or abroad speaks for Congress South Africa just as Mr. Louw speaks for Afrikaner Nationalists in South Africa.</block>

<p>They then proceed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The two nationalistic factions that these two men represent are rivals. The one is a good deal more broadly based than the other. They must be expected to quarrel. Neither has yet learnt to speak for the authentic South Africa, the South Africa in which men of all races have worked together for a long time and want nothing more than to go on doing so, the South Africa whose tolerance and co-operation are the foundation of our strength and the mainspring of our security.</block>

<p>Sir, I quoted from a leading article in the <i>Star.</i> I only put it that it was the kind of utterance that the United Party frequently makes, and I only put it to them that the United Party must express themselves clearly on this matter. The point that I now want to make also will help the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) out of his difficulty, and that is that this view is <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_156"/>basically the view of the Progressive Party. There are two possible views&#x2014;either the Progressive Party&#x2019;s view that South African citizenship is a total conglomerate of people within our boundaries or the view that we have a separate White nation and a number of other nations. The United Party must carefully choose sides between these views, because if it condemns this step which has now been taken, if it persists with its federal plan, then the United Party bases itself on a national philosophy similar to that of the Progressive Party, viz. including all in South Africa, and not that the White population as such forms a unity with specific interests which in the first instance pledges us to protect and cherish. If the United Party desires to compete with the Progressive Party in the degeneration of their views, then I think that they will lose that struggle also because the Progressives at the moment show a promise of being more perverted.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is the road which those members have heard of but have never walked on.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I conclude by finally drawing attention to the fact that South Africa has today come to a cross-roads which calls on the Opposition as on the whole of the nation. The question is whether we will go forward as a nation which united, wishes to enter upon this important new phase to acknowledge that on the one hand we have a White nation in its own territory and on the other hand certain non-White races in their own territories who need us as their guardians.</p>

<p>With regard to the non-White nations&#x2014;and with this I wish to conclude my remarks&#x2014;much help is required. Assistance must be given out of the structure of the whole nation&#x2014;administratively, economically, in many respects morally. Reference has been made to the economic development of those territories where private initiative under organized conditions will also have an opportunity. Reference has been made to the Transkei receiving its own Development Corporation where the best brains of South Africa will be called upon to contribute, and also to play their role. An indication has been given that public funds will be made available to the Transkei in a royal manner so that they will receive what is being spent there at present plus the direct taxation plus a subsidy of approximately R1,000,000. Those things must be granted by the nation as a whole without criticism. Now the point arises: What is going to be the part played by the Opposition in this great task of development which lies ahead of us? Are they as Party and as individuals and as an important opinion-forming body in South Africa going to try to promote this scheme of creation in the Transkei or do they, as in this debate, intend trying by means of little misrepresentations, with criticism on every little point, by engendering fear, to retard this plan as much as possible? The responsibility is on the shoulders of the Opposition itself. I believe, however, that the Prime Minister enjoys the full support of his Party, and also that of the nation, and that his actions will be blameless in the eyes of the world, and for that reason we can proceed with devotion and in faith and we as a nation can be sure that if the Opposition does not give us its support, it will lead to its own destruction and not to the detriment of this Government.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I know that the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow the speech he has just made point by point, because I think that when one reviews this debate and the discussion which has taken place and the revelations which flow from it&#x2014;and I deliberately say &#x201C;revelations&#x201D; in the plural because there was not only one revelation in this debate; there were two or three revelations which in my opinion are as important as the main revelation upon which the light of publicity and world opinion are concentrated&#x2014;I say that when this debate and the revelations which flow from it, are reviewed, then there are three possible ways in which this discussion can be summarized, and I believe that not one of those three ways will violate the rules of this House. The first way to summarize it is to ask ourselves this: How much did we know about Government policy when this debate began; how much more do we know now; how much more do we require to know in order to be able to judge that policy in the present difficult circumstances in South Africa. The second possibility is that we examine the fundamental question underlying all these discussions, that is, whether the policy of separate development as it is now being carried out by the Government and as it wishes to carry it out in future, has a moral basis and to examine it in the light of the facts placed at our disposal in the course of this debate. A further possibility is to ask ourselves what exactly have we found out in the course of this debate about the financial, economic and international repercussions of the plans proposed by the Government. Because of the importance of the debate, it may be advisable to deal with all three ways and to examine all three of these questions and in doing this, we ask ourselves: How much did we know about the extent of the proposed application of the Government&#x2019;s policy when this debate began?</p>

<p>When we pose this question, I think we can say that we knew that it was the intention of the Government in the interests of separation to develop the reserves in order to provide homelands for the maximum number of Natives. Secondly, I think we knew that such development would be an expensive process and we had the suspicion that because of the <span class="col_281-282" refersTo="page_157"/>ultimate aim of the Government, this development would cost more than it would have cost under other circumstances.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I think we believed that it was the intention of the Government to consolidate the present reserves in seven or eight large blocks, to fix the boundaries and to allow them to develop politically until they reach the stage when full independence can be granted to them after they have shown that they have the ability to do so.</p>

<p>Fourthly, we knew that the Government had fallen behind has as regards the economic development and the building up of the carrying capacity of the reserves, but that the Government had never abandoned its ultimate aim. the ultimate aim held out by them in the White Paper on the Tomlinson report, that after 50 years there would be an equal number of Whites and non-Whites in the White areas. This they have never abandoned.</p>

<p>Fifthly, I think that we knew that the Government had refused to use White capital, White initiative and skills for the development of the reserves themselves, but that they were going to concentrate on the establishment of border industries which would obtain their labour from the reserves and which would result in the spending of the earnings of such labour in the reserves.</p>

<p>How much more do we know now after four days of discussion? The borders of not a single one of the future Bantustans have been clearly defined, not of one. According to the Prime Minister this will be discussed in the future with the Bantu Government of the area concerned. No scheme for the consolidation of separate black spots or the exchange of land has been laid before us. This will also be discussed in the course of time with the Bantu Government. Up to now nothing has been fixed. The insecurity amongst the farmers on the borders in the neighbourhood of the existing reserves continues. Their future to-day is just as uncertain as it was before. And yet we have heard from hon. members on the other side about the vagueness of the Opposition&#x2019;s policy. Can one of them tell us to-day what this state within a state is which they have in mind for the Coloureds? Can one of them tell us what the policy will be as far as the Indians are concerned? They accuse us of vagueness. But they are the Government of the day. Can they tell us what their policy is for South West Africa? This has been mentioned in the debate, but we have not heard a single word from the other side except an interjection from the Prime Minister. These are the people who talk about vagueness! If I sat on the Government side, I would be ashamed to use the word &#x201C;vagueness&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It is true that the Prime Minister has given us a speech full of revelations. The chief revelation was that the Bantu authority in the Transkei&#x2014;only in the Transkei&#x2014;will be allowed to draw up a constitution for consideration under which they will obtain a certain measure of self-government and a responsible council or Parliament which may possibly be served by a Cabinet. It is clear that the prospect of eventual freedom and sovereignty is being held out to them. This step is clearly being taken under pressure of world opinion and possibly as a result of the economic effects of such pressure being exerted by the urban Bantu in South Africa, quite apart from the reserves. I think that as a result of this, it has become clear what the Prime Minister&#x2019;s intentions are and I think that it has come sooner than this hon. gentleman himself would have liked and before there has been all the training which is necessary in the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>But have we really heard anything new? We have in the past uttered warnings from this side of the House. We warned that something like this would happen. During the election we warned that this was the policy of the Government and we said that we believed that they would do everything in their power in the next five years to go so far along this road that this step would be irrevocable and there would be no possibility of turning back. But the trouble was that I was not believed when I said it. The supporters of the Nationalist Party did not believe it. At public meetings, especially, it was denied that was the Government&#x2019;s policy and it was not long ago that even Cabinet Ministers published contradictory statements in connection with it.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It is no wonder that the hon. the Minister of Finance thought it necessary to say that the Cabinet unanimously supported the Prime Minister&#x2019;s plan, even the hon. the Minister for Agricultural Technical Services and the hon. the Minister of the Interior who are not here now, but who made wonderful statements in the past. No wonder they had to say that the caucus was unanimously behind the Prime Minister. This now becomes a reality that will have to be considered in the near future. I deliberately say &#x201C;near future&#x201D; because experience throughout the Continent of Africa shows that when the prospect of freedom is held out, it is not the controlling power which decides when freedom will eventually be granted, but the political organization which is seeking freedom. The hon. the Prime Minister has already experienced this. He had only just made his statement regarding the Transkei, when a statement was made by one of the chiefs of the Zulu nation, Cyprian Dinizulu, who was appointed by the Government, asking the same thing for them. And Matanzima, chief of the Transkei, is already asking that Justice and Labour be entrusted to them. It was mentioned this afternoon that they also now demand control over the recruiting of Native labour in their own areas for the mines and other White industries. You see, control <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_158"/>over the tempo of liberation passes into the hands of the colonial unit, either as the result of internal troubles or as the result of external pressure, usually a combination of both, and sometimes the United Nations also play a role in this regard. It is not even necessary to quote examples. It is well known and the hon. the Prime Minister himself has referred to it in the past.</p>

<p>There was a second revelation which in my opinion was almost just as important, a revelation made tacitly and one which the press has not mentioned and to which attention has not been drawn, and that is that it has now become quite clear from this debate that the Government has abandoned the proposed time-table laid down in the White Paper under which there was to be an equal number of Whites and non-Whites in the White areas by the end of the century. This was abandoned, for two reasons. Firstly, they had fallen so behind in the first seven years, and only now realize what it means; but secondly, and this is more important, because of the fact that the tempo of development in the reserves and accordingly their carrying capacity and their attraction to labour living in the White areas, will, once self-government has been granted, no longer be controlled by this Government but by the Bantu Government concerned. Our Government will lose control over it. This will now be controlled by the Bantu Government to which self-government has been granted, even although it has not achieved independence and freedom. That is particularly the position since the Government is prepared to grant control over agriculture to the relevant Bantu Government or authority. They know well enough that, according to the Tomlinson report, if these areas are to be properly developed so that their carrying capacity and the standard of living of the population can rise, so that these areas will be able to carry, not only its own increase in population, but also the increase from the White areas, there will have to be a revolution in the agriculture of those areas. The Tomlinson Commission proposed that at least 2,000,000 Natives presently making a living out of farming would have to find some other means of livelihood. Work will have to be provided for them. Those steps will have to be taken, that revolution will have to be controlled by a Bantu Government, and in the Transkei, I think, it will involve about 600,000 people and all this will depend upon the yea or nay of a Transkeian Parliament.</p>

<p>In speaking to my motion, I made it clear that in my opinion the development of the reserves was much more complicated and was a much greater task than the attempt to alleviate poverty in other parts of the world where these complicated problems do not exist. I pointed out that it was a greater task because the reserves must be developed, according to government policy, not only to provide homelands and a means of livelihood for the natural increase of the Natives in the reserves, but also for the natural increase of the Natives who are at the moment in the so-called White areas. Unless they do so they will be departing from their policy and then they no longer stand for separate development. In other words, they contemplate two revolutions, a revolution in agriculture, in providing opportunities for employment in the reserves themselves, the establishment of border industries to provide work for at least 300,000 workers, and also a revolution in the lives of the Whites in their own areas because of the effect it will have on the supply of labour in the White areas. I pointed out that if the natural increase amounted to 250,000 in the whole of the Republic, 150,000 of these would be Natives, and if opportunities for employment must be created for them, then it would require a capital investment equal to what would be required to provide work for the same number of Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>And if you are in power, how are you going to provide employment?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that. I pointed out that at least half of our capital formation of &#x00A3;500,000,000 would have to be applied to be reserves. I pointed to other figures, such as those in connection with the Venoni plan in Italy, where it appeared that the provision of employment cost almost R3,000 per person there, and that is the position in a country where it was possible for the people to seek work in other parts of the country and to go and live there, something which will not be possible in the reserves if the Government stands by its policy of separate development. What was the answer from the other side of the House? Apart from the fact that the hon. the Minister of Finance mentioned possible loans from overseas, we did not hear a single word as to how the creation of new opportunities for employment is to be financed. We did hear of the establishment of a Transkeian Development Corporation, of certain monies which will be transferred to the Bantu Government, of a possible annual contribution of about R2,000,000 by our Government. But nowhere have the amounts been stated which will be necessary if separate development is to become a reality. I must frankly say that I gained the impression that the Government does not intend to provide the finance necessary for development to this extent, that they have not only abandoned the original time-table, but that the Government is abandoning the implementation of the policy of separate development in the economic sphere. They have found the task too great so they have abandoned it, and now they are trying to shift the responsibility on to the future Bantu Governments. The Government does stand for development, but it no longer looks like separate development to me. How are they going to ensure that a Government which has accepted separate development <span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_159"/>as its policy, the ratio of non-White to White in our urban areas does not increase, something which is possible, until the stage is reached where it is seven or eight to one?</p>

<p>There was a third revelation and that was that the Government has at last realized that it will not be possible to develop the reserves, even on a comparatively small scale, without using private White capital and initiative and skills. It is true that it will only be allowed under many restrictions, but it will be allowed.</p>

<p>What the people will find particularly interesting is that on this road which the hon. the Prime Minister will now probably follow, if I am right, the Government and the Opposition will be much nearer to one another as far as relations with the Natives in the reserves are concerned. The Government&#x2019;s policy is one of decentralization of powers; that is also our policy for those areas. But what happens after that may enable us to act as a united nation or may lead to a permanent parting of the ways for us. If this decentralization of powers contemplates a form of federation between those areas and the Republic, then we clearly stand together on that point. But if the hon. the Prime Minister intends this to be a beacon on the road to sovereign independence for the Natives and to the final carving up of South Africa, then his attitude and ours cannot be reconciled. It depends on the hon. the Prime Minister whether we are once again going to throw away a golden opportunity for White unity. I wish to warn him that by his method he is creating dangers for us all which we shall probably not outlive, dangers for the Whites and for the non-Whites. For the Whites, and together with us the Coloureds and Indians, full independence for the reserves will mean a struggle between the Republic and the new states as to what happens to the urban Natives, which could be catastrophic for the standard of living and safety of all in the Republic. The Native in the Republic, and he will be indispensable to us, will have to exercise his political rights in an area where he has no real interests. Unless he can find means of ventilating possible grievances and frustration in the area where he lives, he will degenerate into an agitator and a potential revolutionary, and he will exercise his political power in the Native area in such a way as to advance his interests herein the Republic. One can imagine what kind of government he would wish to have in those areas. He would naturally want a government which would seek to make his task here easier and which would plead for him before the world and the United Nations.</p>

What is to prevent him from voting for a Parliament in that Native area, a Parliament which would join the Afro-Asian bloc? What are our defence problems going to be? Have these hon. gentlemen forgotten that the origin of a large number of our rivers is in the Native areas? The hon. gentlemen wants to grant sovereign independence to these areas. We know how the communists of the world are on the lookout to exploit the grievances of subject peoples in order to advance Communism. What happens to the Bantu outside the Bantu areas would give them the opportunity to create unrest and hate in South Africa and they would certainly not let that opportunity slip.</p>

<p>Election stories.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately there were too many of the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s supporters in the election who did not want to admit that this was Government policy. They could not believe it. When one addressed them at meetings, they said, &#x201C;It is not true; it is not the policy of our Government; we cannot believe that a National Government would do such a thing to South Africa, our fatherland&#x201D;. There are dangers not only for the Whites but also for the Natives. The Native in South Africa has made remarkable progress because he has worked with the Whites and he may now lose this opportunity, and if one looks at precedents in Africa, it is possible that his hope of individual freedom and dignity may disappear after flickering for a brief spell. The real interests of the Natives and the Whites in the Republic can only be separated with difficulty, in the economic sphere as well. Territorial separation between all Whites and all Natives is an ideal which was born 200 years too late.</p>

<p>I have dwelt for some time on what we have heard in this debate that is new. Now we must ask ourselves what we should still like to know before we judge the Government&#x2019;s policy for the future, and when one poses this question one thinks of the application of Government policy in areas which are not yet consolidated and which are not as homogeneous as the Transkei. One asks how it will be applied in Zululand where Shepstone&#x2019;s corridor policy was introduced and where there are White corridors between the various Black areas; one asks how it will be applied in the Transvaal where the Republican authorities laid down that no tribe may occupy more than 3,000 morgen. We have heard that there will be discussions with the Bantu Governments concerned, but before there can be a Bantu Government, the various unconnected areas will have to be consolidated to some extent. The question also arises in this respect as to what the future of the urban Native is and also what the plans are for the financing of the reserves. The hon. the <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_160"/>Prime Minister criticized the British Prime Minister himself because he regarded the White populations of certain parts of Central Africa as expendable.</p>

<p>Now I want to put this question to our Prime Minister: What is to become of the White population of the Transkei? They have always regarded themselves as part of their own fatherland, as people who went there to assist in the development of that territory, people who are not citizens of an overseas country but citizens of South Africa who helped to develop a part of that territory? What is going to happen to them? Will they be compensated? Will there be adequate compensation?</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister does not know. The hon. the Prime Minister has warned us on more than one occasion against the dangers of liberation and the granting of independence to states which have not yet developed to the stage at which independence can be granted to them. Is he sure that he is not possibly making the same mistake in this instance? I think that before we can be satisfied with the information given to us in this debate we shall have to hear much more about the future policy and future plans of this Government.</p>

<p>My hon. friend asks whether I shall be satisfied when I have heard it. I have been trying for three days to get a reply and it has not yet been given. Some of the questions are questions which I have been asking for years, and they still owe us a reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we now come to the second question to be discussed, and that is the moral basis for the policy of apartheid. It has become apparent in this debate that there is a moral basis for the policy of apartheid. Let us examine the philosophical approach for a moment. We were told in the State President&#x2019;s speech, and we heard it on several occasions from the hon. the Prime Minister and from the spokesmen of the Nationalist Party, that there were only two possible roads in South Africa: total apartheid and total equality. They have not taken into account the fact that Mr. Justice Fagan and his commission felt that there was a middle road. For them there are only two roads&#x2014;total apartheid and total equality. Mr. Speaker, do they apply total apartheid in the case of the Coloureds, and if that is not total apartheid, is it total equality? Do they apply total apartheid in the case of the Indians? And if there are only two roads, are we to understand that they are applying total equality in the case of the Indians? Mr. Speaker, we must be honest with each other. Year after year they led the public to believe that there were only two roads in South Africa&#x2014;total apartheid and total equality; it was either the one or the other. What is it in the case of the Coloureds? The Minister has said that it is not total apartheid.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not prepared to answer. Do they refuse to admit that there is possibly a third road, a middle road, something between total equality and total apartheid? The hon. the Minister of Finance adopted the attitude, in pursuance of the speech by the President who spoke of national reconstruction on the one hand and of willingness to serve on the other, that it was impossible to withhold the franchise from the Native. What about the Indians? Tell us. What about the Coloureds? Mr. Speaker, the motion poses this question: How is justice going to be done to the Indians and the Coloureds under the Government&#x2019;s dispensation? What is the answer? If they are satisfied that they are being just to the Coloureds by keeping them on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll in the Cape Province, and in giving no representation to the Indians, why is it then they are not prepared to accept that there may possibly be a third road so far as the Native is concerned? Talk about justice, talk about the moral basis for the policy of apartheid&#x2014;how do they justify the position of the urban Natives? We are told that his position must be compared with that of the Basutos and of the Italians who go and work in Switzerland. But do they not realize that there is a difference? Do they not realize that it is this Government which told these people that they were South African citizens in terms of the Citizenship Act? And they are now going to take away that citizenship from them and give them another, a foreign citizenship, without giving them any option. No choice is to be given to them. They are going to say to them: &#x201C;You are now aliens in this part of South Africa.&#x201D;</p>

How much dissatisfaction, how much frustration is this going to cause? I think I am justified, inasmuch as this motion asks &#x201C;where and how justice is going to be done to the Coloured and the Indians? In saying that I have received no reply to that question.

<p>My hon. friend wants to put it to the vote, but unfortunately he does not always use his brains when he votes. He knows that there is no moral basis, but yet he is going to vote in favour of it for he is committed to that party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, then there are the financial and economic and international repercussions of the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy. There have been minor changes in that policy; that fact has been disclosed in this debate, but these changes are not of great significance. What will the economic and financial repercussions be? We discussed them in this debate. Several speakers have pointed out that if this policy is carried out by the Government, it will mean impoverishment in South Africa, a South Africa that will develop more slowly, a South Africa in which as it is the standard of living is rising almost more slowly than in the case of any other Western country. Are they still going to continue with this policy? These are the financial repercussions and not a single word of contradiction has come from the other side of the House. Not a single hon. member opposite has had the courage to rise and say that under this policy South Africa is going to prosper and flourish like no other country in the world. But what are the international repercussions going to be? When we speak of international repercussions, I must point out that if the hon. the Prime Minister had taken this step in the name of the development of the reserves, if it had gone hand in hand with a comprehensive scheme for the development of that area, in the way we would all like to see it developed, he would not only have been given the support of this side of the House, but he would also have made an exceptionally favourable impression overseas. But I fear that step has now been taken for the sake of apartheid and I also fear that the world will see it as a further step towards implementing a policy which it cannot tolerate. But when one talks about international repercussions, other possibilities must also be taken into consideration. We know that the communistic world will accept Communism only and will not be content with any other policy. We know that the extremist countries in the Afro-Asiatic bloc demand &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, what does the Western world, our old friends who in the past stood by us and who were our allies desire? The Prime Minister tries to create the impression that everything is being dictated to them by the Afro-Asiatic bloc.</p>

<p>My hon friend says that is so. If that is the case, then he can take it for granted that the Afro-Asiatic bloc will also instruct them not to support or approve of this step. Why then did the Prime Minister take it if he hoped that it would have an effect overseas?</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman knows as well as I do that the attitude of the Western world is not dictated by the Afro-Asiatic bloc. I feel that the Western world will be satisfied with something else, something else which might be safer for South Africa&#x2014;a policy which indicates another direction.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that this policy should be based on four main principles. I think that the first of these principles is that we, as a Christian nation, should be prepared to share the advantages of our civilization with those non-Whites who have proved that they have the capability to assume joint responsibility with us for the future of South Africa. That does not mean that we are prepared to hand over to an uncivilized proletariat and majority. We still believe in White leadership in the sense that White political influence should be retained here, and we believe <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_162"/>that the White race here should be strengthened by a dynamic immigration policy which this Government lacks the courage to put into effect. We have also found that it is impossible to rule people without consulting them. We believe that consultation, those deliberations, should take place at all levels, even in the highest council of this country, this Parliament. We also realize that you cannot live as friends with other people unless you respect their dignity as individuals. For that reason we have decided that what we are going to propose is a policy to be carried out in three stages. The first will be the amendment and repeal of those laws put on the Statute Book by the Government and which cause so much injustice to so many people. The second stage will be steps along the road of planned advancement. The first of these steps will be the admission that the Coloureds have advanced so far that to-day they constitute part and parcel of the Western group. That fact should therefore be recognized gradually and steps should be taken to grant rights to them. The first step to be taken is that the Coloured men who have been deprived of their political rights in the Cape and Natal will be restored to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. The second is that job reservation must not be applied to them.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member should not make such shocking interjections. The third step is that the Coloureds in the Transvaal and the Free State must also be granted representation. Our proposal is that to begin with they should be represented in the Senate, on a separate roll. Fourthly, Mr. Speaker, the Coloured should be able to sit in this House of Assembly if he is elected to the House of Assembly.</p>

<p>No, not Coloured women at this stage. In so far as the Indians are concerned, we admit, just as the Government does, that they have become a permanent part of the population. Therefore the first step as far as they are concerned is that the Group Areas Act must not be applied in such a way that it will deprive them of their customary way of living and his means of livelihood. When the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs spoke, he asked what criticism there was of the Group Areas Act. Does the hon. gentleman not know that it has been attacked by every church in South Africa, including the Dutch Reformed Church? And yet he still asks me why I criticize it.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I have made it quite clear every section will have to be granted representation in this House. I shall deal with that later. Let us first deal with the steps for planned advancement. We now come to the third stage, and I hope that we shall be able to satisfy the hon. the Prime Minister. Take the Native. We admit that there are two classes of Natives. We have the detribalized Natives who have permanently settled in our urban areas. There is also the Native who has retained his tribal connection. In so far as the detribalized Natives, who are permanently settled in our urban areas, are concerned, we say that they should be allowed to own residential property, that steps should be taken to encourage the responsible class of Native by, amongst other things, granting him exemption from the pass laws; that he should be able to enjoy freedom of family life and that he should have some degree of self-government in his own urban area. But he should also have representation in this House of Assembly. He must be represented by Whites and vote on a separate roll. We have always been asked, &#x201C;Why by Whites?&#x201D; Other Parliaments may decide otherwise if they wish to, but at the moment the policy of the party is that they must be represented by Whites. When I saw how members on the other side of this House treated the Natives&#x2019; Representatives in this House, although they were Whites, I realized how right I was in saying this and I also realized what difficulties we would have had if Natives had sat in this House at this stage. [Interjections.] We now come to the Natives who have not become detribalized, the Natives in the reserves. The greatest trouble there is that caused by poverty. It is due mainly to the way in which farming is practised there, the system of land ownership. There is not the slightest doubt that this will have to be changed. There is not the slightest doubt that those Natives will have to be granted a greater measure of local self-government. I think, Mr. Speaker, that we could have agreed wholeheartedly with the Prime Minister and with his plans had it not been for this second step&#x2014;eventual sovereign independence. I think we really envisage further development <span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_163"/>than he does. We envisage large-scale development for those territories so that they will be able to carry the maximum number of Natives, and so as to entice them to move out of the White areas where there are redundant Natives in certain parts. Bue we also realize &#x2026;</p>

<p>Of course it will cost money. But, Mr. Speaker, it will have to be carried out as part of one great economic plan for the development of the whole of South Africa, in the same way that backward territories in all parts of the world are developed, and without the complications which are added by the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister, a policy which will consequently be much more costly. That section of the population should also have a say in this House, not necessarily on the same basic as the detribalized Natives.</p>

<p>The final step in the series on the road of planned advancement is that we want to ensure that job reservation is abolished and that the policy of the rate for the job is applied.</p>

<p>I come now to the third stage, and that is the inclusion of federal elements in our constitution, the admission that every section of the population should have representation in this House, which determines their destinies. The inclusion of federal elements will grant some degree of protection to the rights of the individual, to geographic units and to races. Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, there is the question of the linking up of territories which are mainly Black, the linking up of territories which are mainly White, without consolidating them for administrative purposes as political units. We find, for instance, that the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa has powers which our Provincial Councils do not have. They have representation in this House on a basis entirely different from that of the other provinces. If that can be done in the case of South West Africa, why cannot it be done in the case of the Transkei? Why cannot the new Bunga to be established there be granted rights or powers in accordance with their stage of development until they eventually develop into a fifth province of the Republic? Why cannot they be granted representation?</p>

<p>At this stage by Whites. Do not be so afraid of Black representatives. I do not know why the hon. the Prime Minister is so afraid of the Blacks. The policy of this party says that they are to be represented by Whites. But I should not be at all surprised if another Parliament decided otherwise in the future. I do not think either that the hon. the Prime Minister will have any objection to that. He wants to establish a sort of imperial conference of the Black Prime Ministers of the developed Bantustans. After all, he is going to meet them and discuss matters of common interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, here again we see the fear of colour and the prejudice of the hon. gentleman.

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bantu would not leave the Prime Minister undisturbed in his small White area for all time. If on our borders there are Bantu territories or states which form part of the Afro-Asiatic bloc, what hope is there for the hon. gentleman and what hope is there for the White race in South Africa? No, Mr. Speaker, talk about dangers to South Africa! There is no doubt whatsoever that the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister is a perilous one for South Africa. If I may put it that way, it is fatal for South Africa. I have no doubt whatsoever that it will lead to the downfall of the White race in South Africa.</p>

<p>But we are now faced with the position that the hon. the Prime Minister is proposing certain steps and is going to carry out certain steps in connection with the Transkei and that he envisages independence for them. This party must take cognizance of it and have regard to the consequences of it. I still cherish the hope that if I can persuade the Prime Minister to move so slowly that he will not grant them sovereign independence very soon, we on this side of the House will still succeed in making them part of a new federal constitution for South Africa. That will be the task of this side of the House in the days ahead of us. That, Mr. Speaker, will be the task in the years ahead of the supporters of this party who are well disposed to the non-Whites and the Natives.</p>

<p>We are not going to hinder the Prime Minister as far as economic development is concerned. We shall do all we can to help him. We do not want him, by holding out the prospect of independence to them, to try to escape from the burden of that development which is so necessary in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_164"/>Mr. Speaker, I think I have said that in looking at the international repercussions, I must do so in the light of the possible alternative. I think the difference between the Prime Minister and myself is that he stands for the dismemberment of our South Africa and the division of our peoples into separate, potentially conflicting states. He has abandoned the Protectorates, and he is now breaking down our country. As against that principle we stand for the preservation of the unity of our South Africa and the creation of a common allegiance to the Republic. We have faith in a greater South Africa which will be able to face the storms of the future.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I think the hon. the Prime Minister stands for the ejection of our labour force and the creation of a situation in which a foreign government will control our labour force. We say that we must recognize that all those who work in South Africa are the responsibility of the South African community, and that their welfare and prosperity must be advanced by South Africa.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Prime Minister stands for separate sovereign governments for the Black territories on the one hand, and mixed territories on the other hand, in which the existence of the Black man will not be recognized. As against that we stand for the acceptance of the federal system in which every race, wherever it may be, will be recognized; in which every race will exercise control over matters of particular interest to it; in which matters of common interest will be controlled by a federal parliament; representative of all groups in accordance with the level of civilization attained by them.</p>

<p>In the fourth place I feel that I am not doing the hon. the Prime Minister any injustice by saying that he is attempting to escape responsibility in respect of a section of the population, unfortunately the poorer section of the population. We, on the contrary, are fighting for recognition of the fact that all the peoples living in South Africa share a common destiny. That destiny may be fortunate or unfortunate, and it depends on whether we accept joint responsibility for each other&#x2019;s welfare.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I have said enough to indicate that the conditions stated in my motion have not been met, and that I have not been given sufficient information, that too many questions still remain unanswered, that there is no moral basis for the policy of apartheid of the present Government. I think that when the tests which I have applied to that policy are applied to the policy of this side of the House, I am justified in saying that I feel that the time has come for this House to express its lack of confidence in this Government.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Before 1959 the Land Bank obtained its funds for the provision of credit to farmers from amounts voted from time to time by this House, but in that year the Land Bank Act was amended and it was decided that in future the Land Bank would be enabled to take up its own funds in the open market. The Act also provided that money thus taken up would be debited to and be payable from the revenue and assets of the Bank, and in so far as the funds are concerned which the Board has thus far taken up in the local money market, the above-mentioned legal provision has always complied fully with the requirements for security of depositors and investors. Until now it has not been necessary for the Board of the Bank to obtain any money from overseas, but it may be necessary to do so in future, as in the case of the Electricity Supply Commission, and it has been determined in the meantime that if the Board has to obtain such funds overseas it will probably be a requirement that those funds are to be guaranteed by the Government. At the moment there is no legal provision in terms of which the Government can guarantee any such foreign loan by the Land Bank Board, in case that becomes necessary. The object of this brief Bill is, therefore, merely to enable the Government, if such an eventuality may arise, to guarantee such a loan entered into by the Land Bank abroad. It applies only in respect of money lent overseas.</p>

<p>I may just say that in the case of the Electricity Supply Commission a similar provision has been inserted in the Act, and we are now merely asking that the Land Bank Board should be put in the same position as the Electricity Supply Commission and that where necessary it will be able to depend (if the Government approves it, of course) on a guarantee by the Government for any funds it may borrow abroad.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There will be no opposition from this side of the House to the second reading of this Bill. Any step the Government may take to facilitate the flow of capital investment into agriculture is obviously a step in the right direction, and any reasonable step the Government may take to attract capital funds from abroad for industrial or agricultural development in South Africa will find the support of this side of the House. The hon. the Minister has indicated that the proposal contained in this Bill is a direct consequence of the Government&#x2019;s decision in 1959 to change the method by which the Land Bank raises funds to carry out its loan schemes to farmers. In 1959 the Land Bank was given powers to raise funds by way of bills and debentures. I think we on this side of the House are also in agreement with the hon. the Minister that to attract investments from abroad will hardly be a feasible proposition without the covering support of a State guarantee for repayment, such as is outlined in this Bill. There is no purpose, of course, in expanding on the reasons why the situation arises, at any rate, not at this stage. But I would like to stress this, however, that in the exercise of his right to provide a guarantee in terms of this Act, the hon. the Minister is not carrying out a mere formality. It is much more than that. It is, of course, a commitment on the Consolidated Revenue Fund and constitutes a contingent liability on that fund. Now as the House well knows, control over the Consolidated Revenue Fund, that is the public purse, is an important, perhaps the only remaining important prerogative of Parliament, and I believe it behoves this House in general and the Opposition in particular to be jealous of that prerogative and to see that it should be preserved in every possible way.</p>

<p>There is no duty cast on the Treasury to disclose the extent of contingent liabilities on the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Controller and Auditor-General does try to overcome that defect, but there is also no duty cast upon him, either expressed or implied, to keep Parliament acquainted with what the contingent liabilities are on the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As the hon. the Minister has indicated, State finance has become a much more complicated matter in recent years. The very fact that this institution&#x2014;a well-established institution like the Land Bank, which is a wholly Government-owned enterprise&#x2014;has had to be given these added and extended borrowing powers in 1959, and that these powers have to be amplified during this Session, sufficiently demonstrates that position quite clearly. The simple procedure which was followed before 1959, by which all funds that went to the Land Bank were provided by direct appropriation from this House has now obviously ended. In the circumstances, therefore, it seems to us that this is an occasion on which the need for the insertion of some safeguard to preserve the financial prerogative of Parliament should be given consideration. Sir, there is precedent and I think a satisfactory and workable precedent for such a step. In 1951 when the borrowing powers of a kindred institution, that is the Industrial Development Corporation, <span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_166"/>were extended and when somewhat similar powers of guarantee were conferred upon the Minister, a safeguard was introduced during the Committee Stage of that Bill in these terms&#x2014;(Act No. 40 of 1951, Section 1 (2))&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Until Parliament has by resolution of Both Houses approved thereof, the Minister shall not furnish any such guarantee after a loan of &#x00A3;12,000,000 or loans in the aggregate of &#x00A3;12,000,000 have been raised by the Corporation and guaranteed by the Minister under sub-section (1).</block>

<p>I am well aware that the hon. the Minister does exercise somewhat similar powers of guarantee on behalf of the State in respect of the repayment of overdrafts and other loan commitments by local bodies such as agricultural control boards, but as far as I am aware this is the first instance in which these powers are being sought by Act of Parliament specifically in respect of loans raised abroad. And I am not overlooking the instance of Escom. It is true that Escom has had loans from abroad, but I think I am correct in saying that they have come entirely from the International Finance Organizations, and in particular from the World Bank. The borrowing from those two financial institutions, Sir, takes place in terms of the Government&#x2019;s membership of those institutions, and there is this significant difference, therefore, in so far as borrowing from these international organizations are concerned, that South Africa is a member thereof. Borrowings by Escom have also this other distinctive feature that Escom is providing assets, that it adds to its fixed assets, whereas an institution such as the Land Bank, of course, does not acquire assets but acquires debts. I hope, therefore, that the hon. the Minister will give consideration as a matter of principle to the suggestion that this is the opportune time for the Government to introduce some safeguard in respect of the parliamentary prerogative. I suggest that based on a precedent which has been acceptable to this House, and which I hope will be acceptable to the Minister, such a safeguard should now be introduced. It is the principle we are concerned with, not the details. I hope the hon. the Minister will give consideration to the suggestion because this clearly to my mind is a suitable occasion to introduce that form of safeguard.</p>

<p>As may be expected from all hon. members, the introduction of this Bill is generally welcomed. It is a brief Bill to which the old adage of &#x201C;short but sweet&#x201D; may be applied in so far as the agricultural industry is concerned. We heartily welcome the Bill. The forward step is now being taken of trying to obtain capital also from abroad to finance the Land Bank. The farming community in South Africa, irrespective of political convictions, knows how much worse the position of agriculture would have been without the support of the Land Bank in years gone by. I am thinking particularly of the difficult times we have experienced. We know from experience that when creditors can no longer bear the burdens of the farmers in general and certain farmers, as the result of many circumstances, like the vagaries of nature and other circumstances over which they have no control, landed in trouble, it was always the Land Bank which stepped in and saved the farmers from collapse.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_byl">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House naturally welcome this Bill because we are anxious to see that money is provided to help the farmers through the Land Bank, and for that purpose every source must be gone into, and if the money can be raised abroad it will be an extremely good thing. But I doubt if this can be done unless the Government applies a measure such as this, guaranteeing such a loan. Without such a guarantee the loan&#x2014;if floated at all&#x2014;would be at a very high rate of interest, a rate of interest which would be uneconomic for the farmers. Hon. members merely have to see what our Government loans are standing at on the Swiss or the London or the New York Stock Exchange to realize what a Land Bank Loan would cost as far as the rate of interest is concerned if it were not guaranteed by the Government. Otherwise the Government would have to charge the farmers a rate of interest which would be uneconomic to the farmers, or the Government would have to subsidize the farmers by allowing them cheaper rates than what it had to pay for the money. At the rate of interest that money is earning to-day on our Government loans, the position is that to-day S.A. Government stock in London yield per cent, and therefore one can imagine what a Land Bank loan unguaranteed by the Government would cost. At the present moment of course there is a plethora of short-term money, but that would be of no use for this purpose whatsoever, and whilst there is a certain amount of long-term money (and the rate is shortening, I think), I doubt whether the large amount required can all be raised in this country. I would not suggest for a moment that the short-term money is funk-money. It simply is coming here because it can earn such a high rate of interest. On call-money to-day you can get something like 4&#x00BD; per cent and that is what attracts the short-term money, but that is money which can go at any moment if the rate should rise overseas or the rate should drop here, and even sound stocks, such as first-class municipalities, Pretoria for instance, which is issuing a loan at an effective rate of about 6&#x00BC; <i>per cent,</i> <span class="col_301-302" refersTo="page_167"/>are paying high rates. I think that loan will be over-subscribed as far as Pretoria is concerned. I must say that it is rather surprising that there is such confidence in the municipality considering the type of member they send to the House here. But that is merely by the way. In view of this, I support the Bill fully, but I would like to also support what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) has put so clearly, namely that it is necessary that this House, which is very jealous of its rights, should know exactly what is going on, and therefore I think the suggestion of the hon. member should be implemented in this Bill. But before I sit down, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us where he thinks he is going to raise this money&#x2014;in London or Switzerland, or New York? And what sort of rate of interest does he expect to pay if he guarantees such a loan?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to thank the House for the friendly way in which it has received this Bill, and I immediately want to tell the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) that I am not able to say where or how much or at what rate of interest we shall be able to borrow money, because at the moment this is not an actuality. We are providing here only for a possibility, and the Treasury or the Land Bank Board have not yet seriously considered taking steps to test the market. In regard to the other point raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), I just want to say that in my view the precedent laid down in the Escom Act is sufficient protection for the prerogative of Parliament. We know that the Treasury is always inclined to keep very strict supervision to ensure that no guarantees are furnished for unnecessary loans, and the precedent established there is perhaps the best safeguard against such a danger. The hon. member said that as far as he knew, Escom loans had always come from the World Bank. That is not so. Escom has also floated loans in Switzerland in respect of which such a guarantee applied.</p>

<p>Then I also want to point out that in my opinion the distinction drawn by the hon. member between Escom and the Land Bank is not quite justified. He says that if you borrow money for Escom you are creating assets, but if you borrow money for the Land Bank there are only debts, but I do not think the hon. member is quite correct there. In both cases we obtain these loans for the development of the country. In the one case it is more particularly for industrial development, and in the other case for agricultural development. But both are loans we obtain in order to provide certain services to the various sectors of our economy, and it is not true that the Land Bank only has debts. It renders services, for which it has security. Where Escom as a semi-state undertaking renders services, it also bears the burdens of that undertaking. In the case of the Land Bank, it renders services to the farmers, and the greatest proportion of the debts is borne by them. Here provision is just being made to facilitate the obtaining of capital for the development of the industry. Therefore I cannot see that there is such a difference as to justify a different kind of treatment in the case of the Land Bank from what obtains in the case of Escom.</p>

<p>I just want to say that I appreciate the interest revealed here, but I do not think that the particular suggestions made here warrant our deviating from the precedent established in the case of the Escom loan.</p>

<p>Motion put and agreed to.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>In the North-Western Cape there is a town called Pofadder. This town Pofadder was not named as the result of the fact that there was one particularly large pofadder there, or many pofadders, but it got its name from the then chief of the Koranna tribe who had the name of Klaas Pofadder, and Cannon Island appears on the scene for the first time in our history in connection with this Koranna chief Klaas Pofadder. From 1876 to 1880 there was a small local war between the Cape Colony as it was then and the Korannas under Klaas Pofadder, and later it became necessary to send the Cape Field Artillery to try to end the war. Towards the end of the war Klaas Pofadder and his Korannas entrenched themselves on the present Cannon Island and the Cape Artillery bombarded them from the southern bank of the river. Klaas Pofadder and his men were not very pleased with this one-sided bombardment and then decided that they would also make a gun, and they then took a tree trunk and hollowed it out and mounted it on wagon-wheels, and they put in a lot of gunpowder and a number of riverstones, but in their stupidity they added more gunpowder and more river-stones, and in this way they made a sort of layer-cake up the whole length of the barrel of the gun which they had made from the tree trunk. The result was that when the gun was fired there was a terrible noise, much smoke and fewer Korannas. It is alleged that old Klaas then said: &#x201C;If this is how things are going here, I wonder how they are going over there?&#x201D; The Korannas then decided to make peace, and as the result of this incident the island was called Cannon Island. Cannon Island then practically disappeared from history. It is a nice island of about 2,000 morgen. It disappeared from history until the depression <span class="col_303-304" refersTo="page_168"/>years, when a number of farmers in the north-west became impoverished as the result of the long drought we had at that time and the depression during which they could get nothing for the few animals they still had over, and a number of them decided to go and squat on Cannon Island and to try to make a living there. They were an independent group of people, a stubborn crowd, and their descendants to-day are amongst the best settlers we have in the whole of the Republic. But things did not go very smoothly after they had settled on Cannon Island. They had to provide water and level the ground and uproot trees. But in the course of time they put 1,800 morgen under irrigation and established 180 farms there. But just as the Government did not want the Korannas on Cannon Island, the then Government was not satisfied that these squatters should have claimed for themselves this beautiful island in the Orange River, and the then Minister, Mr. Grobler, decided that they must leave. He then sent one of his officials there, but they curtly told him: &#x201C;We are here, and we are going to remain here.&#x201D; Further officials were sent and they told these people: &#x201C;Look, chaps, you cannot make a living here, you will die of hunger and tomorrow or the next day you will again be on the doorstep of the Government to get assistance.&#x201D; Then this people got together that night and took a solemn oath that they would never ask the Government for any assistance. They had a bitterly difficult time. Many of them did not have food to eat, but they did not approach the Government. The few who had a little food left shared it with the others, and so they carried on.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Grobler decided to take serious steps against them and obtained an ejectment order which was served on them by a policeman from Upington, notifying them that in terms of the law they were being given notice to vacate. They knew what would happen. The Cannon Islanders know of many things in advance. When the constable arrived they immediately treated him to the locally distilled brandy, which is not 43 degrees of alcohol per volume but much stronger, and before the constable could serve the order of court they offered him a farm, which he accepted. The next day he rode his horse back to Upington and resigned from the police and he and his descendants became happy inhabitants of Cannon Island. In the end the Government surrendered to the Cannon Islanders in this second war against them.</p>

<p>In 1939 the Cannon Island Bill was passed, which settled these people there and gave them the right to that land. Now there are about 1,000 souls on approximately 180 farms with an annual production of about R2,000. I can give you the assurance, Mr. Speaker, that we have not a happier settlement in the whole of the Republic or one which is less of a burden to the State than this one. Now and again there were great floods. These people suffered damage together with the others, but they have never come to the Government for assistance to repair the flood damage. They have always struggled themselves to repair the damage.</p>

<p>The board they have has certain powers. It is a sort of local board established under statutory powers. They have, for example, the right to sell land and to buy it, the right to lease land and also the right to donate land. They can, e.g., donate land for schools and have already done so, and also for public buildings, etc. But they have not the right to donate any money. That was not inserted in the Act, probably because it was lost sight of. All that this Bill now asks is that they should have the right also to donate money as well as land. They have approached me because they want to do two things. They want to build a sports-field there and also a clinic. They want to pay part of the costs of the clinic and part of the cost of the sportsfield, but they may not do so under the old Act. Under the old Act they can donate only immovable property, with the approval of the Minister. Now they ask to be given the right also to donate movable property, provided 75 per cent of the inhabitants agree to it at a public meeting; and, secondly, provided the Minister approves of it. Now, I say that this is a responsible group of people of whom we can be proud, and this small concession we are making to them will cost the State nothing, but we will be giving them something they really deserve.</p>

<p>I have the privilege of knowing quite a few of the inhabitants of Cannon Island and, as the hon. the Minister has said, they are hardworking people but they are also hard-headed. I know the bit of history he has related and it is quite true. They are people who did what they liked on that island. They took it and did not allow anybody else to have any say there. I think this House will be obliged to grant this request, or else the Cannon Islanders will simply take these powers. In any case, Sir, we on this side of the House are quite agreeable. We heartily support the amendment and we assure the Minister that it is quite in order.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This is also a very small and innocuous measure. The Douglas Irrigable Areas Board is a statutory body but the powers of this body are for all practical purposes the same as that of an ordinary irrigation board, or as we now call them, a water board, but the method of election of this board differs from <span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_169"/>that of an ordinary irrigation board. In an ordinary irrigation board the members of that board are elected by the members of the irrigation scheme voting in person at the general annual meeting. In the case of the Douglas Board the irrigators can vote by proxy. It has been found, Sir, that certain irregularities have taken place in regard to this voting by proxy which are not to the best advantage of the board or to the best advantage of the irrigators themselves&#x2014;agitators make use of it, people are sometimes kept away from their annual meetings and have to give proxies to people who have some other hold over them. It is felt that this should be brought into line with our ordinary irrigation boards. All that this Bill does is to say that nobody will in future vote by proxy, but only the votes of those present at an annual meeting of the irrigators will be considered. I think this is necessary. They have asked for it. My Department has investigated the matter and has come to the conclusion that some of the evils which exist to-day will be eradicated if we did this and I think it is in the best interests of everybody.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>As the Minister has said by this Bill he seeks to debar any registered owner of property in the Douglas irrigation district from voting by proxy. We on these benches oppose this measure. Not only do we think that it creates a dangerous precedent but we understand that there is no other irrigation district where so many of the owners of property live away from that particular area. We feel that it is unfair to these owners who have made great contributions to the development of this particular area. They have always enjoyed these powers. They obtained these powers when they purchased their particular erven. These powers were part of their rights of purchase. Now, after enjoying these rights for very many years, owners of property living away cannot vote by proxy regardless of any excuse such as illness or something else beyond their control. We feel that the Minister may be beginning to delegate the wide powers which the Government has conceded to this board to perhaps a very narrow representation, perhaps even the quorum of the board in future may have the right of electing its members. We do not think that is a wise precedent. The Minister has not really given us any definite reason for the introduction of this Bill. He says that he wants to bring it into conformity with that of other irrigation boards. But there must have been very cogent reasons why this provision was enbodied in this Act, reasons which fall beyond the Minister&#x2019;s control as regards regulations which affect the power of the Minister in regard to the management of the board. As I have said this board has very wide powers; it actually has ownership. The Government delegated to it the ownership of that whole irrigation district. It controls all the servitudes concerned. Those are wide powers, Sir, which we do not feel prepared to hand over to what may be a quorum of the present board. We know, as I have emphasized, that many of these owners live away from this district and that is something which we want to encourage. Farmers, by owning erven in this irrigation district, are able to build up fodder banks in times of drought and this is what has happened in this instance. There are farmers in the Hanover and other districts who create a fodder bank in the Douglas irrigation district. This regulation is going to detract from an endeavour which we want to encourage. For that reason I want to ask the Minister not to press this Bill.</p>

<p>I think that if the previous speaker was acquainted with the circumstances at Douglas and its environs he would have viewed the matter in quite a different light. He asks that we should protect that settlement so that the powers do not fall into the hands of a small group. That is exactly what the Minister envisages in this Bill, and it is exactly what those people ask for. We must remember that this particular settlement is characterized by the fact that there are a large number of people, different from what the position is at other settlements, who are elderly and who live on a small bit of ground. They are dependent on others. They are people who can be influenced very easily. That is exactly what this irrigation board experienced in the past, viz. that its best endeavours to make the administration of that area as good as possible were obstructed by irresponsible people who got a large number of persons to sign the proxies for them, and then they got undesirable persons appointed to that board, persons who did nothing else but simply obstruct everything the board tried to do for the benefit of the community. It was because this obstructive influence was so clearly felt that the people asked that this Act should be amended. In view of the fact that the Minister has already told us that in the case of other settlements the position is already like this and that this is merely an exceptional case, and that the position is now simply being brought into line with the legislation applying to the other settlements, we want to ask that this House should pass this Bill in order to strengthen the hands of the people in that vicinity who have asked for it and who want to serve the best interests of the community. We shall not be rendering a service to that community by disapproving of this measure.</p>

<p>I am afraid I am not greatly impressed by what the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Mr. W. L. D. M. Venter) has said. He almost jeered at what he called old people who did not understand the position. Yet those people have an interest there. Surely to heaven they have the right to express their opinion and to see that the concern is controlled the way they want it governed. They should not be cut out simply because they are too old or unable to attend meetings themselves. Why should they not be allowed to vote by proxy? It is essential that <span class="col_307-308" refersTo="page_170"/>an interested party should have the right to show and to bring out his views and his opinion as to the running of any concern in which he has an interest. Every financial company, mining house, insurance company, even when there are no shareholders but merely policy holders, extends to its members the right to vote by proxy in order to show what their wishes and views are in regard to the control or the running of that concern. I think we are striking a blow at the right of the individual if we are going to take away that right to vote by proxy. Frankly, Sir, I think it is entirely wrong; it is undersirable to do away with the essential right of the individual to have a say. Because he happens to be ill that day or cannot attend the meeting for some other reason, it is wrong to deprive a property owner of the right of expressing his opinion. It is the thin end of the wedge to deprive individuals of certain of their rights. Let us come a little closer home. If the hon. the Minister, who is a director of a certain concern, had not been able to get his supporters to vote him in by proxy, he might not still be a director of that particular concern. Therefore. Sir, I feel that he ought to sympathize with us when we say that we should stand by the principles which applied in his case and which ensured him his position. Let us give that same right to other people. That right should not be taken away because they happen not to be able to be present at a certain meeting which is essential.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that we are not dealing here with companies and such things. We are dealing with irrigators and with a case where we want to introduce discipline. It is something which emanates from those people themselves. We do not want to take away their rights, but we at least want them to exercise their own rights. The Minister certainly will not introduce these amendments against the will of those people. Therefore I think that our hon. friends opposite have not really studied the matter. After listening to the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Mr. W. L. D. M. Venter), it is obvious that this is aimed at introducing discipline and eliminating confusion which now exists. I cannot understand how there can be any objection to what is being proposed here by the Minister.</p>

<p>I do not want to say that I am not impressed at all by the hon. the member for Kimberley (South). The hon. the Minister also said that there was a tremendous amount of agitation at Douglas, and because these people can now sign proxies for others, it can lead to abuse. The Minister&#x2019;s proposal will not solve that matter. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty is agitation. The agitation will still be there, whether these people vote by proxy or personally. The Minister will not remove that agitation. I think the hon. the Minister and his Department should seek to prevent this type of thing by other means. But, Sir, when we deal with a step like this, to take away certain rights of people, I am quite certain that the only consequence will be that there will be even more agitation. After all, what is wrong with agitation? If those people want to do certain things for their own benefit, must we now prohibit them from agitating in a more democratic manner? Those people will not agitate for things which are not in their interest. They agitate for things which are in their interest. Even the people who live there and who must appear personally to vote for the Board will be acting in their personal interest. What is the position there now? This old Act of 1937 provides for the establishment of an Irrigation Board to cater for the interests of all the erf holders and site owners. That Board has a specific mandate and a specific work it has to do, in the interests of all the people, whether they live there or not. But what is the position at Douglas to-day? In 1950 I gained a fair amount of experience of that area. Then it was to a certain extent a very poor area.</p>

<p>No, but I would not have been ashamed to have been at school there. That area developed, not only through the efforts of the inhabitants of Douglas. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) will agree with that, because I concede that he knows a lot about those parts. Those areas were developed by people from outside, by farmers from the whole of the Karoo and the northwest who to-day have plots there. If we now accept this amendment by the Minister, the result will be that those people cannot exercise their legitimate say as to how the Irrigation Board of Douglas should protect their interests. I say that any inhabitant of Douglas itself, if he sees a little further than his nose, will realize that these people did not come there to exploit; they came there in the interest of the Douglas settlement as a whole. If this proposition of the hon. the Minister is accepted, it means that there will be scores of people who have property there but who will have no further say in regard to that area.</p>

<p>Because it will be impossible for many of them to be present there in person just on the day when the Board has to be elected. If it is made possible for them to cast their vote by proxy, I believe those people will do so for the benefit of Douglas as a whole. It we do it as the hon. the Minister suggests, it means that we are slapping the faces of a large number of people who did a lot of good for Douglas during the past ten or 12 years. Therefore I support the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) in his opposition to this Bill.</p>

<p>When a man is unable to be present during an election he can vote in one of two ways: Firstly, he can vote by postal vote; the second method is by proxy. <span class="col_309-310" refersTo="page_171"/>A few days ago the hon. the Prime Minister outlined to us a system under which Xhosas will vote in the Transkei. The Transkei Native living in Cape Town or East London or Port Elizabeth will have to vote in the Transkei. Now, are they to be disfranchised in the same manner as these owners are being disfranchised? If not, how are they going to vote? I should think probably they will consider proxies in the Transkei, either to the headman or the chief or in some other way, because to vote by ballot will be practically impossible. Therefore, I say that to disfranchise these people in this manner is contrary to our ordinary accepted manner of voting if the man is unable to be present.</p>

<p>The Board asked me for it and I said no, I will not accept your word only, I want to hear what the settlers say about it. Then they voted on it and the majority of the settlers voted for it. If the hon. member says we are forcing it on to these people he knows nothing about the whole matter. In the case of all the irrigation boards in South Africa, one must be present in order to vote. Because this particular irrigation board falls under a separate Act, its provisions are different. If the hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint is correct, it must also be wrong if in the case of other boards the votes have to be cast personally. I put this question to the hon. member for Albany: If it is wrong in this case that one cannot vote by proxy, it is also wrong in the case of the other irrigation boards.</p>

<p>No, no, do not try to run away now. The hon. member himself voted in favour of the other irrigation boards not being able to vote by proxy. He even made a nice speech in favour of that Act. But now that he is in opposition, everything the Government does is wrong. Everything which he did previously is wrong! Well, I know that much of what was done before was wrong, but no worse than what he is doing now.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl). He says: Just think of the position of companies if their shareholders cannot vote by proxy. What an injustice that is! Why does one vote for a company by proxy? Because the shareholders of the company are spread all over the country and it is impossible for them to get together for the annual meeting of the company. That is the reason why there is voting by proxy there. Here it is quite a different matter. These people are spread over an area of about six miles, from the top to the bottom of this irrigation area. The hon. member for Green Point merely thinks in terms of big business. He does not think in terms of a small area where all these people live together and discuss these matters. He does not realize the difference. But he also voted for the old Irrigation Act which said that they could not vote by proxy but had to be present personally. Why is it wrong now?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>In doing so, I wish to refer to the fact that the Coloured population of the Republic of South Africa numbers approximately 1,500,000. of which 1,314,000 live in the Cape Province, 105,200 in the Transvaal, 25,600 in the Free State, and about 43,100 in Natal. Of these numbers, approximately 542,728 live in the Cape Peninsula, and approximately 390,300 in other cities and urban areas.</p>

<p>Good progress continues to be made in the establishment of Coloured townships, so much so that more than 25,000 houses have been provided since 1948 for this group. I mention this figure as an indication of the progress that has already been made in furthering the social interests of this population group. In regard to the rural Coloured areas, considerable progress has been made in developing the agricultural potential of these areas in the last couple of years, but these areas do not offer the possibility of a livelihood from farming to all who live there. The farming potential can only be utilized by and in respect of the <i>bona fide</i> farmer. The other inhabitants of the areas living in the hamlets and villages seek a livelihood elsewhere, usually outside these areas. Now it is the accepted policy of the Government that the Coloured areas, whether in the urban areas or in these rural areas, be developed in order to provide openings for the Coloureds in order that they may also progress in the field of commerce, create opportunities for work and lead to self-help. In this regard I want to quote from a memorandum submitted to the Minister of Justice and myself when we met the Kaaplandse Kleurling-sake-kamer. They refer to the Group Areas Act and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">.,Met die bekendstelling van die Regering se apartheidsbeleid was daar sovele onder die Kleurlinge wie gekant was teen die beleid, maar die sakeman, omrede hy nooit deur emosie of sensasie aangespoor word nie, maar altyd as sakeman prakties moet optree, het oor die beleid ook prakties nagedink, met die gevolg dat toe groepsgebiede geproklameer was, was bespeur die moontlikheid van spoedige vooruitgang en die rehabilitasie van sy eie mense. Andere, om hulle besighede te behou, en te voldoen aan die vereistes van groepsgebiede, het meer gebruik gemaak van Kleurlinge as assistente en agente in hulle sake, met die gevolg, deur die ondervinding opgedoen, dat sulkes hulle kapitaal deur die jare opgespaar en bel&#x00EA; het in besigheid &#x2026; Die grootste gevolg van groepsgebiede, die aanl&#x00EA; van verskeie behuisingskemas met die nodige versorging van besigheidspersele, het vir baie die insig gegee dat daar vordeel is in &#x2019;n eiesoortige ontwikkeling.&#x201D; Met die gevolg dat daar nou al hoe groter begeerte is tot toetrede tot die besigheid.</block>

<p>The urge and desire to develop himself in commerce are present in the Coloured just as in any other person, but throughout he is handicapped by lack of capital which results in other race groups being able within Coloured residential areas and the towns themselves to take advantage of the Coloured&#x2019;s disability in this respect. Now I do not want to criticize these business undertakings where their <i>bona fides</i> are not in doubt. As a matter of fact, these undertakings by other race groups in Coloured areas render to the Coloured community an essential service which members of that community themselves are for various reasons unable to provide. But it gives rise to frustration and opposition as far as the Coloured people are concerned. Many a Coloured man considers himself able to render the same service if guidance and capital were available to him. He finds it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain capital for a business, and there is no institution which is exclusively or primarily concerned with the economic development of the Coloured community. Consequently he seeks an outlet in a few directions which offer opportunities, such as labour, factory work, artisan or teacher, but in which he as a group cannot offer opportunities for work for his own people, except perhaps to a small degree in the building industry. Now it is our earnest desire and it is the declared policy of the Government to guide the Coloured people on the basis of good neighbourliness to self-fulfilment <span class="col_313-314" refersTo="page_173"/>in their own areas, whether urban or rural, and to assist him with the necessary aid towards that goal.</p>

<p>One of the steps towards development lies in development in the economic field. In this direction the Coloured should play a part in his own development and the State will provide the assistance to enable him to make his contribution towards his own upliftment. For this development opportunities will be created to help the man who is prepared to put his shoulder to the wheel. This means of assistance will not only consist of financial aid. It helps no one to receive only money and not to know how to do the work. Guidance and control will be necessary in order to ensure that as far as possible financial aid is employed usefully and to the best advantage, so that the individual business undertaking launched with State assistance will be a success. The hon. the Prime Minister, in his announcement of 7 December 1960, in regard to the Government&#x2019;s positive development programme for the Coloured population of the Republic, envisaged <i>inter alia</i> the establishment of a Coloured Development Corporation for the purpose of encouraging Coloured business undertakings and providing expert advice and financial aid. The announcement of this plan was made for two reasons, firstly as a result of applications which emanated from the Coloured population, and more specifically from the Council for Coloured Affairs to the effect that action be taken by the Government to establish an institution to assist the Coloureds to develop towards full participation in commerce, and secondly, because of an earnest desire on the part of the Government to encourage and promote the advancement of the Coloured population in these fields and to guide them towards self-help through their own initiative and the accumulation of capital.</p>

<p>With the aforegoing background, this Bill which is being proposed has been introduced. Before I deal with the provisions of the Bill. I should like to explain that it was submitted in its draft form for comment to the Departments of Commerce and Industries, the Registrar of Financial Institutions, the Secretary for Finance, the Secretary for the Treasury and the Department of Community Development, and also that I had discussions with Prof. C. W. Schumann, the former Head of the Department of Commerce of the University of Stellenbosch, Dr. M. S. Louw, the well-known economist, and Mr. J. G. van der Merwe, a prominent business man. The useful and valued comments received from these authorities and persons have, but for a few minor suggestions relating to administrative matters, been taken into account in the preparation of this Bill.</p>

<p>The aims of the Development Corporation with which I now wish to deal in detail, envisaged in this Bill in terms of Clause 3, are designed to encourage and promote the advancement of Coloureds in industrial areas and in the fields of industry and commerce and finance. The aims are stated in as wide a form as possible in order to cover most of the aspects affecting Coloured interests in the economic field. Should other aspects arise at a later stage which are not covered by these aims and which the Corporation could with advantage also undertake, this Bill empowers the State President to make provision for such matters by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>Then hon. members will note that the Corporation&#x2019;s field of activities is limited to the granting of assistance to Coloureds in Coloured and industrial areas. A Coloured area is defined in Clause 1, while an industrial area outside a Coloured group area retains its ordinary meaning. Acquisition or occupation in an industrial area is, however, subject to the provisions of the Group Areas Act. In this connection I may inform hon. members that my colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, is contemplating appointing a special auxiliary committee for physical and industrial planning through the Natural Resources Development Council to make recommendations in regard to (a) fitting in all race groups with the physical and industrial planning, and (b) bringing about co-ordinated action in this regard. It is realized that although the Coloured has not yet become an industrialist, he will gradually develop in that direction and perhaps sooner than we expect, with the necessary encouragement and support. Consequently his development in industrial areas is also envisaged in the Bill.</p>

<p>As soon as the Corporation has been established, further, steps will be taken in terms of Section I (i) (xxiv) of the Group Areas Act, as amended by Section 1 (c) of Act No. 23 of 1961, to have the Corporation declared a statutory body. Such declaration will exempt the Corporation, in so far as its own activities are concerned, from certain provisions of the Group Areas Act in respect of the acquisition of fixed property, while its members and employees will be able to take occupation without permits having to be obtained from the Group Areas Board. To enable the Corporation to carry out its aims, a number of general powers are granted to it in terms of Clause 4. All these powers are self-explanatory, but there are a few on which I will briefly touch here.</p>

<p>Clause 4 (a): The Corporation will be able, with the approval of the State President, to establish and conduct industrial, business and financial undertakings. Such activities by the Corporation itself are made subject to the approval of the State President, in order to ensure that due regard is had to the country&#x2019;s interests as a whole.</p>

<p>Clause 4 (b): In a Coloured area there may be affected persons in terms of the Group Areas Act whose business undertakings may be taken over by the Corporation with the approval of the Minister on behalf of a Coloured. As far as Clause 4 (c) is concerned, as I have already said, the mere raising of capital is no guarantee of economic progress. Consequently the Corporation will be empowered to provide other measures of assistance in addition to capital, e.g. technical aid, expert advice, information and guidance, in order that its aim to <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_174"/>encourage and promote the advancement of the Coloured may be achieved.</p>

<p>Then in Clause 4 (b), the coming into being of Coloured towns and cities will bring about the need for Coloureds to be served by members of their own race group. This must be made possible in all fields, and for this reason there should be institutions in which the Coloured community can mobilize its capital and in which the Coloured can play his part and have a say as director, shareholder or investor. Accordingly the Corporation will be empowered to establish companies or to assist in establishing companies. The other proposed powers of the Corporation are clear and I do not intend at this stage to elaborate on them. Normally, Mr. Speaker, the Corporation will, in terms of Clause 5, be able to invest with the Public Debt Commissioners any moneys not immediately required for carrying out its activities, but the Minister can authorize the Corporation to invest such moneys in other ways, and naturally that will only happen after consultation with his colleague.</p>

<p>Clause 6 provides that the Corporation may, where necessary, in order to safeguard its investment, act as director, manager, trustee, curator, executor or administrator of a Coloured business, estate or fund, or designate someone else to act as such on behalf of the Corporation. Clause 7 makes the usual provision for the appointment, discharge and indemnification of the Corporation&#x2019;s officials and for granting them pension and sickness benefits. Then there is Clause 8. One of the powers of the Corporation will enable it to raise or borrow money. It is, however, provided in Clause 8 that the Corporation may only exercise this power under certain restrictions. Its borrowing powers will be limited to an amount equal to half the sum obtained by adding its paid-up share capital to any reserve funds. If the Corporation wishes to exceed this amount, the Minister&#x2019;s approval is necessary. The management and control of the Corporation will be vested in a board of directors in terms of Clause 9. The State President will determine the number of directors, appoint them, and designate the Chairman. The directors will be selected on the grounds of their ability and experience in conducting business or the administration of business undertakings or their acquaintance with the needs of the Coloured population. The board of directors may at its discretion submit any matter to the Minister for his decision. A decision given by the Minister on such submission will be deemed to be a decision of the Board.</p>

<p>Provision is made in Clause 10 for the appointment of an alternate director by the State President, if the latter is of opinion that the circumstances require such appointment. Clause 11 excludes the appointment of a member of the Senate or House of Assembly or of a Provincial Council as a director or alternate director of the Corporation. Clause 12 empowers the State President to fix the period of office of the directors and of the chairman. A director will assume office on such conditions relating to remuneration as the State President may determine and on any other conditions provided by regulation. The board may determine and pay additional remuneration to a director who performs any other duty on behalf of the Corporation.</p>

<p>Clause 13 provides for the appointment by the Minister of the chairman or another director as managing director, whose powers and duties will be granted or imposed by the board. There is also a provision for the appointment of an acting managing director by the board, with the approval of the Minister. Should a managing director be not appointed, the board may appoint a general manager with such powers and for such duties as the board may grant or impose. The general manager would have to relinquish his post should a managing director be appointed. In terms of Clause 14, directors of the Corporation will not be held personally liable for any loss or damage which may arise in or in connection with the carrying out of the official duties unless the loss or damage was due to their deliberate misconduct, dishonesty, gross negligence or failure to comply with one or other provision of the Act and the regulations.</p>

<p>Clause 15 provides that the share capital will be R500,000, to be divided into 500,000 shares at R1 each. This share capital may, on the recommendation of the Corporation, be increased by the State President, and only the State will be a shareholder. The State will take up the shares as and when the State President deems it necessary, and on such conditions as he may determine. The shares will be paid for out of funds voted by Parliament for the purpose. The liability of the State will, in terms of Clause 16, be limited to the amount unpaid on the shares held by the State. In Clause 17 provision is made that the expenditure of the Corporation, including the remuneration of directors, will be defrayed from the funds of the Corporation. In terms of Clause 18, the Corporation may, with the approval of the State President, declare a dividend not exceeding 5 per cent, but otherwise all assets of the Corporation must be used for the advancement of its aims. In terms of Clause 19, the Corporation will be exempt from income tax but not from other taxation like customs and excise duties. The Corporation must, in terms of Clause 20, keep proper books of account, and the accounts must be audited annually by a registered accountant and auditor nominated annually by the Minister. Provision is made in Clause 21 for the submission to the Minister at the end of each financial year of a balance sheet and profit and loss account, a report by the auditor and a report by the Corporation on its activities. The Minister must within one month table these reports in the Senate and the House of Assembly, or, if Parliament is not in session, within one month after the commencement of the following session.</p>

<p>Clause 22 empowers the State President to <span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_175"/>make regulations. In terms of Clause 23 the Corporation may only be liquidated by authority of an Act of Parliament. Clause 24 places a ban on the use of the name of the Corporation by any person or company, except a company already registered when the Act comes into operation. In terms of Clause 25 the Corporation will fall outside the provisions of the Companies Act, 1926, but any provision of that Act which is not in conflict with this Bill may, by proclamation by the State President, be made applicable, with or without amendments, to the Corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I feel convinced that we are all in favour of such a positive measure as we are dealing with here. This is a practical way to enable those Coloured people who wish to help themselves to fulfil their ambitions.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened this afternoon to a piece of special pleading which must, I think, arouse a certain amount of sympathy in the breasts of all of us, because we all welcome the expressed desire of the Minister to assist the Coloured community and we are all anxious to encourage all sections of the people in matters of economic development. But, Sir, that is of course not enough. One may have the desire to help any particular section, as I think the Minister has in respect of the Coloured people, but that is not sufficient to justify one off-hand in automatically endorsing any proposals which may be put forward, simply because they are intended to assist any particular community. One is bound to ask therefore whether this Bill, with the objects the Minister has mentioned, is sound in principle, and whether it is calculated in practice to serve its purpose in the general interests and without clashing with the other economic activities of the country.</p>

<p>This Bill is of course an apartheid measure. One can deduce quite clearly from the Minister&#x2019;s speech that it is the group areas activities which have largely caused what he believes to be the necessity for providing financial assistance for the servicing of those group areas in the commercial field. It is a further attempt at the fragmentation of the economy of the country in pursuit of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s fourstream policy about which we have heard so much and at the same time so little. Of course, we are opposed to the very existence of the Minister of Coloured Affairs himself. As soon as we get the opportunity we shall most certainly abolish his post, not that he is not endeavouring to carry out his duties to the very best of his ability, but in principle we do not approve of the establishment of a Ministry of Coloured Affairs, and therefore naturally in principle we are opposed to anything designed by him to help him build up his state within a state, because we honestly believe that it is economically unsound and politically impossible. There are many Coloured business people, especially down here in the Cape. The hon. the Minister referred to a Coloured Chamber of Commerce. Well, I imagine that if there is a Chamber of Commerce there must be people to form it, if it is a genuine Chamber of Commerce. But the Minister referred to it and I accept it as indicating that there is already a considerable body of Coloured business people in the community, and they have been there some time. Some of them are very substantial and I do not think there is any doubt that given stable conditions their number will increase. It happens almost in the normal course of events, and I do not doubt either that they could be financed in the normal way as they have been financed in the past by raising bonds on their property and loans from finance companies, and, of course, like most commercial people they would be financed to a large extent on credit by their suppliers. Of course, that state of affairs does not exist to the same extent to-day because the conditions of uncertainty and restrictions created by this Government, not knowing what is going to happen to them in the future, have very largely destroyed their normal credit facilities, and the consequence is that one may regard this Bill as a Bill which the Government is bringing in to try to fill the gap which they themselves have created. It is quite obvious; the Minister made no secret of the fact that in the initial stages, at any rate, the main object of this Bill is to establish small businesses, of which there are already a great many. That, of course, is a new principle in the Bill. The State has never yet made provision for financing and establishing the small business man. The Bantu Development Corporation was something apart, dealing purely with the Bantu areas, and we see that as part of a much wider question, not just a Coloured one but a much wider question dealing with the whole question of the small business man in the matter of encouraging them. In other words, we think the new principle is whether the State should or should not provide aid, financial and otherwise, for a small business man of any race through the medium of existing financial non-racial institutions, possibly adapted in some way to enable them to carry out their functions. We do not believe that in order to encourage the economic development and progress of the Coloured people, this hiving-off process is either necessary or desirable. I think we have a very good example in the history of the Fisheries Development Corporation, which came into being under a purely non-racial Act, dealing with an industry employing Europeans and non-Europeans, and with ramifications including large numbers of private people owning fishing boats and so on. and there we have seen, in the operations of that Corporation, how the Coloured people have been helped to an astonishing degree, not because they were Coloured people, but as part of the general community and as members of an industry. We do not believe that a rise in the economic position and the taking of a larger share in the economic life of the country by the Coloured people necessarily entails hiving them off and putting them into a separate kraal. Apart from the principle of the Bill, Sir, there are many aspects of it <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_176"/>which require careful consideration. The Minister referred to the question of industrial development. The Bill provides that this assistance may be given for the establishment of Coloured industries in the European areas. If I understood the Minister correctly, he was going to circumvent the provisions of the Group Areas Act by providing that the Corporation will be able to buy and acquire properties in a European industrial area and lease them to Coloured companies. So we have in the provisions of the Bill something which seeks to cut across completely the whole policy announced by the Government. To give an example, you may find a shoe factory owned by a European, and next door you may find the establishment of a shoe factory owned by a Coloured company, financed and assisted by the Corporation. That Coloured company will obviously not be subject to job reservation. It will borrow its money and possibly the whole of its capital free of interest in terms of this Bill; it will have no capital charges, and what is more, I think if it is going to be a factory of any size, it is quite clear that in the early stages of existence it will have to employ Europeans to get the factory established. There are many aspects and implications in this Bill, therefore, which nobody has really had time to study. I can only say that we find this Bill repugnant to our firm belief that the Coloured community are part and parcel of the White economy, and that they should be helped on that basis. I do not for one moment question the good intentions of the Minister or his desire to assist the Coloured community, but I do not believe that he is on the right lines. We think that a much better Bill could be produced, a Bill which would not single out the Coloured people, but which would include them in a wider measure designed to assist the smaller business man of any race; because, Sir, there are small business men, White. Indian, Coloured and Native, and why should the Government&#x2014;I know that this Minister is responsible particularly for the Coloured people&#x2014;why should the Government single out the Coloured people for this new principle? If it is going to be done, surely it should be done for everybody on a non-racial basis. I therefore propose to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>To omit all the words after &#x2018;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Coloured Development Corporation Bill unless and until the Government gives an assurance that it will&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) develop the economic interests of the Coloured people as an integral part of the economic community as a whole; and</li>

<li>(b) provide financial assistance to develop a class of Coloured businessmen and industrialists as part of a bigger scheme to give financial and other assistance to small businessmen of all races&#x201D;.</li>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) welcomes the attempt on the part of the Government to assist the Coloureds, but then we get the usual &#x201C;but&#x201D; from the United Party. He says this attempt is not enough. I am sure nobody in this House will contend that it is enough. It is a beginning and it is true that it is a small beginning, but all good things have a small beginning, and those good things that had a small beginning are the things that develop into something great and magnificent. The hon. member has been very open-hearted this afternoon. He said that if the United Party came into power they would abolish the Ministry of Coloured Affairs because it was unsound economically and politically. The hon. member and that party actually want to abolish the Department of Coloured Affairs and a Minister of Coloured Affairs to attend to their interests&#x2014;and they are making tremendous progress&#x2014;this institution which really means something to the Coloured community in this country. It was very clear when the hon. member spoke here that he was longing for the days when there was a common roll which offered him and his party the fleshpots of Egypt. However, that common roll which also forms the subject matter of the amendment moved by the hon. member, did absolutely nothing for the Coloureds in South Africa. I am convinced that the average Coloured in this country does not wish for the return of that old order, because that old order did not offer the Coloured person any opportunities. That is a fact which no hon. member on that side of the House can deny. There is not a single outstanding Coloured person to-day in the commercial or industrial world. I cannot think of one. That is why I say that the Coloured people definitely do not long for the return of the old order. We recently had an election and this side of the House won. We shall be here for the next five years to continue to apply that declared policy of the Government and of the National Party, namely, separate development. We are definitely not going to mark time. We should like to bring something into being for the Coloured, something that will be worth while to him, and we ask members on that side of the House in all sincerity&#x2014;and we have the right to do so&#x2014;to assist us in this attempt. I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the clear way in which this Bill is worded. It does not happen every day that legal language is as understandable as the language used in this Bill. This Bill forms part of the socio-economic plan of the Government as announced by the Prime Minister. Last year already this corporation was envisaged by the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech. I think it should be clear to everybody in this House and in the country by now, that this is a Government of action, a Government that carries out its promises. This Bill which is before us to-day is proof of <span class="col_321-322" refersTo="page_177"/>that. For the first time in their history, this Bill makes it possible for the Coloured people to enter upon the commercial and industrial terrains. In relation to its numbers and its total income, the Coloured group is the most backward and the most neglected group in South Africa. As I said a moment ago there are no trained Coloured people who can perform the essential services in the field that lies fallow before them, namely, the commercial and industrial field, and I attribute that to the policy which that side of the House applied in the past as far as the Coloured community were concerned. There is little in the commercial field that the Coloured persons can call their own and nothing in the industrial field. This Bill is the first attempt to put that matter right, and to give them a foundation on which to start. All the principles in this Bill centre round this fact. There are large tracts of land that belong to the Coloureds and that will ultimately be occupied by them. Practically every town in the Cape Province has a large Coloured community which, as a result of our history and the provisions of the Group Areas Act, live in separate residential areas. We have a third terrain and that is the Coloured cities which are fast coming into existence and developing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it must be a revelation to anybody to visit the new Coloured city which is developing on the Cape Flats. I am referring to Bonteheuwel. Just look at the growth that we have there of the Coloureds as an urban community and as city dwellers within their own urban areas. Thirteen schools are envisaged for that single area. It is a fact, however, that trade in that area is not in the hands of the Coloureds. It is in the hands of strangers. I repeat, there is nobody amongst the Coloured people who has the knowledge and the money to go in for trade and for that reason we welcome this attempt on the part of the Government to give them a share in the commercial activities in their own area. This Bill also makes it possible for the Coloured people to share in some of the profits derived from trade. From the nature of things this corporation will in future enable those Coloureds who display initiative to take over businesses within their own areas, businesses which are to-day owned and controlled by incompetent people. They do not have the money to-day. Those incompetent people who own businesses in their residential areas can then be bought out by them, that is why this corporation has been established, namely, to assist those people and to make it possible for them to establish their own businesses. The corporation is a State institution, and its funds are public funds. That is why it is right that the corporation should be State-controlled and that the directorate should be designated by the State President. It is necessary, as a result of the lack on the part of the Coloured community of any knowledge of finance, that there should be a White directorate and that this directorate should give financial and technical assistance in particular, when it comes to taking over and establishing businesses. The Bill makes ample provision for safeguarding the public money which the Government is investing in the corporation. From the nature of things everybody should agree that should be so. I also think that everybody in this House ought to approve of the clause which lays down that Members of Parliament or members of the Provincial Council cannot be members of the directorate. When the Bantu Industrial Development Corporation Bill was introduced in 1959 the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) moved a special amendment to the effect that the Government should not allow Members of Parliament or member of the Provincial Council to become directors.</p>

<p>Seeing that most of the officials will be Coloured people, this Bill is creating new avenues of employment for the members of our Coloured community. This Bill should be regarded as the establishment of a financial training institution for the Coloureds, a training centre with service as its motive. I say it is only a small beginning, but all good things in life start on a small scale. I want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will not wait too long before he establishes a subsidiary company with a predominantly Coloured board of directors, a company which will give the opportunity to the Coloured community to invest their private capital in that company and in doing so contribute towards the development of their own business life. I want to go further: This Bill lays down what the dividend, the interest on capital, should be. It may not be more than 5 per cent. That, too, is to assist the Coloured person. There are some White people who have a great deal to say about what should be done for the Coloured people and how it should be done. I want to make this request to the Minister that when this subsidiary company is formed and he has appointed a Coloured directorate which will collect the private capital of the Coloureds for investment, the opportunity should be given to those wealthy White people who made their money out of the Coloured people in the past, to turn their words of the past into action; they should be given an opportunity of investing their money at 5 per cent per annum in that Coloured corporation so as to assist the Coloureds.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to say immediately that my colleagues propose to give our support to the second reading of this Bill. We have given this matter the most careful consideration and we have come to the unanimous conclusion that this Bill, having as its objective the principles set out in the long title, which I will refer to in a moment, must be supported by those of us who represent the Coloured people of this country. I would also like to say that in coming to that conclusion we have weighed most carefully the arguments <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_178"/>which have been presented here by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and whilst we agree that many of those arguments are valid arguments, worthy of the utmost consideration by this House, we feel that we can best serve the interests of the Coloured people who we represent in this House by supporting the second reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>This Bill envisages the establishment of a corporation for the purpose of encouraging and promoting the advancement of the Coloured people of this country in the field of industry, trade, and finance, and to provide for incidental matters connected therewith. We feel that it would be quite wrong for us who for many years now have pleaded with the Government to bring about some tangible benefits for the Coloured people in this country, to fail to give our support to this measure. We view this Bill as a direct step on the part of the Government to help the Coloureds develop in the economic field in this country. Before I go any further I want to say this: I shall deal with the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Constantia presently, but I want to say that the Coloured people of South Africa have for long been regarded as South Africa&#x2019;s step-children, and at long last we have a measure which sets out to advance our Coloured people in the field of industry and trade and finance. It is a measure which we consider is long overdue, and however much we regret that this step was not taken in conjunction with a decision to support and give assistance to small businessmen of all races, we feel that it would be quite wrong for us to reject this Bill at the present juncture as far as the Coloured people are concerned. I want to say immediately that I can quite understand the contentions submitted to this House by the hon. member for Constantia who in effect has said that he and his party regard this measure as a further development of the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy and has also said in effect that there already exists in this country Government institutions like the Industrial Development Corporation and other institutions which could undertake this type of work for the Coloured people. I agree with him wholeheartedly when he says that this work could be undertaken by these other institutions, but unfortunately the fact remains that despite the fact that the Industrial Development Corporation has been in existence in South Africa for many years now, not a single step has been taken by the I.D.C. to give effect to what the hon. member for Constantia has in mind, and that is to help the Coloured people in the commercial and industrial fields. Indeed, Sir, I doubt whether the present constitution of the I.D.C. empowers that Corporation to help the Coloured people on the lines indicated in this Bill. I doubt whether they have the power.</p>

<p>We know from experience that the Industrial Development Corporation only will enter into a venture when a concern is already established and if it is obvious to them that concern can only further prosper if additional capital is forthcoming. I know of very few instances where the Industrial Development Corporation has initiated any industry or any commercial undertaking and I am inclined to the view that under their constitution at present at any rate it would not be permissible for them to give effect to what is intended in this Bill, that is to encourage and to promote the advancement of the Coloured people in the industrial and commercial field. Therefore I say that however much one regrets that the Government has not utilized existing institutions with the object of helping the Coloureds in common with other sections of our community, I feel that in present circumstances, and particularly in view of the fact that there is a great doubt as to whether any such institutions exist, we would be quite wrong in rejecting this tangible step of the Government to try and help the Coloured people to advance in the economic field of this country.</p>

<p>We know from experience in South Africa that for many years there have been sections of the Coloured people who have endeavoured to make progress in the economic field. But theirs has been a very difficult task. They have made very little headway. We know that there are in the country isolated cases, one or two traders among the Coloured people, who by dint of hard work have established businesses, but they have not been able to develop in the way they should have developed as a responsible section of our community. The reason has been that through their economic position it has been impossible for these people to raise sufficient capital to enable them to advance in the economic field. Those of us who are connected with the Coloured people, professionally and politically, can tell this House that it is extremely difficult, particularly in these days where all the unfortunate apartheid laws are imposed upon those people, for them to raise any capital at all, despite the fact that in many instances they are prepared to bond their own properties for the purpose. It is almost impossible for a Coloured man to-day to raise sufficient money by way of mortgage facilities. Now and again certain building societies will make a small portion of their funds available for that purpose. But by and large it is almost impossible for Coloured people to raise the necessary capital. It is only through the goodwill of some well-disposed Europeans that they are sometimes able to raise the necessary capital. I mention this as an indication of the extreme difficulties experienced by the Coloured people if they are anxious to make any headway at all in the economic field in this country. Therefore we feel that the only way in which they can get assistance is by means of Government help, and I want to say also that for several years now my colleagues and I have pleaded in this House with the Government for the establishment of some sort of development corporation which will have the funds available to enable the Coloured people to make progress in the economic field without having to have recourse to bonding their own property and being confronted <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_179"/>with all the difficulties which I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>We feel that however much we hesitate in being a party to the advancement of the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy, it is our bounden duty to support any measure which is likely to bring beneficial results to the Coloured people. We feel that this Bill has good intentions as far as the Coloured people are concerned and in the circumstances we want to give it our support.</p>

<p>Whilst supporting the principle of the Bill, I want to avail myself of this opportunity of pointing out to the hon. the Minister that there are certain aspects of this proposed corporation which must be dealt with by the Government. in the most careful manner possible, if the success which the hon. the Minister envisages is to be achieved. There are certain aspects that have to be considered, and one of the most important is for the hon. the Minister and this Corporation to ensure that under no circumstances must there be established two economies in this country. I think it is absolutely essential to avoid the establishment of two economies at all cost.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>There must be a continuance of an integrated economy in South Africa. Every sound national economy is based on this very principle and if the hon. the Minister deviates from this in any way at all, his whole scheme is doomed to failure and he will bring about a great deal of chaos in this country. I have said on many previous occasions in this House that the position of the Coloured people is so interwoven economically with the Europeans, particularly in the Cape, that it would be absolutely fatal for the Minister to do anything whereby two economies would be established.</p>

<p>There is another aspect to which I hope the hon. the Minister will also give his careful consideration, and that is that the hon. the Minister must take every possible care to ensure that the Coloured industrial or commercial undertakings envisaged under this scheme are guided into this integrated economy. The Coloured leaders themselves will admit that their people require European guidance. Unfortunately they have not been able to develop by reason of the invidious position in which they found themselves economically in this country; they have been unable to develop their own industries and to carry on their own industries and to develop on a commercial basis. Of necessity they will have to get European guidance, and it is absolutely essential for the hon. the Minister to ensure that in respect of any financial help that is given in the promotion of a given industry, this European guidance will be forthcoming. I say that the Coloured people themselves would welcome such guidance. They realize that they need such guidance in order to make a success of such undertakings. I hope that the hon. the Minister in his reply to the second reading debate will say in emphatic terms that it will be his policy to ensure that there will be this European guidance, and I am sure such an announcement will be welcomed by the Coloured leaders and the Coloured people in general.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one or two of the provisions of this Bill and I hope to make constructive suggestions to the hon. the Minister and I hope the hon. the Minister will bear in mind these representations and if possible accept amendments at a later stage. Clause 2 of the Bill establishes this corporate body which will be known as the Coloured Development Corporation; then Clause 9 establishes the Board of Directors of this corporation. The hon. the Minister says in effect in this clause that the affairs of the corporation will be controlled by this board of directors and that the numbers will be fixed by the State President in due course and that the directors will be selected by him for their ability and experience in business and administration and their knowledge of the requirements of the Coloured people and their suitability and otherwise to act as directors. But in Clause 9 (4) (b) the hon. the Minister goes on to say that matters may be submitted to him from time to time and any decision given by the hon. the Minister shall be a final decision as if it were a decision of the board. Now the effect of this may be, and I hope that is not the intention, that this board will be nothing else but a subservient board of directors to the hon. the Minister. I am glad the hon. the Minister shakes his head, indicating that is not the intention, because if there is one thing that is absolutely essential, it is to ensure that this Board will consist of businessmen who will have the necessary knowledge of the position of the Coloureds in this country and who would be able to use their unfettered discretion in giving help wherever help is necessary to such Coloured industries. I submit it would be quite wrong for the hon. the Minister to intervene and to make decisions in matters of that sort with a disregard to recommendations of that duly appointed board of directors.</p>

<p>Dealing with the board of directors, I want to make this suggestion to the hon. the Minister. I want to ask him whether he and the Government have given any consideration at all to the possibility of appointing to this Board one or two of the Coloured leaders. I suggest that it would be a tremendous advancement in regard to the policy of this Government if they were to give very serious consideration to the appointment to this Board of one or two of the Coloured leaders who would act in co-operation with other European industrialists who are going to be appointed on this Board. It would give a tremendous amount of encouragement and would bring about a great deal of goodwill between the Coloured people and this board of directors. I very seriously recommend to the hon. the Minister to give careful consideration to my suggestion that there should be appointed to this Board one or two Coloured men to sit <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_180"/>with the other people who he has in mind as directors of this corporation. It is quite obvious that whilst the hon. the Minister surely will appoint to this Board gentlemen well versed in commerce and industry, no one can have a better knowledge of the requirements of the Coloured people than the Coloured leaders themselves. There is no doubt in my mind that the corporation will be inundated from time to time with appeals from all sections of the Coloured community for financial help in regard to ventures submitted from time to time, and I say that the hon. the Minister would render a service to the corporation and would contribute largely to the success of the corporation if he were to favourably consider the appointment of one or two of the Coloured leaders as directors.</p>

<p>Another thing that I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister is the possibility of considering that the affairs of this company should not be audited by ordinary auditors appointed by the hon. the Minister, but that their affairs should come under the control of the Controller and Auditor-General. This would at least maintain a liaison between Parliament and the corporation. It is true that the hon. the Minister has undertaken to supply Parliament from time to time with information in regard to the activities of this corporation, but I am inclined to the view that a wider coverage of that information would take place if the hon. the Minister would take into consideration the appointment of the Controller and Auditor-General as the department auditing the affairs of the corporation.</p>

<p>My colleagues and I welcome very much the provisions contained in Clause 11 of the Bill whereunder the hon. the Minister has undertaken that no member of either House of Parliament, nor a member of the Provincial Council will be appointed as a director of this corporation. I think it is a very wise provision on the part of the Minister because at all cost this corporation must be kept free from all political gerrymandering whatsoever. I hope the hon. the Minister will appoint to the Board, men well versed in industry and commerce in our country, Afrikaans- and English-speaking. and that he will allow one or two Coloured people to gain experience on this Board in order to achieve the success of this corporation in a comparatively short time.</p>

<p>There are one or two other provisions that we will deal with in Committee, but to possibly save time later, I want to mention a few of these provisions so that the hon. the Minister can give the matter some consideration before we come to the Committee Stage. In terms of Clause 4, which deals with the powers of the corporation, it is laid down that the corporation may acquire an interest in any business of a Coloured person or a Coloured company. Now in terms of the definition clause, a &#x201C;Coloured company&#x201D; is defined as a company in which all the shares are held by Coloureds and it includes any association of persons of which only Coloureds are members. Now, Sir, I think, with respect, that this is an unwise restriction. We must remember that generally speaking, as I pointed out, the Coloureds have no experience in business. It may be necessary initially for this corporation to acquire a majority shareholding in an existing business for the Coloured people; it may be in the interests of the Coloured people that the minority shareholding should be left in the hands of the European shareholders. I suggest that as long as the majority shareholding is taken over by this corporation for Coloured shareholders, it would be doing a service to the majority shareholders in many instances if some minority European shareholding were left in the business, so as to give these people the guidance they need. I suggest therefore that the hon. the Minister may give consideration to an amendment of the definition of &#x201C;Coloured company&#x201D;. This would give these people the guidance they need. Surely it is not necessary that all the shareholding should be in the hands of Coloureds. There may be many businesses, European-controlled, in Coloured areas, which this corporation may wish to acquire, and I think initially it would be sufficient if the corporation acquired a controlling interest for the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Dealing with the necessity of having one integrated economy, I want to mention to the hon. the Minister the great danger that exists and I want to urge the hon. the Minister to take adequate precautions in that regard. One can well imagine that Coloured industrialists with the assistance of this corporation might make a very great intrusion on White enterprises in this country, White enterprises that have been built up here with White capital and a joint force of White and Coloured labour. The hon. the Minister will have to take adequate precautions in that regard; otherwise the situation may arise where Coloured people with financial assistance obtained from this corporation establish an industry to the tremendous detriment of already established European industries.</p>

<p>The Bill no doubt has very good intentions and for that reason we support it. We feel that the hon. the Minister should incorporate in this Bill some of the safeguards which I have brought to his notice, and we urge that particularly in regard to the integrated economy he will be on his guard so as to avoid chaos in European industries.</p>

<p>Whilst therefore we regard this as a positive step in the interest of the Coloured people, we are going to support the second reading. But I do want the hon. the Minister not to think for a single moment that this Bill in any way removes the objections which the Coloured people rightly have against discriminatory laws applied to them. This is not the time for me to discuss that aspect, but it would be quite wrong for me not to say that whilst the Coloured people regard this as a tangible step for the advancement of the Coloured people in the economic field, this must not by any means be regarded by the Government as removing the very serious objections <span class="col_329-330" refersTo="page_181"/>the Coloured people have to the discriminatory laws which have unnecessarily been inflicted upon them in recent years. They still feel that they are being harshly and unfairly treated as citizens of South Africa. The Government must not be misled into the belief that this Bill will in any way remove that justifiable anti-Government feeling existing among the Coloured people. On the other hand by reason of the fact that we on these benches have appealed to the Government to proceed with a measure of this sort, by reason of the fact that we feel that this Bill has good intentions, and by reason of the fact that we believe that the hon. the Minister is out to assist the Coloured people, we as representatives of the Coloured people in this House are prepared to support the second reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Let me preface my remarks by saying that nobody wishes to stand in the way of encouraging and promoting the advancement of the Coloured people, or the people who are grouped as Coloureds in South Africa. When therefore I oppose the Bill, I do so, not because it relates to Coloured people, but because it is yet another attempt by the Government to enforce economic apartheid for ideological reasons.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) has pointed out that the provisions of at least two Acts, the Industrial Development Corporation Act and the Fisheries Development Act, are wide enough and general enough to promote the economic and business advancement of all sections of the community. If there is need to amplify the provisions of those measures to include still a wider range of activity and to achieve the purposes which the hon. the Minister has in mind, well and good; that would be a matter of general application and would add to the whole scheme of assistance which bodies such as the Industrial Development Corporation and the Fisheries Development Corporation are designed to provide.</p>

<p>I can sympathise with the fears and sentiments of the Coloured persons represented by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg), but, Sir, we should look at this matter from a long-term point of view. I am sure that if we do that, if we try and base our viewpoint on sound principle and realistic practice, the hon. member for Peninsula also will agree that you have to face this fact: You cannot enlarge a country&#x2019;s wealth or enlarge the freedom of the economic choice of its people by sectional legislation of this kind; legislation which inevitably is going to bring about the fragmentation rather than the consolidation of the economy; legislation which is going to do the very thing the hon. member for Peninsula fears, namely to bring about two economies. That is the basic reason why I raise to oppose the proposition and to try and set it in a better perspective.</p>

<p>I think it is reasonable to assume that this additional step towards economic apartheid will operate mainly in the Western and South-Western Cape districts. A very noticeable circumstance therefore is that this Bill is being introduced&#x2014;&#x201C;a Bill to establish a Coloured Development Corporation&#x201D;&#x2014;by the Minister of Coloured Affairs at the very time when the Cape Chambers of Commerce have submitted to the Minister of Economic Affairs a memorandum asking the Government to take steps to counter the prevailing economic stagnation that has arisen in these very selfsame districts in the Western and South-Western areas. It is a noticeable circumstance, because in the first place the Chambers of Commerce in putting forward suggestions for stimulating business in those districts, have quite naturally given consideration to the interests of the community as a whole. They are not suggesting dividing up the economy into seperate water-tight compartments, as this Bill envisages. Secondly, I say, that the appearance of these two sets of proposals at more or less the same time also serves, to emphasize the incongruous and absurd position (to quote from the preamble of the Bill) &#x201C;that the advancement of the Coloured people in the field of industry, trade and finance&#x201D;, should be in the hands of a Ministry of Coloured Affairs, whilst the advancement of the rest of the community in those selfsame fields of industry, trade and finance should be in the hands of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>Sir, assuming that this Ministry of Coloured Affairs will be as competent and will be as well equipped professionally and administratively as the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the field of industry, trade and finance (something which I seriously question) then I say what a wasteful and senseless dissipation of available forces is taking place in the Public Service. What a costly duplication of services in order to try to separate the inseparable! Here again I want to emphasize one thing which is clear the world over, namely that industry, trade and finance know no colour bars and they cannot be forced into racial strait-jackets.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir. the Bill is almost an exact counterpart of the Bantu Investment Corporation Act of 1959, but there is this significant difference: Whilst that Act is operative only in parts of South Africa, in the so-called Bantu areas, this Bill now before us, when it becomes law, will be operative in the whole of South Africa, or perhaps I should wisely add, in so much of South Africa as may still be left when it comes into operation. Paradoxically however the Bantu counterpart of this Corporation is called &#x201C;the Bantu Investment Corporation of South Africa Limited,&#x201D; whereas this newly proposed body is simply to be known as the &#x201C;Coloured Development Corporation, Ltd&#x201D;. In other words, the Coloured community is to be &#x201C;in&#x201D;, but not &#x201C;of&#x201D; South Africa. I say that is a mockery and a. slight to human dignity.</p>

<p><span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_182"/>It is quite evident that the country having been set firmly on the road of patch-work political units, we are now obviously on the road to patch-work economic units as well. The House has already been warned that this is not the end of the Government&#x2019;s patch-work for the disintegration of the country&#x2019;s economy on purely racial grounds. A similar sort of development corporation for the Transkei is in contemplation and the principle, if it be a principle, or at least the process of economic disintegration has therefore to go one degree lower in the ideological scale; it will go from the racial level to the tribal level. When the counterpart of this Bill, the Bantu Investment Corporation Bill, was under consideration in this House, I referred to an article by Prof. S. H. Franckel on &#x201C;Illusion and Reality in Africa&#x201D; which had appeared in <i>Optima</i> of December, 1957. In that article Professor Franckel made a comparison between the real pyramid-building in Egypt under the authority of the Pharoahs of old and the ideological pyramid-building in this country under the authority of a new dynasty of Pharoahs. He suggested that the outcome of both was a monument to &#x201C;efforts that could have been better devoted to better purposes&#x201D;. Whatever the cost to the Egyptians for their monument may have been, the real cost in our case, he said, would be &#x201C;economic misery and political and psychological discontent&#x201D;. And, Sir, he has not yet been proved wrong and might well be proved right. Mindful, however, of the silence that surrounds the operations and the activities of the Bantu Investment Corporation, a more apt comparison in that case might well have been with the Egyptian Sphinx, because this House has got remarkably little information in regard to the activities of that body. I agree with the hon. member for Peninsula when he suggests that the audit provisions of the Bill should be looked at and where he says that he hopes that the Minister will give it consideration, to entrusting that duty to the Controller and Auditor-General. We certainly do not want another Sphinx, even if in fact we must have another ideological pyramid. Parliament and the public are entitled to the fullest information in the way in which public funds in the hands of a body such as this are being used. I do not suggest, Sir, that the funds are not being correctly used. But I believe that the information as to how they are being used, should be available to this House. You see it should be available to this House in particular, Sir, and the information in regard to it should come from the House&#x2019;s own representative, that is from the Controller and Auditor-General. I hope, therefore, that the principle which is contained in Clause 20 will be reviewed and that consideration will be given to the point of view expressed by the hon. member for Peninsula. Provision should be made that will entitle the audit to be entrusted to the Controller and Auditor-General. No injustice will be done to the registered accountant and auditor if that is done. Legislative provision already exists which enables the Controller and Auditor-General to use the services of registered accountants and auditors and in fact he does do so. But if that step is taken, the Minister will be rendering a great service to Parliament and will help Parliament to preserve the prerogatives which are rightly Parliament&#x2019;s, namely having control over public funds in the hands of bodies such as this.</p>

<p>The acid test of the sincerity of this corporation in carrying out the objects of the legislation, however, will depend largely on how the principle contained in Clause 6 is carried out. Clause 6 is the clause which gives additional powers to the Corporation in connection with the safeguarding of its investments. The powers proposed in this clause are exceedingly wide and the principle contained in the clause as it now reads is a dangerous one to my mind. Apparently the Corporation is not only going to be a judge in its own cause, but it is also empowered to execute against that judgment which it has given in its own favour. You see, Sir, it is one thing to give permissive powers to the Corporation to carry out certain additional tasks, but it is a very different matter to make those powers obligatory and then to bind anyone who may be dealing with the Corporation. I do not want to go into detail; I am concerned only with the principle contained in the clause. But in my view the powers contained in Clause 6 go too far. They are in fact obligatory instead of being only permissive. I hope the hon. the Minister, in his reply, will deal with that aspect of the matter and give us some information in regard to it.</p>

<p>I also want to deal briefly with the principles contained in a few other clauses. The safeguards provided for in Clause 8 which limits the borrowing powers of the Corporation, are satisfactory, but I do think that they ignore the authority of Parliament. I think some recognition should be given to the position there to respect the authority of Parliament in regard to these matters as well. The hon. the Minister has referred to the principle contained in subclause 12 (3) which entitles a director to get paid, or receive remuneration, for anything he does on behalf of the Corporation in addition to being a director of that Corporation. I think that is a dangerous principle and at this stage I will say no more than that it also seems to open the door to abuse. That too is one of the provisions which I hope the hon. the Minister will carefully look at and deal with in his reply.</p>

<p>Finally, I end as I commenced, by saying that I oppose this Bill not for what it purports to do but for what it does. Taking a longterm point of view, Sir, it will bring about the fragmentation of the economy of our country. It will do the very thing which the hon. member to whom I have referred before, fears it will bring about. I say the only way in which a country can under-pin the economic security of its people and ensure rising standards of living for most, if not for all, is to enlarge the scope of economic opportunities <span class="col_333-334" refersTo="page_183"/>for everyone and not to canalize them racially or arbitrarily as this Bill sets out to do. For those reasons, Sir, I will vote against the second reading.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the objects of this Bill are to encourage and promote the progress of the Coloured in the industrial, economic and financial fields. All of us who know the Coloured community, know that it is very far behind in many fields, but especially so in the economic sphere. Even compared with the Bantu, the Coloured has accomplished very little in the economic and industrial fields. The Coloured has made his mark in the sphere of education, and even in other professions. But in the business world he is very far behind, and economic upliftment constitutes the basis for overcoming so many of the problems that we have with our Coloured population.</p>

<p>It has been said here that this Bill is in accordance with the declared policy of the Government with regard to socio-economic development. It also derives from a request made by the Union Coloured Advisory Council. The hon. member for South Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has said that he and his colleagues have repeatedly requested the institution of such an undertaking and that they therefore support this legislation because they regard it as a positive step in the interests of the community that they represent here. Therefore all who have the Coloureds&#x2019; interests at heart and who have sincere intentions in respect of this community must welcome this legislation enthusiastically.</p>

<p>This undertaking is of very great importance to the Coloured community. At the right time it will open new doors to the Coloureds, because it coincides with the establishment of group areas, separate residential areas for the Coloureds and the various races, and because there will be real development of these areas, which in many respects are new areas; and in his own areas, where he will be protected against the competition of other groups which are financially strong, he now gains the opportunity, in his own interests and those of his community, to engage in activities in a sphere in which he has in the past had very little chance to participate.</p>

<p>Unlike the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) who said he did not believe it was necessary to segregate the Coloureds in order to allow them to take part in economic life, I believe that it is precisely this assistance that they are being given which will be of particularly great importance to them because it will be given to them and they will put it to practical use in their own areas. I believe that were it not for separate areas for the Coloureds assistance of this kind at this time would count for very little. But under this Bill the Coloured is also to be given the opportunity to establish and to acquire industrial undertakings in defined industrial areas which are not specifically set aside for Coloureds or for any particular race. That is why we support this legislation and that is why the Coloured representatives also support this Bill. But the United Party opposes it because, according to the hon. member for Constantia, it does not fit in with the United Party&#x2019;s policy of economic integration. Irrespective of what advantages it offers the Coloured community, the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint is clear: economic integration for the Coloured or nothing. By giving them an increasing share in business life, it will also be possible to reduce the frustration which many Coloureds feel.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this Bill is, among other things, to stimulate the interest of the Coloured in business life. The Coloured has business acumen. We have only to consider the great numbers of Coloured hawkers in the Cape Peninsula to realize that they really have business acumen. But what the Coloured lacks is that he is not enterprising in the business world. He attempts many things, but he does not do so in the business field. And we will only awaken his interest if we actively draw him into commerce. But the great need which exists and which this legislation deals with is the Coloured&#x2019;s lack of capital to start business undertakings and to participate in commerce. That is why this Corporation is being established, to lay the foundations upon which we can start building.</p>

<p>But we must also develop the Coloured&#x2019;s sense of thrift. Unlike the Bantu, who is often too parsimonious to eat, it is a characteristic of the Coloured that he cannot keep money. It burns a hole in his pocket. Under the guidance of the Coloured Corporation, Coloured companies can now be founded to encourage a sense of thrift in the Coloured and to mobilize his savings and use them productively. The acquisition of technical knowledge, of which he is also in need, will be made possible by this legislation. The Coloured will acquire it and through it he can be guided; he will be able to get advice, as provided for in Clause 4. The Coloured will have to be trained and guided in these new fields which he will have to enter. It will be a gradual and a slow process. But it is especially necessary that the machinery should exist, as provided for in this legislation, so that the economic interests of the Coloured, what he possesses and what he may acquire with the help of this legislation, will be protected just as we protect his other interests among others, his interests in his own rural areas.</p>

<p>It is not the intention of this legislation that money should be doled out left and right in an irresponsible and wasteful fashion to Coloureds to set up their businesses. I do not believe in that, because just as the Afrikaner waged a hard struggle to achieve what he has achieved in the economic field, so I believe the Coloured must also be led step by step. There will be strict supervision; there will be controls. The Corporation will not simply be able to lend money left and right. Limits are being set. In Clause 8 the Bill lays down the restriction that no debt or loan may be <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_184"/>greater than the number of paid-up shares and the reserve fund added together. In Clause 6 the Corporation is given the right to protect money which it has in commercial undertakings, in which Coloureds have interests, by appointing a director to the directorate or a manager or trustee or administrator, where it has invested a sum of money which it believes it must protect. There will be controls and supervision. Unlike the hon. member for Peninsula who thinks that the Board of the Corporation may act for the Minister only in an advisory capacity, I believe that Clause 9 (4) merely prevents the Board of the Corporation from taking decisions on matters of policy without having obtained the approval of the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is even provision made for the Government to draw interest on its money, that is, on the money that it puts into the Corporation. Clause 18 (2) provides for the payment of interest. We do not simply want to give these people money, to shower money upon them. Mr. Speaker, in supporting this Bill I am not urging that the Coloured should be precipitately forced into fields that are unknown to him. All that I ask for is an opportunity for the Coloureds to acquire a share in commerce and industry, especially in their own areas and for the necessary guidance and encouragement and protection of those interests. If we do that for the least among us, Mr. Speaker, it will be to the credit of our sense of justice.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down and the hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill, have made the point&#x2014;as indeed the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) did in supporting this Bill&#x2014;that the Coloured people had great difficulty in amassing sufficient capital in order to undertake trade and industrial ventures generally. The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) thought, of course, that one of the major objections that the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) had in opposing this Bill, was that the amount provided for by this Bill, that is the R500,000, was not sufficient. I must point out, Sir, in passing that the amount provided for, of course, is one-quarter the amount asked for by the Government-nominated member, Mr. Dolley, of the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. So although the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Peninsula both tell us that this is wanted by the Coloured community&#x2014;the Coloured community which they refer to any way&#x2014;it is of course an amount which falls very far short of what they have asked for. But I want to assure the hon. member for Malmesbury that the objection to this Bill has nothing whatever to do with the amount provided. The Coloured community might object to the amount provided, that is, the Coloured community that say they want this Bill, although a considerable section of the Coloured community say that they do not want this Bill. One can bring evidence to show that reliable leaders among the Coloured people protest strongly against the principle of this Bill, the principle of encouraging separate economic development for the Coloured people. But any objection to the amount provided for in this Bill does not come in this House from people who are opposing this Bill but will very likely come from the Coloured community itself. The objection to the Bill, of course&#x2014;my objection anyway&#x2014;is twofold. The first is an objection which has already been mentioned by the official Opposition and that is that the Bill is another milestone in the creation of economically self-contained racial groups. The hon. member for Constantia did not put it in quite those words, but the effect of his words was the same. The Bill is another milestone in the creation of separate economic groups. And as such I object to it very strongly. The hon. member for Peninsula stated, in supporting the Bill, that he hoped that the Minister would guard most closely against the creation of economically segregated economies. He hoped for that, but the Bill in principle creates exactly what he is scared of and what he has asked the hon. the Minister to guard against. What he is asking for, therefore, is something incompatible. He cannot support the Bill on the one hand and on the other hand ask that the Minister guard against the creation of separate economies, because the two are mutually incompatible.</p>

<p>My second objection to the Bill goes perhaps even a little further and that is not only against the principle of the creation of a separate economy for the Cape Coloured people themselves, but the fact is that this Bill tackles&#x2014;as the Government so often does&#x2014;a symptom and not a cause. Why are the Coloured unable to create sufficient capital, to amass sufficient savings to go in for trade, and business ventures generally speaking? Sir, the reason of course is evident to everybody, and in fact the hon. member for Peninsula himself used a phrase which applies exactly to what I mean when he said that the Coloureds had not been able to develop because of the invidious position in which they found themselves. That, Sir, of course is what should be tackled; not the symptom, but the cause of the invidious position in which the Coloured people find themselves. The fact that they have been prohibited by various restrictions such as job reservation, from entering certain skilled trades and professions which will enable them to earn higher wages and enable them to save &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is irrelevant. The point is that if the Government is in earnest about doing something for the Coloured people as a whole, then the Government should be applying itself to removing the restrictions and difficulties which have been placed in the way of the Coloured community from developing into a proper part of the economic life of this country. Those restrictions, of course, are obvious. We have such restrictions as job reservation, and as far as trade is concerned, restrictions such as the Group Areas Act. The manner in which the hon. the Minister thinks he is going to alleviate this problem is to allow this corporation sometimes to acquire property in areas for Coloured people in areas which in fact have not been set aside for the Coloured people themselves.</p>

<p>I listened very well. Even when the hon. the Minister spoke in English I listened very carefully and I understand him just as easily when he speaks English as I do when he speaks Afrikaans. The Bill does say that. I shall refer to the very clause that says that this corporation can acquire property in other areas, even in areas other than those set aside for the Coloureds. It may of course not be the Minister&#x2019;s intention to overcome the Group Areas Act <i>per se</i> by that. I am not saying that is his intention but in fact the Bill does make provision for it. My point, Sir, is that it certainly does not overcome the major difficulties that are encountered by the Coloured community in this country in developing to their fullest extent economically. Until the hon. the Minister has done that, until he has removed the restrictions on the development of the Coloured people, until he has removed job reservation and removed group areas, I say that this Bill will do nothing to alleviate the difficulties in which the Coloured community finds itself. If the hon. the Minister is sincere about this he can use the R500,000 much more advantageously for the Coloured people in other ways. He can assist them with vocational training projects, he can assist them with educational training generally so as to make them skilled people who can, as I say, play their proper part in the economic development of this country, amass sufficient savings and go in for industrial and trading projects just like the Europeans in this country have been able to do. Because this Bill embodies enforced segregation in the economic field and because it tackles the symptoms rather than the causes of the difficulties in the way of the development of the Coloured people, I shall vote against the second reading.</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. member who has just sat down and I am particularly pleased to hear that the Coloured people now have a new champion. We welcome that. As Coloured Representatives we are always pleased to get recruits. I notice that our group has already increased by one and we welcome that as something constructive. I notice that the Minister is enjoying himself, but if he would cast his mind back a number of years he will remember that on 5 April 1959 I pleaded at length in this House for this very thing with which the Minister has come forward to-day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, your plea did not fall on deaf ears.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister of the day simply brushed it aside. Some time afterwards, when the Bantu Development Corporation Bill was before the House, I again pleaded for it, and on that occasion the Minister said that the Coloureds could not have something similar, because they did not have a Native Trust Fund. That was the Minister&#x2019;s excuse at the time, but now, three years later, the Minister has seen the light of day. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if he listens more carefully to what comes from this little circle in the Chamber, he will make a success of his portfolio.</p>

<p>Something which pleases me particularly is the fact that this Bill will greatly alleviate our position as Coloured Representatives. Mr. Speaker, you would be surprised if I told you how I am being inundated practically every week of my life in my constituency by requests from Coloured people who do not have sufficient capital, people who already have the business acumen, but who do not have sufficient capital&#x2014;and the first person they run to is the poor member of Parliament; and now that our salaries have been increased, they come all the more often. One&#x2019;s position is absolutely untenable, but something has now happened that will be the salvation of myself and the others. I must admit that since the R500,000 was placed on the Estimates last year, I have been able to sleep much better at night because I told the people to have patience; that there was R500,000; that all they had to do was to wait a bit because before <span class="col_339-340" refersTo="page_186"/>next year they would have their own Minister and their own corporation; that they should leave me in peace. As an individual I am particularly grateful for that and it will mean a great deal to the Coloured people. But we must not for one moment think that this corporation will not bump its head hard. It is going to lose a great deal of money and that is why I am particularly pleased to see that provision has also been made for people to be assisted even without security where necessary. It is not necessary for the person who can offer security to go to this corporation, because he can get assistance somewhere else. But the person who has no security to offer and who has a good proposition&#x2014;and in hundreds of cases all he lacks is a little capital in order to make a success of his business&#x2014;will now be assisted. I am telling the members of this corporation, and I do not care what experienced businessmen they may be, that once they get involved with Coloured people in the business world, they will bump their heads hard. It will take them a good many years before they will be able to tell which is a genuine case and who is a person on whom they can depend. They will experience many disappointments and they will place confidence in many people who will disappoint them. However, I do not want to detract from the value of this thing. You always have these disappointments, Sir, and as far as the Coloured community is concerned, it will only tend to uplift and to encourage them. That is also why I am pleased that the Minister is allowing this Corporation to take the initiative and to appoint people itself to give the lead in certain matters. As the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Boomberg) has said, in any type of business the Coloureds have to have the guidance of the White man. It is only by being guided over a good many years that they will be able to conduct their own businesses. It is of no avail merely providing money without providing them with the necessary guidance and knowledge and for that purpose we shall still need the White man for many years to come.</p>

<p>Before I sit down, I want to refer to two matters raised by the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden). The one was Bonteheuwel. He said that White people were establishing businesses there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not what I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>The fact remains that at Bonteheuwel there are only Coloured shops. No other group can erect businesses there. There are businesses there already, but provision has been made to ensure that no other group enters there. Then the hon. member said that this corporation offered a golden opportunity for those over-kind people who were always shouting that they wanted to assist the Coloureds, to assist them by investing their money at 5 per cent. But the hon. member is old enough to know that to invest your money there today at 5 per cent is not worth while. You achieve nothing by being charitable. The person who wants to be charitable towards the Coloured person, renders neither the Coloured person nor himself a service. I know them well. If only I had the money that I have lost in assisting Coloureds, it would not have been necessary for me to do another day&#x2019;s work or to have sat here. But apart from this loose talk on my part, I cannot do otherwise than once again to thank the Minister for eventually having taken my advice and for the fact that this will now go on to the Statute Book. I trust that it will be successful and that it will serve its purpose.</p>

<p>I would like the Minister to tell us whose view will prevail. We have already had the experience with the Bantu Development Corporation that the Minister of Bantu Administration had one point of view, and the Minister of Economic Affairs had another point of view. We would like to know whose view will prevail when this Bill comes into operation.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Will it be the view of the Minister of Coloured Affairs, or that of the Minister of Economic Affairs? This Minister will have an opportunity of replying to the debate. It is all very well for him to say that it is the Government&#x2019;s view which will prevail, but we have great difficulty in knowing what the Government&#x2019;s view is because they speak with so many voices. We would like to know from the Minister to what extent he will provide research in his Department to ascertain whether a particular industry or business is economically desirable, and will the Minister tell us that he will collaborate with the Minister of Economic Affairs? That is a perfectly reasonable question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The reply is quite obvious.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Minister is very obvious in telling us the obvious things about the Bill, but he is very secretive in other matters, and I hope he will give us this reply. Our experience of the Bantu Development Corporation is such that we have great difficulty. Commerce and industry are complaining about the difficulty of getting replies from the Minister. I know from my own experience that we have great difficulty in ascertaining from the Minister of Economic Affairs in certain areas what his policy is, apart from the Minister of Bantu Administration. We have not had experience of this Minister yet. He is only starting with this matter, and I hope that we will get quicker answers from this Minister than we have got from other Ministers in the past. It is essential that we should recognize that South Africa has to be developed with one economy and <span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_187"/>here we have a Department of Coloured Affairs and a Department of Economic Affairs, both of which will have an interest in this matter, and I again ask whose view will prevail. What is going to happen is that when the Department of Coloured Affairs makes an application&#x2014;will he collaborate with the Minister of Economic Affairs and will we have to wait for a Cabinet decision before anything is decided on the application? Surely we are creating little kingdoms or little departments right throughout the service, another set of officials to do the job. We already have a fairly efficient organization in the Industrial Development Corporation, which has frequently told us when applications are submitted and a request is made for a speedy reply that they cannot give the reply as speedily as they would like because they do not have the staff. Surely if the Minister of Coloured Affairs is going to investigate this matter, it will be better if he bases his research and investigations on the long experience which the I.D.C. has had. The I.D.C. has been investigating applications for many years and ascertaining the economic needs of the country. It has been bringing various interests together, both in and outside South Africa. We have the well-known example of what has been done on the Natal South Coast, where an Italian organization plus Courtaulds and the I.D.C. have developed rayon as the result of team-work. Here we have the I.D.C. set up under the Minister of Economic Affairs, with all its trained personnel and research over many years, and surely it would be much simpler to extend the operations of that organization and at the same time look after the interests of the Coloureds. Or is that not possible? And if it is not possible, will the Minister tell us why it is not possible to deal with it under the auspices of the I.D.C.? We did not find it necessary to divide the interests of the Coloured people when we established the Fisheries Development Corporation. We know the record of that Corporation in rehabilitating the Coloured people and their economic life by providing funds for the repairs and renewal of boats, housing, etc. Many families on the Cape coast were saved as the result of the work done by that Corporation. There was no need to have a separate organization there. Will the Minister allow this Coloured Investment Corporation to go into the fishing industry, or will all fishing matters still be referred automatically to the Fisheries Development Corporation? Or does the Minister propose to have another body dealing with fishing in the Coloured Development Corporation? The Minister tells us that he intends to provide for a board of directors. Will he tell us whether all these directors of the Coloured Corporation will be White, or will they be Coloured? That is a pertinent question. Perhaps the Minister will again say that is obvious. Will they be Coloured, or White, or mixed? This provision for the Coloured Corporation to appoint members to the boards of companies&#x2014;is it the intention of the Minister to appoint a director for a Coloured business where such a business has been helped by funds from this Corporation? And when they appoint a director to sit on that board, will he be Coloured or White? And if he is White and he is sitting on the board of a Coloured company, will that be all right according to Government policy? I would like to know.</p>

<p>Then Clause 6 of the Bill provides that if the Corporation thinks it necessary to safeguard any investment made by it, it may act as a director. Will the Minister tell us whether it will be permissible under the Companies&#x2019; Act, or whether he contemplates amending the Companies&#x2019; Act to provide for the Corporation being a director? Because the Companies&#x2019; Act precludes a corporate body from being a director of a company. Will the Minister ask the Minister of Economic Affairs to alter the Companies&#x2019; Act in that respect?</p>

<p>The Minister has the right to appoint an auditor. Will he table the accounts and the auditor&#x2019;s report? Will he allow discussion of the funds in this House, or will it be secret? We are concerned with the Minister&#x2019;s reply that it will be obviously be done. We want it to be obvious. We have seen what happens in these utility corporations. As the years pass, we have less and less opportunity to discuss them and to criticize them. There is virtually an iron curtain behind the work done by these various organizations and we will not know, unless there is provision in the statute which will make it obligatory to table the accounts and the reports in this House.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Have you read Clause 21?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and for that reason I am asking the question. One always finds, when one advances criticism, that hon. members try to divert the criticism by making interjections, particularly when they have not studied the Bill. The whole object of this Bill is to provide for the implementation of apartheid. We started with job reservation. We have got economic area reservations under the Group Areas Act, and now we have this further step of credit reservation, with different rules for Coloureds and for Whites in regard to credit. Where do we find anywhere in the Land Bank Act such a provision as we find in Clause 4? I would like to know how the farming members would like the Land Bank to lend money without security. At present the Minister may lend money to the Coloureds without security. Is that going to be part of the new Government policy, that any person who wants to go into business, irrespective of what his colour is, can be lent money free of interest or without security? These questions have to be answered. It is part of the Government&#x2019;s policy to develop not only a state within a state, but a separate economy within the economy of South Africa. Creating conditions such as this will undermine the <span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_188"/>economic position of South Africa as a whole, and for those reasons we oppose the second reading of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) was worried that members on the Government side had not read the Bill and he had all sorts of misgivings as to whether this corporation might not act as the director of a company, because that would allegedly be in conflict with the provisions of the Companies Act. But if the hon. member for Pinetown, who normally studies his work very thoroughly, had read right to the end, he would have seen that this situation is dealt with in Clause 25 which provides that, subject to the provisions of subsection (2), no provision of the Companies Act will apply to the corporation. It is quite clear therefore that provision has already been made in this Bill to meet the hon. member&#x2019;s misgivings.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown also asked whether there would be the necessary coordination between the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the Minister of Economic Affairs in administering this measure, and he rather sneered at the lack of co-ordination between the various State departments and Ministers. Let me assure the hon. member for the umpteenth time that this Government acts as a team and that there is the constant collaboration between our Ministers that is necessary for the team to work together. He need not worry about lack of co-ordination therefore.</p>

<p>In strongly supporting this Bill, I cannot refrain from saying that as far as the Opposition is concerned, we saw the last remnants here of that old, imperialist economic colonialism. To my mind this immediately emphasizes the vast difference between the Government and the Opposition, because the United Party is quite prepared to give everything to the Coloureds, and also to the Bantu, as long as it can exploit them economically. The Government, on the other hand, realizes that it is the guardian of the less developed racial groups in this country, and that is why it introduces a measure such as this because it realizes that as the guardian, it must have the economic welfare of these population groups at heart, and it is especially aware of the needs of those groups, because it represents a population group which itself suffered much in the past as a result of that imperialism; it is because we have suffered so much under the economic imperialism that we are in a much better position to appreciate the economic needs of these less developed groups and to meet those needs as their guardian. We found in the past that we could not obtain a foothold economically because we could not meet the three basic requirements for economic development. We did not have the necessary means. For economic development three things are required: capital, technical guidance and entrepreneurs. This Bill seeks to provide the first two, the necessary capital and business advice. These two items which are so urgently necessary for the establishment of this population group are to be provided by the corporation set up under this Bill.</p>

<p>Then there is a third, very necessary requirement: managers of entrepreneurs. There is nothing in this Bill or in any other legislation placed on the Statute Book by the Government up to now which prohibits the Coloureds from going to work for White business undertakings and obtaining the necessary training there. I foresee that Coloureds will still always, as in the past, obtain their practical training in existing undertakings and that they will then, with their practical knowledge, act as entrepreneurs in their own territory and among their own people. What they still lack then, the capital and further technical advice, will be provided by this Corporation. I foresee that along these lines we shall have a highly developed Coloured community within a very short space of time. I repeat that what we have seen here on the part of the United Party side is nothing but the remnants of the old imperialistic policy which only seeks to exploit. We saw it so clearly throughout the years when we saw how they fought tooth and nail to thwart the establishment of our own steel industry and how they tried to thwart the establishment of other industries. But by means of the establishment of those industries, this population group of ours, which had always been the hewers of wood and drawers of water in the community, has today also become economically independent, and we are now extending a helping hand to another population group which is still undeveloped and which we are going to help by means of this Bill to become economically independent so that they can take their proper place in the Republic. By means of this bill we can help them to become independent and I see a very rosy future for the Coloureds. Where can you find a better example of the advantages of separate development which places people on their feet than in certain spheres where the Coloureds have developed separately as in their churches and in their schools? One finds the Coloured leaders of to-day in the schools and in the churches, where they are apart and develop separately, but they still lag far behind in the economic and financial spheres of their national life. For this reason we are going to help them in this sphere, too, to achieve the necessary degree of self-development and adulthood to make them a happy part of the population of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down seems to be deeply concerned about economic colonialism. Economic colonialism, which essentially visualizes one group being dominated by another, and yet he speaks in this debate in support of a principle of breaking up your economy into those very colonial groups which his Party is so fixed on getting established in South Africa. The whole object of their policy is economic colonialism; <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_189"/>it is to break down the economy of South Africa into a White economy, a Black economy, a Coloured economy, and Asiatic economy, a whole process of colonialization. And yet this is the hon. member who claims in this House that this measure is breaking down economic colonialism. Surely the whole purpose of economic colonialism is to have a unit which you can exploit&#x2014;not individuals but units or colonies&#x2014;and this Bill is creating yet another economic colony in South Africa, a colony which will either be exploited or which will become a competitor to the White economy and the Black and the Asiatic economies of South Africa. The hon. member cannot have it both ways. Either this Coloured economy which he is creating is going to be colonial and therefore exploited or it must be in competition with the other economies and therefore a danger to either the White, the Bantu, or the Asiatic economies which the Government are creating.</p>
