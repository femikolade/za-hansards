<p>I do not propose to take up much of the time of the House. It is perfectly clear that the hon. the Minister hardened his heart against the arguments of this <span class="col_4433-4434" refersTo="page_0843"/>side of the House and that he was not prepared and will not be prepared to make any concession in that connection. We were not unreasonable in connection with this legislation. If there had been any evidence of an accommodating attitude on the part of the hon. the Minister we would have voted for the third reading of this Bill. If there had been any sign that he was prepared, for example, to consult with the provincial councils or the divisional councils, we would also have been prepared to vote for the third reading. The direct consequence of the passing of this Bill will be, of course, that great difficulties will be created for the provincial accountants and auditors and for divisional councils throughout the country, and I am actually sorry for the Minister when I think of all the problems with which he will have to cope in the years which lie ahead of us. There is no doubt at all that the contents of this Bill are much worse than the provisions of the existing law, and I hope that the Minister will remember our warnings when he starts becoming inundated with complaints from divisional councils and provincial councils. When I look at this Bill, at this mutilated Section 83, one of the legs of which has been amputated, then I can only say to the Minister that this amended section will stand as an everlasting reproach against the Government and against the Minister who have dealt a tremendous and painful blow to this honourable and highly esteemed provincial system of ours.</p>

<p>I do not know what the groans coming from my left signify, except that they show ignorance of the subject to which those hon. members have been unable to make any contributions. Mr. Speaker, I am sure you do not need the assistance of hon. members opposite. I wish to deal with the third reading of this Bill, a Bill which affects the lives and livelihood of many people in South Africa and which will even affect some of the hon. members on the Government side if they look a little bit further ahead into the transport of South Africa. Unfortunately I cannot deal with their ox-wagon transport age in this debate, What I want to say is that the hon. the Minister has given certain undertakings in regard to the application of the powers which this Bill grants him. It is largely an enabling Bill; it gives the Minister power to make regulations and on the carrying out of those powers will depend the effectiveness or otherwise of this measure before the House. The measure in itself can do very little. It is the way in which the measure is applied by the Minister which will determine whether it will improve the position or otherwise <span class="col_4435-4436" refersTo="page_0844"/>in regard to civil aviation. We will have the opportunity next year to test the application of this measure. What I wanted to say to the hon. the Minister was that there will be relief amongst those interested, excluding of course those hon. members on his side who are making such a noise, but amongst those genuinely interested in this measure there will be relief because of the undertaking given by the hon. the Minister that he will make real and consistent use of the advice which this Bill will make available to him. With that advice I am sure the hon. the Minister can strike a blow to improve the position of civil aviation in South Africa. We on this side of the House, therefore, give the third reading of this Bill our blessing.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when it became known that it was the intention to amend this Act, a good deal was written about in the public Press, and there were arguments as to what the Government&#x2019;s intention really was. Many conflicting statements were also made. On the one hand the Bill was welcomed and on the other it was condemned. And it was not condemned on party political grounds really. Even in the Press which does not support the Government there were instances where it was stated that it looked as though the Government had hold of the right end of the stick. It would seem that there is a great deal of confusion with regard to this matter and that people do not fully appreciate precisely what the problem is that we have to overcome. I have decided therefore to give the House a very clear exposition, to the best of my ability, so that hon. members may get some idea of the background and also of the necessity for these amendments.</p>

<p>In terms of the present definition of a White person in the Population Registration Act of 1950 there are two alternative tests whereby we determine whether a person is White for the purposes of the Population Registration Act, namely the appearance of the person and his acceptance by the community as a White person. It must be noted that I emphasize the words &#x201C;by the community&#x201D;. The last test that I have mentioned here, namely acceptance by the community, which is expressed in the Act in the words, &#x201C;generally accepted as a White person&#x201D;, is decisive. In all the classifications, this has been the decisive test. That is to say, if anyone is able to prove that he is generally accepted as a White person, then he must be classified as a White person, whatever his appearance may be. As far as the test of appearance is concerned, it is provided in the definition as it reads at the moment that a person who is generally accepted as a Coloured person will be classified as such even though he is obviously in appearance a White person. In other words, any person who is accepted as a Coloured is classified as such; even though he looks like a White person and is accepted as a Coloured, he is classified as a Coloured.</p>

<p>The provisions presently contained in the Act were intended originally to ensure that more importance was not attached to the test of appearance than to the test of acceptance. We must not attach more importance to appearance than to acceptance. We should try to steer the middle course. The reason for that is very obvious, because a person who in appearance is not obviously a White person will generally not be accepted unquestioningly by society as a White person. When we see a person, whether it be a White person or a Coloured, a Malay or a Bantu or anybody else, we immediately form an impression, and if we set our minds to it we immediately say to ourselves, &#x201C;That is a White person,&#x201D; or &#x201C;That is a Coloured person&#x201D;, to whichever Coloured group he may belong, or &#x201C;That is a Bantu&#x201D;&#x2014;or whatever the nationality of the person may be. But we must see to it that acceptance and appearance are considered strictly in conjunction. It was also felt at the time, not without justification, that the best judge in these matters was the community itself or public opinion. Public opinion is there to judge who is a White person and who is not a White person, without necessarily having regard to the person&#x2019;s descent and without paying too much attention to his appearance. That system worked. If the community takes into consideration these two factors which I have mentioned here, namely acceptance and appearance, then it is not necessary to delve deeply into the question of the person&#x2019;s descent to ascertain whether he has a few drops of non-White blood in his veins dating back to the second or third or perhaps even an earlier generation. That is not not necessary, neither was it ever the intention of the Act. It was not necessary to set in motion a witch-hunt; it was not necessary to see whether one could catch out a person who was accepted as a White person although he was not in fact a White person. These factors are taken into consideration by the community before it gives.<span class="col_4437-4438" refersTo="page_0845"/>its verdict and before it accepts a person as a White person or rejects him as a White person. In order to use descent as a test it would have meant digging far back into the past for proof, and the moment one has to start digging into the past one becomes lost in a labyrinth.It was considered impracticable. I am still talking about the present Act now. It was considered entirely impracticable because in most cases such proof was unattainable, in view of the fact that in earlier years there was no reliable record of many of these facts. For example, in some of the provinces facts of this kind have only been noted since 1915 in registrations of births and deaths. In other words, one canont trace the origin and the race of the person.</p>

<p>This approach which I have outlined here briefly, with few exceptions has produced the desired results in implementing this Act during the period of nearly 12 years that this Act has been in operation. It was found that there was no better yardstick than public opinion.I should like, if I may, to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that there have been only 3,593 cases where formal objections have been lodged to race classifications. These are the latest figures, up to 27 March. As hon. members are aware, these race classifications were made on the basis of the 1951 census return which were completed by the individuals themselves. For the rest we made use of the registers of births, deaths, etc., and other information available to the Population Registrar. The individual concerned was thereafter entitled to object to his race classification. Practically all those race classification objections have been disposed of; only a few hundred still have to be dealt with. They are not difficult cases but the Board still has to dispose of them. I shall give the results in a moment. It appears that objections have been heard by the Race Classification Appeal Board and the courts in 297 cases. 233 cases have been decided in favour of the objectors and only 46 cases against the objectors. All I want to prove here, particularly with the last three figures, is firstly that during these 12 years the case made out by the objector has been carefully considered and, secondly, that where there has been any doubt at all, the Appeal Board has given the benefit of the doubt to the objector. All these cases that I have mentioned here have usually been approached with the greatest degree of humanity, so much so that the former member for Salt River, Mr. Harry Lawrence, expressed his satisfaction on various occasions and as recently as last year in the debate on the Interior Vote with the humane way in which the question of race classification was being approached and the humane way in which it was being done. I attach a good deal of importance to the fact that a person like Mr. Lawrence, whose ideas about other actions of the Government are well-known, found it possible to voice favourable criticism in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>Because there is and was doubt with regard to what constituted adequate proof of acceptance, it was indicated by my predecessor in general terms two years ago what sort of proof he would regard as sufficient to prove acceptance as a White person, provided, of course, there was no evidence to the contrary. During the past year&#x2014;after my predecessor had announced the new kind of proof that he would accept and to which he would give serious attention&#x2014;various cases occurred where persons who had submitted the specified proof of acceptance as White persons, subsequently applied to have their race classification amended. And these are all classes where persons had been classified as Whites by the Population Registrar, either on appeal or without appeal, after they had lodged objections. In Cape Town alone during the past year&#x2014;and this is the only figure that I have been able to get&#x2014;we had 15 such cases where people had been classified as White and where they subsequently applied to be re-classified as Coloureds.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>No, wait a moment. The reason given by the person concerned was that when the protection of the few persons who had signed and filled in those forms and who had assisted him to be classified as a White person, disappeared, and he had to face the public with a White identity card, he was not accepted as a White person. Public opinion would not accept him; public opinion rejected him to such an extent that he felt so unhappy amongst the Whites that he went back and asked to be re-classified as a Coloured because he could not be accepted in White circles. Mr. Speaker, these are facts, and they are very important facts. I want to make the point that the humanitanism factor cuts both ways. It is humane to classify a person correctly, but equally it is inhumane to influence a person wrongly with the result that he is classified in a group in which he should never really have been classified. In Cape Town alone we have had 15 such cases just in the past year.</p>

<p>This fact proves two things to my mind.I think it proves that the community is still the best judge, and the community will still continue to be the judge. When you see a person walking in the street, you apply your own test. Let hon. members walk down the street and ask themselves when they see a person, &#x201C;Is this man White: is he Coloured or is he a Cape Malay?&#x201D; They themselves will immediately classify that person in their own minds. What is the use of classifying a person in a book as a White person when he is rejected by public opinion, which is the best judge, and which has to accept him? What is the use if that judge says, &#x201C;I am not going to allow you into my house; I am not going to admit you to my living-room, I am not going to allow you to eat at my table&#x201D;? That, to my mind, is the first proof.</p>

<p>The second point that proves my case is that there are persons who for reasons of their<span class="col_4439-4440" refersTo="page_0846"/>own&#x2014;I am not going to ascribe motives to them &#x2014;are prepared to say that a person is generally accepted as a White person when that is not the case. I do not suggest that these persons are deliberately out to wreck separate development. I do not want to suggest that, but for some years the Government has had cause to think that there is something wrong. Unless there is wilfulness somewhere along the line, we find it inexplicable why these people carry on in this way. I do not want to suggest that a deliberate attempt is being made to misuse this Government&#x2019;s humanitarian attitude, in connection with a very delicate matter such as race classification, with the object of bringing about integration via the back door. I do not suggest that. But after 12 years practical experience of race classification, we are well aware that possibly those who have had to furnish proof of acceptance may have erred, but nevertheless in certain cases I cannot exclude the possibility of absolute wilfulness.</p>

<p>In view of this state of affairs, we would be grossly neglecting our duty towards the community if we did not take active steps in this matter. That is why we are laying down more stringent requirements for the proof of acceptance. Previously, as hon. members are aware, proof had to be presented in the form of certificates or affidavits by at least one or two of the following persons, the police officer in charge, a school principal, a minister of religigion, an employer, a Senator, a Member of Parliament or a member of the provincial council, and from two friends of the family to the effect that they regard and accept the objector as a friend of the family. It was then decided&#x2014;this has also become general knowledge already&#x2014;that except in exceptional cases, at least three of the categories I have mentioned previously and at least two friends of the family had to submit affidavits to the effect that they accepted the person concerned. The friends of the family were also expected to testify that the person concerned&#x2014;that is to say in respect of the classification where any doubt existed&#x2014;was accepted socially as belonging to their own race. Because if acceptance is to mean anything, then at least it must mean that when I accept a person as my equal and want to treat him as my equal, I must admit him socially to the sanctity of my own hom and associate with him as an equal. The moment this happened there was a storm of protests, but it proved to be just a mild gust of wind which soon blew over, and the reason for that, in my opinion, is this: Public opinion rebelled immediately against those voices of protest. Public opinion endorsed that what had been done was correct. How can you testify that a person is White while refusing to treat him as an equal socially? Because after all then you have not testified that he is a White person. But the storm blew over, and I feel that the people of the Republic know what they want. Whether they belong to the National Party or to the United Party, and I would go so far as to say whether they belong to the Progressive Party, they know what they want and they are not unmindful of what has been happening in the rest of Africa in recent years, a fact which proves that throughout our history the people of the Republic have adhered steadfastly to the idea of separate development and no miscegenation. As a matter of fact, the policy of the United Party, like that of the National Party, is that there must be absolutely no social or residential integration. In those spheres they also believe in apartheid, just as we do.</p>

<p>It now appears, however, that there are certain White persons in this country who, again for reasons of their own, are prepared by means of affidavit to assist a person who admits that he is a full-blooded Chinese by descent, that he looks like a Chinese, and who in appearance is obviously a Chinese, to be accepted as a White person by declaring on oath that he is accepted as a White person. [Interjections.] Will the hon. member wait until I have finished? I am quite willing to reply to his questions. This happened in spite of the indisputable fact that was not the opinion of the community, and I challenge any hon. member on the other side to take this Chinese, David Song, out of the environment in Durban where he is living and to place him in any other environment in Cape Town or Pretoria or Johannesburg and to get the verdict of public opinion as to whether he is a White person. And yet these people declared on oath that he was accepted as a White person. I say without any fear of contradiction that is not true; he is not accepted as a White person. He may be accepted as a White person in certain homes where he grew up, or by Whites with whom he attended the same school, or by Whites with whom he played when they were children. There may be certain White families who accept him and invite him to their homes, but they do not accept him as a White person. It has become perfectly clear now that the Government&#x2019;s humanitarian attitude in approaching this very delicate matter has been grossly abused. Race classification is a very delicate matter. It is not something to be toyed with. It is not a matter in which one can hurt people unnecessarily to-day and then think that one can heal the wound to-morrow. I say and I repeat that during the 12 years that this Government has administered this Act it has done everything in its power to take into consideration the humanitarian factor and not to wound and hurt people unnecessarily. If there is a possible loophole in an Act, it is quite possible that people may make use of the loophole and juridically that they may be correct in doing so. We do not dispute that, nor did we appeal in this case. The loophole is there. This person admitted that he was a Chinese. He admitted that he was born in Canton and that he had no White blood in his veins. But on the principle of acceptance only misuse was made not only of the loophole in the Act by coming forward with affidavits, but from the humanitarian point of view, the implementation of the Act was also misused and people&#x2019;s feelings were trampled upon. That is why it has become necessary once again to take steps to <span class="col_4441-4442" refersTo="page_0847"/>see that integration does not take place against the will of the community. As I say, I set out from the standpoint that society, public opinion, does not want integration in this sphere, and it is the duty of this Government to consider that public opinion and sentiment and to give effect to it. That is why we move an amendment in Clause I which changes the definition of &#x201C;White&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now, hon. members know what legal language is. To me as a layman it sometimes sounds unnecessarily complicated. As a layman I ask myself: What does this new definition mean? This new definition, to my mind, contains three principles, not necessarily new principles, as we now propose that it should be amended. I start from the bottom, at the end of the definition as it stands here. The first principle is that somebody admits&#x2014;and I emphasize the word &#x201C;admits&#x201D;; he is not forced to do so, but he does what David Song did. He gets up and says: I tell you I am Chinese and I have only Chinese blood in my viens. That person voluntarily admits, without being compelled to do so In any way, that in so far as his descent is concerned he is a Native or a non-White. That person will not be classified as a White. He is not looking for a loophole in the law. He frankly admits it, and perhaps he is proud of it, but for reasons of his own he would rather be classified as a White, because according to Press reports David Song said that he wanted to be classified as a White because it is more convenient in this country to be a White. We are now closing that loophole. We say: If you admit you are a Native or a Coloured, you can do what you like, but in terms of this definition you will not be classified as a White. I do not know whether hon. members opposite can find fault with this, except of course if they again stand behind the door with all kinds of suspicions and try to see whether we are not in some way cheating these people again; except if the opposition refuses to accept an accomplished fact, that this Act is applied with the greatest humanity, and if somebody is hurt it is not done deliberately by the Population Registrar or by the Department, but that a preliminary classification is made according to the data available to them, and when a person lodges objection the Act is administered in such a humane way that even the Opposition has praised us for it.</p>

<p>I do not expect anything from the hon. member, but there are others over there who will believe it.</p>

<p>In the second place, this new definition means the following: a person who ordinarily passes for a Coloured will not be classified as a White, even though he appears to be White, even though he looks like just like a White man. We are not going to walk around and say: &#x201C;But you look very much like a White man. Why are you still a Coloured? You can apply, because you look like a White man. We will make you a White man.&#x201D; Our definition now says, without any doubt, that if that person passes for a Coloured, even though he looks like a White, he cannot be declared to be White, because he is a Coloured.</p>

<p>Then we come to the third leg of this definition, which says that a person who by appearance is not White will not be classified as White even though he generally passes as a White.</p>

<p>A person who looks like a non-White will not be classified as a White. The second part is: A person who is accepted as a Coloured will not be classified as a White. One who admits that he is a Coloured will not be classified as a White. That is quite clear. Now we have the three legs of what public opinion is. Public opinion itself classifies these people in that way. It says: How can you be classified as a White if you admit that you are a Coloured or a Bantu? It says: How can you be classified as a White if you are accepted as a Coloured or a Bantu? And it says: How can you be classified as a White if you look like a non-White?</p>

<p>This is a very serious matter, and it is just as well for us to laugh a little. Now hon. members may ask: Why are we doing this thing? Our reply is: In the first place we want to prevent&#x2014;and that is the duty of the Government&#x2014;integration taking place deliberately or as the result of a mistake, because people do not know what they are doing; and we are only doing so because that is absolutely the traditional way in South Africa. If the Opposition opposes the principle, they are simply opposing the state of affairs which has prevailed here ever since we White people came to this country. To me the important point is that we realize very clearly that if there is race classification, even under the former definition or in terms of any definition we may have, there will be cases of unnecessary hardship. We must be realistic, but I want to assure those people, who perhaps, in their opinion, are going to suffer unnecessary hardship. that their cases will still, as in the past, be dealt with by us as humanely as possible. I want to give them that absolute assurance to-day. What the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) said by way of a joke is quite correct. We cannot only take the one case. There will be cases where a man is absolutely White, but where his appearance is so <span class="col_4443-4444" refersTo="page_0848"/>much against him that one would perhaps not classify him as a White. But then we come to the acceptance, and when later we come to the next provision the necessary proof will also be furnished that this man&#x2019;s family has already been accepted for generations and his children are accepted. I just want to give the assurance that the former definition resulted in problems, and this one may also do so, but these people will be treated as humanely as possible.</p>

<p>I want to say frankly that I regret it. Matters had just begun to run smoothly in regard to this whole classification. Hon. members know from replies we gave here to questions that a large number have already been disposed of. We are struggling at the moment only with a small number who have not yet obtained their identity cards as the result of the fact that they changed their address, so that we could not trace them. But identity cards have already been issued to 2,039,000 Whites, 704,505 Coloureds and 171,744 Asiatics. We estimate that we still have to issue identity cards to 40,000 Whites, 111,000 Coloureds and 108,000 Asiatics. I say I am sorry we have to do it at this stage, but we have no choice, and I think this House has no choice, because in the case I mentioned a deliberate attempt was made to frustrate our legislation and to try to ridicule it. But what have those people gained by it? Those people did not realize the consequences of their actions, and as the result of their actions they have caused unnecessary concern and misery to other people who were wrongly classified in this way.</p>

<p>Have we ever considered what it means if a person is classified as a White and begins moving in White circles and people look at him askance, so that he takes out his identity card and asks them why they look at him askance, and then he says: I am here in a public bar and I want to have a drink. or I want to go to the cinema and I am White, and then later that person comes and asks us: Please classify me as a Coloured again? That is surely a terrible position to be in.</p>

<p>Who is the cause of it? I say it is the people who gave those people wrong advice who caused all the misery. Surely it is not a disgrace to be a Coloured or a Native, no more than it is a disgrace to be a White man. It is not a disgrace to belong to a particular race, but it is a disgrace to forsake one&#x2019;s own people and to join another group of people whose traditions and cenceptions can never become one&#x2019;s own, and where one never feels at home. Every member of every racial group has a function to perform in this stage of our existence, to ensure that the pride and the identity of his own group, its morals and its traditions, will not become lost, and to ensure the greatest possible measure of prosperity for all within the limits of their own capacity. If only we would realize this; if we want to help, let us help as Members of Parliament and as responsible persons only in cases where we really feel help is necessary, and such cases have been brought to my notice already by hon. members opposite, where I readily, when I got the data from them, immediately ordered a reclassification to be made and said: I am convinced that this is a <i>bona fide</i> case. Let us do that; it is our duty. We do not want to debar from the White group people who belong there, but on the other hand we do not want to allow people to infiltrate into the White group when they do not belong there, and then they are eventually the sufferers and sit back and laugh and say: Have we not played a nice trick on the Government?</p>

<p>I shall briefly deal with the next clause. I am not going to discuss Clause 2. We only make it quite clear there that &#x201C;he&#x201D; means the Director of Census. In regard to Clause 3, this is also a difficulty we came across in race classification. Before the Population Registration Amendment Act of 1956 came into operation, any person could at any time object to a race classification made by the Secretary of the Department, whilst a period of only <i>30</i> days was allowed in which to take the decision of the Board on appeal to the Supreme Court. This House passed the Amending Act which <i>inter alia</i> also limited to 30 days the period in which anybody could object to a race classification made by the Secretary, because it was felt that having an unlimited period would lead to uncertainty, if objection is raised years after a classification was made. That is what the House considered at the time. It was considered to be in the interest of everybody, and particularly in the interests of the persons concerned, to obtain certainty in regard to their race classification as soon as possible. In practice it appeared that this position contributed much towards the progress made in regard to race determinations and the clarity and calmness which resulted in this respect. However, the courts later held that the provision, as worded at present, was not peremptory, and expressed the view that the Board investigating the objection could condone any delay. Delays of up to five years were condoned as the result of this judgement, because the provision in regard to the 30 days was not regarded as peremptory. In the proposed provisions of Clause 3 it is now provided that the intention of the House in 1956 should be stated very clearly, viz. that a person has the right to object to the classification only within 30 days of having become aware of it. Because this Act is applied humanely, it is realized that in some cases it may be possible that the period of 30 days will be too short, and therefore, it is further provided in this clause that the Minister should be given the power to condone such delayed objections for a maximum period of one year. Fairer than that we cannot be. But then the Minister cannot condone just any delay, and therefore I want to give the undertaking to-day on behalf of the Government the delays will be condoned only if it appears <span class="col_4445-4446" refersTo="page_0849"/>that the objector, due to factors beyond his control, will be deprived of the right to have the correct classification made if he is not granted an extension of time, and under no other circumstances. I want to repeat that. If it appears that the objector, due to factors beyond his control, will be deprived of the classification to which he is entitled&#x2014;in those cases we will do it.</p>

<p>Then I come to Clause 4. The Secretary for the Interior now has the power only to instruct the person in regard to whom details are being entered in the register to submit proof of the accuracy of such details. It is now proposed that the Secretary may institute investigation, or appoint somebody to do so, as to the accuracy of such details. It is regarded as essential because of the inaccurate information contained in the census forms of 1951 in regard to citizenship, births, marriages, racial descriptions, etc., that the Secretary for the Interior should be clothed with these powers to prevent inaccurate information being entered in the register, or the illegal or deliberate infiltration of members of one population group into the ranks of the other.</p>

<p>Later on I will give that assurance to the Leader of the Opposition very clearly. I still have to inform the House that there is a small amendment which I myself will move in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>This power I refer to will, with one exception, not be used to investigate the descent of persons, except Bantu. Hon. members know that we can investigate the descent of Bantu. But the descent of persons will not be investigated, because descent is not the decisive test in the case of Whites, although it is such a test in the case of Bantu. I want to give the assurance that the descent of Whites will not be investigated as the result of this power now being given to the Secretary to investigate, because descent (afkoms) is not the decisive factor in race classification.</p>

<p>I say there is one exception, and that is in the case of an admission by a person that by descent he is a Native or a Coloured. That is the only case where descent will have anything to do with the provisions of this Act, when the person admits that he is a Native or a Coloured.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should read the English text, then he will understand it more clearly. The English text refers to &#x201C;descent&#x201D;. Our law advisers have translated &#x201C;descent&#x201D; as &#x201C;herkoms&#x201D;. It is not the place where the person comes from, but it refers to the blood in his veins. In any case, that is something we can discuss later in the Committee Stage. In order to prevent anybody through ignorance, or for reasons of his own, making an admission which will be very harmful to him or his family, I intend moving in the Committee Stage, at the end of the proposed definition of a White person, that the following words be added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless it is proved that the admission is not based on fact.</block>

<p>These words will be inserted in Clause 1, after the words &#x201C;of &#x2019;n gekleurde is nie&#x201D;. In English the words will be &#x201C;unless it is proved that the admission is not based on fact&#x201D;. This provision&#x2014;and I shall illustrate it in a moment by giving two examples&#x2014;will ensure beyond all doubt that an admission made in ignorance or for other reasons, whilst the facts of descent prove the contrary, will not harm innocent persons. To take the two cases which pertinently came to our notice, there will be no difficulty with this definition in the case of David Song without the tail attached to it. But now another case can arise, and here I pertinently want to mention the case of Singh and the Bloem girl. A person, like Mrs. Singh, who has contravened the Mixed Marriages Act, could very easily say: I admit that I am non-White. For all practical purposes, it will perhaps be to her advantage to admit that she is an Indian, because in terms of our laws she illegally married an Indian; we do not recognize her marriage. Therefore, in order to prevent our Act being stultified further, it is necessary to add &#x201C;unless it is proved that the admission is not based on fact&#x201D;, and then her descent will be investigated.</p>

<p>I want to state very clearly that in no other cases will my Department investigate the descent of persons, either those who still have to be classified or those who have already been classified. Persons whose race classification is in dispute will be dealt with in the same humane manner that they have been dealt with in past years. That is also a promise. The amended provisions in regard to race determination will not affect the position of persons already classified, but I want to give a very clear warning here that as from to-day no classifications or reclassifications will be considered and no objections will be referred to the Board for investigation, before this amending <span class="col_4447-4448" refersTo="page_0850"/>Act has come into operation and its provisions can be applied. I hope there will not be a long delay. Hon. members should not waste their time by telling us that we classified David Song as a White person; that Song is married to a Chinese and that it is an illegal marriage. Song was married before the Mixed Marriages Act was promulgated and that Act, as hon. members know, condoned all existing mixed marriages. Therefore Song is legally married and he can stay married.</p>

<p>I want to express the hope that we will not regard this Bill from a party political point of view. Perhaps I am now making a big mistake; perhaps I should just allow the Opposition to put their foot more deeply into the trap. I think that is what I should have done, but I want to put it this way: I do not think it is worth while for the Opposition. We now have race classification in this country in terms of an Act which is on the statute book. Hon. members may not be in favour of the races being classified, but they have been classified and they will be classified; and if the Opposition seriously regards itself as being the alternative Government of this country, I am convinced that hon. members opposite are just as proud of their White skins as I am of mine and that they will not allow people to slip in by the back door to be classified as Whites&#x2014; not that I look down upon the other classifications and classified persons, because they in turn are proud of their skins. We have mutual respect for each other, but we have no respect for those who want to encroach on. anybody&#x2019;s terrain.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>When one has listened to what the hon. the Minister has had to say and has tried to sort the wood from the trees, it would seem that he has succeeded in putting before this House a Bill which, whether he likes it or not, is going to tighten up admission into the White group and which, whether he likes it or not, is going to have certain effects which he apparently does not foresee and which it would seem he would like to avoid.</p>

<p>He has said that there will be no reclassification of individuals under this legislation because of a change in the definition. Nowhere in this Bill and nowhere in the original Act is there a prohibition on reclassification. All we have then is the Minister&#x2019;s assurance, and we have already been conscious of the fact that since he has been in charge of this Department there has been a tightening up as opposed to what the position was under the previous Minister. He cannot bind future Ministers, and I see no provision in the original Act, its amendments, or this Bill, which prevents reclassification as a result of this change in definition. The hon. the Minister gave me an assurance, very confidently, but it is not borne out by the terms of the Bill before us.</p>

<p>It is difficult for us on this side of the House to approach this Bill without having regard to the background against which we must see it, and without having regard to the principal Act which it seeks to amend and our attitude to that principal Act. I think that after the hon. gentleman himself has dealt so fully with certain aspects of that Act, I may perhaps be permitted to say that when the original Act was before us, we found it objectionable on a number of grounds. We believed that with that Act the Government was attempting to classify what could not be classified, was attempting to classify the unclassifiable, attempting to sort out what 300 years of history had done in South Africa in a manner which we did not believe was possible; secondly, that while the border-line cases might only affect tens of thousands of people, what was going to be done under the Act was going to affect the consciences of hundreds of thousands of people because the results attendant upon reclassification in the social sphere, in the economic sphere and in the political sphere were so severe. We know from our own experience of the untold misery suffered by many families as the result of the application of the provisions of this Act, untold misery which was foreseen at the time and which this side of the House warned against. Thirdly, I think particular attention was drawn to the fact that there would be repercussions to this legislation in the international sphere, repercussions which would be far-reaching, especially in our relations with organizations outside South Africa and other countries of the world; and I think one can say that after 12 years these allegations have been established beyond any doubt at all. They have been established not only beyond any doubt but to such an extent that the country to-day is still in some measure paying for the consequences of this legislation and the philosophy which gave rise to legislation of this kind.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, there is to be a change in this legislation. There are going to be changes introduced to meet certain difficulties which have arisen in respect of classification and difficulties which are still affecting the consciences of many people to the same extent perhaps as the original Bill itself. One has heard the Minister outlining the difficulties and one reaches the conclusion that one wonders whether he has met the difficulties that he outlined and whether he has not in fact created far greater difficulties than the ones with which he had to contend before he set about amending this Act.</p>

<p>It has been quite obvious from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech that the amendments are designed to deal particularly with the Cape Coloured people. They were without a doubt the main target of the original Bill, as was clearly stated at the time by the Leader of the Opposition, Field-Marshal Smuts himself. But the then Minister of Interior, the present Minister of Finance, realizing the difficulties and the problems with which he was faced, realized too that in establishing something in the nature of a human stud-book, he was dealing with a very delicate matter indeed, so delicate a matter that he preferred to stick to the <span class="col_4449-4450" refersTo="page_0851"/>judgment of society in coming to conclusion as to the clasification in which people should be put. He preferred to accept the conventions of society, conventions which had been built up as the result of experience, as the result of day-to-day contact, as the result of general acceptance, and he made general acceptance the test really. The hon. the Minister himself, on a previous occasion in this House, not only showed that general acceptance was the test but how, if general acceptance changed, an individual could be reclassified. It was only last year that the hon. the Minister said in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are two sides to this matter, and I am glad the hon. member has mentioned the cases. He said that he has had many such cases. I shall in any case be glad if he will bring them to me.</block>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand I want to say that he cannot do so because the principle on which we work is the principle of acceptance. If a person is classified as White and after two years mixes with Coloureds and lives amongst them, if he associates with them and if the White community rejects him and the Coloureds accept him as one of them, then his classification can be changed.</block>

In other words, I am using this example at this stage for one purpose only&#x2014; I will use it for others later&#x2014;and that is to establish that as far as the Minister was concerned, general acceptance was the factor to which overwhelming importance would be given. Despite that example, despite the example of the previous Minister, the hon. gentleman is coming here to-day and he is changing that principle in two respects. In one respect he is allowing appearance to triumph over general acceptance, because he has told us himself that a person who appears obviously Coloured will not be classified as a White man even if he is generally accepted as a White man. Sir, there are very many dark people obviously accepted as White people, and that is why general acceptance was the test to which attention was directed in the original Act.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>At last we are getting it straight. In other words, that is change number one. A person who in the opinion of the Secretary, in the opinion of the officials responsible, is obviously a Coloured person in appearance, is going to be a Coloured person whether he is generally accepted as a White person by the community or not, and it is no use telling me that this is just to deal with the case of one Chinaman. This is going to have repercussions throughout South Africa. What inspector has this hon. Minister got who is such an expert that he can decide that a person in appearance is obviously a Coloured man if society accepts him as a White man? Sir, at the time when this original Act came before the House, I challenged the then Minister &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>General appearance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; with the support of that hon. member, judging by some of the noises he made&#x2014;I said that the Minister was trying to establish a stud-book without properly trained inspectors, and I got the approval of the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister wants to go on general appearance. If the hon. gentleman wants general appearance, then he must rule out general acceptance.</p>

<p>May I come back to the hon. the Minister. In other words, we are now to have a test, the test of general appearance, which is to overrule the acceptance of an individual by society as a White man. Sir, where is the individual, the trained expert, to whom the Minister can entrust that function? How dare he come along and say to us that where a man obviously appears to be a Coloured man, he is going to classify him as Coloured although society accepts him as a White man? It is no good his talking <span class="col_4451-4452" refersTo="page_0852"/>to me about the fact that there were false affidavits and things of that kind. Let him change the system of proof, if he likes; he can lay that down by regulation; that is nothing to worry about. The courts can decide whether a man is generally accepted as a White man or not, but here the Minister is taking the power to place some official or other or to place a board in charge, who is going to say that if a man by general appearance is Coloured, then it does not matter if he is accepted by society as a White man; that is a finding on fact and he is classified as a Coloured man. He may find that there are many families in which we know that there is Coloured blood. We who have lived in South Africa for a long time know the history of many of the old families here. We know that there are occasional throw-backs and that people appear who are obviously Coloured in appearance. Are they going to be classified as Coloured although society accepts them as Whites? Sir, the hon. gentleman is creating for himself more trouble to-day than he is avoiding. He is introducing a provision here which is a vicious provision, a provision which can be a cruel provision and one which makes us like this change even less than the original Act.</p>

<p>But then, Sir, there is a second change. Originally descent was of no importance at all. The tests were general appearance and general acceptance. That is well borne out by a question that I put to the hon. the Minister at the time in the course of the second reading debate; I said, &#x201C;What happens to the child of two people accepted and registered as White people; is that child necessarily White?&#x201D; and the reply was, &#x201C;the test is appearance and general acceptance&#x201D;. That was the reply. Descent played no part at all. Sir, we realized that the result was an elastic line, but the line had been elastic in South Africa for many hundreds of years; it was not possible to come along and change it overnight. We realized the difficulties involved in classification. We felt that the line had to be elastic because of the hardship involved and the consequences of classification, and we realized too, with the Minister, that classification could be impermanent because of that test, and we accepted that was so. The Minister himself has indicated here by his statement that classification can change when circumstances change as well. But what is the Minister doing now? He is abandoning that and he is introducing the element of descent by a back door in a somewhat clumsy, inexact and unscientific manner which it seems to me enables him to take advantage of the element of descent to the detriment of every applicant but never to his advantage. May I put to the hon. the Minister the position as I see it. No matter what the applicant looks like, no matter what his general acceptance&#x2014;he may be blond and blue-eyed, he may be generally accepted by society as a White man, but if he admits that by descent he is Coloured, then he is classified as a Coloured man. Genetics play very strange tricks. If the hon. the Minister wants to know about them I can send him to certain Coloured schools where he will see some very strange things, which will undermine many of his preconceived ideas as to tests, if they have not been undermined already as the result of his experience in administering this Act.</p>

<p>Sir, what is the position in which we are now? When is a man inclined to admit, when he may admit, by accident or otherwise, when may he admit without knowing properly what the legal consequences are, that he is Coloured by descent? You see, Sir, we are in this position now that if a man is obviously Coloured in appearance, and the Minister has established that, it does not matter that he is generally accepted as a White man; it does not matter that he can prove conclusively that there is not one drop of Coloured blood in his ancestors; he is going to be classified as a Coloured man. That is the effect of this Bill. It that what the Minister intended? Does he realize what he is doing? The man may look White, he may be accepted as a White man, but if it appears that he admits that he has some Coloured blood, if he says that by descent he knows he is a Coloured man, then he is Coloured; then he has admitted that by descent he is Coloured and he is classified as a Coloured man. He may be White in appearance; he may be generally accepted as a White man, but because he is an honest man he says, &#x201C;Yes, my grandmother or my grandfather was of mixed blood or was Coloured or came from St. Helena or was a Mauritian.&#x201D; We know the various difficulties and the various grades that one may have. In that case the Minister classifies him as a Coloured man and there is no option at all.</p>

<p>What are the consequences for the family? Supposing one brother admits that he is Coloured, what about the other brothers and sisters? Supposing a parent admits that he was Coloured, what about the family? Sir, the Minister does not know what he is doing scratching into cases of this kind. The moment descent is introduced, where does he end? I cannot understand how an hon. gentleman with the experience that he has had could take the risk of introducing a factor of this kind. When can you say that a person in honesty should admit that he has Coloured blood? It may be that his blood is one-quarter Coloured; it may be an eighth, it may be a half, it may be one-sixteenth or it may be one thirty-second. When is he a Coloured? The Minister says, &#x201C;unless it is established that the facts on which the admission was made are inaccurate&#x201D;. If it is established that the facts on which the admission was made are inaccurate, then of course the Minister is not going to accept that admission. But when does he not accept that admission? At what stage does he not accept it? Must he say, if there is any Coloured blood at all, that the admission is accepted? Because technically that person is Coloured; genetically there is Coloured blood in him. Sir, I wonder if the <span class="col_4453-4454" refersTo="page_0853"/>hon. gentleman realizes now what he has done. Mr. Speaker, what is the position now, where is the line going to be drawn, what are the results going to be? In the United States of America they had exactly this problem and they laid down when a person was a Negro and when he was not. I forget what percentage of negroid blood there had to be for a person to be a Negro.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>One-eighth, but my impression is that it varied from state to state. Now what test is the Minister going to apply here? What crueller test could the hon. gentleman apply than one of this kind? You see, Mr. Speaker, we would be against any change at all at this stage which was going to make things more difficult and which was going to result in a harsher application of this legislation which is anathema to us anyway, which we would like to see repealed anyway. But, Mr. Speaker, here you have an attempt to tighten up, to meet one or two exceptional cases, which in my opinion could be met very, very simply by a change in the regulations or a change in the proof required, and you could have gone on and at least you would have some measure of permanency. Where are you now?</p>

<p>The next point I want to come to is this: What is an &#x201C;admission&#x201D; for the purposes of this legislation? When does a man admit that he is a Coloured man or that he is a Native for the purposes of this Act? Is it sufficient if he admits that he has got a mixed birth certificate? Is that sufficient? There is going to be an investigation now. The Minister is taking powers, or the Secretary, to investigate, or to appoint somebody to investigate on his behalf, in respect of&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any matter in respect of which particulars are required to be recorded in the Register.</block>

<p>Well, one of the matters is &#x201C;race&#x201D;. So there can be an investigation into race. The Minister tells us that they are not going into descent in establishing race. But how can they avoid it? There is nothing in the Bill to prevent it, to prevent them going into the race of the individual concerned and going into his ancestry in order to establish his race. And we know through our experience during the last 12 years, despite the fact that general acceptance was the overwhelming test, how often the one problem with which we were faced was a mixed birth certificate, or a death certificate of someone who had been described as &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;, or a marriage certificate in which an individual had been described as being of mixed blood, and we knew always that was the first hurdle to overcome, and then you could get the other tests applied. But now where descent is a factor, what is to prevent the individual who is appointed to do the investigation to meet the gentleman concerned, whose classification is in doubt, and say to him, &#x201C;I have here a mixed birth certificate which represents that you are of mixed blood; do you admit it or don&#x2019;t you admit it? Is it yours?&#x201D; The answer is &#x201C;Yes, it is mine&#x201D;, without qualifications. Is that sufficient for the purposes of the Act? If there is a marriage certificate of his parents, in which one is described as of mixed blood, and he identifies that and admits that those people are or were his parents, that he is born of a marriage of people of mixed blood, of parents one of whom is of mixed blood, is that an admission for the purposes of this Act? Where do admissions begin and where do they end? The hon. the Minister has given the case of an individual who, having been accepted as a White person, admitted that he was purely of Chinese blood. Well, it seems to me that is a most exceptional case that could be dealt with in another way. What are you going to do if it comes to the question of classification, and the investigating officer is now appointed? Remember that he can force you to answer questions. Under the regulations if you don&#x2019;t answer his questions, you can be prosecuted. He says to you: &#x201C;What is your ancestry? I require that information, a birth certificate, a marriage certificate.&#x201D; He says: &#x201C;I have heard people say that one of your grandparents is Coloured. Do you admit it or not?&#x201D; Is that sufficient proof to make him Coloured for the purposes of this Act? Where are we going to?</p>

<p>Now comes the question of reclassification. The definition has been changed. I accept that where a person has had a decision of the Board, or a decision of the court, the original Act says that it is final and binding on the Director, now the Secretary. But where there has not been a decision by a court or a decision by the Board, and it is an ordinary classification, what is the position? The Minister himself told us here that there could be a change in a classification. He said so and he said it once before in this House, because circumstances may change. What happens now? At what point of time is the new definition going to be applied, and at what point of time does the old definition stop being applied? Is it the definition in force at the time you apply to be classified when you become 16 years old? Or is it a subsequent point of time? Because the hon. the Minister has told us now that he is accepting no new classifications until this Act has been passed. Now where are we? Suppose there is a challenge after the coming into operation of this Act. I may be wrong about this, I hope I am wrong. The Minister has given me an assurance that there will be no reclassification. I can&#x2019;t find a provision in the Bill to that effect. It seems to me there can still be reclassification.</p>

<p>I want to put to the hon. the Minister the next step in this matter. There are parents who are White under the old definition. They have a child which is now going to be classified under the new definition, and it may well be that under the new definition that child is classified as Coloured. Can you imagine what the result of that is going to be to family life, <span class="col_4455-4456" refersTo="page_0854"/>to their place in society, to what the world thinks of us in respect of matters of this kind? It seems to me that the hon. gentleman in coming with these provisions has overlooked the anguish that he can be causing, he has overlooked the human tragedies that can result from a Bill of this kind.</p>

<p>There is one further point. We have a change now in classification upsetting the whole studbook because apparently of one decision. The whole thing is being upset. The rules for admission are being changed because of one decision. Supposing somebody else found a loophole somewhere that the Minister does not like. Is it going to be changed again? Is the Population Register going to become something like the Group Areas Act which is being changed every year or two? And, Sir, when you have regard to the consequences, the social consequences, the economic consequences, the political consequences of a change in classification, of the differences as it affects different members of a family, then I feel that this is a terrible piece of legislation, a vicious piece of legislation. It is not a piece of legislation which should be passed by this House.</p>

<p>I go further. What is the object of this clause providing for powers for investigation? Surely the hon. the Minister and his Department has all the powers they require. Under Section 12 of the old Act, they have the right to demand further evidence in respect of any matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Director may require any person in respect of whom any particulars required for recording in the Register, have been furnished in any form or return received under the Census Act or in any form prescribed under Section 9, to furnish him evidence as to the correctness of any such particulars.</block>

<p>There is the power to demand that evidence must be furnished. But now he wants the right to investigate, to appoint someone who is going to conduct an investigation, who goes snooping round into the private lives of the person concerned, snooping round amongst his associates and finding out what the position is, whether everyone accepts him as White, or whether there are some who have doubts, and whether there are some who are not sure. Imagine the state of affairs! The person who does the snooping, the person who does the investigation may well keep quiet about his job, keep quiet about information he gleans. But imagine the effect on the person whom he interviews during his investigations! Can you imagine the effect on the social standing of the individual concerned?</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, we cannot accept that clause either, and I think there is only one amendment which is fitting in respect of this Bill and that is the amendment I now move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has very briefly touched on the background of this Bill, and he referred to the attitude of the United Party at the time of the passing of the original Act, I presume in 1950, when they found it objectionable. Now I do think the principle of registration, or of the division of the population into various groups, should not be under discussion at this stage. I presume that aspect was very well canvassed at the time of the passing of the Act. In any event, I do not consider that the Opposition with its announced policy of racial federations is entitled to oppose the registration of the different races. I should like to hear from them how they intend to put their ideas of racial federation into practice unless they have a system of population registration of the various races. According to their announced policy, the different races will have their different representatives in a common parliament, but it will be absolutely essential for their policy and in order to put it into practice, to have a system of registration of the various groups. So it would appear that the principle of registration of different population groups should be unanimously accepted by this House. The only point that could arise now is the definition of what is a White person and what is not. In that respect it is also a pity that the Opposition has not furnished us with their definition of a White person. Perhaps it would be easy for them to furnish us with a definition and we could then compare. If they could furnish us with a definition which is more acceptable, I am quite sure we would be pleased to accept it, because it is a most difficult definition to arrive at. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is quite correct when he says there is a change in the law. I believe that we are <i>ad idem</i> in regard to the interpretation as announced by the hon. the Minister namely that in future not only the acceptance by the White population as a White man is necessary, but also that in appearance he is not obviously a non-European. When one considers this amendment, then in view of the background of this Bill and the loopholes mentioned by the hon. the Minister, one cannot see any other way of defining a person as a White person, and I cannot see the hardship which could be caused by classifying a person who is obviously a non-European as a non-European. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated that an inspector could come along and he could go and classify any person as a non-European on appearance only, although he might be accepted by the European community as a White man, and this might create a severe hardship. He asked what experience these inspectors have. I want to point out that there is an appeal first of all to the classification Board, a board consisting of a senior magistrate or a Judge as chairman and two other members. From that Board there is not only an appeal, but a full hearing before a supreme court. The supreme court is entitled to call further evidence and to see the persons <span class="col_4457-4458" refersTo="page_0855"/>in person as has happened in the case in which Mr. Justice Snyman gave his recent judgment.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>They have to have regard to the law</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>Obviously when the Board considers a person who is obviously in appearance a Coloured person, they declare him a Coloured person in accordance with the law. If he is not satisfied he goes to the Appeal Court, and he appears personally before the Judge of appeal, and it is only when the Judge of appeal also considers this person to be obviously a Coloured person, that he is classified as Coloured. There can surely be no objection to that procedure, nor to the classification in that way.</p>

<p>There is the further point that was raised by the hon. Leader of the Opposition with regard to an admission that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person. As I see it, the person will have to answer not in detail, but if he is a person who honestly admits that he regards himself as a Native or a Coloured person, then he is so classified. Those are the questions I presume will be put to him, not what his grandparents were, or his father or his mother. The question is simply put to that person and his answer is final. There is no appeal, there is no investigation there. He admits himself that he regards himself as a Coloured person or a Native. Then surely there can be no hardship in classifying him as such a person.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I need not go further into the matter. I consider that the definition as it is now framed is a fair one and the only possible one to stop these loopholes. After all, the law must be effectively carried out and it must be so worded as to be effective. Otherwise, you might as well abandon the law, and as I have already stated, there should be unanimity on the point that race classification is essential in South Africa. I therefore support this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down raised a few points dealing with the Bill. I&#x2019;ll touch on the last point raised by him first. That is that he could not see the hardships which could be inflicted on people affected by the amendment we are now dealing with in regard to their race classification. In other words, he could not see the hardship that could be incurred by people who would be classified as non-Europeans when they apply for registration as White persons. He went on to say that various remedies are open to those people by means of appeals, ending up in the Appeal Court. I wonder if the hon. member realizes that in the vast majority of these cases, you are dealing with people of the working-class type, people who have by no means the money to face Appeal Court cases when fighting the Government. The Government takes these cases on principle right through to the Appeal Court. They don&#x2019;t want their laws upset, and they are almost bound to take them to the Appeal Court. But no private individual, and particularly the majority of these individuals, have the wherewithal to face these costs. They are already hard enough put to provide a decent home and decent living conditions for their families, without having this additional burden thrown on to them. So when it comes to a question of hardship, quite apart from the hardship of being classified (which I will deal with at a later stage) there is the financial hardship incurred right away. There is also another hardship, the hardship of the mental anguish which that family has to go through waiting for these various appeals to be settled. I personally dealt with many hundreds of cases coming under this particular ban&#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Hundreds?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, literally hundreds of cases, there are many which can never go forward. You can give them nothing and I want to say at the outset that as far as the staff of the Registrar&#x2019;s Offices are concerned, in dealing with these cases, they are very considerate. It is only fair to say that one meets the most sympathetic consideration and a most helpful attitude is generally adopted. So in any strictures, in any criticism I make, I am not referring to the staff whose job it is to carry out the law, but I am referring to the impracticability and the wickedness of the law itself. When the hon. member talks about the lack of hardship, I wonder if he has ever seen a father and mother, knowing the penalties which other Government legislation will apply to their family once they are classified as non-Whites, the bitter anguish they have to go through while waiting to know their fate. Because that is what it is, &#x201C;their fate&#x201D;. I would like the hon. member to think that over. These people are human beings, the same as we are; they are South Africans, the same as we are. They are part of the flesh and blood of us, every one of them part of the White race of this country. Our people, our forefathers, were responsible for them coming into being, the forefathers of both language groups. Let us face up to that. We can&#x2019;t shrug that off. We can&#x2019;t throw off our responsibility towards them as lightly as some people appear to want to do.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Surely they are classed as Natives?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I feel very strongly on this point. We are dealing primarily with the <span class="col_4459-4460" refersTo="page_0856"/>people whom we know as the Cape Coloured people. The question of the Bantu and the Hottentot or any other racial group does not enter into this. The Bill itself is directed mainly at the Cape Coloured people. It might be as well to refer back for a moment to the days of the passing of the original Act to get our minds quite clear as to what the purpose of the Act was. I want to refer to Hansard, Vol. 71, of 1950, Col. 2525, and I refer to the speech opening the debate on behalf of the Opposition by Gen. Smuts, in which the General said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think it is perfectly fair and justified to say that the real object of this Bill is to provide for the elimination of the Coloured people of this country from the Voters&#x2019; Roll. I go back to the speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister not so long ago, a few weeks ago at Paarl, in which he explained the policy of his Government and of his party, and he said that their policy in view of the dangers ahead, of the education of the Coloured people spreading in the country, and the increased number of Coloured people coming on the Voters&#x2019; Roll was that it was necessary for them to take action. This is the action that is now being taken. The whole object of this Bill is to provide by the law of the land a system by which quite easily, almost painlessly, the Coloured people can be taken off the Voters&#x2019; Roll and be deprived of the franchise they possess to-day. I think it cannot be denied that this is the real object of the Bill.</block>

<p>We want to get that in the back of our mind when we deal with the Bill now before us, because it removes many mistaken impressions of what the legislation was really intended to do. The Act is part of the framework of the Government&#x2019;s policy as it affects the country as a whole. That policy can be directed to assist in many ways the purpose and intention of this type of legislation, intention which was not so clearly expressed when the legislation was passed, as the operation of the Act now makes clear.</p>

<p>The amendments proposed in the Bill before us, particularly in respect of Clauses 1 and 4, concern the most intensely personal and private feelings of the people affected as it is possible to imagine, particularly the most private and intimate of human feelings the persons directly concerned have with regard to their own surroundings, the circle of friends they have built up, their own family and their own future. In considering the effect of these amendments, we are also bound to consider the direct penalties which apply as a result of other pieces of Government legislation and Government policies. Direct penalties which now follow automatically the classification in one or other race group&#x2014;either benefits or penalties. It is not possible to consider the amendments before us now divorced from these direct consequences which must follow decisions flowing from it. The racial classification which is governed by Clause 1 of this Bill, the racial classification under which a man or woman is registered as Coloured, completely governs amongst other things: The area in which they are allowed to live; it governs the possible employment in which a man can earn his living, as also his whole family; it governs the school in which his children can be educated; the standard of education they will be allowed to attain; whether they can or cannot attain university education, as we understand university education; it governs also the persons with whom he can associate, either in his work or in his daily ordinary domestic private life; it governs his entertainment, sport, recreation; the method and the class of travel to and from his work, and the very friends he can entertain in his own home. All these features, all these facets of human life are governed by the race classification under this particular clause, and I say that Parliament cannot consider the clause, unless we also take into account those penalties which apply in these cases. Because in the case of classification as a Coloured person, these are penalties which automatically come into operation. In fact it is not too much to say that the decision as to a person&#x2019;s race classification controls every aspect of that person&#x2019;s life and his family&#x2019;s life from the cradle to the grave. There again I just want for a moment to get the position clear that in introducing the Bill itself, the hon. Minister responsible for its introduction at that state, the present Minister of Finance, accepted that view. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any case this Bill makes provision for the introduction of a Population Register, and I deem it essential that we know at the outset what the basic principles of a Population Register are. A Population Register is actually a book containing the life story of every individual whose name is recorded on that register. It contains the most important facts relating to such a person. In some cases the life story of the individual is very short.</block>

<p>The Minister dealt with the case of a stillborn baby, and he then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other cases a long life history has to be recorded in that book. All those important facts regarding the life of every individual will be combined in this book and recorded under the name of a specific person, who can never change his identity. It is only when the last page in that book of life is written by an entry recording the death of such a person, that the book is closed and taken out of the gallery of the living and placed in the gallery of the dead.</block>

<p>Mr. Tighy, a late Member of Parliament, then interrupted him and said&#x2014;</p>

<p>It sounds like a funeral oration.</p>

<p>And the reply of the hon. Minister introducing the Bill was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4461-4462" refersTo="page_0857"/>That is the basic principle.</block>

<p>I wonder how many hundreds of Coloured families will not substantiate that last remark of the Minister&#x2019;s to-day. It has been the funeral of their hopes; the funeral of their aspirations; the funeral of all their hopes of building up a family life. That is what race classification has meant to hundreds of families. But how true was that remark of the Minister&#x2019;s when he introduced the Bill at that time. As I have already explained, it has meant the loss of rights and freedoms to which every decent living man is entitled to, no matter what his colour. It has meant the loss to him of certain basic human principles, human rights and human freedoms.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of this amending Bill proposes certain important changes in the qualifications by means of which a person will be classed either as White or non-White. In other words, it is providing for a fairly wide new definition of the method to be used in race classification. What flows from that clause really forms one of the basic principles of population registration. May I refer you back to the words of Gen. Smuts. And that is only one aspect of it, namely, the political aspect. There are many others which weigh far more heavily on the individual concerned than whether or not he has the franchise. The hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill, referred to the difficulties which were being experienced in dealing with race classification. When the 1950 Bill was before the House, Sir, the Government was warned with regard to that particular aspect but the Minister of the day shrugged it off. He said there would be no difficulties. I wish to refer to Hansard, vol. 71, pages 2531 and 2534. In dealing with the 1950 Bill Gen. Smuts referred to a Select Committee which had sat some years previously to inquire into the possibilities of establishing a national register and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Proper inquiry was made in 1935 and the result of that was that the Select Committee recommended that the Bill should not be proceeded with. Let me read to hon. members the findings of that committee which, in spite of what the Minister said, still applies very largely at the present time and in some respects applies even more forcibly to-day than they did at that time.</block>

<p>And I think we can endorse that even to-day, Sir. The principles which applied then, apply equally if not with more force to-day when we are facing this amending Bill. The General went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The committee said: &#x201C;Your committee having taken evidence on the question of the compilation of a national register referred to it, whilst conscious of the many advantages such a scheme might offer, if completely effective, finds, so far as the evidence laid before it goes, that the carrying out of such a scheme would be impracticable in South Africa.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Gen. Smuts then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That still holds good to-day and now more than ever, after all this apartheid nonsense has been started in South Africa.</block>

<p>As recorded on page 2534 he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are passing laws which we know will not be carried out and which will only lead to evasion and towards the creation of lawbreakers.</block>

<p>The very thing that the hon. the Minister tried to warn us about in his opening remarks. He referred to the difficulty they experienced in getting information to classify people correctly. He referred to affidavits upon which he cast certain doubts. Gen. Smuts went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think that all this probing into private affairs, this listening to informers, this effort to classify what is unclassifiable, what is impossible to achieve, will create a situation which will hit this country hard in years to come.</block>

<p>Indeed, Sir, we had a man of vision who was dealing with the Bill at that time, a man who foresaw the difficulties which are confronting us to-day, the difficulties which the Government is trying to overcome by the introduction of this amending legislation, the difficulties which have been besetting the officials who are charged with the carrying out of this legislation from the very day they started to carry out the provisions of the Act, the difficulties those officials have experienced in trying to achieve the impossible. We are dealing with human facets, Sir, human facets which cannot be dealt with by means of black and white rules and regulations in the form of legislation. We have to consider them from the human angle. They have to be considered with tolerance and sympathy and with the spirit of Christianity which we are all supposed to practise ourselves. I think that is the basic principle which should apply.</p>

<p>I tried to follow the opening remarks of the Minister as closely as I could, but he has not said a thing which to my mind in any way justifies the acceptance of this amending Bill. As my hon. Leader has already said, we stand committed to remove this Act from the Statute Book when we take over. We do not think it is workable. We believe there are ways and means of achieving with justice and fairness exactly what the Government is working for namely the preservation of the South African race as a whole. Only we will employ different methods; not by this type of method. There is not a law on our Statute Book to-day, not even including the Immorality Act, which has caused so much sheer misery, heart-break and sorrow in so many families in this country, as has this piece of legislation. And there is nothing in the amending Bill which will alleviate that position. In fact, Sir, it will worsen it. I think the opening remarks of the hon. the Minister completely justified the criticisms <span class="col_4463-4464" refersTo="page_0858"/>voiced by Gen. Smuts from this side of the House when the original Act was introduced in 1950. You can go right through the debates on the Bill at that time, Sir, and you will find statement after statement which completely fits the position into which the Government has got itself to-day. They find themselves in such a difficult position to-day that they have to come to the House with amending legislation in an attempt to find an easy way to do the impossible. They will not find it, Sir. Even if we accepted this Bill unanimously to-day, they will not find it except at the expense of the misery of hundreds and hundreds of more families in this country. This side of the House is not prepared to perpetuate that position.</p>

<p>I say that this law has done more to break down race relations between White and non-White in this country than any other piece of legislation. There is only one answer to this Bill and that is the answer given by the Leader of the Opposition, to have nothing to do with it. The parliamentary way of saying that is to move that the Bill be read this day six months. That means that the Bill is not worthy of consideration by Parliament it should be put on one side and forgotten as quickly as it is possible to forget it because it is such a bad piece of legislation.</p>

<p>Despite the very eloquent appeal which the Minister made in an attempt to justify the acceptance of this Bill, he has not made out any case. The Bill remains a wicked Bill which should not be accepted by the House. As I have said, this amending Bill deals with an Act which we are pledged to remove. Any attempt to amend it&#x2014;an attempt which in our opinion will make it worse&#x2014;is something which we cannot support. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister himself and many of those hon. members who have discussed this legislation&#x2014;maybe I am wrong in the case of the Minister because he has only recently been charged with it&#x2014;but I wonder if members who do not come into personal contact with the effects of this legislation on human beings, fully appreciate the real terror and fear which it arouses in people, particularly people with families. Those people think of how the future of their whole family is going to be damned practically forever as a result of this sort of legislation. I wonder whether hon. members opposite appreciate that? I have seen those people; I have spoken to them; I know what they feel like. I think it is one of the most bitter responsibilities which a Member of Parliament has to shoulder when he has to deal with those people. In many cases there is no hope for them. In terms of the existing legislation you cannot even try to alleviate their burdens. There it is, legislation passed by the House and you have to accept it. But that in no way justifies its existence. In many cases those people think of the penalties that will be inflicted on their children and their children yet to be born in the years to come. They know that once they have been put in this particular stud book&#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not worried about what the member thinks. I am dealing with this Bill from personal experience and not from political expediency as the hon. member is doing. I am dealing with it on the basis of the knowledge which I have acquired to my sorrow, of people who have suffered under this legislation. I am not prepared to perpetuate that position by means of any type of amendment such as we now have before us.</p>

<p>The Bill goes further. The Bill now proposes, under Clause 4, to introduce a system of investigators in regard to matters in respect of which particulars are required, particulars to be recorded in the register. In his opening remarks the hon. the Minister has given us what he feels is a form of guarantee that these investigations will be carried out discreetly and that they will endeavour to keep them as confidential as it is possible to do. Sir, these are things which cannot be kept confidential. These are things which you cannot keep under cover. Immediately an investigator asks a question of any one of the circle of friends, to whom he will have to go, you start a fire which you cannot put out. You will have started something in respect of which there was not the slightest suspicion in the mind of the person you have spoken to. I wonder again, Sir, whether the hon. the Minister realizes that, no matter how carefully such an inquiry is carried out, that the suspicion it raises, that the mud it stirs up, can never wholly disappear. Can the Minister imagine a family which has built up a happy home; they have their circle of friends in the <span class="col_4465-4466" refersTo="page_0859"/>area in which they live, friends who have accepted them as White people. They live a White standard of living. They behave as decent White people. Their children are accepted in White educational establishments. They live the accepted life of a White person. There is no justification in any shape or form to change it. Then suddenly the investigator comes along and asks one of their friends to substantiate that Mr. A or Mrs. B are indeed White. We know what human nature is like, Sir. Once such a question is asked you plant the seed of doubt and how long does it take for that little seed to grow as far as these things are concerned? How long can people survive that blast of suspicion? They may never hear a word of verbal criticism but it is there. Even under the method which has been employed hitherto where that person could go to a personal friend of his own choice and ask him for a certificate, where he could go to somebody in an official position such as his Member of Parliament or his Provincial Councillor his employer or Minister, people who normally forget such a thing as being confidential once they have done it. How many families whose race classification has ultimately been accepted as White, have been driven out of their surroundings by the inquiries made. Have had to move elsewhere rather than to continue to tolerate the looks and suspicions of their friends, those friends amongst whom they have lived formerly, have had to move elsewhere as a result of the inquiry which they themselves have had to institute. People have come to me, Sir, and asked me: &#x201C;In God&#x2019;s name, have I to go to somebody whom I have known for the last 20 years as a personal friend and now go to ask him to say that I am White.&#x201D; What would we do if we were placed in that position? I wonder what the hon. the Minister would do? I wonder what I would do? Can we be surprised at the antagonism which has grown up amongst the Coloured people towards us as a result of what has been perpetrated against them?</p>

How can you justify it on the basis of your Christian belief, Sir, the Christianity which hon. members profess to believe in? It is completely un-Christian. It falls below the standard accepted for normal civilization. I could quote from Hansard, but I do not intend taking up the time of the House by doing so. But I can quote from Hansard where Gen. Smuts warned this country when the original Bill was introduced and said that this particular measure would bring us into disrepute overseas, that it would bring bitterness and bad feeling towards South Africa. How well his warning has been justified. How would we like to have this sort of thing imposed upon us as individuals, Sir. No matter how sympathetically or how humanely it is done, how would we like to be subjected to it? Those people have just as much right to a decent life as we have. They have just as much right to security as we have. They have just as much right to their own dignity and their own family feelings as we have.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F.KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>When we discuss such a delicate matter as the classification of races, we ourselves have to approach it calmly, and <span class="col_4467-4468" refersTo="page_0860"/>not get as heated about it as the hon. member did who just resumed his seat. The difficulty is that when it comes to very complicated issues such as, for example, the classification of races, there will always be hard and difficult cases. But the principle that we should have a population register was accepted by this hon. House in 1950. That was accepted and the principle laid down, and to-day the law has to be carried out and administered. The trouble is that hon. members of the Opposition are not prepared to accept that principle. As the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) has just said, it is their intention to remove that Act from the Statute Book if they should get into power. They are not prepared to accept the principle of race classification, and all the objections which they have raised this afternoon against this amending Bill stem from that.</p>

<p>I do not wish to go into the principle of this matter. I do not think that is relevant. We are dealing here with an amending Bill. The question of the classification of races is dealt with in Clause 1 of this Bill and, before the National Party came into power, before 1948, hon. members of the Opposition were in favour of the classification of races. As late as January 1948 the provincial councils instructed the administrators of the provinces to approach the then Prime Minister, Field-Marshal Smuts, with the request that a national register of races should be compiled, irrespective of their colour. That national register would not have been anything else but a population register; it could not have envisaged anything else but the classification of races as is envisaged to-day under the existing legislation. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I merely wish to point out that the Opposition have undergone changes in respect of the principle which was accepted and, because the United Party have changed since 1948 as far as the principle is concerned, they are raising these objections to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the first amendment contained in this amending Bill deals with the definition of a White person, and the new definition as contained in Clause 1 (a) (b) is in spirit the same as the original definition, except for the addition of a few words in (b) at the end of Clause 1. The only new words which are incorporated in the present definition are the following words in (b) &#x201C;&#x2026; and is not in appearance obviously not a White person.&#x201D; Before I go further I just wish to say that neither this definition which we have here to-day, nor any future definition nor the original definition, is or will be acceptable to hon. members opposite. We will never be able to satisfy them in respect of any definition. When the original definition was laid down they raised the same objections, they saw the same ghosts, they saw the same dangers. All they are doing to-day is simply to repeat them. We heard the same tearful stories which we heard when the original definition was before this House.</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, blood and tear stories. The two basic principles on which the definition is founded remain the same. The first is whether a White person is in appearance obviously White; and the second is a White person is somebody who is generally accepted as a White person. These two principles still form the crux of the new definition. In the original definition, however, the first principle was qualified. It read that a White person was somebody who in appearance was obviously a White person, with this qualification: But who does not pass for a Coloured. The second principle, namely the acceptance was not qualified, and what we are now doing is to qualify the second principle as well namely that a person who is generally accepted as a White person is a White person provided he is not in appearance obviously a non-White.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised an objection this afternoon and said that, in terms of the present amendment to the definition, the conception of appearance will supersede the conception of acceptance; the conception of appearance will carry more weight, according to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, than the conception of acceptance. He gave us an example: the case of a person with Coloured blood in his veins who admitted in all honesty that his grandmother or great-grandmother was of mixed descent&#x2014;was a Coloured from St. Helena He said that would be the end of it; in that case such a person would be classified as non-White. But the hon. the Minister said a minute ago that in such a case, where a person passed as and was accepted as a White person, and who appeared to be non-White, and was classified as a non-White, all that was required was to produce proof and lead evidence as to the principle of acceptance. All that has to be done in such a case is to produce proof that person, in spite of the fact that he acquired non-White blood in his veins generations ago, is, nevertheless, accepted by the Whites and the community as a White person, and in that case the principle of acceptance applies.</p>

<p>If he admits it, there is still a legal provision that evidence can be led to the effect that his admission was incorrect. The fact of the matter is that a person who is generally accepted as a White person, and who is accepted by the community as a White person, and who looks like a non-White person, will be classified as a White person.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F.KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with paragraph (b) of the clause, and the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) knows nothing about it. He should rather keep his mouth shut; he should go and swim. The point which I wish to make very clearly is <span class="col_4469-4470" refersTo="page_0861"/>that we are dealing with the crux of the matter, namely that when a person alleges that he is accepted as a White, and a blind man can see that he is not a White person, he is certified as a non-White. If in appearance he is obviously a non-White, he gets classified as a non-White. But, in spite of that, evidence can still be led that, although this uncle looks as dark as he does, and, although his hair is as short as it is, he has been accepted all these years as a White person, and if that evidence as to acceptance is sufficiently substantial, he is classified as White. But in that event the evidence as to acceptance must be substantial, and we do not object to that. [Interjections.] I do not expect all hon. members to understand it. When it comes to classifying border-line cases the deciding factor remains the principle of acceptance. The principle remains the same as that enunciated at the time by the Minister of the Interior when he moved the second reading of this Act and when he said the test to be applied under the Act would be the opinion of the person&#x2019;s fellow citizens, the test of appearance and the society he moved in. That remains the dominant principle in the present Bill.</p>

<p>Objections which were lodged in the past in respect of the classification of people, objections based on descent have never been taken into account in the case of appeals. As a result of that problems have recently arisen, all bounds of reasonableness have been exceeded and that is why a firmer attitude is being adopted in the present amendment in respect of the principle of acceptance as well as that of descent. Firstly, in respect of descent in as much as if the person himself admits that he is of non-White descent and he is a non-White, his word is taken for it subject to the proviso of which the Minister has just given notice and which he will move at a later stage. That, Sir, is the new approach as far as the principle of descent is concerned. Except if he himself admits that he is of non-White descent, a person&#x2019;s descent will not be investigated otherwise. The change which is made in respect of acceptance is that embodied in the amendment in Clause 4 (b) where the Secretary is now being empowered to conduct an investigation either himself or through somebody else into the details which are necessary for his register in respect of the classification. Previously the Secretary also had the power to seek certain information but he could only seek specific information on specific forms and any information that could not be obtained by means of the questions in those forms, were on appeal regarded by the courts as being irrelevant. The Secretary is now given the right either personally or through somebody duly authorized by him, to conduct an investigation into the <i>bona fides</i> of the evidence which is led on appeal when there is a dispute as to a person&#x2019;s classification. He can send somebody out, not to start a witch hunt and find out who was the grandmother or grandfather of somebody, or whom he is courting, but to ascertain whether the evidence which is submitted to the Board of Appeal or the Court is correct. He can go further and gain information and submit it to the Appeal Court or to the Supreme Court to refute the evidence which has been submitted. He will also be entitled to investigate anything else which may be a deciding factor as to how a person should be classified, provided it is in connection with the principle of general acceptance, as the Minister has said, and not in connection with origin or descent. Although the attitude was originally adopted that objections which were based on descent and blood should not be taken into account when the two main principles of appearance or general acceptance were in favour of the applicant, the Minister foresaw the difficulties which that would cause in future when he introduced the legislation. He said in 1950 that for the time being that easy definition could be accepted, but even at that time he foresaw that it would be difficult to adhere to that easy definition. His words at the time were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The test which is laid down in the Act is the opinion of fellow-citizens, but I am afraid that we are gradually moving in a direction as far as these borderline cases are concerned, where we will in future no longer be in the position to accept this practical and easy test, but that it will be necessary to apply a more difficult test as to descent, as is the case in America.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are not going so far to-day as to apply a test of descent but I just want to tell the House that the then Minister foresaw the difficulty that this easy test would not stand the test of time. The classification of borderline cases is a very difficult and delicate problem and very wide in its scope. In 1959 the Minister of the Interior said that in respect of the Cape Province alone there were 60,000 doubtful cases which had to be investigated and classified. The Department tackled that onerous task and I submit that once the Department started to investigate those 60,000 cases, they found that in the case of the Cape Province alone, the number had doubled, because the one leads to the other. But the Department acted with the greatest possible circumspection and compassion. They tackled that onerous task and they dealt with those 60,000 and more cases so that only a small percentage is left to-day which has not been classified, and in respect of the decisions they had made, only 3,593 objections were lodged, as we were told to-day. During the entire 12 years this easy test has worked quite well until last year <span class="col_4471-4472" refersTo="page_0862"/>when people saw in this Act an opportunity to concern themselves with things which were not in the interests of the composition and structure of our nation.</p>

<p>As the Minister said on a previous occasion the officials had definite instructions at the time to treat the public as sympathetically as possible and to be as accommodating as possible and we have irrefutable proof that the officials and the Department have acted in that spirit. The Minister has referred to the previous member for Salt River (Mr. Lawrence). I think I should tell the House what the hon. member for Salt River said. He said this in 1960&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to say at the outset that my experience has been that the Minister is administering the Population Registration Act sympathetically and compassionately and that his approach to his duty is a human one and I would not be quite honest if I did not say to-day that I have no complaint against the Minister&#x2019;s administration of the Act.</block>

<p>He did not only say that in respect of the Minister&#x2019;s actions, but also in respect of those of the officials. In 1959 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My experience has been that in a whole number of these cases the Minister&#x2019;s officials have been exceedingly helpful.</block>

<p>And that is true. The officials went out of their way in these difficult cases to treat the people humanly and to help them with their problems. I just want to give a few examples to illustrate how the Department went out of its way to help in those difficult cases of classification. As you know, Sir, Section 5 (3) of the Act provides for re-classification. Even where cases had been finalized and new evidence becomes available to it the Department re-opened the case in terms of that Section and decided in favour of the applicant on the strength of the new evidence. But they went further. After they had made the classification they informed the person concerned in writing. That is not expected of them in terms of the law, but they notified the person in writing that he had been classified as such and such but that he had the right of appeal and that such and such was the procedure he had to follow in order to appeal. The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) asked with tears in his eyes what was the use of a right to appeal because there were poor people who did not have the money to go to court. The Department even thought of that and the Minister said that arrangements had been made in respect of those cases where the people were poor in that where a case went to court and the person could not pay an advocate could act for them <i>pro deo</i> so that justice could be done without any cost to them. We have proof throughout that this Board of Appeal which the Minister has brought into being has treated every case most humanely and with the greatest possible circumspection on its merits. We had evidence from the Minister to-day that of 279 appeal cases 233 were decided in favour of the appellant. Mr. Speaker, I have said that when it comes to a matter such as this, when it comes to the administration of this type of legislation, you will always come up against difficult cases. But the fact remains that the principle of the law was accepted in 1950 and we cannot again discuss it to-day; and the Opposition is not prepared to adopt the attitude that this principle has been accepted and that this is a question of carrying out the law in which they have to assist. But in spite of that we will continue to carry out the law sympathetically as we have done in the past and people like the former member for Salt River will continue to be grateful to us but on the other hand there will always be those people who will try to avail themselves of the opportunity of raising fear, stirring up feelings, people who act like political vultures in circumstances such as these in order to make political capital out of the sorrow of families. That is why I say this last mentioned group is beyond redemption and we have to ignore them when it rests on our shoulders to carry out the law.</p>

<p>I wish to associate myself with the eloquent and well-reasoned speech made by the Leader of the Opposition and with the amendment moved by him. Despite the assurances given by the hon. the Minister of the Interior this afternoon, I am strongly of opinion that this Bill will have the effect of causing greater misery and more hardship to those unfortunate citizens who at the moment are on the racial borderline in this country and who up to now do not know officially whether they will be classified in terms of the law as Coloured or White citizens. I go even further and say that the provisions of this Bill not only seriously affect those people whose cases are presently pending, but I am of opinion very firmly that this Bill is likely to affect a very large number of our citizens who, on investigation, may have to admit that they are by descent Coloured persons. In my view the consequences of this wholly unnecessary Bill are extremely difficult to estimate and I am certain the Minister of the Interior himself has not been able to gauge the harm that this Bill may do to the citizens of our country. I am certainly convinced that the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;), who does not appreciate the fundamental distinctions which this Bill seeks to introduce, cannot possibly appreciate the great harm which this new definition may do to thousands of people in this country. I take the very serious view that this Bill will do untold misery and hardship to a large number of our citizens. I repeat that the observations I make here do not only apply to the many cases still outstanding where people still do not know what their future destiny will be <span class="col_4473-4474" refersTo="page_0863"/>in our racial set-up, but the Bill is likely to be used against many of our citizens who up to the present have escaped the effects of the Act. The sword of Damocles has hung sufficiently long over the heads of countless law-abiding people in this country and there seems to me to be no reason at all why we should extend the numbers who fall within the ambit of this new definition now proposed by the Minister.</p>

<p>For the benefit particularly of the hon. member for Parow. I want to deal with the definition now proposed by the Minister and compare it with the present definition in the existing Act. This Bill seeks to amend the definition of the term &#x201C;White person&#x201D; in the Act. If one refers to Section 1 of the original Act, the definition of a White person is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person who in appearance obviously is or who is generally accepted as a White person, but does not include a person who, although in appearance obviously is a White person, is generally accepted as a Coloured person.</block>

<p>On the face of it, this definition may seem to be somewhat confusing, but it has been generally interpreted by our courts and by the Minister&#x2019;s own Department as meaning that a person is entitled to be classified as White if in appearance he is obviously White and is not generally accepted as a Coloured person, and if he is generally accepted as White. Under the existing definition, that is the interpretation given to it. In other words, under the existing definition evidence of acceptance as a White person is the decisive and determining factor. I want to impress that upon this House. Under the proposed amendment the Minister seeks to change the existing definition so as to make appearance the domining factor. [Interjections.] That is what the Minister himself said this afternoon. The Minister now seeks to change that existing definition and to make appearance the dominating factor. Sir, I say that this is a very dangerous step indeed. If appearance is to be the important factor from now on. I say we are treading on very dangerous ground.</p>

<p>But it was the dominating practice previously also.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>No. I have explained it, if the hon. member would only listen, that if a man was generally accepted as a White person he could be classified as White. That was the dominating factor. I only want to repeat what the Minister himself said this afternoon. If our system of race classification is now to be changed as I envisage it under this new definition so as to make appearance the dominating factor, many additional citizens of this country who are on the racial borderline&#x2014;and let us admit that there are many of them&#x2014;will now have the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads as well as those unfortunate people who are still waiting to hear the outcome of their applications. Their racial classification will now depend on the impression which their appearance makes upon the officials who will be charged with carrying out this race classfication under the new definition. To my mind, this will make the task of those unfortunate officials even more difficult and more disagreeable than it is at present.</p>

<p>But apart from this aspect, I say that this is a very dangerous innovation. I say that grave mistakes have been made in cases where appearance was the determining factor. When the original Bill came before the House in 1950, in the course of a speech I then made I quoted to the House instances which had come to my knowledge in my professional and public capacity, instances of extreme hardship which caused a great deal of misery to the people concerned, instances where appearance was the dominating factor in determining whether a man was White or Coloured. It is parhaps not inapproriate, for the benefit of some of the younger members, that I should repeat some of the examples I quoted then.</p>

<p>I recall the case where a man was forcibly ejected from the White enclosure at the Newlands rugby ground on the allegation that he was a Coloured man and not entitled to be there. His appearance was the dominating factor which decided the officials to have him ejected from the White enclosure, because he looked like a Coloured man. He took action against the W.P. Rugby Union for having been forcibly ejected in public, and you can imagine, Sir, the invidious position in which the W.P. Rugby Union found itself when it was discovered that this man&#x2019;s own brother was refereeing the principal rugby match being played that afternoon.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was. It was only through the intervention of Mr. Justice Jones, the president of the Rugby Union, who had to make the most abject apology on behalf of the Union, that I was able to prevail upon this man to forego his action. That is one of the instances showing how dangerous it is to judge a man by appearances only.</p>

<p>I recall another tragic case of a young school-boy of 12 years of age, who hanged himself in his parents&#x2019; kitchen out of sheer desperation and frustration because he was refused the right to attend a White school because in appearance he looked Coloured. At the inquest, where I appeared professionally for the family concerned, the evidence revealed that this boy&#x2019;s own blood sister was a pupil at that very school to which he was refused admission. That is another instance of how dangerous it is for a man&#x2019;s classification to be determined merely on appearances.</p>

<p>Sir, if these cases have not made any impression on hon. members opposite, I want to recall another very unfortunate incident, where a member of this House, judged merely on appearances, was refused the tenancy of a flat in Sea Point which was reserved for Whites only. I mention this again as an example of the very dangerous ground upon which we are <span class="col_4475-4476" refersTo="page_0864"/>treading if the hon. the Minister pursues his new definition to make appearance the dominating factor in regard to a man&#x2019;s race classification. I have mentioned these instances as examples of how dangerous it is to make appearance the dominating factor. I regard the Minister&#x2019;s new definition as a retrogressive step. [Interjection.] Sir, if the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) will give me an opportunity I can proceed. If he wants me to do so I can sit down and let him make the speech. I was saying that I regard this new definition of the hon. the Minister, in all seriousness, without any political implications being involved in this matter, as a retrogressive step.</p>

<p>But all these hardships took place under the old definition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I say that you are going to aggravate these hardships under this new definition where appearance is going to be the dominating factor. Under the existing definition, evidence of acceptance as a White man was decisive. This definition is now being altered so as to make appearance the dominating factor. I say that this will open the door very wide indeed and is likely to affect a considerable number of otherwise law-abiding citizens of this country. I think it is appropriate that we should bear in mind the fact that there are many people on the racial border-line who have not yet been told whether they are going to be classified as White or as Coloured. The numbers make no difference. I am at variance with the hon. the Minister as to the numbers that he quoted, but I think that the numbers make no difference. It does not matter whether there are a few hundred concerned or a few thousand concerned. There are many now who are still awaiting the Department&#x2019;s decision as to whether they are to be classified as White or Coloured. This new definition, which makes appearance the dominating factor, will to my mind increase substantially the number of unfortunate citizens who will have to be re-classified. You can imagine the humiliation and misery which this is going to bring to those unfortunate people, who have committed no crime at all other than the fact that they may possibly have an admixture of Coloured blood going back a couple of generations. That is the only crime that these unfortunate people committed. I ask the hon. the Minister in all conscience: Is it necessary to inflict any further hardship upon these unfortunate people? We were told in a report which was made by the Controller and Auditor-General and which was tabled in this House a few days ago, that since the start of race classification in 1950 an amount of R3,573,892 has been spent by the Population Registration Office. Sir, to what purpose has this money been spent? To my mind all that has been achieved by spending this vast sum of money, is the elimination from the White group, in the most humiliating fashion, of law-abiding citizens who were on the racial border-line and who were doing nobody any harm. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us what possible harm can result if some of these border-line cases, even some of the doubtful cases, succeed in their endeavour to be classified as White people under the existing definition. I say that under the new definition the hon. the Minister is going to restrict even more the facilities that these people will have of trying to be classified as White people. Many of these people have lived and have been accepted as White people in this country despite the fact that in the dim and distant past their birth certificates may have read that they are descended from mixed parents. How would anyone in this House&#x2014;and I say this with the greatest respect to everybody in this House&#x2014;how would anyone in this House feel if he were suddenly summoned to appear before a Government official for racial re-classification because an ancient birth certificate read that he is descended from mixed parents. To my mind, leaving out the question of appearance for the moment, the Minister in his new proposal is making the definition even more restricted than the existing one. Generally the law should tend towards the liberty of the subject; here the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s definition is restricting, more than the existing definition, the liberty of the subject. I have shown how the dominating factor under the Minister&#x2019;s new definition is going to be appearance whereas previously it was general evidence of acceptance as a White person. That was generally accepted and was decisive. But, Sir, the evil does not stop there. There is an even more dangerous element being introduced by the hon. the Minister in his new definition of a White person, because as I read the new definition a person who is not in appearance obviously not a White person and who is accepted in the society in which he moves as a White person, may nevertheless be classified as a Coloured person if he admits that he is Coloured by descent. The hon. the Minister has said that in as many words; I have perhaps put it more concisely, but the hon. the Minister will admit that he has said that a man who, although in appearance is obviously a White person and who is accepted in society as a White person, may be re-classified as a Coloured person if he perchance admits that he is of Coloured descent. To my mind this is a wholly unnecessary provision, but I go further and say it is a dangerous provision. Sir, we cannot appreciate the serious consequences which this provision may bring in its wake. What does the hon. the Minister <span class="col_4477-4478" refersTo="page_0865"/>mean by &#x201C;descent&#x201D;? How far does he intend going back with this witch-hunt? Is it intended, for instance, that an admixture of Coloured blood on the paternal side or the maternal side of any of our citizens, say two or three generations ago, will render that citizen a Coloured person instead of a White person if he admits that admixture of Coloured blood? I mention this as an example of the dangerous ground upon which we are treading. Does the hon. the Minister realize how easy it will be now for poison-pen letter writers and for unscrupulous informers to advise the Population Registrar that in the dim and distant past a respected and law-abiding citizen of this country had an admixture of Coloured blood on the side of some of his forebears. If he admits that, he will have to be classified under the new definition as a Coloured man. Again I want to ask the hon. the Minister: To whom is it intended that this admission of descent should be made? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has put some very pertinent questions to the hon. the Minister. I should like to know to whom it is intended that this admission of descent should be made? Is it intended that the citizen should be obliged to make the admission to the Population Registrar or to any of its officials, or is it intended that the mere admission will be binding if it was made in an unguarded moment to a fellow-citizen? Will that be an admission sufficient to justify a man being declared a Coloured person? Or is it intended that the admission has to be made under oath? No. Sir, the more one examines the proposed amendments, the more does one realize how utterly complicated this issue becomes. At present the definition of a White person varies from Act to Act passed by this Parliament. These definitions are such that for the purposes of one Act a citizen may be regarded as a White person and under another Act he is regarded as a Coloured person. The present definition which the Minister has submitted to this House for consideration to-day will complicate the matter even further, because there he is going to be judged either by appearance as the dominating factor or by an admission of descent in the circumstances which I have just described, which is in conflict with most of the definitions under the other Acts to which I have referred. I say that the present Bill will tend to make the definitions of a White person even more variable than they are at present, and I am inclined to the view that it will create greater misery and bring more hardships upon our unfortunate citizens&#x2014;much more than they have had to suffer up to now. I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that when the original Population Registration Act was introduced in 1950, his predecessor, the present Minister of Finance, claimed that the Act was an essential instrument of the policy of apartheid. We know that is so. He then stated that the object of race classification in this country was that there should be some easy means available for proving the particular race of citizens where such proof was required in carrying out the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid. Later the same hon. Minister, when his attention was drawn to the great misery and hardship which was inflicted upon a large section of the population in administering this Act said that the Act was required for &#x201C;administrative purposes only&#x201D; and that he would issue specific instructions to the officials of his Department to apply the Act in a humane way. I think it is appropriate that I should mention the actual words used by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor in office. These were his words&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>It has often been quoted here that Mr. Harry Lawrence quite conscientiously said that officials duly gave effect to what the Minister had instructed them to do, namely to apply this Act in a humane way. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s immediate predecessor. Mr. Tom Naude, also declared in this House that instructions had been given to the officials to deal with all cases in the most humane manner possible, without inflicting unnecessary misery or hardship upon any of our citizens. I want to say this in fairness to the present hon. Minister. I was very glad indeed to hear from him this afternoon that he had no intention whatsoever of altering those instruction and that he would perpetuate those instructions that even under this new definition the officials were to carry out their duties in as humane a manner as possible. I personally was very glad to hear that assurance, but I want to say this to the hon. the Minister that Ministers come and go; we do not know whom may succeed the Minister. Moreover, officials come and go; we do not know what the future trend is going to be. But apart from that I say that the official&#x2019;s task of administering the act humanely will become a more onerous and difficult one if the question of descent is now going to be introduced to complicate the issue. In the circumstances, therefore, I would appeal to the hon. the Minister not to proceed with this definition, but even if he is to proceed with it, to amend it in such form that descent will not be a factor that will be taken into account, even on the admission of any unfortunate citizen who has to be brought before the Population Registrar. Sir, I repeat: What does it matter if by chance a Coloured person, a doubtful case, becomes classified as a White person? Does it mean the downfall of our Republic? Does it put an end to our Western civilization in this country if it so happens that one or a dozen or a hundred Coloured people perchance become classified as White people where they are borderline cases? Is it such a terrible thing? On the other hand, look at the misery and the hardship inflicted on these <span class="col_4479-4480" refersTo="page_0866"/>people. For generations they and their families have been accepted as White people, and in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s new definition they are to be re-classified because by appearance they are obviously Coloured or because they admit to an admixture of Coloured blood going back a few generations. The hon. the Minister spoke this afternoon of just under 4,000 cases awaiting re-classification. I am of the opinion that by extending the definition on the lines indicated in this Bill, the hon. the Minister is opening the door to many more thousands of our citizens coming up for reclassification if they are to be judged solely by appearance and descent. I would remind the hon. the Minister that a survey was made by the S.A. Institute of Race Relations a couple of years ago as to the number of possible cases that would fall into the borderline category, and the conclusion that was arrived at was that as little as 1 per cent of the population might be affected. This seems a very small figure when taken in terms of percentage, but in numbers it would mean that nearly 140,000 of our South African citizens might have to suffer the humiliation and indignity of having to go through the process of racial classification under this new definition. All these people, to my mind, will have the sword of Democles hanging over their heads and will live in fear that their ancestry is being investigated, with the constant danger that they may be re-classified as Coloured people. I say that there is no necessity at all of inflicting any further misery upon so many of our law-abiding citizens. In any event, in view of the tremendous adverse criticism which South Africa has received from the outside world and which unfortunately we are still receiving, is this the time for the Government to come along with a further ridiculous definition, which already has made this country the laughing-stock of the world. Sir, it is this type of legislation that continues to make us the laughing-stock of the world. Surely in the light of present-day circumctances the Government should do everything in its power to reduce the internal suffering in this country and the world ridicule which has been brought about very largely by the tortuous apartheid laws, of which this is one, introduced by this Government, and particularly the ridiculous race classification definition which this Government has brought forward from time to time. It is this crude type of definition, this crude type of classification, that has exposed us to the derisive laughter of the rest of the world. If the Government feels that it is essential, in giving effect to its policy of apartheid, that there should be definitions of race and distinctions between man and man in this country, then it is in the interest of South Africa that those definitions should be as simple and as unambiguous and as flexible as possible. We should not aggravate our definitions, whereby different criteria apply under different Acts. One set of criteria is being applied under the Group Areas Act, another under the Population Registration Act, another under the Cape Education Ordinance&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>We are seeking to amend the old definition, and I ask the hon. member who interrupted what is wrong with the definition which lays down that an individual who is generally accepted as a White person should be classified as a White person for the purposes of this Act. I say that we should not aggravate the situation in this country.</p>

<p>Some years ago the then Minister of the Interior, realizing how absurd the situation was becoming in this country, was obliged to appoint a special inter-departmental committee to investigate whether it was possible to arrive at a common definition of the various racial groups for the purposes of all legislation. I am sure that the present Minister knows of the appointment of that committee. In due course that committee reported to the Government, but the task was really beyond its powers. You cannot define for all possible laws who is a White man and who is not a White man. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister is in a position to enlighten this House as to whether any progress has been made in that connection. All we know is that there are many cases where families have been broken up, where the education of children has been disrupted and where jobs have been lost through conflicting definition and classification under these different Acts. This Bill to my mind, will aggravate that unfortunate position. Sir, I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has read it, but I would really commend this to his very serious attention: There was a fact-finding report entitled &#x201C;Race Classification in South Africa and its effect upon human beings,&#x201D; which was issued some years ago by the S.A. Institute of Race Relations. If the hon. the Minister pays attention to that report he will realize how thousands of human beings in this country are deeply hurt and humiliated under our system of race classification and under our definitions. I say that the definition that the Minister envisages in the present Bill will aggravate that indignity and that degradation. I am convinced that this Bill, far from ameliorating the position that I have described will aggravate it. I can see no reason whatsoever, particularly at this difficult time in our country&#x2019;s history, for the Government to introduce an amending Bill of this nature which introduces a new definition which is much more restricted than the present definition. Some little time ago there appeared an excellent leader in the <i>Burger</i> in which the leader-writer of the <i>Burger</i> said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4481-4482" refersTo="page_0867"/>While we plead for constructive co-operation from the Coloureds in the days ahead, we ask the authorities in equal seriousness for imaginative action to forge new links of understanding and co-operation between White and Coloured. Let everything which the agitator can seize of and which can be removed, be removed with the utmost speed, for future race relations in the Cape are at stake as never before.</block>

<p>I can hardly imagine anything worse being placed in the hands of the agitators than this new definition proposed by the hon. the Minister. I can hardly imagine anything militating more against better race relations than the Minister&#x2019;s proposal in this Bill. For those reasons I propose to support the amendment moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Before replying to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, I just want to say a few words with reference to what the Leader of the Opposition said here this afternoon. He stated that they were opposed to the original Act of 1950; that the Opposition opposed that Act &#x201C;because you cannot classify what cannot possibly be classified&#x201D;. The last speaker also said that there was a commission of inquiry and that they also found that race classification was not possible. The Leader of the Opposition is the leader of a party which wants to introduce race federation in South Africa. If they want to introduce a race federation in South Africa, they must surely at some time or other have a race classification. My submission is that in this definition, as in the old definition, an attempt is being made at race classification. It is no use that party saying that they want to introduce a race federation if they cannot make a race classification. It is pure political hypocrisy to come here to-day with hard luck stories.</p>

<p>Then I withdraw the word: I abide by your ruling, but I want to say this: It will not avail the United Party to go to the electorate with all these hard luck stories, as they did here to-day. It will not avail them to mention all these tragedies, these cases of blood and tears. This is not the only law which causes blood and tears. The whole statute book, big as it is, causes difficulty, causes hurt and misery. This Act will also cause hurt and misery, but it will not avail the United Party in this particular case to hold up all the harm and misery which will flow from this Act in order to condemn what the Government is trying to do here in all honesty. They themselves want a racial federation; they themselves want to institute a race classification, but they have not the courage of their convictions to draft that race classification and to tell us how they want the definition to read. I challenge the hon. Leader of the Opposition to take this definition and also the one in the principal Act and to tell us how he will improve on them when he has to make his race classification for his so-called race federation. He cannot do it; he will never be able to do it. I have in my hands an article written by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M.

<p>In his article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> he said that they would not repeal this Act but would only apply it in a better way. Those were the words he used. They want a racial federation. I now ask them and challenge them to be honest and sincere, unlike the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay), who told us a lot of stories to-day in regard to the hurt and misery and discrimination which are being caused now. We know that there is discrimination in every case where one has one racial group which is less developed than another. There must always and necessarily be discrimination. If it is not discrimination in terms of the law, then it is discrimination applied by society itself. Whilst talking about discrimination in society itself, these hon. members are terribly concerned about so-called discrimination applied by legislation, but they themselves are the best examples of the application of discrimination without legislation. The hon. member for Simonstown not only discriminates against non-Whites; he discriminates even against the Jews, because exclusive clubs are established in the Peninsula to which Jews may not belong, and that happens right throughout the country. But now suddenly there may not be any discrimination! We know for a fact that they do not want legislation to apply discrimination, but they apply discrimination throughout their lives. They would be the first people to object if certain of these laws were repealed.</p>

<p>I do not want to carry on further on these lines I want to come to the actual matter to which we should devote attention this afternoon. The Leader of the Opposition has <span class="col_4483-4484" refersTo="page_0868"/>stated that according to this measure there are three yardsticks or factors in determining who is a White person. According to him, there is the yardstick of descent, the yardstick of appearance and the yardstick of acceptance by the public as a White person. My submission is that he is not right in the one instance, because &#x201C;descent&#x201D;, even with this amended definition, is no yardstick. Not at all. Racial descent is a factor which is only taken into account when the person concerned has already been classified according to the other yardsticks and acknowledges that by descent he is a Native or a Coloured person. Then the question of descent is taken into account, not as a yardstick but because he admits to being a Native or a Coloured. Then in terms of the amendment of which the hon. the Minister has given notice, if it is in accordance with the facts, his admission will be accepted. Why should it be necessary for this matter of admission to be inserted? We can, in particular, mention two cases to show why it is being included. The first is the case of the Chinese mentioned by the hon. the Minister. The Chinese are a group of people who have a higher standard of living than, e.g., the ordinary Coloureds, at least many of them. Many of the Asian peoples live on a high level. Take, for example, a Thai who comes to live in our country. He would maintain a standard of living equal to that of the Whites in South Africa. Because he maintains that standard of living and mixes in that society, and is accepted by the Whites because he maintains that standard of living, he can pass as a White person if acceptance is to be the only yardstick.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>A Japanese also, if you want it that way. They maintain that standard of living and now they make that admission. It is to exclude those people from the White group that we say that they must be classified according to their admitted descent. Because the Coloured race in our legislation must cover all those who are not Bantu, but who are not White either. That classification of Coloured covers them all, even the Asian races, for example. Now such a person admits to being an Asian. Surely it would be unreasonable to say that in spite of his admission of his descent and that he is an Asian, we would nevertheless classify him as a White person simply because he is accepted as a White person and his standard of living is that of a white man. The other one is this, and I say this particularly to those hon. members who are so liberal-minded: We know that there are quite a number of liberals who are continuously trying to evade the laws of the land. They now want to say that they are Coloureds, and if they have to be classified they will say: I want to be associated with the Coloureds. That is a real danger, and that is why it is necessary to have this definition. [Laughter.] The hon. member laughs, but she herself is a great liberal, this hon. member for Houghton. Those who make the admission then become subject to the test. He makes the admission and then the Minister goes further and says it must be in accordance with the facts, and then he will apply the other yardsticks and see whether that is in accordance with the facts. But that alone is not used as the yardstick. He will see whether it is only his descent, and if that is his descent then the two other yardsticks provided by the definition come into operation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) contended that this matter of descent would now be the test in any case. That is not so at all. It will be no test at all. It will only come into operation if the person himself says, &#x201C;I am by descent a Coloured or a Native&#x201D;. Only then, but it is never applied as a test by the authorities. Why does the hon. member for Peninsula now aver that by means of this definition we are now making descent the test and that we will have &#x201C;snooping expeditions&#x201D;, to use his own words, and that we will now investigate what the man&#x2019;s ancestry was? That was never the intention of the Act nor will it ever be the intention.</p>

<p>If he comes along with a birth certificate indicating that his father was White and his mother non-White, and he states that he is a Coloured, well, he has admitted to being a Coloured. But the proviso is that must be supported by the facts. The hon. the Minister will then determine whether the facts are correct, and whether he therefore measures up to the other two yardsticks as required by the Act.</p>

<p>The requirements of appearance and general acceptance. That must be taken into account and will be taken into account.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also said that appearance is a yardstick. But appearance alone is surely no criterion. It must be considered in relation to general acceptance. In both sub-divisions of the definition, (a) as well as (b), the appearance must always be considered in relation to the acceptance, or the acceptance taken into account with due regard to the appearance. They are equal factors, and it is not true as the hon. Leader of the Opposition contends, that &#x201C;appearance is to triumph over general acceptance&#x201D;. That will not be the case at all. If a person is White in appearance and he is accepted as <span class="col_4485-4486" refersTo="page_0869"/>a non-White, then he will be classified as a non-White. Both tests are made in conjunction with one another. If he is generally accepted as a White but is a non-White as far as his appearance is concerned, he will be classified as non-White. Here again the two tests are applied in conjunction with one another. To take them separately, one by one, as was done by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, is not a fair interpretation of the position. I also want to draw attention to the fact that the factor of appearance was to-day interpreted by several speakers opposite as if it were a question of colour alone. It is a question of many other factors as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will not be able to state all of them, as I am probably not as much of an authority as the hon. member in this regard, but there is, for instance, the question of nails, high cheekbones, hair, and of gums. There are all the various factors whereby a person can be identified as belonging to a particular race. It is not right to contend that it is just a matter of the colour of the skin. There are many White people who have a brownish skin, who have a dark complexion but do not exhibit any other signs of race and who are certainly White, will remain White and will be classified as White. It is the general effect of all these factors which will determine whether a person is White or Coloured. For instance, a man from the southern states of Europe is dark-skinned. He comes possibly from Spain or from Southern Italy; he is swarthy, but he will not be classified as non-White for this reason alone. There are other factors by which a Coloured can be recognized.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula also adopted a wrong attitude towards the question of descent. He approaches the matter as if the question will be put to each person. I have already said that this is not the case. And then he asks whether it will be one forbear, or more, who were non-White. In any case, this is no matter for the State. If the person concerned is now going to admit that he is a Coloured because his grandfather, for instance, was a Coloured, then it is his affair, but the State will have to investigate the facts, the man having made that admission, to determine whether, according to his appearance and by general acceptance, he is a Coloured, because his admission must be supported by the facts. That is the effect of the amendment, and hon. members cannot get away from it. The hon. member also wanted to know to whom the admission will have to be made. The admission should in the first instance be made to the Secretary, that is to say, the Director of Census, who takes the census, in which a person declares this or that. He is asked in the form whether he is White or Coloured, or a Native. If on that form he states that he is Coloured, he naturally has made an admission. Or if he states that he is White, then he has admitted to being White. An admission has therefore already been made, in the first place, in the records of the Department of Statistics. No special &#x201C;snooping agent&#x201D; is then sent along, as alleged by the hon. member for Simonstown. Clause 2 only applies later.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>But it is in the Act all the same.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but it only becomes relevant later, not at the stage where he makes a statement in the first instance, but later when, for instance, he objects to his classification. In the event of his objecting to his classification, then further investigation will be instituted. Judge Snyman said in his judgment that any further information which may come to light will not constitute a portion of the record. Now, in terms of this amendment in Clause 4 it will indeed become part of the record. Then it will be a question of someone having to go round to hear his views on the matter. Thus, in the first place the admission is made to the Secretary. If the person concerned then appeals to the Board, he can repeat his views and state his case, or he can withdraw it if he has certain reasons for doing so, but that will necessarily have to be done before the Board. Thirdly, if he is not satisfied with the finding of the Board, he can go to the Appeal Court and make his admission there. There is no question of his having to make such an admission to any person he comes across, or of his being trapped unawares into making an admission and having to abide by it.</p>

<p>I come to the other point which was raised here, the so-called benefit of the doubt which must be given, and the contention that this will no longer apply under the new definition. I have no idea where the hon. member gets that idea, because the hon. the Minister gave a definite assurance that he will act in future just as he has done in the past, in the event of there being any doubt in the matter; then the person concerned will be given the benefit of the doubt. It is not right to say that, because of the new definition, the benefit of the doubt will now be excluded. The hon. member gave no reasonable ground at all for that argument.</p>

<p>Another argument that was advanced, particularly by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was that there appears to be nothing in the Bill which will either make a reclassification imperative, or to the effect that it cannot take place. I am convinced that no government, merely because the definition has now been altered, will change the whole register and bring about a reclassification. This definition will apply when the Act comes into operation. It will apply in regard to all classifications made as from that date. It will not be necessary to revert to the old classifications which have already been made. Therefore that argument is, in fact, no argument at all.</p>

<from><span class="col_4487-4488" refersTo="page_0870"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It may be done in terms of the law, but then reasons must exist why it should be done in a particular case. There must be special reasons why a person&#x2019;s position comes to be re-considered. The possibility exists, but it is absurd to suggest, as was done by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, that a general reclassification will have to take place.</p>

<p>Then there was the argument regarding world opinion. I must now honestly say that we on this side of the House are getting very tired of hearing all these tales about world opinion. We are constantly told by hon. members of the Opposition that we are busy with legislation which will have the effect of turning world opinion against us. It is not this legislation, but they who continually incite world opinion against us, and it starts in the first place in this House by the hon. members of the Opposition. The hon. members of the Opposition grasp every opportunity, for the simple reason that they are bankrupt and have no political policy at all. It is for this reason that they always seek to sow suspicion, as they did again this afternoon in citing these so-called &#x201C;hard luck&#x201D; stories in a disgraceful way for the benefit of the public, and this type of thing is raked up in every debate and is blazoned far and wide, particularly by the English newspapers in our country, and on that the world bases its opinion. I doubt whether there is a single newspaper which has ever made known to the public the actual provisions of any Act passed by us here, so that the outside world could see what we were really doing. It is what is said by the members of the Opposition that is published to the outside world. The argument of the hon. member for Peninsula, that we are busy creating a definition which will once again stir up world opinion against us, no longer holds any water. We are considering a definition which is being exploited by certain persons in an attempt to ridicule our legislation; we are busy closing the loopholes, and hon. members of the Opposition are seizing the chance to exploit this. I really believe that if the Opposition had carefully compared this definition with the earlier one, they would have realized that nothing is in fact being added to it. It is just to ensure that the emphasis is fairly laid on both of the tests, both the test of appearance and that of general acceptance, and that acceptance should not be given priority over appearance, or appearance over acceptance, but that both factors should always be taken into account in conjunction with one another.</p>

Therefore I don&#x2019;t propose to deal with any of the comments that he has made in that regard, except to assure him that the world does pay a great deal of attention, not only to what is said from this side of the House in opposition to the Bills which are introduced by the Government, but to the Bills themselves, and more important to every single stupid and ill-considered act that this Government does outside of this House in terms of regulations, in terms of petty annoyances, in terms for example of absurd bans on golf tournaments.

<p>I am only talking about individual cases. Nobody is talking about race groups. I am talking about individual cases, and as the hon. member for Peninsula pointed out, originally there were something like 100,000 doubtful cases, borderline cases. Not all of these cases have as yet been classified. In fact last year, in 1960, the hon. Minister himself, or his predecessor, stated that 60,000 cases in the Cape alone had not been dealt with finally, borderline cases. The new estimate is that something like 30,000 of these borderline cases in the Cape alone still remain to be classified. Now all these cases can be reopened at any time in terms of the original Act, and I want to read the section out to this House. There is nothing to prevent anybody from informing on people who have already been classified, who were borderline cases at the time that they were classified, and who still remain borderline cases, whether they had been classified or not: because any informer can come along with information.</p>

If the hon. member for Vanderbijl-park for instance happens to know that there is a case where somebody has been classified as White whilst he is not really a member of the White race, and he has some information about that person&#x2019;s grandmother or grandfather, and he informs on this person and the person is hauled up before the Director, or the Registrar, and the Registrar says &#x201C;I have information that you are of mixed descent, do you admit that you are of mixed descent&#x201D;, then what is the position? I presume the person is under oath and has to admit that he is of mixed descent. And then, Sir, he can be reclassified.</p>

<p>Let me read it again, because other members in this House may not have read it, and if the hon. member has read it he apparently has not understood it. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If at any time it appears to the Director that the classification of a person in terms of sub-section (1) is incorrect, he may, subject to the provisions of sub-sections (7) and (11) after giving notice to that person (and if the person is a minor, to his guardian), specifying in which respect the classification is incorrect, and affording such person an opportunity of being heard, and alter the classification of that person in the register.</block>

<p>The hon. member shakes his head. Can he not understand that under the law as it stands, and there is no amending provision in the amending Bill before us now, at any time in the future persons who have been classified as White may, if the Director receives information which leads him to believe that a person has been incorrectly classified, be reclassified?</p>

<p>I said so.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not say that. The hon. member said that no hard cases would be affected by this, that only persons coming up for reclassification in future would be affected. He said that it may be allowed in law, but that he was quite certain that it would not happen. Sir, as long as the law allows reclassification and as long as the definitions are widened to include not only this question of appearance and acceptance, but also descent, where formerly acceptance was the dominating factor, many people can be affected. But now there is the third factor which never existed before, namely the admission of descent. As long as the definition is widened and as long as investigations are possible, and indeed this new Section 4 seems to me to encourage the idea of investigation and information being given, as long as that is so, there is nothing whatsoever to prevent every single one of these 100,000 borderline cases from coming up again for reclassification. And this is as far as I am concerned, one of the most objectionable factors that this Bill introduces. Already thousands of people have gone through this agony of classification, the misery of classification, and the suspense in regard to classification, which is more than one can really describe. And now, whether it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention or not, the fact is that the law now lays it open for every single one of those borderline cases to be reclassified. I know that we are not dealing with the vast majority of our people when we discuss this sort of classification or race Bill. The vast majority of people in this country fall into specific broad categories, but there are these borderline cases, 1 per cent, perhaps 2 per cent&#x2014;nobody knows what the percentage is&#x2014;but in terms of individuals it comes to thousands of people and the old miseries are now going to be intensified, and however humanely the Act is administered, the anxiety and the anguish cannnot be over-estimated in the case of this particular Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister when he introduced this Bill, and particularly in regard to this little descent sub-clause which is now being introduced for the first time, mentioned specifically that he was motivated in so doing by this famous Song case.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned for dinner, I was busy trying to explain what to my mind were the reasons for the introduction of this new definition into the Population Registration Act, and I said that the main reason for the change in the definition of &#x201C;White person&#x201D; and, in particular, for the new descent clause, was to be found in the Singh case and the Song case. I think&#x2014;and here the hon. the Minister will agree with me&#x2014;that it is the Song case which gave the direct reason for the introduction of the descent clause, and the Singh case which is directly responsible for the introduction of a new proviso which the Minister, I believe, is going to propose in the Committee Stage. Why do these two cases mean so much that the hon. the Minister feels himself obliged to come along and change the entire definition thereby <span class="col_4491-4492" refersTo="page_0872"/>causing additional difficulties and greater hardships? How many Singh and Song cases are there in the whole of South Africa and which could possibly be effected by this Bill? I should like to deal with the Singh case first of all. In this case, Mrs. Singh is attempting to get herself classified as an Indian&#x2014;as a Coloured, in fact, in terms of this Act&#x2014;so that she may live lawfully with her husband in South Africa which is the country of their choice. Sir, how many women in this country would attempt to have themselves classified into a group which would for all purposes, i.e. social, political, economic, etc., be for them a lower classification? This is a very unusual thing, and if Mrs. Singh chooses to do so, then surely that is her own choice! It is her own choice how she wants to live her life. It is, after all, her own life. Surely, this Government is not so authoritarian as to try and determine exactly how every individual in this country should live his or her life? As to the Song case, the hon. the Minister is perhaps not aware of what Mr. Song had to go through in order to get himself reclassified as a White in terms of the existing definition. I intend telling the House something of what Mr. Song had to produce to the Board before he could get himself so reclassified, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister in the light of that whether he believes that out of the 100,000 odd borderline cases, there are more than a handful of people who would be able to produce all this evidence in order to get them reclassified? But even if they do succeed in producing all this evidence and in getting themselves reclassified, then what does it matter? How would that alter society in South Africa if a few hundred people are able to get themselves reclassified as Whites? Are we, indeed, such a pure race that this injection of so-called borderline cases is going to make such a difference to society as a whole in South Africa? But let me tell the House what Mr. Song had to do before he succeeded in getting himself reclassified. His application was in the name of David Song and was accompanied by a petition which was signed by 350 White people. Therein they testified that they had known Mr. Song and his family for many years and that they associated freely with that family and accepted them as Whites. In addition oral evidence was led from some 20 White persons and testimonials were received from a number of persons and institutions. It was, therefore, not just a matter of Mr. Song going to the Board telling them that he was being accepted as a White person although in appearance he was Chinese which he admitted he was&#x2014;although that would not have disqualified him at that stage. No, Sir. There was much more to it than that. He went along with the petition signed by 350 White persons and all the testimonials and oral evidence which he could produce before he succeeded in getting himself reclassified. I should like to give some examples of the type of testimonial which Mr. Song produced. A well-known school of modelling and deportment in Durban testified the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Miss Doreen Song (one of the daughters of Mr. Song) is a senior pupil of the above school. She did her training in a large class with European girls and was very popular and liked by all. She comes from a very respectable family and is a thorough lady.</block>

<p>The Durban Y.M.C.A. testified as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Misses Fay and Doreen Song have had association with our Club members for many years and have recently assisted us in one of our repertory productions.</block>

<p>A certain Badminton Club testified as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Misses Fay and Doreen Song have been good members of this Club for nearly two years; are both accepted as European in our Club and are well-liked by all. Miss Fay Song is our secretary and Miss Doreen Song a committee member.</block>

<p>The following testimony was given by a well-known Durban firm of wholesalers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Miss Doreen Song has been employed in our offices as a shorthand-typist. There was never, at any time, any question of her being looked upon or taken as any other than a European.</block>

<p>The Durban Business College testified as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Miss Doreen Song has been a student attending this College and was most successful in her course. She was a charming and well-behaved young girl and was treated as all the other students at College. She was accepted by the staff and students alike as a European for, indeed, the Chinese nation is of a much older civilization than our own.</block>

<p>I ask, therefore, what does it matter when this entire family is accepted as part of the White race? What deterioration in the society of South Africa could possibly result therefrom? What do hon. members think they are that they should take unto themselves the impertinence to think that the acceptance of a family such as this can in any way deteriorate the White race of South Africa?</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I say it will be extremely difficult, even under present conditions, for many cases to pass the Board and to be classified as White in terms of the existing definition. All sorts of cast-iron evidence will be necessary before that can be achieved. The hon. the Minister need not, therefore, fear <span class="col_4493-4494" refersTo="page_0873"/>that there will, because of the Song case, be a flood of applications for reclassification as Whites, so that the White society in South Africa will be endangered and undermined. This Bill to me is just another tragic reminder of the Government&#x2019;s sick obsession&#x2014;that is the only way in which I can put it&#x2014;with colour and race. It is to me a tragic reminder of what is going on in this country. It is the sort of legislation which nullifies any possibility of our being accepted as a mature country by the Western civilized world. This sort of legislation can never achieve its purpose, which is to herd off each individual member of the South African population into his or her own particular little racial kraal. It cannot succeed, but must fail because there is no scientific proof of race. There are of course physical characteristics, colour of the skin, and other features which were mentioned by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), but none of those features has a scientific basis. Even the phrase &#x201C;Coloured blood&#x201D; which is so freely used in this country, has no scientific basis whatsoever. You can as much tell the race of a person by his blood as you can tell it by his fingerprints. In other words, you cannot. There is no scientific test which can determine these borderline cases. So that, ironically enough, this legislation cannot possibly succeed.</p>

<p>This brings me to a point which was touched on by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg), namely the question of a standard definition. Since we are so obsessed with the idea of race and colour in this country, the question of a standard definition which would determine a person&#x2019;s race for all time, crops up again and again. Is this new definition of what is to be a White person, going to be the standard definition? In 1958 the then Minister stated that the question of a standard uniform definition of race had been referred to the law advisers. He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not want to bind myself yet, but I think the provision which will be laid down will be more or less along these lines, namely that if a person has a certain classification for the purposes of the population register, then that racial classification will be decisive for the purpose of all other laws and then there can be no possibility of confusion.</block>

<p>That was as far back as 1958 and two years after the appointment of the inter-departmental committee which inquired into the practicability or otherwise of a uniform standard of race classification. I am sure that we will all be interested if the Minister would take this opportunity of telling us something about this confidential document. Did it state that the Government could, in fact, give us a uniform definition, or did it tell the Minister that he was trying to define the undefinable? Even the identity card&#x2014;which I carry with me and other members probably too&#x2014;is no proof of race. It is not admissible in a court of law as proof of race, but if it was, it would not be of any help because the definitions vary from one Act to the other. In this respect we have assumed an extraordinary chameleonlike character in South Africa. We can, for instance, be classified as White under the Population Registration Act but as Coloured under the Group Areas Act. I, for instance, can be classified as White under the Population Registration Act but if by chance I have married an Indian or a Coloured man, I will be classified as Coloured or Indian under the Group Areas Act. If I subsequently divorce my Indian or Coloured husband, I then revert to my former race classification. Let us take the case of an African. He can be classified as a Coloured in terms of the Group Areas Act, White under the Immorality Act and Native under the Native Representation Act. There are so many variable definitions under our legislation that the position has become completely absurd. And this is all very relevant now in view of the dangerous new subclause which is being introduced by means of this legislation, i.e. the descent clause. I wonder whether hon. members realize that the definition of Native alone has something like ten variations under the various Acts. In terms of the Population Registration Act the basic definition of &#x201C;Native&#x201D;&#x2014;I am using the term which is used in that Act&#x2014;is qualified even further by the specific inclusion of ethnic groups, groups which themselves are undefined. The unfortunate Coloured person is afforded no positive criteria at all under the Population Registration Act. His membership of the Coloured group is ascertained entirely by the negative process of exclusion. Under the Act, a Coloured person is defined as a person who is not a White person or a Native. But once he is so classified, he is further classified according to seven sub-groups which have been proclaimed under the Act. There is, incidentally, considerable doubt in legal circles as to the validity of these sub-classifications. This is the type of maze in which one is landed when one tries to impose race laws on a heterogeneous society, because these are, in fact, race laws and ours is, in fact, a heterogeneous society. It is impossible to impose race classifications, sub-classifications and group classifications, etc., all of which are themselves undefined. As I pointed out already, for the Coloured group alone there are seven sub-groups, viz. the Cape Coloured group, the Malay group, the Griqua group, the Chinese group, the Indian group, the other Asiatic group, the other Coloured group&#x2014;all in terms of the Population Registration Act. The &#x201C;other Asiatic group&#x201D; is defined as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">including any person who, in fact, is, or is generally accepted as, a member of a race or tribe whose national home is in any country or area in Asia other than China, India or Pakistan.</block>

<p>This excludes Japanese however. The &#x201C;other Coloured group&#x201D; again is defined as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4495-4496" refersTo="page_0874"/>including any person who is not included in any of the first six groups and who is not White, or Native as defined in Section 1 of the Act.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, this is the absurd sort of maze we get into when we try to compartmentalize every single individual into his or her own little racial group. The Population Registration Act has been called the cornerstone of apartheid. But so many other Acts are looked upon as the cornerstones of apartheid, that apartheid has many corners and most of them are dangerous corners. The hon. the Minister said that this Bill was intended to plug the loopholes of the principal Act to prevent people from crossing the line and obtain a race classification which they should not have. The question, in the last analysis, is why people try to cross the colour line? Why is it that Coloureds try for White and why is it that Africans try for Coloured? The real reason is, of course, that there are so many differentiations in the modes of life, in the status, rights and privileges of the different racial groups. The easier way and the more harmonious way to set about the problem would be to iron out the differences which exist between the different racial groups in this country instead of trying to plug loopholes in Acts.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are beginning to cover a very wide field in this debate. Originally the details of the principal Act were enlarged upon. I do not intend doing that except to say that I am very sorry&#x2014;and I want to refer to the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) in this respect&#x2014;that this opportunity is being used to dig up unpleasant things as was done during the discussion on the principal Act. I wish to indicate that with this Bill we are simply continuing to build on the existing Act. Section 5 of the principal Act provides for the classification of Whites. Coloureds and Natives and because of the existence of that section it is obvious that the law should contain a definition in order to effect classification. The Bill which is before us to-day really contains only three principles. In the first instance it changes the definition of a White person so as to enable us to effect the classification which is referred to in Section 5 of the principal Act. Secondly there are provisions in respect of the period within which objections can be lodged and thirdly we have Clause 4 which makes it possible for the Minister to institute further investigation if he wishes to do so. I wish to deal with certain matters which have already been raised by hon. members. I shall in fact endeavour not to deal with this matter on a political basis&#x2014;and I hope other members will also do that&#x2014;but in a spirit of trying to ascertain what will be the best definition for the purposes of the classification which is provided for in Section 5. The classification is already there and all we are doing here is to try to find a better definition on which that classification can be based. I think it is our duty as responsible people not only to want to break down but also to avail ourselves of this opportunity to find a definition which will make it possible to apply the Act as effectively as possible. Although many hon. members opposite do not agree with the principal Act it is still necessary for them when they criticize to criticize constructively and to make suggestions as to how the definition can be improved.</p>

<p>You are building on sand.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>If I were to react to an interjection like that I would be building on sand! I asked the hon. member for Peninsula this afternoon whether he could make any suggestions as to how the old definition could be improved. I am under the impression that hon. member is more satisfied with the old definition than with the new one, but that was as far as he took the matter. He also referred to the misery which was occasioned on the border line. In this respect we must accept it that when we try to define who is White, who is Coloured and so on, a line must of necessity be drawn somewhere along the border. It is of no avail, therefore, for that hon. member to come here this afternoon and to say that it causes misery to this or that group, because the fact remains that as long as there is a border line there will always be &#x201C;hard cases&#x201D;. Seeing that is so, the &#x201C;hardship&#x201D; to which hon. members have referred, will not be eliminated by altering the definition slightly in one or other direction. There will always be people who will be hit by the border line, even thogh the definition is made as favourable as possible for those border line cases. We have to accept that and on that basis try to find a definition with the least number of loopholes and one which will give rise to the least uncertainty because where there is the least uncertainty, you will find the least dissatisfaction. The hon. member for Peninsula also alleged that whereas association was the most important yardstick under the old definition, appearance was the most important yardstick under the new definition. In this respect I differ from the hon. member as the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) has already disagreed with him. This is a point, therefore, on which the hon. member for Houghton and I agree! I wish to state clearly that in terms of the existing definition a &#x201C;White&#x201D; person can be classified as such on two different grounds, whereas under the proposed definition a person can only be classified as White if both those grounds are present. The existing definition says that a person is White when he is obviously White in appearance, subject to a proviso which appears later. The second ground on which a person can be classified as White is when he is generally accepted as a White person. It must be noted that these two grounds are separately valid, that is to say the two are not linked together with an &#x201C;and&#x201D; but are separated by an &#x201C;or&#x201D;. The hon. member for Peninsula alleges that in the existing definition appearance is being <span class="col_4497-4498" refersTo="page_0875"/>pushed into the background and that association is the most important consideration in determining whether or not a person is White. I differ from the hon. member on this point, because in my opinion the two grounds, namely appearance and association are equally important. As a matter of fact, appearance is mentioned as the first ground in the definition. In this connection I wish to refer the hon. member to Section 19 of the principal Act and ask him whether in view of the provisions of that section he agrees that appearance is indeed regarded as the most important ground under the present definition. Section 19 (1) of the principal Act reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person who in appearance obviously is a White person shall for the purposes of this Act be presumed to be a White person until the contrary is proved.</block>

<p>In other words, appearance is such an important consideration in the existing definition and is so decisive that when his appearance proves it, the person concerned is automatically accepted as White unless the contrary is proved. The onus is placed on the person who alleges that the person who is classified as White, is indeed not White. The hon. member for Peninsula went further and alleged that under the proposed definition, appearance was the dominant consideration. Here, too, I differ from him, because appearance and association are no longer regarded as two separate grounds, but are taken together for obvious reasons. The proposed definition provides that a person is White if he is obviously White in appearance&#x2014;exactly the same, therefore, as the existing definition. But the definition goes further and says provided such a person is not generally accepted as a Coloured. The two grounds are no longer regarded as separate tests, therefore, but are regarded as one test, in other words, it is no longer an &#x201C;or&#x201D; but an &#x201C;and&#x201D;. To put it different it means that &#x201C;appearance&#x201D; becomes positive whereas &#x201C;association&#x201D; is negative. In other words, a person must positively appear to be White, whereas he must not pass as a Coloured in the negative sense. This definition to which I have just referred is more or less reversed in paragraph (b) of the proposed definition and it states that a person who is generally accepted as a White person and who in appearance is not obviously a non-White is White. In other words, you have a positive statement in respect of passing as a White person and a negative statement as far as appearance is concerned. I cannot understand, therefore, how the hon. member for Peninsula can conclude from this definition that appearance will be the deciding factor. On the contrary. I think the hon. member will agree with me that in the proposed definition a more decisive meaning is not attached to appearance than in the existing definition.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that in future descent will play an important role, but the fact of the matter is that we are only adding something to the definition, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but does not include any person who admits that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person.</block>

<p>In other words, if a person is White or regards himself as White by reason of one of the grounds already mentioned and wishes to be classified as White why should he admit that he is not White? The hon. member for Houghton gave us an account a moment ago of the freedom which people ought to be able to enjoy, that Mr. and Mrs. Singh should be able to live their own lives etc. We are now making it possible for anybody who harbours any doubt and who thinks that he is a Coloured person to admit that he is Coloured and to be classified as such. Hon. members object to this, however. They do not want those people to have that right. Hon. members conclude from the relevant provision that descent is a determining factor. Descent is only important in so far as it is referred to here and where it is made possible for someone who knows that he is Coloured by descent to admit that he is Coloured. The hon. member for Houghton has referred to the case of Mr. Song and alleged that we were changing the definition because of that case. But it is not the case of Mr. Song alone which has given rise to this. As a matter of fact, we are not concerned about individual cases. What we are concerned about is the principle. The fact of the matter is&#x2014;and hon. members who think seriously about this matter will realize this&#x2014;that there is an important weakness in the existing definition which must be eliminated. That weakness is this that a person can be classified as White if he is generally accepted as a White person.</p>

They say they associate with that person as though he is White and <span class="col_4499-4500" refersTo="page_0876"/>because of that he should be classified as White.

<p>If that is the basis on which we differ we cannot talk to one another, but I am convinced that is not the basis. I merely wish to point out that the weakness in the old definition was a ridiculous weakness and that we are putting it right here, in this sense that the person should not only associate with Whites or be regarded by the community as a White, but that he should also be White in appearance. Without that addition the definition will not be water-tight. Hon. members opposite are continually trying to create confusion, however, as far as the definition of a White person is concerned, because they want to create confusion, because the more uncertain such an important definition is, the greater the number of difficulties that will arise and the greater the dissatisfaction, and they want this legislation to cause dissatisfaction. That is why they want to have confusion and why they do not want to have a clear definition.</p>

I wish to endorse that the less uncertainty there exists and the clearer the definition, to that extent there will be dissatisfaction and &#x201C;hard cases&#x201D;, When you analyse this definition, Sir, you will see that two factors are necessary. That is appearance and that he must be generally accepted as White. I want us to analyse those words &#x201C;generally accepted&#x201D;. What do they mean. I want hon. members to consider those words &#x201C;generally accepted&#x201D;, or &#x201C;deurgaan&#x201D; in Afrikaans. They can be interpreted in so many different ways that you can interpret them to mean practically anything because of the fact that what some people regard as &#x201C;accepted&#x201D; or &#x201C;deurgaan&#x201D;, other people do not. When is he accepted? My own interpretation is that he is accepted as White when he is regarded by the general public as White.</p>

<p>That is my problem. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has hit the nail on the head. By whom or by how many? In the case of Song 350 said that they associated with him and that he was generally accepted. But in the same case of Song thousands of others would have said that they were not prepared to associate with him. That was why the hon. member for Kensington asked how many, and that is my problem. I do not wish to enlarge upon that but it is for that reason, the uncertainty of what &#x201C;generally accepted&#x201D; means, that there should be greater clarity and that we can expect trouble under the existing definition. That is why I think it is desirable that there should be greater clarity in regard to this aspect of the definition. There must be a yardstick. If we wish to compile a population register in which Whites, Natives and Coloureds appear separately, it is essential that we have a yardstick. It would perhaps have been possible to define a non-White and to have said that those who were not non-Whites, were Whites. But as the definition reads to-day, it defines a White person and perhaps that is right, because the White community is the community to which it is desired to belong. Consequently it is better to define &#x201C;White&#x201D;. &#x201C;White&#x201D; is defined and those who are not White are non-Whites. But there must be a yardstick and in conclusion I wish to appeal to hon. members opposite to accept that the better we formulate that yardstick, the greater will be the unanimity and satisfaction in the country in regard to the application of the register. They have a duty to perform in that respect and I will be glad if they will assist and do their duty properly. They can assist us in finding a definition which will give a greater measure of satisfaction. <span class="col_4501-4502" refersTo="page_0877"/>Hitherto we have not had it but I do hope we will still get it before this debate closes.</p>

I wonder whether before this debate is over, the Minister himself will explain to us this pig iron curtain and tell us what lies behind it. The hon. member for Ceres typified the attitude of hon. members opposite. He spoke with some restraint about the hard luck cases. He said that there were some people who were always unhappy. Cannot he realize that these so-called hard luck cases, an expression coined on that side of the House, are human tragedies; that they are not hard luck cases but human tragedies, whose children will suffer increasingly if this amendment is passed. The hon. member for Ceres asked why we did not suggest a better definition.

There is nothing further from the truth. This is not a description of a White person. There is no description of a White person in this amendment. What this amendment does is to exclude from the status of being a White person an awful lot of other people who up to now have been members of the White group and with that status, under this Nationalist Government, go all the privileges to which every human being is entitled. It is all very well for hon. members to ask what difference does it make and what hardships there are. The hon. member for Heilbron said that. He spoke about there always being discrimination.

<p>I think that puts it fairly clearly. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And where the Legislature has left the definition open to the Courts to find, in the light of the individual cases that come before it, I feel that it is our duty to interpret the Act in such a way that in the complexities of our multi-racial community they will work as smoothly as conditions will admit and with a minimum of hardship.</block>

<p>That was the definition under the Mixed Marriages Act. I hope the hon. member for Vereeniging will have a look at that also. Sir, there it is. There is the situation which the Minister is trying to do something about. He cannot do it. We cannot do it. There is no legislation which can do it, or undo, as the Judge said, what the Creator has already done. We cannot clear up what He has blurred. There is this dividing line. One of the things that frightens the hon. member for Ceres was that there might be one person who looks like a Coloured, and for that, and for a few Japanese and one Chinese, a handful of people who happen to be darker than others, we have to introduce a completely new definition. The whole attempt by this Government to try to define, to try to draw a line through these boundaries, the boundary groups, become more and more impossible.</p>

<p>Let us take the process of the Mixed Marriages Act. I said that the test under that Act was the same as the test under this Act we are now amending. If this Bill is passed in the form in which it is, it is now going to be possible to have people classified as Coloureds because they have one Coloured ancestor somewhere and they have been honest enough to admit it, and because of that they will forever be Coloured and there is nothing that the Minister can do about it. It will not be one of those cases in which he has any discretion at all, because the law we are about to pass says that if you have one Coloured ancestor then for ever and ever you will be classified as Coloured. That is what we are asked to pass here to-night. But there is no amendment of the Mixed Marriages Act before us to-night. I wonder if the Minister will tell us whether there will be, because in terms of that definition there are people who are married to-day who will become disqualified under this Act, and if hon. members opposite think that is far-fetched, I would like to refer them to several cases reported in the law reports where it has happened in fact.</p>

<p>There is one case reported in Natal where an Order of Court was obtained declaring that for the purposes of the Mixed Marriages Act the woman concerned was entitled to be married although she was classified as Coloured under the Population Registration Act. What is the position that will now arise? Are these people going to be reclassified? The trouble is that once they have been classified, because they have a Coloured ancestor, that is the end of that classification, and this is the sort of anomaly which we will have in South Africa if this Bill is passed. It is an anomaly which apparently does not worry the Minister. If the Minister will look at the case of Herbst vs. Kuhn (1961, S.A.L.R., p. 555), he will see at page 563 that the Judge, dealing with this question of the one statute and the other&#x2014;and that is what I am considering, the Mixed Marriages Act&#x2014;said that the fact that there is another Act, the Population Registration Act, does not concern us. The Judge said that no one can expect this woman to wait for more than two years until the Minister&#x2019;s Department has classified her. He went on to show that there are two different considerations which apply. If a White woman wants <span class="col_4505-4506" refersTo="page_0879"/>to get married, she can, if she has a Coloured ancestor, get married to a White man. But your race classification in terms of the Act we are now amending, is entirely different. What absolute nonsense, Sir! [Interjections.] The hon. member said that he could not see any harm in classifying someone who is obviously a non-White, but I think he rather missed the point. The point of sub-clause (b) of the first clause of the Bill changes the law in this respect, that whereas before, if a person was accepted as a White person, that was the test which applied. It did not matter if he looked like a Coloured person, or if he had the appearance of a Coloured person. The situation that has now arisen under this amendment is that if a man looks like a Coloured person, like a Mauritian, which is expressed in the negative in this Bill, and if such a person is generally accepted as a White person, then as the law stands to-day, whether he looks a little Black or not does not matter, he is entitled to be classified as White. But now, if he is accepted and he is dark and if, as expressed in this Bill, he is not in appearance obviously not a White person, in other words, if he appears to be Coloured, then he will be classified as a Coloured from now on. I wonder whether hon. members opposite who smirk when we talk about these tragedies realize what this means and how many people there are in this world who, through no fault of their own, are dark in colour, who are not obviously White? I wonder whether the hon. member has ever come across people from Mauritius who are accepted as White, in Durban at any rate, where I know a lot of these people; from now on those people can be classified as Coloured and there is nothing they can do about it. That is the tragedy. All the flexibility is now removed. Whereas before there was a certain flexibility, that is now being taken away, and these persons who are, unfortunately for them, dark in colour, although they are accepted as Europeans, will now not be able to be classified as White. The Minister then adds to the two definitions in (a) and (b) something else. He adds a condition to that. I hope the Minister will make it clear whether or not the last two lines in Clause 1 apply to both (a) and (b). I think he has said so, but I hope he will make it clear. Perhaps the Minister will indicate by a nod. If he does not, it is a mystery we will have to unravel by ourselves. It does not include a White person either when he is obviously White and not accepted as a Coloured, or one who is generally accepted as a White, and is not obviously not a European, because those people may not be White people if they admit that they are by descent a Coloured or a Native person. I wonder if the hon. the Minister will tell us what is meant by admitting that you are a Native or a Coloured person by descent. How do you admit it, Sir? Do you use the words in the Act? I do not think so. It introduces something quite new, something which we have not as yet had in South Africa in relation to these matters, because we never had these matters until this Government came into power. The whole trend has been away from the blood test. The whole trend has been towards the idea of association and appearance. Now we have this blood tests. How do you make such an admission? What does &#x201C;descent&#x201D; mean? What does &#x201C;by descent a Native or a Coloured person&#x201D; mean? Does it mean that you have one ancestor who is Coloured? And if it does, does that mean that you are descended from someone who was a Coloured person or a Native&#x2014;I think that is the ordinary meaning of descent? How far back do you have to go? Even in Nazi Germany when they classified the Jews, they only went back four generations. How do you admit that you are a Coloured person by descent? It is a legal phrase, Sir, which has no meaning. It could have a hundred meanings.</p>

<p>I do not know. I only know that a long time ago there were very few Europeans. When you read this new definition, when you read this introduction of having a Coloured ancestor, with Clause 4, I think you have a proper appreciation of what is being aimed at in this Bill. The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) said that the purpose of Clause 4 (b) was to see that the evidence which had been given was true. I want to demonstrate that is quite incorrect. Section 3 of the Act says that certain particulars are required for the compilation of the register and that they are to be taken from the census forms received by the Director or the Secretary in connection with the census &#x201C;and such other records as are available to him&#x201D;. Clearly that does not involve<span class="col_4507-4508" refersTo="page_0880"/> the right to investigate which is now being given in terms of Clause 4. It clearly does not involve that. It refers to existing records. If there is any doubt about that, perhaps hon. gentlemen will look at the case which I believe this Bill is all about, or one of the cases it is all about, and the decision of the Court which this Bill is intended to meet, namely the case of M. and Others against the Race Classification Board. I refer to the judgment of Snyman J. as recorded in the South African Law Reports, 1962 Vol. 1 (T.P.D.). On page 720 the learned Judge says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems clear from Section 3 of the Population Registration Act that the Secretary must compile the register from the census returns and such other records as may be available to him. What is meant by &#x201C;other records&#x201D; gives difficulty. I shall not attempt to explore the matter save to say that it seems to me that &#x201C;other records&#x201D; means records in existence and available to him in the ordinary course of his duties. As I see the position it cannot mean that he can conduct additional investigations, either himself or through officers of his Department. Nor can he use written reports of such investigations as &#x201C;other records&#x201D;. It would be a misnomer to call such reports records for they are investigation reports specially made. I do not think they are included in the term &#x201C;other records&#x201D;.</block>

Clearly then this investigation which Clause 4 provides for is not necessary to get information from which to compile records because the records are there. What is it all about? Obviously it is so that this new part of the definition can be implemented properly. The hon. the Minister is not just going to rely on people to admit that they are Coloured by descent.

<p>That is very interesting indeed, Sir. I want to ask the hon. gentlemen to have regard to Clause 4 and to this proviso, if I may call it that, to the new definition. What is going to happen? These people will now be able to investigate anything required in terms of this Act. And one of those things is whether or not you have a skeleton somewhere in your family cupboard. They are going to search for that skeleton. They are going to smell it out. Whereas before all that the Secretary could do was to get proof that the facts were true which he had in his register, he can now appoint anybody, not necessarily a civil servant, not an officer of his Department, but any person, to make these investigations. And the investigations which they can make are the investigations as to whether or not you have a Black skeleton somewhere in your family tree. I myself have come across at least 13 people who have Coloured ancestry. They admit it. They cannot help it that they have Coloured ancestry, but the fact is that for the last two generations they have been living as and accepted by Europeans as Europeans. I am sure all the hon. gentlemen over there know them too. Those are the people who are going to be affected by this. If hon. gentlemen do not believe me when I say this, I want to tell them&#x2014;and I want to tell the hon. the Minister too&#x2014;that this sort of thing has been going on in any event. Despite the fact that it is quite clear from this judgment that they have not had the power to make these investigations, nevertheless his Department has been making these little witch-hunts. If the hon. the Minister reads the case to which I have referred him, Herbst v. Kuhn, he will see in the judgment which was delivered in that case that all sorts of investigations were carried out by the Department after the appeal was noted against the classification. That is the sort of thing that has been going on already.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite must appreciate what a complete depravity this makes of all human dignity. The hon. member for Simons-town (Mr. Gay) mentioned a great many of these cases. I know of cases, one in particulat which makes me very angry. I hope it will make the hon. the Minister very angry too. In that case the offices of the Population Registration office in Durban called in a family and told them that they were not satisfied that they were entitled to be classified as Europeans and that they wanted to make further investigations. The husband was first called in and he was asked to bring in his family so that they could be looked at by this individual in the Minister&#x2019;s Department. What a scandalous invasion of a man&#x2019;s dignity, Sir. Do hon. members who are smirking and smarming on that side of the House think it is not? Would they like that to happen to them? I want to say that it could easily happen to anyone on that side of the House, and if it were not for the fact that they mentioned that they were a Member of Parliament they would be, and they would feel very humiliated by this.</p>

<p>It is not melodramatic, Sir, it is like a Greek tragedy, but it goes on and on. What I want to ask the hon. the Minister is who is going to be appointed to make these investigations, to do this smelling out for him in the family cupboard? Are they going to be paid for it or is he going to use some other organization? Or is he going to use the sources which he obviously already has, because it is quite clear that the hon. the Minister has sources of information. It is quite clear that people, after they have been classified as White, suddenly out of the blue, through some vision which somebody has had, are suddenly classified differently. They are informed by people around the place, and the hon. the Minister now wants to legalize these informers and what they do. If that is not what he wants to do, why does he not say that it must be an officer of his Department? How is an admission made, Mr. Speaker? I can see what is going to happen here. These people will go around and say: &#x201C;Your grandmother was Coloured, you know.&#x201D; And the person says &#x201C;Yes, I know&#x201D;. And that is an admission that he is a Coloured person by descent. If you go back further, as I have said, I am sure the hon. the Minister will find that is the position in the case of half of the population of this country.</p>

<p>This will cause an awfully greater delay. I have not the time to do so, but I would like the hon. the Minister to read what the learned Judge said in the Herbst versus Kuhn case about the delays that there were. One last thing, Mr. Speaker. My leader asked the hon. the Minister whether or not this would apply to people who had already been classified. The hon. Minister said no.</p>

<p>He also asked me whether I would object to being classified as a Coloured. If I were a Coloured person, of course, I would not object to it. I do not know why the hon. member laughs. The hon. the Minister said this afternoon that there had been 15 cases where Coloureds who for one or other reason had been classified as Whites had pleaded to be re-classified as Coloureds. They are proud of it. I cannot imagine anything more cruel and more undesirable than to classify a person who is a Coloured person as a White person. That was why many people again applied to be classified as Coloureds. I also regarded that hon. member as a reasonably brave member and I hope he will not refuse to answer this question. I wanted to ask him a question while he was speaking. He said his leader had said that their yardstick should be appearance and general acceptance. I wish to ask him the question which I wanted to ask him earlier on and I hope he will have the courage to say yes or no: Is he satisfied with the definition as it appears in the Act to-day?

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot say that I am surprised at the Opposition, but I must honestly say that I had not expected them to carry on the way they have; it started with the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Durban (North) has carried on in the same way. What is their argument against this amendment and against the principal Act in particular? Their argument is this: That this legislation is causing terrible hardships. As the principal Act stands at the moment, according to them, it causes terrible hardships and that this Bill will cause similar and worse hardships. The hon. member for Durban (North) said that we called them &#x201C;hardships&#x201D;. They are the people who call them &#x201C;hardships&#x201D;. He says they are not &#x201C;hardships he says these things are &#x201C;human tragedies&#x201D;. I challenge that hon. member to mention one of these so-called &#x201C;hardships&#x201D;&#x2014;and I admit there have been&#x2014;which would not have been experienced even if this Act had not appeared on the Statute Book. The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) mentioned one case which I remember very vividly. That was the case of the person who went to Newlands and was transferred&#x2014;he was not kicked out&#x2014;to the Coloured section. He wanted to institute an action for damages against the Western Province Rugby Union and Twentyman-Jones, the Chairman of the Rugby Union then tendered an apology. That is quite true. The person who was transferred to the Coloured section was the brother of the person who refereed the main game. I remember that incident. Why did the hon. member not tell the House that incident took place before the introduction of the Population Registration Act? He then told us about the youngster who had hanged himself&#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member mentioned a number of cases. He mentioned the case of a person who hanged himself because he had been classified as a Coloured. The case he mentioned was one of the first cases. It was the most blatant case which you could find of those &#x201C;hardships&#x201D; Sir. I want to know from him whether those &#x201C;hardships&#x201D; were suffered under the Population Registration Act? That happened long before there was a Population Registration Act. To be honest, Sir, those things happened before the National Party came into power. The point is this that had the Population Registration Act been in operation at that time the brother of that referee would not have been subjected to that humiliation. It would only have been necessary for him to say: Here is my identity card; it is clear that I am White.</p>

<p>It is very clear why we have this Bill. We have it so as to eliminate certain abuses which have taken place because of certain loopholes in the Act and because we want to close those loopholes. The Opposition now grasp at this opportunity not only to try to disturb race relations in South Africa, but they grasp at it in a desperate attempt to make matters more difficult for South Africa overseas. They painted a distorted and wrong picture this afternoon and said that as a result of this change in the definition, as a result of this Population Registration Act, we <span class="col_4515-4516" refersTo="page_0884"/>have all these so-called &#x201C;hard luck cases They want the world to believe that this is a Government which oppresses people in gruesome fashion, a Government which commits these cruelties, knowing that is not the case. Now that tremendous progress has been made with the population register, now that it has nearly been completed, they again have to tell the world of the type of thing which is happening. The Population Registration Act is being administered in the most human manner. Not one of them can deny that. As the Minister has already said the former member for Salt River, Mr. Lawrence himself referred to the human way in which it was being administered. To-day in order to meet those agitators&#x2014;because they are the only people who are causing difficulty&#x2014;hon. members create the impression that as a result of this Act terrible oppression is taking place in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hard fact of the matter is this, Sir, that as long as there is separation, and as long as there are separate institutions, there will have to be a definition as to who is White, who is Coloured, who is Bantu, as the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) has already said. That is the crux of the matter. It is not the population register which is causing these difficulties. It is not this definition which is causing them. Do away with the population register, do away with this Government and put the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in power and you will have exactly the same &#x201C;hard luck &#x201C;cases that you have to-day. Sir. Let me give an example. It is the policy of that party to have separate residential areas, is it not? Is that their policy? Can the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) tell me whether that is their policy?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question: Were there separate residential areas in South Africa before the introduction of the Population Registration Act?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should not do himself the injustice of asking such a stupid question. He is not as stupid as he looks. The point is this: They are in favour of separate residential areas. If a Coloured pretends to be White and he wishes to build a house in Rondebosch, who will decide whether or not he is Coloured? Are they going to tell him he can build there or he cannot build there? Who will decide? What definition will they apply [Interjections.] They refuse to tell us what their definition will be? They have been challenged right from the start to tell us what their definition is of a White person, what their definition is of a Coloured and of a Bantu, but they refuse to tell us. But at the same time they say, however, that they will have that separation. The position in regard to the Population Registration Act has become very difficult recently, and I think the Minister will agree with me. All these amendments would not have been necessary had it not been for the fact that the population register has been sabotaged, had it not been for those deliberate attempts to evade it. You have those agitators, Sir, who try to ridicule the law and to make it fail. That is why we should hasten and find a definition which will thwart those people. But hon. members opposite must also have a definition for their type of discrimination. Take the case of the schools. The Opposition is in favour of separate schools. How are they going to carry that out without a definition. Recently we had the case of certain agitators who got a number of Coloureds to go from one restaurant to the other in Cape Town in an attempt to gain admission. Then you have people like Alan Paton, and people like R. A. F. Swart, who recently handled a case of that nature. There are people who go out of their way to send children who appear White but who are not White to White schools. That position also obtained in the past, even before this Government came into power. If hon. members opposite were to come into power again, how would they handle the position without a definition? I remember a case in Port Elizabeth in days gone by where the son of a family was sent to a White boys&#x2019; school and the daughter to a White girls&#x2019; school. The daughter was refused admission to the White school while the boy was accepted. That happened under the United Party Government. There were other cases as well, even more deplorable cases. No, it is not because of this legislation that these so-called &#x201C;hard-luck cases&#x201D; exist. They also happened before this Government came into power. It is as a result of that both we and the United Party want separate schools for White and Coloureds, that we want separation. And as long as you have them, there will always be cases like that but as soon as the population register has been completed, those difficulties will be eliminated to a very large extent. During the regime of the United Party there were similar hard-luck cases.</p>

<p>Yes, I was a United Party supporter, what about it? But fortunately I am no longer a United Party supporter.<span class="col_4517-4518" refersTo="page_0885"/> However, that is the position. The hon. member for Peninsula referred to certain cases. Similar cases repeatedly happened in days gone by with this difference: When those cases happened in the past everybody realized that we were faced with a difficult problem and every responsible person said: Do not make the task of the principal more difficult; do not make the task of the school board more difficult; do not make the task of the unfortunate Coloured family or White family more difficult; let us try to settle the matter amicably, let us try to find some way out and let us try to solve the problem. But when this Government came into power the English Press and hon. members opposite gave great publicity to every case. They did not care how much damage they did to the country, they did not care if they publicized the case of a White family and landed that family in the greatest possible difficulty. Every minor case was exploited for party political purposes. If that hon. member has the few brains which I think he has, he would realize that wherever there was separation that type of case occurred. You had them in the churches, Sir I remember how certain churches admitted Coloureds in those days and others did not, and I remember the trouble which that caused. I do not think it is honest on the part of hon. members to contend that all this has been as a result of this legislation. Not only is that the biggest nonsense in the world, but it is also the most malicious thing to say in the world. All these years, during the past 50 years, we have always had this type of &#x201C;hard-luck&#x201D; case in South Africa because of this policy of separation to the same extent to which we have it to-day.</p>

<p>The only member in this House who can talk about this matter is the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) because she does not believe in separation. She condemns it and says it is wrong and that a line should not be drawn. But any member who wants to draw a line, any member who wants to have separate schools and so forth, is being exceedingly unreasonable and malicious when he says that these cases are as a result of this legislation. They are inherent in any system under which there is separation between White and non-White.</p>

<p>His Leader wants it. Hon. members opposite and the Progressives quarrelled because the latter did not want separation whereas the United Party wanted it. I repeat that all the suffering to which they refer has been there all the time and will always be there as long as you draw a line, because there will always be people on both sides of the line who are very close to it. The problem is what is the best solution. An attempt was made in the principal Act to solve this matter so that everyone will be classified and will have to be classified, whether it be under this system or under the United Party system. The advantage of our system is that within a few years, and with the assistance of this amendment we hope to do so quicker, everybody has been classified and when that has been done there will no longer be any hard-luck cases.</p>

<p>That is the position, because as soon as you have completed the registration the confusion will be over. The people will know where they stand. The position is simply this that we would have completed something which we could in any event have had to do within the next 50 or 100 years. There is only one alternative and that is to do away with colour separation. If you want to have colour separation, Sir, as hon. members opposite also want, you have to draw a line, that is unavoidable.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by saying this: More than 2,000,000 identity cards have been issued. We are proposing this amendment to make short shift of those saboteurs, those agitators who use innocent people in an attempt to ridicule this legislation and to make it fail. Considerably more than 2,000,000 identity cards have already been issued, and as soon as everyone has his card, you will have come to the end of these difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, nobody who thinks about this matter and who is a friend of South Africa will say the things which hon. members opposite have said to-day. Anybody who is a friend of South Africa will not say what my good old friend from Simonstown (Mr. Gay) said namely that all these &#x201C;hard luck cases&#x201D; had occurred as a result of this legislation, and that under this legislation the White men in South Africa were cold bloodedly and unfeelingly committing cruelties.

<p>It is only since the Afrikaner came into power that they have started to exploit these things as much as possible. They do not care what damage they do to South Africa as long as they can gain a few votes. The English Press is continually exploiting every minor case to inflame the hatred against the Government, to the detriment of South Africa. They do not act the <span class="col_4519-4520" refersTo="page_0886"/>way the <i>Burger</i> and the then National Party Opposition acted. They remained quiet about those things, they always tried to settle those matters and to solve them behind closed doors, behind the doors of the consistory or whatever it may have been. They did not try to hurt anybody&#x2019;s feelings. I say that the English Press is responsible for 90 per cent of the hard-luck cases because they are continually giving publicity to those cases. What is the suffering in those cases? The fact that it is made public to the whole world, that they are shouted from the roof tops, that they are broadcast to the whole world.

Now I want to ask him what has happened since 1950 to make him need a pass and a definition in order to classify him as separate from the Coloureds? He needed no classification in those days, but now he is pleading not only for the classification, but he is pleading for a stronger, a more rigid classification; where he required nothing before, now he requires a more rigid classification in order to separate himself from the non-Whites of South Africa.

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am dealing with the Bill, and I am now going to give the reasons, the answers to the questions which I have just asked. The reason for this Bill is that the Government suddenly finds itself in such a mess, such an utter shambles because pig-iron became more important then pigment that it had to bring in this Bill. [Laughter.] And they had to call on the hon. member for Vereeniging to try and extricate itself from the mess into which its own impractical policies have landed it. We warned this Government.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, I say that we warned this Government that a situation would arise with which this Bill deals. This Bill, the &#x201C;Singh-Song-snooper&#x201D; Bill does three things. It deals with a Mrs. Singh, with a Mr. Song and with snoopers. This is exactly what we warned the Government would happen if they contined with the policy they were following. And now we are faced with a Bill to tighten up the definition of a White man. The hon. member for Vereeniging was concerned when he said that if he was a Coloured, he would admit it and be proud to admit it. I have no doubts about why he is supporting a change in the regulations, Mr. Speaker. If I had changed my political colours as often as the hon. member, I would not object to the changing of regulations which deal with other changes in the colour classification of any other person because if one is used to political chameleonship, then it matters not to him whether you are going to change the race classification of a person.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I say that this <span class="col_4521-4522" refersTo="page_0887"/>Bill, in terms of Clause 2, makes it possible to change the classification of the race of any person in South Africa. I say too that chameleon policy would not matter to any one who did not have at heart the welfare, the happiness and contentedness or security of all the peoples of South Africa. But once you accept a chameleon policy, a policy that to-day you can be White and to-morrow you can change the colour&#x2014;once you change the the law by which you classify a person every time you strike a Singh-Song difficulty, then you interfere with the security of every human being.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging made the statement that these human tragedies, which were so aptly described by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) were not the result of this Government&#x2019;s actions but had always been there in South Africa, and he said that was part of South African life. I want to ask the hon. the Minister when he replies to deal with what formed the first half of his speech, his thesis that since the introduction of the principal Act, which we are amending, the decision of society had been the right and just decision and had worked satisfactorily. The Minister spent half his speech establishing the justice with which the original definition had been applied, establishing that society had been the test and that society had determined the colour of a person and that it had worked, and worked correctly. The hon. member says that these things happened before and that there were hardships. I want to ask him if he rejects the decision of society which classified people before the original Act came into force? Before 1950 society dealt with these issues, and I believe dealt with them fairly and justly, as the hon. the Minister said to-night. It is not often that I agree with the hon. the Minister, but I agree with him there. Now that hon. member repudiates his own Minister and says that society failed, that society created hardships and tragedies. I challenge the hon. member to name one case of those generalizations he used. He mentioned the case of a school-child in Port Elizabeth. I challenge the hon. member to substantiate that claim here in this House, to give the date and the circumstances of that case.</p>

<p>The hon. member was a member of the Executive Committee of the Provincial Administration of the Transvaal which dealt with the education in the Transvaal. Under that hon. member Chinese were accepted and allowed in White schools and are to-day still allowed. The same Government to which the hon. the Minister belongs, who was himself also a member of the Executive Committee, allows the Chinese race into White schools in the Transvaal. They are now at this very moment angling for the membership of one Mr. Ben Burgers whom they say is a very good Nationalist at heart. His children go to school with Chinese in Johannesburg and their propagandists published a pamphlet alleging that was so during the last election. Yet that hon. Minister allowed it. Now under his own party, under his Government, that situation still exists. They are classified as Whites for the purpose of education in the Transvaal. That hon. member now tries to say that it was not the Nationalist Party Government but the United Party that caused hardships. Not the United Party but his own party recognizes the right of people, Chinese in this instance, to come to White schools and to enjoy their education together with his son or daughter if his son or daughter happens to be at that school. He is the hon. member who now comes here and talks of hardships at school. He cannot quote a case. He cannot give one single name because he knows that the names he could quote would not be cases of tragedy or hardship. He can&#x2019;t quote them because he does not know them, because he is using generalizations in regard to what happened in the past.</p>

<p>Will the hon. member allow me to put a question to him? Applications came before us asking for children to go to a White school. After investigation it was found that it was impossible to allow them. Even if we were as just as we could be, would these people themselves accept that decision as just? Would there be no hard case in any case?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says: If there was a case where a person quite clearly could not be admitted to a White school, and if that fact was accepted, would it be an injustice? No. No, the injustice is when violence is done to the dignity of people by artificial classifications which do not take into account the flexibility, of which the Minister bragged. He said that his administration of the Act had been flexible and that society applied flexibility. That is the issue to which I want to come, the issue of flexibility or inflexibility of definitions. Because the hon. member for Vereeniging who himself handled such cases, says that no injustice was done. If he applied flexibility and the decency and humanity of a civilized person, he would ensure that justice was done in every case. And the Minister brags of the justice which his department applies in respect of these classifications. And now deliberately and consciously in terms of this Bill before us, he is removing the human flexibility from this Bill. He is turning a measure, which to us is impracticable anyway, but which had at least an element of humanity in its administration,&#x2014;he is turning it now into a rigid, a cast-iron and inflexible definition in which the human element, the humanity and the justice and the decency of a sympathetic Christian South African approach is removed. And those cases on which the hon. member for Vereeniging was able to decide, on which he was able to sit and to judge and to decide in terms of what was his Christian duty, he would now have to regard in terms of a cold, hard definition on paper, a definition which leaves no flexibility, which leaves no room for humanity, for justice or for decency in its decisions. In terms of this amendment, which the hon. the Minister himself admitted was unintelligible as it stood here, there is no option given to the person who must make a decision. Hardship and tragedy? I have a case on my desk at this moment upstairs of of a man whose mother and father both are classified as White. They have White identity cards, with &#x201C;W&#x201D; after their number, and their son who is as White as the hon.

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes;</li>

<li>(2) no; and</li>

<li><p>(3) in so far as import facilities for the motor industry are concerned, the position is that permit issues for the second half of 1962 provide for an expansion in the retail sales of motor vehicles, as approximately 42,000 units will be available for that purpose during the period referred to in comparison with 37,000 units for the first half of 1962 and 34,000 units sold during the second half of 1961.</p>

<p>A general discussion of this matter with representatives of the industry took place on 12 March 1962, and it is, therefore, incorrect to say that the expansion and operation of the motor industry are being held up owing to a lack of knowledge of Government policy in this regard. On the contrary, it can justly be stated that the present policy of the Government provides an appreciable stimulus for the expansion and operations of the motor industry.</p></li></ol>

<p>In 1955 all churches and missionary bodies, except the Roman Catholic Church and the Seventh Day Adventists, decided to transfer all their schools to community control. For religious reasons the two last-mentioned churches preferred to retain responsibility of educating the children of members of their respective churches. As the Roman Catholic Church offers religious instruction in its mission schools according to its own curriculum and refuses to offer the non-denominational curriculum of the Department to non-Catholic children, and also refuses to allow ministers or evangelists of other churches to enter their schools for the purpose of giving religious instruction to their own adherents as is being done in community schools, the limitation has been placed on the attendance of their mission schools.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of the Interior, upon which an amendment had been moved by Sir de Villiers Graaff, adjourned on 26 April, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) for publicly accepting the statement I made last night. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that I had not intended bringing this matter into the debate, because I do not think it is wise to deal with a matter affecting the whole life of a person across the floor of the House, but I was provoked into doing so by the statement that this amendment before the House makes no difference to the position and cannot affect people already classified in terms of the original Act which is now being amended. This sort of case is a perfect example of how this Bill does, in fact, affect the lives of people already classified. It is a perfect illustration of the point I made last night, that the Minister is exchanging the flexibility of the decision of society for the rigidity of a rule which takes the decision out of his hands and out of the hands of any official in his Department, because this is the case where two parents have both been classified as White, have been registered as White and have identity cards determining them as White. But, in terms of a document, a record, the child of those two White parents is classified as being Coloured, of mixed birth. Now, in terms of this amendment before the House, that person&#x2019;s colour must be tested against the new rules which this amendment is introducing, and, in terms of those rules, what ultimately counts is the fact. The Minister made it quite clear that he was moving an amendment to make it so, that no matter what a person may claim or what society may determine, and no matter what a person may look like, these tests will be superseded and the overriding test will be the fact, if there is a conflict with fact. So, if the fact shows that a person has any Coloured blood whatever, even though his parents may be White, then the Minister and his Department are obliged to classify that person as Coloured. A family may have been White for generations and accepted as White, and they may have lived as Whites for four or five generations. That person may claim to be White to-day, but, in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s amendment which he has now introduced, if that person should say: &#x201C;I am White, but I admit that 200 years ago there was colour in my family&#x201D;, then that person has admitted to having Coloured blood. Therefore, in terms of this amendment, the Minister will be forced to classify him as Coloured, although he comes from a family which for generations has been regarded as White because of his admission of mixed blood perhaps 200 years ago. Then those hon. members come with this nonsense that this Bill makes no difference, that it will not create additional hardship and that it will not affect people already classified. I repeat that this Bill substitutes the test of fact for the test of society. The Minister is discarding the test of society. He is throwing it overboard for a song. He is discarding a test which he himself accepted in the introduction of this measure as being the test which he was satisfied was the best test for this country. I called this a snooper Bill, a Singh-Song <span class="col_4537-4538" refersTo="page_0895"/>snooper Bill. This is the snooper part of the Bill, the part which introduces the test of fact which the Minister must apply. He will remember&#x2014;it is common knowledge&#x2014;that at one time under this Government a witchhunt was started to get people taken off the common voters&#x2019; roll on the ground that they were not White, that they were Coloured, a witch-hunt which required an investigation into the antecedents of people. That witch-hunt reached the stage of embarrassment when people were saying: &#x201C;Certainly, classify me as Coloured, but then you must also classify my cousin, Mr. So-and-So, and my uncle, Mr. So-and-So.&#x201D; It became a little difficult, because when they investigated those claims they found that persons whom they had never contemplated in the original investigation were involved. Now the Minister is re-introducing the machinery for that witch-hunt, which can go back into a person&#x2019;s history and involve not only that person but hundreds of others as well. One clause of this Bill empowers any person to be appointed to start an investigation into the background of a person to obtain the facts required for the register. The Minister is now going to re-start a practice which his own Government was forced to put aside because of the confusion and the embarrassment it created. We already have a suicide lane in South Africa for those who stray off the road which society has laid down, the accepted pattern of life. Now the Minister is changing a suicide by-way into a suicide highway, because he can imagine what will happen when that official, who will be known, starts to knock on doors and starts to make inquiries into the antecedents of people, starts to ask among a man&#x2019;s friends: Do you know this person&#x2019;s mother, or his grandfather, or his great-grandfather? Once that inquiry is made, the finger of suspicion has been pointed at that person, and the Minister can work out for himself what the consequences will be of starting that sort of investigation.</p>

<p>The object of this Bill, clearly and unashamedly admitted by the Minister and his colleagues, is to make it more difficult for a person to become White. It is not to make it easier to classify a person. It is not designed to obtain a fairer test; it is designed to make it more difficult for a person to be classified as White. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) last night, and I think the Minister and others, said: &#x201C;If I were Coloured I would be proud and admit it; there is nothing wrong with being classified as Coloured.&#x201D; The hon. member for Vereeniging may not think so, but of the 3.000-odd cases where appeals have been lodged, what percentage&#x2014;not even 1 per cent&#x2014;of those appeals were in order to be classified from White to Coloureds? They were all appeals to be classified from Black to Coloured, or from Coloured to White. They were all appeals to be classified &#x201C;upwards&#x201D;. Why does society &#x201C;try for White&#x201D; if there is no hardship involved in being classified as a Coloured? What is it which makes all these people on the border line try to become accepted as Whites if there is no stigma and no hardship and no reason for their wanting to be classified as White? Obviously the facts make nonsense of this argument. This provision, the preventing of people from being classified as White if there is any excuse whatever for it, is the Song part of the measure, and is designed to deal with one person. Thus all the marginal cases between White and non-White must be prejudiced. The whole of that group of tens of thousands of what the late Leader of this party, General Smuts, called the &#x201C;unclassifiables&#x201D; must now be put into the straitjacket of the test which seeks every single possible cause for them to be declared as non-Whites. If they do not look White, they may not be declared as Whites. If they have in their history any Coloured blood, they must be declared as non-Whites. If they admit to any Coloured blood themselves, they must become non-Whites&#x2014;three additional tests every one of which is against people being classified as Whites. And for what reason? Because one person was able, on purely legal grounds, to become classified as White and the Minister did not like it. Hon. members say yes, but there is a vice versa to this; there were 15 people who were classified as White and who appealed and asked to be classified as non-Whites. I challenge the hon. member for Vereeniging and the Minister who made that statement to deny that in all those cases there was a love element. Those people were trying to avoid other legislation, the Mixed Marriages Act or the Immorality Act, and because their partners could not be declared White they themselves decided to give up their White status. Those are the 15 cases. In every case which I have ever seen publicized&#x2014;there may be others which the Minister knows about&#x2014;of people applying to be classified as Coloureds instead of Whites&#x2014;there has been a love element, as there was in the Singh case, the Singh part of this Bill, where a White person wished to be classified as an Asian, and that applies in most of the other cases. The Minister may know of one or two individual cases where because of association and because of family background a person wanted to go back into the society from which he had come, but the overriding consideration and objective of everyone is to come up into the White group. This measure is making what was initially bad even worse. I do not know whether we really are crazy in South Africa, but we deliberately create a situation where a father and mother can be White, a son can be declared an Asian, a daughter can be declared White and another sister or brother can be declared Coloured, depending merely on how they look, and on the test of any admission which they may make, merely because of this or other factors which some official is going to apply to the complex problems of humanity and genetics. [Interjection.] I think we are crazy. There is no doubt about it, when you consider this Bill, that we are giving that impression to the world, when we are able to divide a family and classify people in one family into different races <span class="col_4539-4540" refersTo="page_0896"/>because of a definition, and when we find that definition creates anomalies we come along with another definition which creates even greater anomalies. I think Lewis Carroll must have had some foresight of this Government when he said: &#x201C;I will make words mean what I want them to mean.&#x201D; What do words mean? What do the words &#x201C;White&#x201D; and &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; mean? The Minister had an answer. We were challenged to say what the United Party test is of a White man. The Minister himself gave our test, the test of society, which has worked for 300 years in South Africa. We do not believe that any single official or human being has a better right to judge his fellow man&#x2019;s colour than the society in which that person moves. Ever since the introduction of this Bill we have said: &#x201C;Let society deal with those matters which are the responsibility of society.&#x201D; And the Minister agreed with us. He agreed with us in introducing this Bill, but he said that because people had abused his humanitarian approach and outlook it was necessary to close the gap. Do you abuse humanity, do you abuse justice, do you abuse what the Minister calls his generosity in regard to appeals? This Government is like the man who pushes someone into the sea and then seeing a policeman coming he dives in to try to save him, and then says, &#x201C;Look how brave I am; I tried to save this person from drowning&#x201D;. It is not whether you try to save the odd person; it is who pushed that person into the sea, and by its own admission this Government had pushed over 3,000 people into the position where they have had to appeal in regard to their classification.</p>

<p>Then finally comes the ultimate nonsense of this Bill, and that is when you come to the Chinese and the Japanese. I ask the Minister to tell this House very clearly where the Japanese come into this picture, whether they are to be tested by the pig iron in their purse or the pigment in their skin? What is to be the test for people of Japanese origin? I ask the Minister to tell us very clearly what the test will be. I do not know whether the Minister has seen reports in the Press about the position of Chinese and Japanese in South Africa as it affects their treatment in hotels. It reads like a complete farce to see the explanation of where they are going to fit into our race pattern. So I ask the Minister to give this House a clear explanation of the position of the Chinese and the Japanese and other races of dark skin. What about the South American countries, Brazilians, Mexicans and the people of the East, or Mauritians? Where are their descendants in South Africa to fall in the pattern of race classification? What is a Mexican to be declared as if he lives in South Africa? Is he to become White or Coloured? What is the Mauritian to be declared, varying from pure White down to a dark skin, and some of the Southern European races, some of the Latin races? Where are they to fall? What about the Polynesians and the Indonesians? Where are they to fall in this classification? Because if you pass a law which lays down a test, then that test applies to every person who is subject to the law of South Africa, and this Minister cannot blandly talk of Whites and Coloureds as though they were the only people affected. He must tell this House where the others fit in, and because he cannot do that we on this side of the House regard this Bill as making an impossible position even more impossible and we will oppose it to the end.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) said that the Bill makes it &#x201C;more difficult to become White&#x201D;. Those words contain an admission that the person who applies is not White, otherwise why would &#x201C;it make it more difficult to become White&#x201D;? This is in fact the whole object of the Bill, to classify. This amendment before us to-day has come as the result of the Song case in Durban. The whole object of the Bill is to classify the races into different groups, and Song admitted that he was a Chinese and he therefore does not belong to the group we are discussing here, viz. the White group. He is not a White man and therefore this legislation becomes necessary.</p>

<p>I am sure no member of the Opposition would allow his son or daughter to marry such a person. Then why raise these objections to the Bill? It is just to imitate the liberals and to oppose the apartheid favoured by us, but in spite of that, when it comes to the point, they definitely refuse to have anything to do with such a person. I am sure the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) will be the last man to allow his children one day to marry such &#x201C;hard luck&#x201D; and borderline cases who are allowed in the White group. You may laugh now, but that is the truth. You will not even allow your children to associate with them.</p>

<p>I feel that these borderline cases should definitely not be classified as Whites. Why <span class="col_4541-4542" refersTo="page_0897"/>should my children suffer because the ancestors of one of those persons sinned? We know that the Bible tells us that the sins of the father will be visited on the children even unto the third and fourth generation. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) says there is only 1 per cent or 2 per cent of these people, and what difference does it make if they are classified in the White group? But should we not protect that other 99 per cent or 98 per cent who are pure White? [Interjections.] It is easy for the hon. member for Houghton to talk because she belongs to the Progressive Party and she is one of the persons who favour it, but I am sure she will not allow such a borderline case to enter her home or to marry one of her children. They talk very easily but they will not do it in practice. I ask why we should not protect that 98 per cent who are pure White. A farmer is proud of his thoroughbred animals and will not allow them to be crossed with inferior breeds. Why should we as Whites allow non-Whites to marry our children and to beget another non-White race? We are just as proud of our White heritage as the Coloured or the Bantu is of his. They do not want miscegenation, so why should we allow it?</p>

<p>I have said that I welcome this amendment because it protects my children so that they will not be able to marry borderline cases and produce children of mixed blood. Then there will really be tears and &#x201C;hard luck&#x201D; cases. I fully support this amendment.</p>

<p>I have said that the Song case made it necessary to introduce this amendment. I took the trouble to study the evidence in the Song case. Although the definition in the principal Act stated that a person must ordinarily pass as a White person, it clearly appears that all those who made statements declaring Song, who admits that he is a Chinese, to be a White man, did not regard him as a White man, but that they treated him as a White man, and there is a big difference between regarding and treating someone in that way. I may treat my servant like a White man, but I still do not regard him as such, and that is what happened here. They treated Song as a White man and made statements to the effect that they regarded him as White. Many of those statements indicate this. Therefore I say there is a big difference between treating and regarding. I am glad the Minister has now introduced this Bill to remove this ambiguity and to make it quite clear who is White and who is not.</p>

<p>The hon. member who spoke just before me mentioned the ridiculous case of people having been regarded as White for 200 years and whose descendants might now admit that they are not quite White, and therefore they must be classified as non-White. That is why Section 4 is now being amended. Do hon. members opposite think anyone would be so unreasonable, after having investigated the matter and found that the person&#x2019;s family have been regarded as Whites for 200 years, as then to classify him in a different group? [Interjections.] If a person is so irresponsible as to say that he belongs to a race other than the one into which he was born, if he and his family have been regarded as Whites for 200 years, then the person appointed in terms of Section 4 will go into the matter, and surely nobody will be so unreasonable as to find that such a person is in fact a non-White. Surely that is ridiculous.</p>

I do not know why hon. members do not want to accept the Minister&#x2019;s word that this Bill will not be applied in the way they suggest. I welcome this Bill, and I am glad that the Act will be amended in such a way that in future we will be sure that when a person obtains an identity card on which there is a &#x201C;W&#x201D; (for White), he will indeed be a White person. That is in the interest of the preservation of the White race here in South Africa. I give the Bill my full support and I am glad that the Minister is now amending the Act in such a way that in future there will be no doubt at all.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to answer on one point that the hon. member has raised. He raised the difficulty of a White perhaps marrying a Coloured by descent. I suggest that even without this legislation that position is covered, because any such marriage would be a mixed marriage and therefore void under the existing law. Consequently there is no need for a race classification register to achieve that.</p>

<p>I would like to follow to some extent the lines followed by the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller), and I am sorry that he is not here this morning. He said that we should devote ourselves to trying to make the best possible definition out of this one. That is an attitude that this side of the House has adopted on occasions even within my knowledge. In the Group Areas Bill that came before this House this year we made certain suggestions because we thought the Bill could be improved. In some cases I think those suggestions were accepted, and certain other improvements were made. But here we feel that very much the best help that we can give to the country and to the Government is by advancing reasons why they should rather leave the matter where it is. We would, of course, like to see the whole law repealed, but that is not possible. But we certainly feel that it should not be taken any further than it has already been taken. Hon. members opposite who again repeated this entirely unjustified and. I suggest irritating charge of sabotage against this side, should know that if we cannot persuade the Government to accept <span class="col_4543-4544" refersTo="page_0898"/>our point of view, we must try to persuade the country. And I am quite certain in this regard that we do in fact get the ear of the sort of people in the West that we want to attract. It is no good saying that our talking harms the Government abroad. The Bill itself does all the harm that can be done in that regard. They might hope, as we will continue to hope, that the Government will see the wisdom of a softer approach in these matters. We are looking for it ourselves, and so are people overseas. There are doubtless many people overseas who meet members of the Government, and who cannot believe that they will persist with this legislation and indeed with increasing the pressures of this legislation. We ourselves find it difficult, knowing friends on the Government side, to appreciate why they do bring this legislation and then, as it were, seem to give a further twist to things.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ceres asked us to examine whether there are any merits in this. And I would like to see shortly if there are and, if so, to mention a few of the disadvantages too. In the first place, one of the disadvantages is that the Minister himself has not said that there is any lack of clarity in this old definition; he has said that it has worked well; the only difficulty is the application. Now indeed the application will be made more difficult, I suggest, because whereas before you can say that general acceptance was virtually the only test that the Department had to apply, now they have to apply that test and they have to apply the appearance test. This question of judging whether a person is White by appearance is a most difficult task. I suggest that it would baffle Solomon himself. Because, although we describe the people to be classified here as Whites and Coloureds, etc., previously the definition was &#x201C;Europeans&#x201D; as far as the English language was concerned, and that too is a most difficult thing to ascertain. Secondly this Bill clearly enlarges the scope of investigations that must be made into people&#x2019;s private affairs. To that extent it adds a further burden to officials who have very rightly been acclaimed for their humanity and consideration in approaching the existing Act. But this Bill, by virtue of Clause 4, which introduces Section 12 (b), amends and takes further the principle that was laid down in the judgment of Mr. Justice Snyman in the case of M v. the Population Registration Office. In that particular case, as hon. members know, he laid down that the reports of people, perhaps officials, who have to inquire into matters that are relevant, were not appropriately to be taken into account. This new provision allows that, and clearly therefore greatly extends the scope of the inquiry and the burden of anybody who has to undertake any inquiry. I would like just on this point, since obviously there is a very grave risk that this Bill will pass into law, to ask the hon. the Minister to bear in mind that this provision here seems to make it possible for him to appoint as investigators persons who are not within the Public Service, and therefore imbued with that tradition. It seems to make it possible to appoint incidental people to go about these investigations, because it says&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, even a private detective. One knows from one&#x2019;s experience that often you get very unsatisfactory results accruing in such cases. I do therefore ask the hon. the Minister to watch that particularly in the administration of this Bill.</p>

<p>A third grave disadvantage is this whole question of re-classification which has been brought forward by many members on this side The hon. the Minister did give an assurance about re-classifications. I think I am correct in saying that he has said that where people have been classified there will be no re-classification. I think he meant to convey that where people had an identity card issued to them, naturally, as it follows upon classification, those people are regarded by him as having been classified. We welcome that assurance very much. But I am just a little bit afraid that he did say that it was still possible to re-classify because circumstances were always changing, and as I understood him he did not entirely close the door to the possible re-classification of people in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>The Act allows it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The Act certainly allows it, and we naturally hope very much that the Minister will accept a variation of the Act, which will write his assurance into the Act. But if that cannot be obtained, then let us at any rate try and get from him a clear assurance that there will be no re-classification whatsoever of these people at any rate&#x2014;to put it at its lowest&#x2014;as the result of the amended definition of a White person. Of course, we would welcome an amendment to the Bill very much indeed, and it is very important to have that amendment, because, as has been said by many members, this Minister may have the very best intentions&#x2014;and we accept that he has; but circumstances may change or other Ministers may take charge of this Department, and a different view may be taken. There will consequently be grave uncertainty and suspense and anxiety for all these people. On this point I am convinced that hon. members opposite, being Members of Parliament, must like ourselves be approached on many occasions to help people with the procedures to be followed for classification. I am quite certain that they must appreciate the personal heartburning and miseries, not to say tragedies, which are involved. I am sure therefore that they must be glad, having heard the Minister&#x2019;s assurance, to support us in seeking to have this assurance written into the law, which will then merely go as far as he himself is prepared to go.</p>

<p><span class="col_4545-4546" refersTo="page_0899"/>One little point which I should be glad if the Minister will clarify, if he has not already done so, is this: Clause 1 introducing the new definition has a proviso which reads, &#x201C;but does not include any person who admits that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person&#x201D;, and then there is the further amendment that the Minister has introduced. We would just like to be certain that his intention is, and that indeed the advice of his legal advisers is that these words give effect to that intention, namely that this proviso covers both (a) and (b) of the definition. It would seem that is the case but we would like to have an assurance on that point.</p>

<p>So much for some of the disadvantages which have just occurred to me, over and above those which have been put before the House by other hon. members. So far as any possible pros are concerned I find it very difficult to see them. The hon. the Minister has said that this will prevent people making an ass of the law. Well, one quite agrees that it is bad to have people making an ass of the law. But I suggest that just as it is true that where is a will there is a way, so where there is a law there is a loophole; and there will doubtless be loopholes here. Indeed members from this side have pointed to many loopholes and many new difficulties which can be seized upon. I would suggest that if one was not too concerned about these few loopholes, they would not enjoy the sort of publicity that they sometimes do get, and consequently the damage that is aimed at would not in fact seem so important.</p>

<p>Then there is a further point that the hon. the Minister mentioned. In introducing this Bill he did name 15 cases, I think, where people, having been classified as Whites, sought to be re-classified as Coloureds. The first point I want to make here is that it seems that very few cases are really covered there. Should the law concern itself with so few cases? There is the well-known maxim of the law <i>de minimis non curat lax:</i> the law does not concern itself with minor matters. Here the law is coming in to introduce an amendment and it seems that the law would be wiser to remain out. Then I would like to say this to the hon. the Minister: I suggest that the very point that he makes, namely that he has had these 15 cases where people have been classified as Whites and have then had to be re-classified as Coloureds, really shows the unwisdom of having this law Act at all, because what would have been the position before the Act? You would perhaps have had people &#x201C;trying for White&#x201D; as the expression is, and perhaps succeeding up to a point and then something going wrong so that it was no longer possible to maintain that position, as the Minister says is the case now. Those people would then have accepted that position and there would have been no heartburning; there would have been no extra unhappiness caused by first having to go through the process of classification and then re-classification. That, I suggest, is the way in which things happen normally and did happen before.</p>

<p>Now I would like to react to the speech of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), who said that this side of the House standing for race federation would have to maintain this Act. He accused us of political hypocrisy in opposing it. I suggest that is not so. Before this original Act was ever thought of there were, it is true, the various customs and conventions and laws of this country which took note of the different race groups. Thus it was well known very soon after the 1936 Act, if not before, roughly who were Natives&#x2014;indeed very clearly who were Natives. It was quite well known before this Act who in fact were Natives, and that would still be so for purposes of any race federation. And the same applies to the Indians. There were countless Acts; there was the Act which permitted Indians to be paid a bonus if they returned to India. That Act alone, presumably, was enough to help establish who in fact were Indians. And under the race federation policy there is no intention of classifying Coloureds. They will be treated as part of the Western group. But in fact, if for any purposes they have a group of their own, there will always be the Electoral Laws of before 1950, in terms of which Coloured people did have a special registration qualification with which they complied. I suggest therefore that there is no justification for the change of the hon. member for Heilbron in that regard. These things cannot be completely precise. We are finding now that this Act cannot work precisely either.</p>

<p>Surely whether you have this Act or another Act, you must have a classification?</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>You see, Sir, the hon. member again says that there will be classification. But the fact is that here you have a register; that is why it has been called a stud-book by some people because it is a register. These things should happen in accordance with the test which the hon. the Minister praised so much when he referred to the &#x201C;openbare mening, die gemeenskapsgevoel&#x201D;. These things did happen in that way. Perhaps these adjustments were effected in the pastor&#x2019;s presbytery: perhaps they did sometimes happen in the office of the school principal, but these things happened gently and imperceptibly. No one can deny that up to 1950, if there was any classification, as the hon. member says, it happened with the very least possible injury to people&#x2019;s feelings, so much so that I make bold to say that it was not noticed as classification.</p>

<p>There is a last point I want to make; I just want to leave it as a thought with the hon. the Minister. He has said, &#x201C;As dit by u &#x00EA;rens is en as u net so trots op u Blanke vel is soos ek, sal u nie toelaat dat ander mense by die agterdeur inkom nie&#x201D;. I hope I have quoted him correctly. It is conceded therefore that this is a Bill to prevent people who the <span class="col_4547-4548" refersTo="page_0900"/>legislature regards to-day as non-Whites from becoming Whites.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<p>I think it would be common cause between us that certain people who by the test to-day, by the tests from time to time, would not be or were not regarded as Whites, have become Whites. There have not been many. And, of course, this side of the House has always taken up the attitude that this is not a serious problem; indeed we adopt the attitude that the Europeans have maintained their position here and their identity, notwithstanding 300 years of contact with Africa. But the point I want to make is this. The Minister says that he is very proud of the White people, and of course the White people have tremendous achievements to their credit; we hope there will be many more and I am sure there will. But when the Minister is speaking of the Whites, as they are regarded even by him to-day, he includes many people who we are agreed had this test been adopted say, 50 years ago, would not have been included. Consequently you have the position that he is proud of everybody who is regarded by the Government as White and as I have stressed, some of them would perhaps not have been classified as White had this definition been adopted in the past. We are therefore going to use this test of public opinion at this particular point of time in our history. Now, in the very nature of things there is a change in that regard from time to time, and in the very nature of things the circumstances of individuals vary from time to time, as the Minister himself has said. I suggest therefore&#x2014;and I intend to give offence to no one in saying this and it is a thought that the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite should consider&#x2014;that had this classification definition been adopted, say, 100 or 50 years ago, the composition of the people would have been somewhat different. But notwithstanding what has happened in the past we are extremely proud of White South Africans for their achievements, not to mention the other races who have great achievements and who are fine people. What therefore is the great fear and need to close this tiny door, and again to re-open the wound, and for the Government to do itself injury in the eyes of so many people?</p>

<p>I do no want to try to reply fully to the speech of the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson). The hon. member addressed his remarks to the hon. the Minister and I am sure that the hon. the Minister will reply to the questions that he put to him. I just want to express my appreciation of the calm and reasoned way in which the hon. member stated his case and the fact that in doing so he stirred up little emotion. I shall try to do the same. I just want to say that we on this side of the House also view with great sympathy this great human problem which forms the background to this discussion. We on this side of the House also have the very greatest sympathy for people who are affected by the racial set-up in South Africa, and when we move about in the streets of our cities and travel in the country and see these people in their houses, in their schools and on their playgrounds, we look at them with very great sympathy and we ask ourselves where we can fit them in in South Africa so that they can be as happy in this country as we should like everybody in our country to be. That is my approach to this matter and it is in that spirit that I should like to say a few words about it. But I want to say that since yesterday it has become clear to me in this debate that there is a deep gulf between us on the Government side and hon. members of the Opposition. There is a gulf between us which in my opinion is unbridgeable in this specific case. The Opposition is inexorably opposed to the amendment of this Act because it was inexorably opposed also to the principal Act. The attitude that the Opposition is adopting to-day is only logical; it cannot really adopt a different attitude. The Opposition strongly opposes this amending Bill because it refuses to accept the idea of race classification and seeks to bring it into discredit. The Opposition rejects this principle <i>in toto.</i> As I have said, from their point of view I do not really blame them, because that is only a logical consequence of their whole attitude in the past, but it does reveal once again that on this point there is a great difference between us in principle.</p>

<p>It is because there is this difference between us that the Opposition is not willing to co-operate to bring about any improvement in the existing Act of 1950 Neither is the Opposition willing to try to make the best out of a bad case, from its point of view, and that is why it is this Government&#x2019;s responsibility to put through this amending Bill, just as it was the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to put the principal Act on to the Statute Book. It is also the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to account to the country for<span class="col_4549-4550" refersTo="page_0901"/> this amending Bill, just as it was accountable for the passing of the principal Act. We are prepared to meet the country on reasonable grounds, on grounds of which we are convinced. But because we on this side of the House and the Minister are responsible for the implementation of the principal Act, it is perfectly logical, if the Act shows defects in the course of time, that those defects be remedied, otherwise the Government would have on the Statute Book an Act which cannot be properly implemented. I have asked myself this question: In spite of everything that has been said here, is there not some measure of agreement; have we not found some point of contact with the Opposition in this matter? It seems to me that there is one point where we are on common ground to some small extent, and that is on this question of the test of acceptance, the test of public opinion. Because if I understand the Opposition correctly, it has been said repeatedly by some of their speakers that the community will be the judge; that the opinion of the community is a fair opinion; that the opinion of society is the opinion by which we should allow ourselves to be guided in these matters. I want to say that is a very good idea; that it is certainly the ideal. I suppose the ideal is that the law must correspond with the practice, and conversely, what the community has been saying throughout the years should be reflected in our legislation. I should like now to try to prove that not only the old Act of 1950 but also the amending Bill which is now before the House tries to comply with this test of public opinion. Let me read out Clause 1 (a) of this amending Bill. It says specifically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A White person means a person who in appearance obviously is a white person and who is not generally accepted as a Coloured person.</block>

<p>There it is specifically stated that the person concerned must not be accepted as a Coloured. That is the test which the community applies to that person&#x2014;the Coloured community and the White community. That is the test of public opinion for which the Opposition pleaded. If he is not classified as a Coloured by the community, he is accepted as a White person. No other interpretation can be attached to Clause 1 (a): A person who in appearance is a White person and who, according to the test of society, is not a Coloured person. I feel, therefore, that the test that has been accepted generally in this House, both by this side and by the Opposition, is the test that we can use in connection with Clause 1 (a). There is nothing in this clause, therefore, that worries me.</p>

<p>But now we come to Clause 1 (b), which adds the words, &#x201C;and who is not in appearance obviously not a White person&#x201D;. In connection with Clause 1 (b), I should like to distinguish between what one would call a normal case, if one can talk about normal cases in regard to this whole problem, and abnormal cases. I contend that in normal cases, the cases that we have dealt with in past years, the position remains what it has always been: A person who is generally accepted as a White person. I submit that Clause 1 (b) will apply in the future to those people in precisely the same way as in the past. But if in appearance a person is obviously not a White person, if the Minister or the Secretary or the Director thinks so, it the Appeal Board thinks so, if the Supreme Court of his province thinks so, why then should we force him into the White category? I say, therefore, that this provision has not been inserted for normal cases, for the artificial cases.</p>

<p>This provision has only been inserted for abnormal cases, and here I should like the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) to listen. We had such a case here yesterday evening when the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) talked about the signatures of those 350 Whites in connection with the case of the Chinese. When the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) spoke subsequently he said: &#x201C;Let us take a far-fetched case. Let us assume that those 350 people had declared that they accepted a Bantu, a Native, as a White person.&#x201D; The hon. member for Ceres then asked the Opposition: &#x201C;What would you do with the Native in such a case; would you also accept him as a White person?&#x201D; At that moment I looked at the hon. member for Turffontein, and I saw and heard him say &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. I declare in this House that I was watching his face and, when the hon. member for Ceres asked whether in that case they would also accept that Native as a White person, the hon. member for Turffontein said, &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>No, the hon. member did not add anything; he simply said &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, and I am willing to put that on record in this House. I want to say at once that I do not contend that the whole of the Opposition would have given that reply. But that is the sort of abnormal case that I am dealing with here, and it is to deal with that type of abnormal case that this addition has been inserted and the loophole in the Act closed. But with the assurance that the hon. the Minister has given, and with the right of appeal for which the Act provides to the Appeal Court and to the Supreme Court, I am convinced that abnormal cases will be dealt with as in the past, on both appearance and acceptance. On that basis I support Clause 1 (b). and I give my unqualified support to the whole of this Bill.</p>

<p>But now the Opposition says that there will be further exclusion in respect of people who will admit that they are Natives or Coloured persons. In that regard the hon. the Minister has introduced an amendment which says: &#x201C;Unless it is proved that admission is not based on facts.&#x201D; That does not worry me at all, because what will be the facts that<span class="col_4551-4552" refersTo="page_0902"/> will be adduced to prove that it is a false admission? If for some reason or other I personally were to go and admit that I was a Coloured, what would be the facts that would prove that my admission is not based on facts? Those facts would be my descent, my parents, my friends, my brothers. Regard will be had not only to my parents, but to my acceptance, to my descent. These are the facts that would prove that my admission was obviously a false admission. I am quite satisfied, therefore, that this clause should be inserted in the Bill. I should just like to ask the Minister, if I may, whether he will perhaps consider meeting the difficulty which the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) has also mentioned again, the difficulty which worries the Opposition, and that is the difficulty of reclassification of people who have already been classified under the old definition, because, if such people ever have to be reclassified for some reason, the legal position will be that there will only be one definition, and that is the definition presently under consideration, because the old one will have been repealed. I want to ask the Minister whether he can go into that matter and give the House an assurance that will satisfy all of us. That is all I have to say with regard to this matter, which is a delicate one, and which is the outcome of the course on which we have embarked. I feel, therefore, that we should deal with this matter in such a way that we do the least harm to ourselves as Whites and to the prestige of this House in general. For these reasons I support the Bill, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to carry out his policy in the future, as in the past, with the greatest measure of circumspection and sympathy, in the interests of all groups and in the interests of our country.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t intend to answer the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) in full. I would like to say that he ended his speech in the spirit in which I want to begin mine, and that is to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to withdraw this Bill. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I intend to be constructive and that I do not intend to use the tragedies of certain people as a political football in this debate. I want to give the hon. the Minister the assurance that I am sincere in my appeal to him to withdraw this Bill, and to consider another type of amendment which would meet the objections which the hon. the Minister has. The hon. Minister already shakes his head. Now to talk to a Minister who is adamant is difficult enough, but I want the Minister to understand that he is using a few instances which he has brought to our notice, to bring in an amending Act which is, as the hon. Leader of the Opposition rightly said, vicious. The hon. the Minister is using a tenton tractor to level a little antheap. That is what the Minister is doing. I am going to show to the hon. the Minister how dangerous this amending Bill is, and how easily his objections could be met by a much simpler amendment to the principal Act. First of all, I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that his definition of appearance is very dangerous, and in fact most of the cases which are being investigated or which were investigated, arose because the enumerators in 1951 acted on appearance. I am informed that where people gave information that they were of a certain race and the enumerator thought, judging by their appearance, that the information was wrong, he put a question-mark on their forms. He judged their appearance, and he was the cause of these people being investigated, merely because the enumerator thought that on appearance certain people should be investigated. My authority for this statement is none other than the former Minister of the Interior, Mr. Naud&#x00E9;, who said in 1959 (Hansard, Vol. 101, Col. 6927)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am told that when the census was taken in 1951, it was left to the enumerator who saw that the form was filled in, to put a question-mark on the form where he was uncertain about the classification given by the party who filled in the form.</block>

<p>So you see, that as a result of that question-mark on those forms, merely by appearance, hundreds and hundreds of people had to suffer the indignity of having to prove that they were White, and the danger was &#x201C;judging on appearance&#x201D;. If that had not taken place, if appearance had not been the crux in the matter, you would not have had so many people investigated. The hon. the Minister knows the trouble that is being experienced in the City of Cape Town, and possibly also in other towns, as a result of judging by appearance. Does the hon. the Minister know the difficulty in regard to swimming baths, swimming pools to throw out little boys because of their dark appearance? How often does it not happen that they say &#x201C;but I come from a White family&#x201D;. Does the hon. Minister know the difficulties experienced in parks and gardens where you have notice boards &#x201C;Europeans only&#x201D;, where the official in charge has to say to a little boy &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t come in here, because it is for Europeans only&#x201D;, and then getting the reply &#x201C;but I come from a White family&#x201D;? Does the hon. the Minister know the amount of trouble and tragedy that results from judging on appearance? And the hon. the Minister wants this Parliament to throw overboard &#x201C;acceptance by the community&#x201D; in favour of appearance&#x201D;! I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he realizes what he is doing? I have had a lot of experience in this matter. How many cases have I not brought to the gentleman in charge at Roeland Street, where a person&#x2019;s face was on the dark side but his body was pure white? Are you going to judge by the face of a man, or are you going to strip these people to see whether a man&#x2019;s body is white? What does the hon. the Minister mean by &#x201C;appearance&#x201D;? Is he only going to judge his face? Because if that is so, there are a lot of members in this House who will be in jeopardy of losing their seats. I am not trying to be facetious. I know of many cases where young-</p>

Why were they disbanded? Because they passed everybody who applied. I know that they fell foul of the authorities in Pretoria. This board in Cape Town which consisted of a magistrate and two officials was disbanded because they judged in favour of applicants to the consternation of the officials in Pretoria.

<p>May I ask the hon. member how he can discover loopholes without taking the case to court?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>My answer is: How many judgments have there been when the law as a result of such judgment was altered? It happens once in a blue moon. As a result of administrative experience Acts are amended, but very seldom are Acts amended because of a judgment of the court. It is a most dangerous and pernicious system for any government to amend an Act merely because a judgment goes against their policy. And it affected only one family. In the last case that was quoted, the court held that the Registrar could not investigate such a case, that an investigation was not permitted. So promptly the the hon. the Minister brings in a Bill and says that he can appoint an investigator. It has been pointed out already how dangerous that can be, and I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that he should withdraw the Act because I realize the danger of this amendment and the danger of permitting people, informers, to have their way. This will give the informers a wonderful opportunity. All they have to do is to go to the Department and make an affidavit that A who has been declared a White person is in fact a Coloured man by descent.</p>

<p>I come to the next point. The hon. the Minister has said, and I accept his <i>bona fides</i> despite our disagreements politically, and despite the fact that the Minister thinks I don&#x2019;t know much about law, that the admission to which he referred in this Bill is not a dangerous procedure. The hon. the Minister will never convince us of that. Let me give an example to the hon. the Minister. An application is made. Now the Government must realize that people who are pure-White do not have to make an application. Only people on whose form a question mark has been placed, or in respect of whom the 1951 Census indicated &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;, who are investigated. Now you have a young boy or girl who was 10 years old say in 1951, and who has now reached the age of 21. Possibly he left his home years ago and lived as a White person. He is accented as White. Suddenly he finds that he or she cannot get an identification card. May I say that I acknowledge that the Government has acted humanely in these cases. But this person comes and says: &#x201C;For years I have lived as a White person. I have worked in a White office, I have worked on the Railways, and I now find that there is a skeleton in my cupboard.&#x201D;The question is put to him: Are you White by descent? The person says &#x201C;Yes I am, I think so&#x201D;. &#x201C;Oh, no,&#x201D; says the official, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t agree. I have your 1951 Census form filled in by your father and your father states that you are of mixed descent.&#x201D; To the consternation of that person he is now suddenly a Coloured man. He is confronted with that evidence. The official then says &#x201C;Do you admit that your father in 1951 put you down as &#x2018; mixed &#x2019; or &#x2018; Coloured &#x2019;?&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member agrees. But that is the tragedy of this Act. People who for years have lived as White people, not knowing about the 1951 Census, to their consternation are suddenly confronted with that evidence. And they must admit it, and once they have admitted it, they are done for. The officials dare not, despite all the assurances which the Minister gives us, pass that person because of his admission that he is Coloured by descent. How can the Minister overcome that?</p>

<p>The Minister has not qualified it. He has made it worse. The hon. member for Heilbron is no doubt suggesting that the Minister is qualifying it by the proposed amendment. I say that the proposed amendment is making the matter a hundred times worse because this is what the position will be: That applicant is asked by the official: &#x201C;Are you a White person?&#x201D; The applicant says: &#x201C;Yes, I am a White person&#x201D; and then the official says: &#x201C;Oh no, I can prove that admission is not based on fact. I have evidence in my 1951 census that you are Coloured&#x201D; and that person is gone. Do you realize what you are doing, Mr. Minister?</p>

<p>What I am dealing with is descent. Descent is the most tragic thing that the Minister could have brought into this Act. Believe me, Sir, I know of cases, hundreds of them where, if they hare to admit their descent, they will be declared Coloured tomorrow. You and I know of such people. Sir, Mr. Speaker, I have tried to make a sincere appeal to the Government. If the Government wants to close up the loopholes about Chinese, if it wants to try to overcome abuses, as the Minister pointed out, of people making affidavits where the applicant applies for reclassification, it is so simple. I want to ask the hon. the Minister how many more people<span class="col_4557-4558" refersTo="page_0905"/> are to be classified? How many more people are to be investigated? My information is there are only about 200. And the Minister is making a law to affect only a couple of hundred people! But when it comes to the children, does the Minister realize what he is doing to the children of the future? Those children, innocent children, believing that they are White may suddenly be confronted by an official who says: &#x201C;I have evidence that you are Coloured by descent.&#x201D; You are going to bring tragedy into the homes of hundreds of people by this amendment. Mr. Minister. Why should you do that? Why do you not bring in a simple amendment? I suggest that where it says here &#x201C;A Coloured person means a person who is not a White person or a Native&#x201D; he should add &#x201C;or an Asiatic or Oriental&#x201D;. I do not want to make fun about the Japanese. But seriously, if the Minister added those words he would obviously be closing the loopholes as far as the Chinese are concerned. That will be simple. Why bring in a Bill which in its implication can destroy all the things that the Minister said?</p>

<p>A point has been made which I think it is necessary for me to emphasize. I want the Minister to believe that we think highly of the officials; I pay credit to them, but they will not always be there to administer this Act as sympathetically as they are doing to-day. You may get officials who are very officious in their handling of this Act. They can easily say: &#x201C;I reject you because I have the evidence in the 1951 census.&#x201D; So you see, Mr. Speaker, the word &#x201C;descent&#x201D; is the most tragic and dangerous word. How many of you can prove your descent?</p>

<p>Even if the hon. member for Mossel Bay did say that the hon. member for Turffontein was a Coolie, it just shows you how difficult it is to go by appearance.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to ask the hon. the Minister why he freezed all applications as from yesterday afternoon. Why? Surely, Sir, people who applied months ago and whose applications are still under consideration, should not now be prejudiced because of this amendment. I think it is most unfair that people who applied months ago shoud now be prejudiced. Many of us know from personal experience the red tape there is before an application is finally considered. Some applications are before the board or before the Department for as long as 12 or 18 months. Are all those people now to be told: &#x201C;You must apply in terms of the new amendment&#x201D;? May I make an appeal to the hon. Minister to make this amendment, if it has to become law, effective only in regard to applications made from the date of its acceptance and not to make it retrospective. I think the Minister would be doing a service to hundreds of people if he would not make it retrospective. It would be cruel if the Minister were to make it retrospective. I emphasize that some cases have been before the Department for as long as 18 months for classification and it would be very unfair if they have to be prejudiced by this.</p>

<p>To sum up his objection to the present position, the Minister gave us a few cases. He relied on the fact that 15 people had applied for re-classification&#x2014;from White to Coloureds. I want to ask the Minister who initiated their first application? Those people themselves initiated their applications. Nobody forced them to apply to be White. Those 15 people who asked for re-classification surely initiated their original applications. If affidavits were furnished by M.P.s or others that they knew<span class="col_4559-4560" refersTo="page_0906"/> those 15 people and that they lived amongst and were accepted as Whites, how can you bring that as evidence to amend the law? How can you justify amending the law because 15 people out of thousands&#x2014;the previous Minister said in 1961 there were about 40,000 in the Cape&#x2014;feel uncomfortable in their new classification? The Minister advances that as a reason why he should amend the Act. The Minister mentioned the case of the one Chinaman&#x2014;I do not want to stress that unnecessarily&#x2014;and he amends the law! I want to warn the Minister that despite his assurances&#x2014;assurances which I accept and which the House accept&#x2014;this amendment, if it becomes law, will destroy all the good work which the Department has done and to which the Minister has referred. I say that emphatically. It will destroy all that. You are tying the hands of the officials, Sir. You are making it impossbile for them to use their discretion. You are making it absolutely watertight against the applicant. You are defeating the very object you are trying to achieve. If I cannot make the Minister understand that it is unfortunate. But I want to say this: We have dealt with these applications for years and years. We know them. The hon. member for Mossel Bay does not believe it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I thought you said it; I am sorry if I misunderstood you. I thought you said it by way of interjection.</p>

<p>Finally I want to raise one point. To show how unnecessary it is to amend the law I want to deal with the figures which the Minister gave us. I believe he said that in the case of 279 cases, where there were applications for classification as Whites by people who apparently had to apply, 233 were accepted and 46 refused. That indicates that out of those 279 cases 233 people were justified. But I venture to suggest that in the case of each of those people who had to apply because there was something wrong originally, if you look at the 1951 census. Sir, you will find that by descent they all have Coloured blood in them. If this Bill were law when those people applied, every one of those 233 would have been refused. If you go into their records you will find that in the case of every one of those 233 cases there is some evidence of Coloured blood, or a mixture of blood. I wish to emphasize to the House that shows how serious this amending Bill is because had it been law probably every one of those 233 would have been rejected. And what an injustice that would have been, Sir! I say that injustice will now come about in regard to future applications, on the same evidence, on a par with these 233 successful people. As from yesterday afternoon every one will be refused.</p>

<p>I want to conclude on this note. As the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots), the hon.the Minister and other hon. members have said, we are proud of our South African race; In what way can 300 or 400 people who may be on the borderline affect the purity of a race of over 3,000,000 people? As I said at an earlier stage, why do you use a 10-ton tractor to smooth down an antheap? Why do you bring in such a vicious amendment&#x2014;it is a vicious amendment&#x2014;in order to save White South Africa the doubtful fear of having 400 borderline cases in the White community? Under the existing law there is plenty of protection against people who are obviously Coloured and who want to become White. There is no reason to introduce this amending Bill to overcome the difficulties which the Minister believes he has. Simple amendments can be made to meet the cases which the Minister has mentioned. I want to ask him again in all sincerity to withdraw this Bill, come forward with something less vicious and I am sure we will try to assist to close the loopholes which obviously exist. I wish to say again to the Minister: You will destroy all the good which you have built up if you insist upon this Bill. I think the hon. the Minister will do a disservice to himself and a disservice to his Department and his officials if he persists with this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these hon. members who talk in this way know nothing about the history of South Africa. I am sure that neither of those two members is aware of the fact that Simon van der Stel, when he undertook his journey to Namaqualand, issued a proclamation against clandestine affairs between his soldiers and the Native women. They do not know that, and now they come along with these sob stories. The hon. member for Point has mentioned a case here where the parents, were registered as Whites, the one child as a Coloured and the other as an Indian. I say<span class="col_4561-4562" refersTo="page_0907"/> that the example given by him is a far-fetched one. But I shall give him a few other figures in a moment, if the hon. the Chief Whip of the Opposition will leave him alone so that he can give his attention to me. The hon. member for Boland, if I understood him correctly, has stated that parents are classified as Whites while the child is classified as &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;. Yes, he did say that the parents were registered as Whites and the child as a Coloured. As a lawyer, and particularly as a representative of Coloureds in the Western Province, he ought to know that if parents, even if they have Coloured blood, are registered as Whites and they went along years ago and registered their child as a Coloured because they know that they had Coloured blood in their veins, they can apply for their child to be registered as a White person because of the fact that they are registered as Whites. The hon. member cannot deny that. He ought to know it, but he does not know it, and yet he is a representative of the Coloureds! But there are members sitting behind me who have already taken up various cases of that kind.</p>

<p>No, the hon. member did not say it. His words were that was the tragedy of the situation. I wrote down his words, and what he said was, &#x201C;That is the tragedy of this apartheid.&#x201D; He said that it was a tragedy that parents were classified as Whites and their poor little child as a Coloured. As a representative of the Coloureds he ought to know that sort of case can be rectified, in the same way that hon. members sitting behind me have frequently rectified such classifications in the past. The hon. member did not mention that because he wanted to create an impression outside this House. If I understood him incorrectly, what then is the tragedy of this? When the two parents, although they have Coloured blood, are classified as White persons and they themselves, when the child was born, informed the Registrar of Births that he was Coloured, is it a tragedy if those parents apply for the child to be declared a White person? Is that a tragedy? You see, Mr. Speaker, my hon. friends are simply putting up a smokescreen.</p>

<p>But I just want to say this. There are three Acts on the Statute Book of South Africa which cannot be separated. The state of affairs that we have to-day, the fact that we have to introduce this amending Bill, is the cumulative effect of these three Acts. The first is the Immorality Act of 1927, as subsequently amended when this Government came into power. The second is the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949, and the third is the Population Registration Act of 1950. These three Acts cannot be separated because the one links up with the other. Hon. members opposite who are now conversing when I am addressing them&#x2014;I should like to have the attention of hon. members opposite because I am speaking to them&#x2014;have overlooked one thing. When the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was introduced in 1949 in this House, the then Minister of the Interior, Dr. D&#x00F6;nges, mentioned certain figures to substantiate his statements, and <i>inter alia</i> he quoted from a commission report which appeared in 1939. It must be remembered that this is a commission which was appointed by the then United Party Government. What were the findings of that commission?</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, I have finished with the hon. member for Boland, because I see he is finished; he can go. At that time the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object of this Bill is to check miscegenation as far as possible and to promote race purity as far as possible.</block>

<p>Hon. members on the other side pleaded for the opposite; they wanted more and more people on the other side of the White line to be allowed to enter the White group. In 1927 this House passed a measure which went further than any of the laws of our provinces when it placed the Immorality Act on the Statute Book. That Act made intercourse between Whites and Natives a punishable offence. It was confined, however, to extramarital intercourse and only to intercourse between Whites and Natives. That Act went no further than that. The hope that it would check miscegenation was not fully realized, and in 1936 the late Major Roberts, the then member for Vrededorp, introduced a Bill here to prevent mixed marriages between Whites and non-Whites. That Bill was thrown out. In 1937 General J. J. Pienaar, the then member for Marico, again introduced a Bill to prohibit mixed marriages. He and Maj. Roberts did the necessary preparatory work at that time, but the outcome was that in 1938 the Mixed Marriages Commission was appointed by the United Party Government. It was appointed by the very people who now have so much to say and who complain about the classification of people as Bantu, as Coloured and as White persons. I should like to read out what the finding of that commission was, and then you will see the hollowness of the arguments of members on the other side, to whom we have had to listen here <i>ad nauseam.</i> In paragraph 70 of its report the commission said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There can be no doubt that public opinion, generally speaking, is against mixed marriages.</block>

<p>There we have the public opinion. I am sorry that the hon. member for Boland was in such a hurry to leave because I should have liked him to listen to this. However, there are members who belong to his group. The attitude of the other races, of the Bantu, for example, is apparently definitely against mixed<span class="col_4563-4564" refersTo="page_0908"/> marriages. That is stated in paragraph 84. The commission then goes on to say this about the Coloureds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They are also opposed to mixed marriages.</block>

<p>Then we go further. According to paragraph 90 of the report even the Indians declared that they were opposed to mixed marriages. And does the hon. member for Boland who spoke here want to suggest to me that the group to which he belongs is not against mixed marriages?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member will give me a chance, I shall come to the numbers and also to the findings of the commission. The finding of the commission was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission is of the opinion that the opposition of public opinion to mixed marriages is justified.&#x2026;</block>

<p>The commission then mentions two reasons It came to the conclusion that public opinion would exercise sufficient pressure. That is precisely where I am going to tie up the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson). In the ten years before the appointment of that commission, or before the report was brought out, namely from 1928 to 1937, we find that there was a certain number of mixed marriages. Let us compare that with the number in the ten years after the commission brought out its report, namely from 1938 to 1947. We find that the total number of mixed marriages in the ten years before the commission sat was 912, and the number of mixed marriages in the ten years after the sitting of the commission was 913. As far as numbers are concerned, therefore, there was a steady increase. Over that period of 20 years, therefore. 1,825 mixed marriages were contracted. I do not want to weary hon. members further with figures, but let us take that at an average of four children per family&#x2014;and I am talking now about the position years ago. If the National Party had not introduced legislation to check this thing&#x2014;and I readily admit that it has not been checked 100 per cent because illicit intercourse is still taking place between Whites and non-Whites, but mixed marriages can no longer take place&#x2014;what would the position be now? One gets the cases that the Jeremiahs on the other side mentioned where White persons, in order to circumvent our laws, such as the Immorality Act and the Mixed Marriages Act, want themselves to be declared Coloured persons. But is that the Government&#x2019;s fault or is it their own fault? I just want to say that if we do not tighten up the Population Registration Act as contemplated in this Bill, we can write off the ideal that is cherished by the White race in South Africa to keep our nation White for all time to come.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I made some attempt yesterday to follow the arguments advanced by hon. members opposite. They attempted to give their interpretation of the definition of a White man and of a Coloured man, and beyond that, to give their definition of the definition in the Bill. I believe it would be an interesting exercise to try to tabulate merely the definitions of the definition, side by side in each case, and to see whether it is physically possible to draw a conclusion from all those definitions. I submit that the more one listened yesterday to the definitions of the one or other racial group and the interpretations of the definitions contained in the Bill, the more difficult, if not impossible, it became to follow the arguments, and to arrive at any conclusion. The analogy which occurred to me was that it was like the attempt of certain artists nowadays, who are regarded in their own sphere as being artists, to produce a work of art in a certain fashion. You may be aware of this technique, Sir, where the so-called artist stands at a certain distance from his canvas, takes his container of paint and puts a spoon into it and just throws the paint at the canvas, and then he frames it&#x2014;and it constitutes a &#x201C;picture&#x201D; which is shown at exhibitions in all seriousness and is even paid for by people. That resembles in artistic terms the attempt made yesterday to find a definition of a White or a Coloured person. There is another way of doing it which has come to the notice of the public quite recently, when a young man spread his canvas on the ground poured a lot of paint on to it and then got a motor-car and drove to and fro on his canvas and the result was called a painting! This &#x201C;legitimate&#x201D; art was somewhat illegitimate because he had taken the car without the owner&#x2019;s permission&#x2014;but it was still regarded as legitimate art. Ridiculous as it seems, that is the picture which emerged from the debate here and from the attempts made to be logical and reasonable in the definition of the racial groups concerned in this legislation. For example, the hon. member for Omaruru (Mr. Frank) even went beyond the scope of the argument when he said in effect that the United Party could not possibly envisage its race federation policy without a race classification, which we had said was objectionable. But as was pointed out by the hon. member for Pinelands, who merely touched on the matter, the question of voting rights has nothing to do with race classification as such. I put this to the hon. member for Omaruru with great respect, because I believe he has had legal training. We have the laws and the necessary machinery to define who may in certain circumstances vote in a certain sphere, whether municipal, provincial<span class="col_4565-4566" refersTo="page_0909"/> or parliamentary, and who may not vote; and that has been the case for many years since the machinery of democracy in regard to voting rights has existed, well in advance of race classification. The hon. member need not be unduly worried about what the United Party would do in applying its policy of race federation without this sort of legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>So there will be no such plan.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says there will be no plan. As you have ruled, Sir, that there should be no interjections, I leave it at that. However, we will await the day when hon. members opposite do the reasonable thing and make way for a good Government. They will then find out how to establish a race federation without race classification. Let us leave it at that.</p>

<p>Another point made by the hon. member for Omaruru was that he could not see any hardship in classifying someone who was obviously White as a non-White. I think he said there would be the procedure in terms of this Bill of the inspector calling, and if the person was not satisfied with his classification he could appeal to the Board, and if he was still not satisfied he could appeal to the Supreme Court. Now, that is surely an unreasonable argument. How would the hon. member like to be faced, through no fault of his own, because he has not committed an offence&#x2014;he has merely committed the offence of existing behind a certain complexion&#x2014;how would he like to be put through all those hoops like a performing dog, in order to prove something of which he and his immediate neighbours and the society in which he lives are already well aware of? Yet he argues that there is no particular hardship in it. I can only say that we should from time to time try, even in this debating chamber, to apply the simple precept of &#x201C;doing unto others what you would like them to do unto you&#x201D;, and then see how the argument comes out. He went on to say that if a person admits that he is non-White, what harm can be done? First of all, we must assume that such a person is not entirely isolated from the rest of humanity, although he may be a person about whose colour there is a doubt. No man is an island.&#x2026; This man has a family; he has parents, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, and children, and vet the hon. member for Omaruru says: What harm can be done if this man, whether in a fit of aberration, or whether he is in his cups, or whether he says it under pressure or as a joke, admits that he is a non-White when he has lived as a White man all his life? Well, things may be very different in Omaruru, but outside of Omaruru it would make, as the Americans would say, one heck of a difference for that man to have made that admission. I would like the hon. member to realize that we cannot all see these matters in such splended simplicity, as is apparently possible in the wastes of Omaruru.</p>

<p>Now, coming to the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;), I must say with great respect that I tried very hard to follow his argument, but it was an exceedingly complex one. I wished at times that the hon. the Minister of Transport was present when the hon. member spoke, because he is so fond of saying: &#x201C;You contradict yourself.&#x201D; Throughout his argument the hon. member for Parow contradicted himself time and again, piling Pelion upon Ossa, until nobody knew what was going to come out of it at all&#x2014;and all this in an attempt to define a race group. He said in effect that the investigator to be appointed in terms of Clause 4 would not go on a witchhunt. He would merely go to find out whether the evidence submitted was correct. Now, if this Bill becomes law&#x2014;and one must assume that it can&#x2014;it will be very reassuring to assume that whoever was sent out, by the official concerned, under this clause was not only a man of great experience and ability in regard to such matters as genetics and social customs, but also a very fair and honest man. It would be very pleasant to assume that, but unfortunately in public life, in and out of officialdom, there are too many examples of people who are neither experienced nor just, and too many examples of people who are neither fair nor honest; and I submit that it is impossible at this stage to foretell the number of people who will be exposed to the unscrupulous activities of these snoopers, as they have been called, who are not necessarily officials of the Department with a certain standard of conduct to observe, but people who may have been hired for the task and who will then go out to get the information the Minister requires. For example, it is common cause that the private detective agencies, the so-called &#x201C;private eyes&#x201D;, make a very lucrative practice of observing what goes on between a man and a woman when there is a possible divorce involved, and then they think nothing whatever, according to reported cases, of enriching themselves by fabricating the necessary evidence, or enriching themselves by making a certain situation possible of which they can then bring back the evidence to their principal which it suits him to obtain&#x2014;and then say to the person who is found in default: If you pay me so much, I will not take this information back to my principal. In other words those who support this legislation are asking for a great increase in corruption and graft&#x2014;and with that I should now like to move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I asked for the half-hour to deal with the matters of policy under the Vote, Social Welfare and Pensions. Before doing so, I would like to say that in regard to keeping abreast with the activities and policy of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, I feel that it is important that regular reports should be submitted by that Department. For instance, during the 1960 Session a report was tabled by this Department for the period 1 April 1952 to 31 March 1959, covering a period of seven years. This report, covering all the activities of the Department, was a most comprehensive one, which has proved to be invaluable to those interested in social welfare matters. To fit in with the framework of social work between the State and the Church and welfare organizations and the community it is important that we should have at regular intervals a report from this Department. I believe that this report, which covered seven years, was naturally very comprehensive and one cannot expect to receive such a report every year. However, I ask the Minister to try to table at regular intervals a report of the activities and the policy of this important Department. The number of people affected by the amount of money to be voted here amounts to many hundreds of thousands, and when one looks at the vast activities of the Department, like Child Welfare. Social Security, Social Pensions, Civil Pensions, administration and certain research surveys that have been carried out, many thousands of people are involved. Therefore I believe that this Vote is perhaps one of the most important Votes to be dealt with, and therefore the amount of R72,700,000 which is required to be voted under this heading&#x2014;more than half this amount, R37,000 000-odd, is to be voted under war veterans&#x2019; pensions, old age pensions, blind persons&#x2019; pensions and disability grants under Head &#x201C;K&#x201D;, and it is under this Head that I first wish to address the Minister.</p>

<p>The question of the old age pensions, and indeed, all social pensions, is one of vital concern to all those receiving such pensions and also to the many who hope to receive them in future. In reply to a question earlier this Session, it was revealed that there were 86,756 old age White pensioners, 25 165 White war veteran pensioners, making a total of 111.921 pensioners merely for old age pensions and war veterans&#x2019; pensions. That gives some indication of the large number of people involved, and indeed that number is increasing. Due to the advances of medical science, it has been shown in various surveys that the span of life, particularly amongst the Whites in South Africa, and throughout the world, has increased. In 1911 the number of White people over 60 years was 4 per cent, but to-day it is 10 per cent. That means that there are some 300,000 people over 60, and by the year 2,000 there will be some 700,000 such persons. A large number of these people are endeavouring to eke out an existence on a hopelessly inadequate pension. I am fully aware of the fact that during the Budget speech of the Minister of Finance, proposals were made in regard to increasing these pensions. Indeed. I believe that the recipients of these pensions are grateful for the increase. However. I must say that it is a very small increase indeed, because an increase of R18 per annum means that these people will receive a bonus of R1.5 per month for the White pensioners. We must realize that, in terms of the Pensions Act, these people are able to draw a maximum pension of R24 5 per month, and that is merely for the White pensioners. In view of the fact that the policy is to pay pensions in the ratio of twelve to six to five in regard to Coloured and Asiatic pensioners, we can see that there is a very small increase for those persons. In fact, the increase for the White pensioner only amounts to 5 cents a day. Consequently we can see that it is a very small increase indeed. Before dealing with that I would like to say a few words in regard to the civil pensioners, because this matter has been the cause of a great deal of discontent among civil pensioners, in regard to persons who retired prior to October 1953. To a certain extent their requests have been met by an increase for the civil pensioners in connection with the bonus, which means that those who retired prior to October 1953 will now no longer be unfairly discriminated against. Similarly, the problem of the Coloured ex-servicemen and their war veterans&#x2019; pensions, and the ratio between the social pensioner and the war veteran pensioners, has now been put on a more realistic basis. However, various difficulties arise and difficulties are experienced by these people in trying to exist on the amount provided for them, and that is something I believe every member of this House should concern himself with. Because in a large number of urban constituencies there are many thousands of aged persons struggling to exist on an inadequate pension. And when I say that they are struggling to exist. I really mean that they are struggling to exist, because in the twilight of their lives, when these people are unable to fend for themselves, in many cases due to circumstances beyond their control, they are unable to maintain a decent standard of living and we find that they often have to live in conditions of squalor. Surveys which have been carried out have shown that a number of these people are living in very drab circumstances indeed. I would just like to mention here that a person who lives in my constituency, in Umbilo, has put forward a case which I believe should receive the consideration of the hon. the Minister, and that is in regard to the provision of more adequate housing for<span class="col_4569-4570" refersTo="page_0911"/> the aged. Many of these people, especially womenfolk, widows, etc., have great difficulty in obtaining accommodation in homes for the aged. Many of these homes for the aged have waiting lists of sometimes over 200 names. I have a letter here which illustrates what I believe is not an isolated case: it is a good illustration of the position of many people who are living under very difficult conditions, sometimes poverty-stricken conditions. This letter says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are hundreds of single women everywhere without anyone to depend upon, for different reasons. We find ourselves living very dreary lives indeed. We live in dismal rooms about the city and try to like it. Houses are being made all around us for Bantu, Indian and Coloured, so why not a few of us at the same rental. I believe some are being built to let at &#x00A3;2 10s. per month. I want to live to be independent and not to have to live continually treading on someone&#x2019;s toes in large institutions, and in any case it is almost impossible to obtain admission to these institutions. I am living in ore room where the rent is &#x00A3;6 5s per month, a drab back-room, the only window looking on to a dirty backyard of Native quarters.</block>

<p>I believe that is an example of a large number of cases where people are suffering hardships to-day in their old age. I think it is a very poor reward for these people who have contributed so much towards the development of their country to have to live the twilight of their years under such conditions. I know that the hon. the Minister is aware of these conditions and of the fact that these people, unable to obtain admission to certain homes, have to try to exist on the paltry sum that is provided for them by means of an old-age pension.</p>

<p>Under the Department of Education, the Bureau of Education and Sociological Research conducted a country-wide investigation into the lives of the aged. In the reply given by the Minister to this House on 20 February he stated that the report was now being considered and that considerable progress had been made in this regard. I hope that in the course of this debate the hon. the Minister will give some indication as to what progress has been made in this regard. This appears to have been a country-wide investigation into the lives of aged persons, and a very valuable report should have been submitted by the Bureau; so I do hope that the Minister will give some further information in regard to this investigation, because this investigation was carried out during 1959.</p>

<p>Sir, the inadequacy of the amount received by persons who qualify for pensions is one matter but the cases which I believe deserve the earnest and sympathetic attention of the Government are those cases who fail to qualify for a pension because of the application of the means test. In considering the whole question of the means test, many of us who have seen the anguish and the anxiety of persons who do not know where to turn when they are advised that they do not qualify for a pension, would like to see the means test abolished. However, we have to be practical and realize that it would not be possible to abolish the means test, because of economic reasons. However, it would be possible to abolish the means test if a contributory pension scheme was introduced, and I hope later on to refer to that, but in the first instance, pending the adoption of such a scheme, I believe it is imperative that the Central Government should take positive steps to relax the means test. I believe that the hon. the Minister would be doing a great service to the aged if he were to appoint an interdepartmental committee to investigate ways and means of relaxing the means test, because the free income that is permitted in the application of the means test and the application of the property qualifications, appear to be two important matters that require the earnest and immediate attention of the Minister. When a person applies for an old-age pension or for a disability grant&#x2014;because I understand that the means test is the same&#x2014;the applicant is allowed a free income of R180 per annum before any deduction is made from his pension or disability grant or any of the other social pensions. But when he reaches an income in excess of R312 per annum, in other words R26 per month, he is no longer entitled to any pension whatsoever. I believe that the level of this free income should be raised because where a person over the age of 70 is still in employment and receives pay or salary, that is not taken into account in applying the means test. I believe that the free income of R180 per annum should be raised so as to make provision for persons who have made investments and who have certain moneys coming to them, so that they will then qualify for some pension, which will not necessarily be the full pension, of course, but a <i>pro rata</i> pension. However, I believe that this is a matter which an inter-departmental committee should investigate, because naturally we would have to take into account how many people would be able to qualify for a pension and what the financial implications would be for the State. Secondly, the other matter which I believe such an interdepartmental committee should investigate is the question of property qualifications. I believe that is even more necessary than the question of free income, because the formula applied under the means test is based on assets worth R2,400. Although the basis of calculation allows for amounts in excess of that in regard to the unemcumbered value of his property, the whole basis of the calculation in the case of a married person is assets to the value of R2,400. We realize too that a house occupied by the applicant is taken into consideration and that the occupational value is assessed at 1&#x00BD;per cent on the first R800 of the unencumbered value of his property, and at <i>2&#x00BD;</i> per cent on the<span class="col_4571-4572" refersTo="page_0912"/> balance of the unencumbered value. In the case of the single person, there too the bascic pension is reduced by 5 per cent of the unencumbered value of such assets in excess of R1,200. I submit that the basis of this calculation is far too low, particularly when we take into consideration the fact that in a large number of municipalities properties have been revalued, and persons who are potential pensioners and future applicants for pensions will be unfairly treated under this particular provision, because they might then find that they do not qualify for the old-age pension. I believe it is only just and fair that the Minister should take cognisance of the fact that these people will now be at a distinct disadvantage when they come to apply for an old-age pension. If they do qualify for a pension, they might only qualify for a reduced amount. I believe that this is a matter of vital importance which should be investigated by any committee that is set up.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to the applicant for an old-age pension. I am pointing out that because of the increase in municipal valuations in a large number of municipal areas, some people will find that the increased municipal value of their property will preclude them from applying for a pension. I am not referring to the person who is already a pensioner. I understand that those persons will not be affected by any such re-valuation, but I am concerned about those people who do not qualify for a pension at the present time. There are many thousands of people who are ekeing out an existence in rooms, living with other people. I have seen old-age pensioners trying to live on a small pension, having to live in rooms in backyards in small alleys and streets in large municipal areas, and other persons who have property find that they are unable to qualify for a pension because of their thrift and the fact that they have invested in property which is not encumbered. Many of these people have been ill advised to sell their properties and to dispose of certain assets, and then they find that they still do not qualify for a pension because of the cash investment standing to their credit or any cash investment that they might have disposed of. I believe therefore that he question of setting up an inter-departmental committee to investigate the question of the relaxation of the means test is of the utmost importance at the present stage.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the abolition of the means test could only come about with the introduction of a contributory pension scheme. I know, Sir, that you would rule me out of order if I were to advocate legislation, but unfortunately the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions was not present when the debate was held in this House on a motion moved by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). During the course of that debate we put forward our proposals in regard to a contributory pension scheme. I may say just briefly that with the introduction of such a scheme, we forsee the possibility of abolishing the means test and that people will be able to qualify for pensions as a right and not merely as a privilege. I feel that at this stage there is no necessity for me to outline our scheme to the hon. the Minister, because what is under review here is the Minister&#x2019;s policy and we are anxious to ascertain the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to a contributory pension scheme. I know that this matter has been investigated from time to time by his Department, because in the latest report of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, covering the period 1952 to 1959, reference is made on page 66 to the fact that a meeting of the International Social Security Association was held in London during May 1958 and was attended by a member of the Minister&#x2019;s Department as an observer. At the same time, the report states, this observer studied a contributory social pension scheme or system of certain European countries in <i>loco.</i> It then states that the official concerned has also submitted a report. I hope that the Minister at this stage will be able to give us some indication of the policy and his attitude in regard to a contributory pension scheme. Because, as I said, with the introduction of such a scheme we foresee that it will be possible to abolish the means test, something which has been desired for many years. Various committees which have investigated the effects of the means test, have all come to the conclusion that it is an invidious test and that the sooner it is abolished the better. In this regard I would like to quote one passage in connection with the means test from the report of the Select Committee on Social Security of 1944. The Committee state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In pursuing the objective of encouraging the individual to provide for himself, the Social Security Committee next drew attention to the fact that the more rigid the means test according to which the pension is determined, the less obviously is the inducement to save and to continue earning.</block>

<p>Similarly a national conference that was held to study post-war planning on social welfare work in Johannesburg in September 1944, also came to the conclusion that it was in the best interest to effect a gradual abolition of the means test for old-age pensioners. Sir, this is an ideal that we must strive to achieve, because it will mean a great alleviation of the difficulties and hardships presently being suffered by people who do not qualify for a pension in terms of this means test. We know that the Government&#x2019;s attitude to this whole problem is to encourage the establishment of private pension schemes. In this regard we have given our opinion on various occasions on private pension schemes and the various disadvantages that do arise. Even hon. members opposite realize those disadvantages. People resign their positions so as to obtain the benefit of funds which have accrued to them under<span class="col_4573-4574" refersTo="page_0913"/> this scheme. There are numerous other difficulties. For example, people over 45 years of age often find great difficulty in finding employment where firms have their own pension schemes and they do not qualify as contributors to those schemes. However, one aspect which I believe could go towards a relaxation of the means test, is an extension of private pension schemes. I know that is the Government&#x2019;s policy, and since it is the Government&#x2019;s policy, surely as more people are covered by such private pension schemes, with the extension of that scheme, so it will be possible to relax the means test in the case of people who do not fall within such schemes. Sir, this Vote that we are considering to-day involves R72,000,000, of which R37,000,000 goes towards pensions. Provision is also made for a sum of R14,000,000 as a contribution to pension and provident funds. In these circumstances I feel that we should have a statement from the Minister in regard to the success or otherwise of the extension of private pension schemes. This is a matter on which we would like to have further information to see whether the Government has in fact been able to encourage the establishment of further private pension schemes. We want to be able to gauge the degree of success in this particular regard.</p>

<p>Sir, these are all matters which vitally affect the person who is not presently covered by any form of insurance, who has no security in his old age. We also know that the corner-stone of any social security programme is security in old age, and it is here that I believe that a great step can be taken to cover as many persons as possible by means of insurance, private pension schemes and ultimately a contributory pension scheme.</p>

<p>There are certain other administrative matters which I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Firstly, there is the question of some form of brochure, leaflet or booklet that could be provided at the regional offices and at the offices of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions as a guide to applications for social pensions, This is a matter which has caused a great deal of difficulty amongst numerous applicants for old-age pensions. I realize that in this matter welfare organizations are playing a very important role, and indeed without the assistance of welfare organizations to alleviate the hardships of the aged, their position to-day would be unbearable. The distribution of such a pamphlet, which would serve as a guide to potential pensioners, would prove of immense value to persons wishing to apply for the old-age pension. I believe too that to a certain extent it would obviate what brings about a great deal of hardship to-day, and that is overpayments. Some of these people, in their ignorance, do not advise the Department of a change in their financial position. There are numerous cases where people drew unemployment benefit or received the proceeds of an endowment policy and failed to advise the Department immediately. When the Department finds out what has transpired, the pensioners are called upon to repay the amount that they have been overpaid. These overpayments amount to a considerable sum. The Minister gave the House certain figures last year, in reply to a question, in regard to overpayments. He stated that the latest available figures were for 1959-60 and that the overpayments during that financial year had amounted to R638,000. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The previous speaker will forgive me if I do not deal with all the matters he mentioned; I am sure others will do so. I can only say that the record of this Government proves that it is not indifferent to the position of our pensioners, but that it has devoted attention to this matter practically every year, as other speakers who follow me will indicate.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I want to deal particularly with two matters under this Vote, Items &#x201C;L&#x201D; and &#x201C;V&#x201D;, Child Welfare and the care of the aged and the ill. I want to point out that a large amount is devoted every year for the care of children in need of care. If we analyse this Vote carefully we will see what a large amount is spent with this praiseworthy object every year. A large number of these children in need of care are housed in institutions, and we are grateful to the State for having made it possible to have such places where these children can be cared for. But we cannot get away from the fact that as long as institutions of that nature exist, they really constitute a disguised complaint against our society, because such places are necessary. In other words, they really prove how family life has been broken up to an ever-increasing extent. With this in mind, we feel that every attempt made to combat this disillusion and every positive step taken to promote healthy family life ought to enioy the attention of this House and of this Government and should have the support of everybody who has the interests of our nation at heart and who wants to promote a healthy nation. That is why we want to refer here to-day particularly to one of the greatest positive steps taken last year, in Family Year. Family Year started on Union Day, 1960, and reached its culmination in the Family Congress which was held in Pretoria from 4 to 7 April 1961. I want to point out that in this Family Year it was our ideal to strengthen all the principles on which a sound family life is based. The State President, who on that occasion made the inaugural speech, <i>inter alia,</i> said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Congress will deal with the most important matter which can exist in our society.</block>

<p>Those words were not exaggerated. Every sociologist will confirm that unless one has a sound family life one can have no society; then one cannot establish an orderly and sound society. The words of the State President<span class="col_4575-4576" refersTo="page_0914"/> were also confirmed on that occasion by the hon. the Minister when he stressed the importance of this Congress and pointed out that the task of this Congress should be to indicate a line of efficient action for the future. The appeal made by the Control Committee on that occasion was an earnest appeal to all bodies which have the fostering of a sound family life at heart to make a positive contribution to the promotion of sound family life, each within its own sphere. That Control Committee took the lead by means of two brochures which it distributed before the time, the first containing the announcement of Family Year and thereafter gave guidance for Family Year which resulted in the fact that people emphasized the importance of the family life of the nation from every possible platform and pulpit. That resulted in a congress being held where there was a congregation of 750 selected delegates from all over the country. When one reads what was done at that congress it strikes one how direction was given by the various persons who read important treatises. They were asked to concentrate in terms of a positive approach on the formulation of the basis on which family life can be stabilized and that they should only, if it is at all necessary, devote, additional attention to the analysis and description of the prevailing unhappy state of affairs. That is a very important fact because we are too negative in our approach to this problem. We condemn too much the negative things which assist in breaking up the family, and emphasize too little the positive steps which can be taken to make family life sound and to keep it that way. Therefore this important Congress did not try to emphasize the negative, but sought a positive approach. On that occasion, 19 treatises of outstanding value were read on ten different subjects. The matter was approached from the sociological, the psychological, the economic, the educational and the religious aspects. It is therefore clear that we are dealing here with a Congress the object of which was to emphasize one of the very real problems of our nation and to look for a possible solution for it. When we look at the results of that congress we can say that it tried to formulate a sound policy for the future. The conclusion arrived at by that congress is that it is the task of the State increasingly to initiate research in regard to this problem, which will result in the formulation of a family policy in which the efforts of all interested bodies can be co-ordinated and which will put family life on a sound basis. Sir, the task was not completed by holding that congress. That was only initial spadework. The State and the Church and all interested bodies must co-operate in formulating and propagating and sound family policy. I fear that our welfare policy is still often too negative. We are dealing with those who have fallen by the wayside, the children who have to be protected, the people who need assistance. We deal with that aspect of the matter, but we do too little in the way of formulating a positive, comprehensive policy which will get to the root cause of the disruption and the disrupted processes we find in our society. We must make it our task&#x2014;and it is the task not only of the Government but of all those who deal with this work every day, welfare organizations and institutions which are specialized in this respect, and all the various welfare organizations&#x2014;to think together and to garner the facts which can result in the formulation of a comprehensive policy which will keep family life stable. In the second place, I should like to refer to another matter, the care of our aged. Former speakers have already pointed out that the aged are men and women who have borne the heat of the battle.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to discuss one point, that is one of the few remaining blots on our war pensions legislation. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister how this also is of importance in regard to our expanding Defence Force and that therefore it covers a wider field now than before. I am sure I have one man on my side in this regard, and that is the hon. the Minister of Defence, because he had the honour of opening the congress of the S.A. Legion of the B.E.S.L. at Muizenberg the other day and this difficulty was pointed out to him in no uncertain terms, and I know that he considered it important enough from the point of view of his troops to make voluminous notes during the discussion. We are the last of those countries who were wartime allies, members of the Commonwealth, to retain what are called &#x201C;time limits&#x201D; in regard to payment of marriage and children&#x2019;s allowances. The present position is that I want to ask the hon. the Minister to go into this matter again, because it now covers a wider field of people than before. Shortly, the history of this matter is as follows. Under the War Pensions Act of 1942, as amended, if a pensioner marries more than ten years after his discharge or any of his children are born after ten years, he is precluded from receiving allowances for such wife or child. The history of this time limit question, shows how questionable the origin of the idea was. In 1942, the definition of &#x201C;a child&#x201D; was: &#x201C;Child&#x201D; means a child of a volunteer born before, during, or within 280 days after the termination of the volunteer&#x2019;s service. I don&#x2019;t want to use any mathematical calculations in regard to the 280 days, but I do suggest that if a man was discharged say at Cape Town and lived in Pietersburg, he would possibly have some difficulties. In 1943. this definition was changed to: &#x201C;Child&#x201D; means the child of a volunteer born before, during or within five years after the termination of the volunteer&#x2019;s service&#x201D;. In 1944 it was again amended: &#x201C;Child means the child of a volunteer born at any time within the period preceding his enlistment, or the period of his service, or within the period of five years after termination of his service,. <span class="col_4577-4578" refersTo="page_0915"/> or eight years after such termination if the degree of pensionable disability was 80 per cent or above And then follow the other conditions which are not germane to my argument. In 1946 it was again amended: &#x201C;Child&#x201D; means a child born before or not later than ten years after the termination of the volunteer&#x2019;s military service. Now this Act applies to these new boys of ours who are enlisted. There was a further amendment in 1947 in the definition of &#x201C;Child&#x201D;, but that does not affect the &#x201C;time limit&#x201D;. The same position applies in the case of widows. In 1942: A widow in relation to a volunteer means the widow of a volunteer, but does not include a woman who is married to such volunteer after the date of his discharge from military service. That was the position in 1942. That was obviously ridiculous. It was amended in 1943: &#x201C;Widow&#x201D; in relation to a volunteer, &#x201C;means the widow of a volunteer, but does not include a woman whose marriage to such a volunteer took place more than five years after the date of the volunteer&#x2019;s discharge from military service&#x201D;. This was again amended in 1944 to five years after the date of discharge where the pensionable disability was under 80 per cent, and eight years after that date if the pensionable disability was more than 80 per cent. It followed the line taken in the case of a child. In 1946 there was another change: &#x201C;Means a woman married to a volunteer before or not later than ten years after the termination of his military service&#x201D;. Again there was a small amendment in the definition in 1947, which however does not affect this particular point, and there was another amendment which also does not affect my argument.</p>

<p>I would like to point out at this stage that at one time there was a fear that this question of wives of chaps who came back from the war, disabled, might lead to a social evil which was referred to as a &#x201C;death-bed marriage&#x201D;. The fear was that an unscrupulous woman might go and nurse some fellow who was obviously on his death-bed because of war disability, getting him to marry her at the last minute and then collect the widow&#x2019;s pension. Or a man might try to help his woman friend, possibly for favours received, towards the end of his life. You know how a man may feel about his nurse. There was that fear that a man might marry his nurse, purely for the reason that she would get a pension. Now this idea has been totally abandoned and in any case can be legislated against and has been legislated against in other countries.</p>

<p>I want to go back a little bit. It ought to be remembered that if a war pensioner dies of his pensionable disabilities and he marries outside the time limit, after ten years, his wife and children will receive no benefits at all. I submit that is most unfair. In 1944. at the instance of the S.A. Legion of the B.E.S.L. the Brinton Committee was appointed to go into this matter and that was when the time limit was increased to ten years. In 1948, after further agitation by the S.A. Legion, the Smit Committee was appointed and then the ex-service men had two representatives on that committee. This committee found that the ten-year limit was fair, but there was a minority report from the two ex-servicemen saying that the time limit should be removed altogether.</p>

<p>It was not only in the Union that this matter was receiving attention, but it received attention all over the world. The position in the other countries which we regarded as our wartime friends, and who are still our friends, is as follows (I am quoting from a letter. I think most hon. members got from the B.E.S.L.):</p>

<block name="quote">Rhodesia: The time limit was abolished completely by the Rhodesian Act of 1958 which was based largely on the existing South African legislation. <br/>Australia: There has never been any time limit for pensioners of World War II and the time limit imposed on pensioners of World War I was abolished in 1950. <br/>Canada: There has never been any time limit for pensioners of World War II and the time limit imposed on pensioners of World War I was abolished completely in 1958. <br/>New Zealand: There is no time limit, but the War Pensions Board may disallow a war widow&#x2019;s pension if there is evidence of a so-called &#x201C;death-bed&#x201D; marriage. <br/>United Kingdom: The time limit was abolished completely in 1946.</block>

<p>Now this new factor that I mentioned at the beginning, has arisen. Our new Force, which please God will never have to claim pensions for disability in war, but which may in some cases receive injuries in training, will now fall under the war pensions legislation, and most of these lads will be under 20 years old when they are called up. IS it fair, I ask, to place them in a position, that if they are hurt, they cannot, unless they get married before they are 28 or 29. be entitled to such widow&#x2019;s or children&#x2019;s benefits. And they may be precluded from marrying earlier. You can&#x2019;t get married only on your military pension, and if they are hurt in the service of their country, is it fair that they should be precluded after ten years from marrying and if dying from pensionable disability the widows losing all benefits.

<p>I was pointing out that the aged are people who have already borne the burdens of life. They have gone through difficult times and now, at the end of their lives, one is concerned about their fate. As the previous speaker pointed out, the average age of all the people in the world is increasing. One of the factors responsible for that is of course the age dispersion. When there are fewer children it is obvious that the average age will increase. But that is only-<span class="col_4579-4580" refersTo="page_0916"/> one of the factors. Another factor is the fact that people&#x2019;s lives are being prolonged as a result of improved medical services, and people now attain a greater age than they did previously. That age is not always an unmixed blessing, because in the world in which we live it seems that the aged to a large extent get in other people&#x2019;s way. Now we find that something must be done to make the lot of these people more pleasant, to make them feel that they are accepted and that they can still make a useful contribution to society. There are many families where the children regard it as an honour to care for their aged father and mother and to accommodate them in their homes, and the grandfather and grandmother in home life is one of the most important factors in binding together the family and in creating an atmosphere which is ideal for the children growing up in that family. It is deplorable that we increasingly see the phenomenon of a father and mother who have done everything to care for a child, being pushed aside and sent to a home for the aged when they get very old. That is one of the things which increasingly happens in our time and which should be combated. It does not redound to our honour. But now there are many cases where there is no child to care for those parents, or there are domestic circumstances or economic factors which make it impossible for that child to care for his parent, and in such cases those old people must be looked after by the State, by society. The aged do not need pensions alone; they also need suitable accommodation, as a previous speaker has pointed out. Now it redounds to the honour of this Government that whilst in 1949 there were only 25 subsidired homes for the aged, in 1961 the number has increased to 84, whilst another 19 were being considered in 1961. By now the number will probably be even higher. If we ask why it is that there is such an increase in the number of homes for the aged, we can mention various factors. Firstly there is, of course, the awakened conscience of society, where people realize their duty to those people and feel that we must protect and care for our aged. But all this would not have been possible if the Government had not paid increased subsidies to those bodies to maintain such homes. The increased subsidies granted to 3,000 persons who are being subsidired and who are at present being housed have made this possible. Furthermore, there is the <i>per capita</i> subsidy of R3.50 in respect of each of the persons accommodated, and, moreover, the higher subsidy of R10 per month per person for the bedridden, and the increased subsidy for furniture for these homes which has been increased from R30 to R90. That has made it possible for more and more bodies to establish such homes for the accommodation of the aged. But I think that a danger is threatening in this respect against which we must issue a warning. Sir, it is no use every little town now trying to establish a home for the aged. From the very nature of the matter one can understand that if there are such a large number of homes, each accommodating only a few people, one cannot give those aged people the facilities which one could have given them if one had rather thought in terms of large centres. One does not want to remove these aged people from the vicinity in which they grew up, but if one establishes such a centre, e.g. at Kimberley which is intended for the whole of the Northern Cape, for the old people of Douglas and Kuruman and those parts, one attains that object. The old people from those parts regularly visited Kimberley from time to time to attend to their business, they know the environment, and they will feel at home there. If one then establishes such a centre there which can serve the whole area, all the people in that area will feel happy and at home in such a centre. But then I want to point out further that we should have a new approach in respect of these centres. We should no longer build big buildings, some of them double-storeyed, where the aged can be accommodated. When the old people get to that stage they need rest, but they still want to be independent. We should adopt a new pattern, of a township laid out for the aged. It should be planned in such a way that when one enters it one can see that it is a place where the aged feel at home, where there are no dangerous steps for them to struggle to climb at the risk of falling, where the place of worship is within reach of those people, where the little shop and the caf&#x00E9; and the little park and everything else make the old people feel happy in their little township, a township with semidetached houses so that if an old couple becomes ill they can simply call the neighbours across the fence to come and help. It should be a little township laid out in such a way as to comply with all the needs of the aged. It is a recognized fact that the aged to-day constitute just as important a subject for modern psychology as the children. The old person has his own way of thinking and of acting and his own reactions, and we should concentrate more on really complying with the requirements of those people, to show the world that in this respect we are thinking progressively in respect of our aged, and that we want to do something which will contribute no only to making the lot of these people more pleasant, but to give them community life during the last days of their lives, a little town in which they can feel at home and feel that they are still wanted and that they are still able to contribute something to society.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I have personally interviewed previous Ministers on the matter I have been discussing on behalf of the B.E.S.L., that has been fighting to get these time limits cancelled. The last Minister interviewed, intimated to me that he feared the financial implications, the possible cost, and he asked whether I could arrange for the legion to go into this matter. Rhodesia had recently abolished these time limits and the time seemed ripe for the<span class="col_4581-4582" refersTo="page_0917"/> ex-servicemen to press for the same concession. The Legion went into this matter and arranged with a very eminent statistician to investigate this question of costs. His estimate was that the cost would not exceed 4&#x00BD; per cent of the existing war pensions. The amount provided in the Estimates for war pension allowances, is R7,185,000 and <i>4&#x00BD;</i> per cent of that would be a little over R300,000. I assume that is not a ruinous amount for this country. The Legion has since made representations to the department asking it to co-operate in regard to a much wider investigation if the authorities are not satisfied with this investigation, but extraordinarily enough these representations were turned down, and quite frankly I cannot understand why. I would like to quote again from a recent letter of the Legion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Legion has consistently opposed this arbitrary Time Limit for the following reasons <br/>The payment of family allowances is an accepted principle endorsed as such by both committees mentioned above and in the Legion&#x2019;s view it is illogical that a wife&#x2019;s allowance should be paid in respect of some wives and not others, that children&#x2019;s allowances are paid in respect of some children and not others of the same marriage and that some widows receive pensions when their husbands die as a result of their war disabilities while others do not qualify for a pension by reason of an arbitrary time limit. <br/>A heavily disabled ex-volunteer who has lost his wife requires the constant care and attention of a wife, but if he remarries outside the time limit, no wife&#x2019;s allowance is payable. <br/>Many disabled ex-volunteers were discharged on pension whilst young men of 20 or thereabouts, but if they have not married and completed their families within ten years of their discharge, they are deprived of allowances by this arbitrary time limit.</block>

<p>And this is going to apply to every single boy who joins our defence forces now under present conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there have been several changes of Ministers dealing with this matter in recent years, but I do plead with the present Minister to go into this matter again sympathetically. It does not apply only to those who served in previous wars, although Heaven knows their cause is good enough, but it applies to all those who join our Forces now.</p>

<p>One last point. I want to give this information to the hon. the Minister Under the War Pensions Act, a disability is deemed to have been caused if it arises as a result of injuries sustained within a camp where a volunteer is stationed, or within the confines of any accommodation where he is required to reside. Where a volunteer is disabled whilst proceeding on authorized leave to and from his destination, the provisions of the Act apply to him. If a boy has an accident when serving, he comes under the War Pensions Act. And there will be lots of these cases, as we all know.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to say that these provisions have existed for many years and they are the result of many years of experience in many lands, and I think it will be a poor show if the hon. the Minister does not put the matter right. I would like to make the hon. Minister an offer. If he will instruct his department to allow us to have an actuarial investigation of the possible cost to the country (although I don&#x2019;t believe that this has any bearing upon the matter whatsoever), I personally will arrange with the Legion that they will bear the cost of that actuarial valuation. That is not a challenge and I know the hon. Minister won&#x2019;t say &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, but that is how strongly we feel about this matter.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words in regard to a few points raised by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). He said that this Vote is a particularly important one and I agree with him. I also want to point out that the hon. the Minister and the Government agree with that statement of his, because the large sum of money made available under this Vote is evidence of it. But now the hon. member expatiated on what he called &#x201C;the large number endeavouring to eke out an existence on small pensions&#x201D;. We are all sympathetic towards these people who are not so well off, and we pity them, and we admit that there are many of them who have to live under very difficult circumstances, but in all fairness we cannot allow such a statement to stand uncontradicted. I do not say that the hon. member said it with any particular purpose, but we cannot allow the impression to be created that we are dealing here with a Government which is only prepared to sit and watch hundreds of thousands of people struggling to make a living on the small pension granted to them. I think we should view this matter of old age pensions in the correct perspective. I do not believe that under our present system the old age pension should be regarded as one intended to supply 100 per cent of the needs of a person. I think we should regard it as an amount provided to relieve the burdens of the aged. We should realize that the old age pension is there as an aid and that we have the right to expect the churches, the welfare organizations and particularly the children to assist their parents. If we view it in that light we will not criticize the Government unnecessarily. It is a fact that the Government is very sympathetic towards these people. But we must remember that when we are dealing with pensions we are dealing with the fact that pensions tend, <span class="col_4583-4584" refersTo="page_0918"/> like a snowball, always to increase and there is no government in the world which can afford always to increase pensions without taking into account what the eventual result will be. No government can commit itself to amounts which later might embarrass it. Although a government has the power again to reduce pensions, it still remains a fact that it would be almost impossible in practice to do so. Therefore a government must be cautious and cut its coat according to its cloth. I do not want to expatiate on the question of private pension schemes. The question of private pension schemes, as opposed to a State scheme, has repeatedly been discussed here. I was glad to hear that the hon. member also regarded a private scheme as a possible way by which the burdens of the aged can be alleviated.</p>

<p>If we just look for a moment at what the Government has done for our pensioners in recent years, we must come to the conclusion that we have a sympathetic Government. In these Estimates this year an increased amount of R3,000,000 is made available for increasing the various pensions. Civil pensions, or certain of them, are being increased by more than R100,000, and if we study the matter we find that the tendency there is this year to increase pensions is a tendency which we have noted for some years already. In 1952-3 concessions amounting to R4,500,000 were made to pensioners, and in 1953-4 it was R4,550,000. In 1955-6 there was also an increase of R3,800,000 granted by the Government by way of concessions. In the year 1956-7 there was also an increase of R5,400,000. So we can mention the figures year by year, but I do not want to detain the Committee by quoting figures unnecessarily. Year after year increased amounts were voted to assist these people. If we study the figures it is interesting to note that this increased expenditure was not due to an increase in the number of pensioners. On the contrary, the increased expenditure was mainly due to the concessions made. I want to quote a few figures to prove it. In 1947 the number of pensioners was about 60,000. It has now increased to 86,800. In other words, there was an increase in numbers of 34 per cent. But the expenditure increased from R6,570,000 to R23,000,000, a percentage increase of approximately 253. In other words, whereas the number of pensions increased by 34 per cent, the actual expenditure, as the result of increased pensions and allowances, increased by 253 per cent. Over the same period the maximum pension increased from R120 to R294, an increase of 145 per cent. This increase was not only intended to cover the increased cost of living. On the contrary, the increased allowances are more than the increased cost of living. If we again take the same period we find that in 1947 the figure was 139.7 and in 1962 the index figure was 230.6, an increase of 65 per cent, whereas the increase in the pension was 145 per cent. We find this tendency in regard to all other types of pensions, veterans&#x2019; pensions, disability allowances, etc., where the increased expenditure percentagewise was much higher than the increase in the number of pensioners. The hon. member also referred to the problem of the value of the dwelling-house. In that respect also concessions were made to the aged. The fact is that many people to-day do not know that the position is that a person can occupy a house valued at R7,520 and still draw an old-age pension. Another great concession is that where two aged people live in a house and the one spouse dies, the surviving spouse retains the pension, even though the value of the house, on a revaluation either by the municipality or by the trustee, is higher. For pension purposes the value of the house remains the same and the surviving spouse draws the same pension. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the remarks on the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross). He appealed to the hon. the Minister to give consideration to the abolition of the time limit for payment of marriage and children&#x2019;s allowances. It is felt that the maintenance of this arbitrary time limit is not only entirely unreasonable in present-day circumstances, but is really out-dated legislation. Other countries have abolished it and we now accept it as a fact that family allowances form part of a pensionable attribute to a war veteran. As the hon. member pointed out, it is illogical that some widows should receive these pensions when their husbands die, while others do not qualify for this pension simply because of the time limit. I would leave the reply of the hon. the Minister to the hon. member for Benoni who stated his case very well. But I do want to say that this is something which deserves immediate and earnest consideration.</p>

<p>Talking about matters that deserve immediate consideration, I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to another source of dissatisfaction as far as the War Pensions Act of 1942 is concerned. The Minister will remember that in 1942 the Act was amended to make provision for compensation for the loss of earnings by means of a supplementary allowance which was given in the form of a pension; this was in addition to the basic pension granted on the loss of amenities of life. To meet the increased cost of living a supplementary bonus was also given, and this bonus has not been paid in respect of the supplementary pension. The bonus has since been increased to 45 per cent of the basic pension which is granted to a pensioner. However, the bonus has not been made applicable to the supplementary pension. And when you remember the increase in the cost of living index, which is now approximately 230, you will see how necessary it is that this bonus should be made applicable to the supplementary pension as well. As everybody knows, the value of our currency has considerably depreciated since those years. It is totally unrealistic to keep that supplementary pension<span class="col_4585-4586" refersTo="page_0919"/> still as low as it is without allowing for the increase of the bonus to apply also to that supplementary pension. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to grant an increase in the ceiling for the supplementary pensions payable to disabled servicemen and widows of deceased military pensioners. While I fully agree that the point raised by the hon. member for Benoni is of vital importance in view of the increased number of young men who are now going to serve a nine months&#x2019; military course, I do want to say that this non-allowance of the basic increase in the supplementary pension is something which, in my opinion, is of equal importance to the point raised by the hon. member for Benoni, as it affects all pensioners.</p>

<p>Dealing with the disabilities under which pensioners suffer, I should like to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). He drew attention to the unrealistic position of only allowing an amount of &#x00A3;1,200&#x2014;R2,400&#x2014;as the basic amount of the unencumbered value of the house which may be owned by a pensioner, as the basis for his pension. With the increase in property values which is prevalent to-day, Sir, I think that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to increasing this basic amount to at least R6,000 and then let his calculations of <i>2&#x00BD;</i> per cent become applicable. One of the factors, I feel, which the Minister should consider is to waive the wireless licence fees which are now payable by old-age pensioners. We must remember that as far as an old-age pensioner is concerned&#x2014;many of them, I should say&#x2014;the only form of entertainment and relaxation which they have to-day is that which they get from the wireless. I do want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he gives consideration, in conjunction with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, in reducing these wireless fees from R5.5 to R1 only. There are only approximately 112,000 old-age pensioners and war veterans, and this reduction in the wireless licence fee is not going to be a very severe burden to the State. But it will be greatly appreciated by these people in their old age and in the twilight of their years.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister knows, when people are confined to work colonies the maintenance grant which is received by the family ceases on the day of the discharge of the inmate from such a work colony. Considerable hardship is suffered by wives and children who find that, immediately the inmate is released from the work colony, that grant ceases immediately. It is exceedingly difficult for any such person to obtain employment immediately. He finds that he is out of employment and his family is also deprived of that maintenance grant which was previously available to them. I should like the hon. the Minister to consider whether it is not possible in circumstances such as those, to continue the grant until the end of the following month or if that is going to be too severe, to continue the grant at least till the end of the month in which such an inmate is released. In that case the family will get the benefit of the maintenance grant until a fixed period of which they are aware and for which they can make provision. I think the hon. the Minister is fully aware that this is a considerable cause of hardship to many families in the Republic and I do not think that the extension of this facility will involve us in a considerable loss of revenue. Talking about loss of revenue, one of the causes of dissatisfaction to-day, as far as pensioners are concerned, is the fact that they have to pay income tax on their pensions.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members on both sides of the House will certainly not hold it against me if I congratulate the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter) in particular on the excellent speech made by him in connection with the building up of family life in our country, because without moral and religious famlies and unless the character of family life is absolutely sound, every attempt at upliftment and social advancement is hopeless and fruitless. I want to thank the hon. member therefore having made a very fine positive contribution and for his suggestion in connection with an ideal settlement for the aged.</p>

<p>The few ideas that I want to stress relate to one of these settlements, a branch of the work undertaken by Social Welfare. I refer to settlements for the physically disabed, indigent aged. There are three such settlements in our country, one at Karatara, one at Ganspan and one at Sonop. The latter is situated in the Brits district, and it is in connection with these settlements that I want to put forward a few ideas.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister knows, certain increases were given in the recent Budget to social pensioners, and I want to ask the Minister whether it is not possible to grant these same increases to these medically unfit<span class="col_4587-4588" refersTo="page_0920"/> and needy old people on the Sonop, Ganspan and Karatara settlements. When certain increases were brought about on previous occasions, even under the previous Government, and also under this Government, this type of settler was aways overlooked as far as increases were concerned. Members of Parliament always had to make representations to the Minister of Social Welfare, and then he had to make representations again to the Treasury. Eventually their pensions were supplemented by a certain amount, but they did not receive the full increase and sometimes they only received half the amount that was given to the ordinary social pensioner. I want to tell the Minister that the effect of this was that these settlers usually felt aggrieved, and I want to ask him whether he will not go into this matter. The Department may already have done so. We ask that in this case too the sickly aged on this type of settlement should also be given this increase in their pensions. I want to say to the Minister that any Minister and any Government who look after the aged, will have their days lengthened in this country that has been given to us. I do not want the hon. the Minister to do this with ulterior motives! We can deal with this matter on its merits, and I know that hon members on both sides of the House are sympathetic towards people of this kind. We are dealing here with cases of chronic invalidity, and I want to ask the Minister to give particular attention to those cases.</p>

<p>In this same connection I want to ask whether the time has not come for us to introduce a different classification on those settlements. I should like to state my position very clearly. I am a great advocate of settlements of this kind for the aged. I think they were given to the aged in order to give them a sense of achievement. There they were given free housing and other facilities such as a piece of land that they could cultivate. Those people were accommodated in a rural environment and to some extent they had to be correctly adapted again. But to-day I feel that there is something wrong with the selection. We have certain classes of old persons there. There are many families where both the hubsand and wife are entitled to a pension: in other cases the husband is an old man and the wife a young woman. In some families there are many children: in other cases the parties are chronic invalids. We find different types there. My request to the hon. the Minister is that he should order an exhaustive inquiry into the position of these social welfare settlers. I am informed that the sort of development that we want at Sonop is already taking place at Ganspan. I want to ask whether there cannot be a reclassification so that some of those houses can be given to lessees, so that some of these old persons who are entitled to the oudstryders&#x2019; pension or to the ordinary old-age pension will have the right to lease those houses for a certain amount, and then the land can be let again to others who are physically able to carry on further with their small and meagre pension. I do not want to enlarge upon the system as such. I do not want to interfere with the internal working of the system at Sonop. I know that the Minister is acquainted with the system because he has already paid a brief visit to this settlement. But I think this is the psychological moment for the Minister to order this inquiry and to see that we get a better classification there. Certain people who are entitled to oudstryders&#x2019; and other pensions will then perhaps be much better off if they can hire houses there and if they can perhaps pay a small amount for the privileges that they will enjoy there.</p>

<p>These are the two matters that I wanted to put to the hon. the Minister. I ask in the first place that the increase which has been given to the social pensioners should also be added to their pension, and in the second place I ask that a change should be brought about at Sonop, not in the spirit that prevails there but in the classification. I want to tell the Minister that there is a fine spirit there. There is goodwill and affection between the officials, the superintendent and the settlers. But what I am pleading for is a better classification so that many of these old people who are entitled to pensions will be able to hire a small house and enjoy the other facilities there such as free medical services and the other things that will be to their advantage, without the settlement as such having to be destroyed. Because, as Dr. Venter has informed the House very clearly, it is on this very type of settlement that upliftment work can be done and the family connection retained. I do not want the change that I advocate there to lead to the destruction of these settlements, but I am advocating that something should be done to place the settlement on a sound basis so that the various types will be better off than they are at the present moment.</p>

<p>I also want to ask the Minister to see to it that when the inquiry take splace the superintendent and his people will consult with the people on the settlement so that there will be no strife and discord later on that may disturb the present atmosphere there, an atmosphere which is always so necessary for the promotion of a fine spirit on such a settlement. I want to invite the Minister to pay another visit to Sonop as soon as possible. It is a fine place; there is a pleasant spirit there; the Minister will enjoy his visit and the people there will appreciate it very much.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal with some matters which old-age pensioners and war veterans have to contend with in their daily lives. I realize full well that the Minister has certain difficulties in meeting the wants of the old-age pensioners. But I would suggest to him that he works in close collaboration with other Departments, such as Agriculture, Posts and Telegraphs, and sees whether or not he cannot alleviate some of the hardships with<span class="col_4589-4590" refersTo="page_0921"/> which old-age pensioners have to contend. Firstly, I would say that one of the greatest hardships that an old-age pensioner or war veteran pensioner has to contend with is loneliness. In the matter of loneliness I think the State can help to some extent. I would like the Minister to consider the possibility of making an agreement with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in order to see whether he cannot exempt all old-age and war veterans pensioners from having to pay for a radio licence. I know members may say this is the wrong Vote under which to raise it, but this is not something which I can deal with under Posts and Telegraphs. Then I will be told that I must raise it under the Pensions Vote; and when I raise it under the Pensions Vote I will be told that I must raise it under Social Welfare and so on. But I am asking the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions to make some arrangement with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. It is his duty to try to help in this matter.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the question of malnutrition. How some of the old-age pensioners manage to exist on their pensions is a miracle to me. It is a miracle of management. How they divide their pension into amounts allowing for food, for accommodation, for transport, and for clothes, is to me one of those things which only those who have to do it are able to explain how they do it. To us, to me at any rate, it is one of the wonders of South Africa. I think it is a wonder to find that there are over 100,000 people managing on such a pension. A great many grumble about the amounts which they receive but we do know that the majority of pensioners are more than grateful for what they are getting. I say that we must try to do something to help these people who are already grateful. Here I want the Minister to discuss with the Department of Agriculture ways and means of combating malnutrition. We have all heard about the surpluses which this country is producing. Unfortunately a great amount of this food is being destroyed. In the time in which we are living with refrigeration plants and dehydration plants. I should like to see our Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions getting his own Department, if necessary, to keep excessive food either in refrigeration or by dehydration and selling it cheaply&#x2014;I say sell it; I do not say give it&#x2014;as cheaply as possible to the old-age pensioners, and the war veterans pensioners. It can be arranged. I do not think there will be many abuses: if there are I think they will be negligible. If an old-age pensioner goes to a store with a letter of authority or his old-age pension card he should be able to buy excess food either in a dehydrated or frozen condition. It should be sold cheaply and it will assist them to spend some of the money which they have on other essentials.</p>

<p>Now the matter of health. Because of malnutrition, because of old age, we find that the old-age pensioner is more liable to get ill than the young person who is well fed. The difficulty which arises is how does the old-age pensioner meet the beginning of an illness. And I say the beginning of an illness because out of the meagre pension which he receives, he has to pay for his first visit to the doctor.</p>

<p>I will tell the hon. member why. The second visit will probably be at the hospital. It is wrong to think that it is so easy for an old-age pensioner to get into a hospital. All sorts of difficulties arise. I know from experience that an old-age pensioner suffering from a disease of one sort or another will go to hospital on a Monday and be seen by a casualty officer who then tells him to come back a day or two later so that he can see a specialist. Those things cost money. It means travelling up and down from his home to the hospital. I do not know what the travelling facilities are at Odendaalsrus. I do not know how far the centre of the town is from the hospital or how far the outskirts of the town are from the hospital. I know in the large towns, where the majority of pensioners live, the poorest areas are usually furthest away from the hospitals and that it costs several shillings to get to the hospital and another several shillings to get back home.</p>

<p>I do not know many old-age pensioners who have telephones by their bedsides. Let us be practical about this. We know where these people live; they live in backyards of homes. They often lie ill in bed without the people knowing that they are ill. They are too ill to get out to inform anybody. Often you find a bottle or two of milk outside the door of an old-age pensioner and it is only that which draws the attention of the neighbour to the fact that something is wrong in the room. Do not let us make things more difficult for these people. I want to ease their hardships. I am not condemning the present system so much, but I want to make things easier for these people who are suffering. I repeat, Sir, that when the next-door neighbour comes in and finds the pensioner ill, that person invariably phones for a doctor. The number of calls that go to the district surgeon is virtually<span class="col_4591-4592" refersTo="page_0922"/> negligible. I want to make it easier for these people to receive treatment. The first visit the old-age pensioner makes to the doctor should be paid for. The medical profession will be only too pleased to assist. The Minister must devise ways and means of discussing the possibility of getting the initial visit of the pensioner to be paid for or partially paid for by the State. From then on the patient can be referred to the hospital and can be hospitalized, but I know from experience that the illnesses which are considered minor by the hospitals are very often major illnesses to the pensioner. The old woman of 70 with an attack of bronchitis will not be hospitalized, but will be given a bottle of medicine and sent home, because they do not have a bed for her. Then the question is who will pay for the medicine? A hundred and one difficulties arise. I would like at some time to have more opportunity of discussing this whole matter of helping the pensioners to get treatment in their own homes and to have district surgeons and district nurses looking after them. I know what services are given now, but I say they are inadequate. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>There are just a few points that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister. In the first place I want to say to the Minister that the aged are very happy about the increase that they received recently. Although R25 per month is very little, we appreciate that in the circumstances it cannot be increased. But I do want to suggest to the Minister that the means test should be more flexible and that it should be lowered. I do not want to plead, as other members have done, that we should do away with the means test. We had the example of free hospitalization and how it was misused; we found that well-to-do persons made more use of it than the people who really needed it. For that reason the abolition of the means test is out of the question, but what can be done is to lower it so that if a person owns a property worth R6,000 he will still qualify but will not receive more than R10 by way of pension. Two persons, for example, may own a property on which there is still a bond. They cannot live off their property: it simply provides them with a roof over their heads. They have to get something extra to be able to live, and that is where the means test hits these people. Something must be done to help them. A case was recently brought to my notice of a woman who was earning &#x00A3;36 per month. She and her husband own a house but the husband gets an old-age pension. They proceeded to let two rooms and their income then exceeded the limit of the means test, with the result that the husband&#x2019;s pension was reduced by half. There I feel that the means test must be changed. As far as I know R40 is the maximum that a person may earn and still qualify for a pension. Bearing in mind the high prices of to-day I feel that a change must be brought about and that the maximum permissible income should be raised to at least R60. Where a person owns a property worth R6,000 on which there is still a bond of R2,000 and he only receives R10, how is he to pay the interest and still live? We know that these people did a great deal for us in the past, and now that they have reached the twilight of their lives we should try to make it possible for them to live decently during the short period that they still have left.</p>

<p>Then there is another point that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister, and here I hope that I am wrong. I refer to the case where a grandmother takes a child from one of her children, where the father has died perhaps or where the parents are unable to raise the child. That child is not considered by the Department of Welfare. There was a case where I tried to get something for such a grandmother who was raising a child, but I was unable to get anything for her. I think it is very important that the Minister should tell us whether that is correct.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has talked about medical services. I agree with him and I want to support his suggestion that there ought to be a panel of doctors for aged people so that they can choose a doctor who can treat them free of charge at home. Not only do they lack the means sometimes to be admitted to hospital but their health may be such that they cannot go to hospital. In those cases the State ought to intervene and see to it that a house doctor is appointed for those people.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Speaker after speaker has pointed out that due to the new medicines and techniques people are becoming older and that the number of people over the age of 65 is increasing year by year. It is true that there is a universal dread of old age amongst all people, even amongst those who have means and can afford to grow old. On the one hand, a man desires a long life, and on the other hand he dreads the consequences of longevity. A great writer once said that to know how to grow old is the master work of wisdom and one of the most difficult chapters in the art of living. But I want to say that it is most difficult for those people who have not the means to grow old gracefully and to support themselves. For an old person to live, three things are necessary. There should be enough money to retire on and to supply their needs. Secondly, they should have a suitable place to live in, and thirdly they should have an aim in life to replace the aims of their previous employment. When I think of the old age pensioner, I say that the first and third points I made go together; they must have enough money and they must have an aim in life, and this is where our system falls down. The old age pensions are hopelessly inadequate to maintain a decent standard of living. Here I must<span class="col_4593-4594" refersTo="page_0923"/> differ from the hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer). I find it rather ironical that a man representing the richest constituency in South Africa should tell us that the old age pensioner needs nothing and that the pension should not be considered as a pension granting all the necessities of life, but that it should rather be considered as an aid to the pensioner. Surely the hon. member has heard of the means test and that if a person has an income of more than R15 a month he cannot receive the old age pension, so it is the needy person who gets the pension and not the rich person. The old age pension is hopelessly inadequate to maintain a decent standard of life. That is why I say it should go together with my third point, that they should have an aim in life to keep them busy. I believe that the means test should be there, but I do not think the means test, as it is today, is quite correct. I believe that once the means test has been applied, the old age pensioner should be allowed to go to work and to get himself a new aim in life according to his strength and his ability to work. He may be able to work one or two hours a day, but to-day he is debarred from doing that because he sacrifices his pension immediately he earns over R15 a month. I find that we are so different in South Africa from the rest of the world. In all the Western countries they are creating employment for old age pensioners. In America there are firms who take in these pensioners and the Government is encouraging them by subsidizing them. I think the Minister should also think of that and encourage firms here to do the same. I disagree with the hon. member for Kimberley-South who speaks about &#x201C;villages for the aged&#x201D;. Sir, there is no sadder thing than to see these people in the old age homes waiting for death, where they have no outside interests. I regularly visit an old age home and they say to me that the saddest thing of all is that they are all old people and that week by week one of them dies. I believe that the old people should live in circumstances where they can see the rest of the world, where they can see the motor-cars and the children playing and have an interest in life. They should not be isolated. They must come into contact with life and with young people in order to keep some young ideas in their old minds.</p>

<p>I come back to the argument that they should be allowed to earn something more. The Minister will say that is the case in regard to people over 70, but why not make it applicable to all pensioners? After all, when a teacher goes on pension to-day, nothing debars him from taking other work. He does not have to sacrifice his pension, and the State contributes towards his pension also. The same applies to the whole of the Public Service. They have their pensions plus their salaries. If we could do the same for our old age pensioners it would be a big contribution to their happiness.</p>

<p>Then I come to a suitable place to live. Here I find myself, like the hon. member for Langlaagte, up against the means test. I find that where a man, through his thrift, has a little house of R2,400&#x2014;it is not a palace; in Cape Town it is little more than a hovel but he lives there, and the value of the property is taken into account for his pension, and the two of them, he and his wife, are allowed &#x00A3;160 or R320 a year and they are still entitled to the full pension. But then the one dies and the one who remains behind is credited with the full amount of &#x00A3;160 for the house. The circumstances have not changed; it is still the same old house, and this person, together with the grief of losing his or her partner, is now faced with the position of losing the whole old age pension.</p>

<p>The hon. member is wrong. &#x00A3;160 is calculated for the two, and it is &#x00A3;80 for each person. They are allowed to have &#x00A3;30 10s. a month, so they qualify for the full pension if it is divided into two, but if the one partner dies it is &#x00A3;160 for the survivor and they do not get any pension at all. That is a tragedy. I think we should reconsider this. It is nine years that I have been in this hon. House and every year the Minister has heard the same plea from both sides of the House. I have looked through the speeches made in past years, and in 1960 there were fourteen speeches on this subject and twelve of them were on this subject. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus was one of the two who did not speak about it. But year after year the same plea has been made to the Minister. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. members for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) and Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) adopt the attitude that the State is obliged to take care of all old people and that no obligation rests on the private individual. The law provides that a parent must support his child, and that obligation is mutual; the child is also obliged to support his parent. I think the first obligation that rests on a child is to support his parents if they are unable to take care of themselves. It will be a sad day if children, churches and welfare organizations can no longer take care of the aged and if the State is obliged to do so. Can you imagine. Sir, how hard hearted the individual is going to become if the obligation no longer rests on him to take care of the aged?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) has talked about the means test. It is true that the means test causes certain difficulties. In every case where application is made for an old-age pension and the applicant has fixed property, the value of the property is taken into account. I understand that<span class="col_4595-4596" refersTo="page_0924"/> the value of the property must not exceed R7,260 not R2,400, as the hon. member for Springs has said, or R4,800 as the hon. member for Drakensberg has said. I want to make a suggestion to the Minister in connection with the plea of the hon. member for Umbilo with regard to housing for the aged. I agree with him that there are many old people who are living in small little rooms and in garages in back-streets, and that is something that should not be permitted in our country. In those cases where persons own property, the value of which is so high that they cannot get a pension, I have been wondering whether the value of such a house cannot be assessed and the life expectation of such a person taken into account and whether the value of the property cannot then be divided by the number of years that person is still expected to live; for example, if a house is worth R8,000 and a person aged 65, with a life expectation of 10 years, applies for a pension, cannot he be given a pension R800 per annum on condition that on his death that property will be transferred to the State? If that person dies sooner, the State will be the party that benefits. If he lives longer than the expected period, he will be sure of a roof over his head until he dies, and thereafter the property will belong to the State. Within a few years then we will find that the State will be the owner of numerous houses, and persons who have no home of their own can then be put in those houses, and the fact that they are housed can then be taken into consideration for pension purposes. This would solve the housing problem. I make that suggestion to the Minister and I hope he will consider it.</p>

<p>Then I also want to thank the Minister for having succeeded once again in getting pensions increased. Even though it is only 5 cents a day, we are grateful to him for it. I also want to thank the Minister for the housing schemes that he has established throughout the country for the aged. These schemes provide housing on a large scale, and although there is room for a certain amount of criticism, we welcome these schemes. I agree that it must not only be in certain places where old people only are housed in these schemes; I agree that they should still mix with the community and that it would be better for them to live with younger people in their old age. But if the Minister goes into my proposal in connection with the assessment of life expectation and the valuation of properties, these schemes will no longer be necessary. I want to thank the Minister once again for everything that he has done in the past for the oudstryders and the old-age pensioners.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I have three points I should like to submit to the sympathetic consideration of the Minister. The first has been dealt with so ably and so exhaustively by the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) that it is hardly necessary for me to touch upon it again except to say, that the hon. member for Benoni mentioned the Special Committee that was appointed by Mr. Sturrock as Minister of Finance in 1947 to advise him on this question of the validity of the claim of the wife and children of a pensioner. I was a member of that Committee, and if I can be of any assistance to the Minister in giving consideration to the appeal of the hon. member for Benoni, I shall be very glad to do so.</p>

<p>My second point is one of which I again have personal experience. I am thinking of the case of the disabled soldier who has to return to hospital again because he has trouble with war wounds after the war. There are many such cases. He is treated very sympathetically when he goes to hospital. He receives a pension of 100 per cent while he is in hospital, but when he leaves hospital and returns home and is not quite ready to work, he has either to go to work in an unfit condition, or revert to his ordinary pension, say 50 per cent or 60 per cent. I make this plea that the Minister should consider these cases and, if possible, extend the period of 100 per cent payment until the man is able to resume work. I know these cases. I spent months in hospital with these people. I was in the same condition. I am sorry to touch on a personal note, but I feel very deeply about this. Fortunately I was a public servant and was treated very sympathetically by the Government of the day.</p>

<p>My third point I am peased to able to mention in the presence of the hon. the Minister of Finance. He has come in at the right moment. A few years ago the Minister of Finance of the day, our present Minister of Foreign Affairs, introduced a pension scheme for oudstryders of the Anglo Boer War without any means test. It was most popularly received by everybody, by men on both sides. Men who actually fought for the British Forces and are now living in South Afrcia, receive that pension just as the old Boers receive it&#x2014;God bless them on both sides. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should use his sympathetic influence with the hon. the Minister of Finance to extend that scheme to the veterans of World War I who are now over 70. I urge that the man who is over 70 should come in that category and receive that oudstryders pension without any means test. I think that is a fair claim. I do not wish to press it further. I think the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions has the first qualification that a Minister holding that portfolio should have: his heart is in the right place. I think he receives these cases very sympathetically. We do not realize in South Africa that the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions in modern civilized industrial countries is regarded as one of the keymen of any Cabinet. In the British system, in the new welfare state, he is almost the keyman in the Cabinet, and some of their best men are given that portfolio. Great responsibility rests upon the hon. the Minister and in these cases I have mentioned I can<span class="col_4597-4598" refersTo="page_0925"/> assure him of the wholehearted support of this side of the House.</p>

<p>One of the less pleasant aspects of the capitalistic system is that during times of plenty, during times of over-production, there is, for example, a tendency to destroy food in order to increase the price. I regard it as a gruesome and deadly crime to destroy food, particularly if the object is to increase the price of that product or to keep the price high. We on this side say that during the years when we were still in Opposition we continually objected to the destruction of food in order to increase the prices of those products; we fought against it. For that reason I wish to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to negotiate with his colleagues, the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, to see to it that when there is such over-production, that food will never be destroyed in South Africa but that it will be distributed, perhaps at cost price, towards which end the Department may possibly pay a subsidy, to orphanages and other welfare institutions where necessary. That in the first place.</p>

<p>That brings me to a second matter and in this respect I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter). I wish to join him in paying tribute to those who were responsible for observing last year as a family year. Congresses were held on the occasion; many speeches were made; many lectures were given; a great deal of guidance was given but it would be a tragedy if it were to remain at that, if all those beautiful suggestions and plans were to remain suspended in mid-air and if nothing tangible and concrete resulted.</p>

<p>I wish to return to something which I raised last year in connection with the same matter but in connection with which nothing has really been done. I wish to avail myself of this opportunity of asking that as an outcome of the family year consideration should be given to introducing marriage guidance as a subject in our secondary schools; that the Minister of Social Welfare should plead with the Minister of Education that a subject marriage guidance be introduced in our secondary schools. It is a well known fact that a man&#x2019;s happiness lies between his home and his profession. After all everybody finds his happiness in his home and his profession. In other words, everything, therefore, depends on the profession a man chooses and the woman he marries&#x2014;or perhaps does not marry and similarly in the case of a woman, the man she marries and the profession of her husband&#x2026;</p>

<p>We are dealing with serious matters; we should not become frivolous. I say, Sir, that your happiness lies between your home and your work. After all everything depends on the profession you choose and the woman you marry.</p>

<p>As far as your profession is concerned, guidance is given in our schools; that is being looked after, but no provision is made for marriage guidance which ultimately decides your happiness more than anything else does. That is why I wish to plead with the hon. the Minister to go into the matter and see whether it is not possible to introduce a subject in our secondary schools, namely the subject marriage guidance, under which many aspects can be dealt with, as for example, the yardstick to apply when seeking an ideal mate. A multitude of aspects can fall under such a subject. I do not wish to go into that at the moment; this is not the time or the place to do so. But I think it will be worth while giving attention to this matter, as a positive contribution to reduce the divorce figure.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say this in respect of the pleas that have been made for the lowering of the means test. This side of the House has often pleaded for that in the past; hon. members opposite have associated themselves with us and they are still doing so as they again did to-day. Like us they plead that the means test should be lowered, particularly where people live in a little house which belong to them, so that they can qualify for the old-age pension. We know it is a very difficult problem; it is difficult to determine where to draw the line, but the one anomaly remains and that is that those who have saved, those who have perhaps sacrificed all the conveniences of life in order to save for their old age, who have saved to acquire a little home of their own for those days, are actually penalized because they have saved, because they do not receive the old-age pension. On the contrary the spendthrift, however, the person who did not save, is rewarded for having been a spendthrift, because he does in fact receive the old-age pension. I think we should in any case reflect on this and evolve some plan to remove that anomaly because I do not think it is right that it should continue to exist. That is why I want to plead once again, as I have repeatedly done in the past, that the one and only house which a person owns, without his having any other income, should not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the means test.</p>

<p>I am very interested in the suggestion which the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) made a few moments ago in regard to the advisability&#x2014;I do not think he put it any higher than that&#x2014;of providing instruction in the schools in regard to the problems and responsibilities of marriage&#x2014;one might say, marriage guidance in the schools. Sir, we know that &#x201C;marriage guidance&#x201D; has become quite the norm in South Africa, but largely because of the abnormally<span class="col_4599-4600" refersTo="page_0926"/> high incidence of divorce. We have the &#x201C;proud&#x201D; record of being among the countries in the Western world where the divorce rate is at its very highest, and these marriage guidance organizations, as I am sure the hon. member for Boksburg is aware, usually come into the picture when a marriage having been entered into, it begins to go on the rocks; something has happened to the one or the other or both parties, and the marriage, if not already on the rocks, is certainly heading in that direction&#x2014;and then marriage instruction is given to either or both of the parties concerned! Having had something to do with this organization in Johannesburg, I can only identify myself with the hon. member in saying that this idea is a very good one, but the problem one has to face is this: When is this instruction to be given in the school, and on what basis and through which media? Because I think the hon. member will agree that in a successful marriage there are certain minimum essentials and one of them is compatibility. We have been assured by psychologists, ever since the word psychology was brought into our language, that compatibility rests in the first place on sex, on agreement on that particular aspect of marriage. I do not want to develop the subject this afternoon, because I have not raised it, but I want to say that until we clear our minds of what is undoubtedly the mental block we have in this country about giving sex instruction in schools, then I am very much afraid that we cannot&#x2026;</p>

<p>I am quite prepared, Sir, to recognize the rulings I am getting from that side of the House if you will support them. I was going to say, just to complete the point, that unless you are prepared to incorporate sex instruction in your marriage guidance instruction in the schools, you cannot advance the project in any way whatsoever. I want to leave it on the basis that this is a matter to which all members of this House, if they see it in the way in which the hon. member for Boksburg does see it, should give very serious consideration in order to decide whether that type of education or instruction should be given in our schools and at what age, at what stage and in what way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) said that the pensioners&#x2014;possibly pensioners within his own circle of acquaintances&#x2014;say that they are thankful for the extra five cents per day which they have received in terms of the Budget. Sir, I do not know whether I mix with the wrong kind of pensioners, but I want to tell the hon. the Minister that as recently as this week when I was in Johannesburg, I saw a number of my constituents who are old-age pensioners, because in the constituency of Hospital, which is in the very heart of Johannesburg, there are several thousands of people who qualify for and receive the old-age pension, and one knows of them and has contact with them from time to time. There is no question that they will, of course, accept the extra five cents per day, but this thankfulness to which the hon. member for Prinshof referred just now must not mislead the Minister or the Government into thinking that they have now done the right thing by the pensioners&#x2014;because I want to tell the Minister that some of the pensioners are either not so old that they cannot read or not so illiterate that they are unable to read; some of them have acquired a radio or preserved it from better times and days; in other words, they hear the news and read the news, and this is the point that has been put to me as recently as this week by more than one old-age pensioner: Why is it that in these circumstances in which we hear on the radio and read in the newspapers about the burgeoning economy of South Africa; as one particularly well-spoken pensioner said: the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, when he addressed this House quite recently, gave chapter and verse not only about the soundness of our economy but the constant, in fact the almost inevitable growth of it&#x2026;</p>

Now, how is it, in view of the fact that our economy is so flourishing, in view of the fact that the gold-mining industry has once again broken its all-time record&#x2014;and it is common cause even amongst the pensioners that the Government receives a considerable proportion of the revenue earned by the goldmining industry&#x2014;how is it, when we are assured on all sides that although it is a considerable amount of money, the sum of R120,000,000 for Defence is one that we can easily bear and should be thankful to bear, how is it that in spite of all those facts&#x2014;all that the Government can find for me, the old-age pensioner, is an extra five cents a day, which in a large city is not even a one-way bus-fare?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am well aware of the fact that when you multiply five cents by 90,000 and then multiply that by 365 to get your annual cost, it becomes much more than five cents, but that, with due respect to the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) does not alter the fact that the individual is not the nation. The individual is concerned with his own problems, just as he and I would be, and to that individual the globular cost of this increase means exactly nothing. But what does make an impact is the matter that was raised here by the hon. member for Prinshof, that the individual pensioner is now going to get five cents per day extra. All I want to say&#x2014;believe me, not in a spirit of criticism of the Government, but merely in order to<span class="col_4601-4602" refersTo="page_0927"/> provide, to the extent that I personally can do so, a spur on the Government to do better than this&#x2014;all I can say is that the Government must not fall into the error of thinking that throughout the land there are thousands of old-age pensioners who now fold their hands in thankfulness to the Government for the extra five cents per day. Most of them, with great respect to the Minister, are convinced&#x2014;those of them who are still fit enough to think for themselves, able to hear news and to read it and to talk to other people&#x2014;that the Government can and should do better in the present circumstances in which South Africa finds herself. I sincerely hope, therefore, that he will not merely fall into this postbudget lethargy of saying, &#x201C;We, the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, have done our bit for the old-age pensioners, we have given them an increase&#x201D;, because that increase is so small, regardless of what the total cost to the country is, that I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree that in no-one&#x2019;s budget can five cents a day make an appreciable difference between living even slightly below the subsistence level and living well below it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>In the nature of things, as hon. members will understand and realize, in dealing with a Vote of this nature, there are a few main requirements that one can state generally. One of the first requirements, which I have stated year after year and with which hon. members on both sides of the House have complied, is that this matter of Social Welfare and Pensions must be approached in a spirit of goodwill. The second aspect is that in approaching it in such a spirit of goodwill, we as responsible representatives of the nation must also approach it in a spirit of sober realism and ask ourselves what lies within the realm of practical politics. It will serve no purpose to speculate about things which are unrealistic and to stir up expectations which we know perfectly well cannot be realized. And in dealing with a Department such as this, I want to say at once that I very much appreciate the fact that hon. members on both sides of the House have raised this matter in the spirit in which they have done so, and I should like them to have some idea of the nature and scope of the activities of this Department. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) began his half-hour speech by emphasizing the enormous scope of this Department and then went on to deal with the nature and character of the Department. I just want to give these details to the Committee, and I do so not only because I owe it to members of this Committee but also because I owe it to the public. The hon. member for Umbilo has stated quite correctly that this Vote affects the interests of thousands and thousands of the less-privileged section of our population. It affects their intimate interests; it affects their personal interests, and because it affects their personal interests, it affects the interests of all of us, because, after all, all of us, on whichever side we may be sitting, have been sent here to look after the welfare of the nation. I do not therefore want to curtail the debate on this Vote. In the course of these discussions, suggestions are made on various sides of the House. All those suggestions are duly recorded and we go into all these matters again. In due course when the Vote has been disposed of, the officials of my Department and I again give our specific attention to these matters. And we do so because this is a matter, both with regard to social welfare and pensions, which is never static; it is an organism which develops throughout the years, because the life, the existence of mankind is never static, and in a developing world such as that in which we live, where new demands are made every day upon every individual, whether he is rich or poor, it is our duty under this Vote to give attention to the new demands which the new times make upon those whose interests we are called upon to look after under this Vote. Let me outline the scope of it to hon. members. The Department of Social Welfare and Pensions receives an average of 3,000 letters per day, <span class="col_4603-4604" refersTo="page_0928"/> and the Department answers an average of 1,500 letters per day, but these are not letters which can be replied to by way of circular letters. Every letter deals with a personal case, with the personal interests of the people whose cases are submitted to the Department. I realized, after I had been charged with this responsibility for some time, that these were not matters which could be dealt with by way of circular letters, for the very reason that here one is dealing with the intimate life and the very existence of human beings, each differing to a large extent from the other, and that is why these matters have to be dealt with so individually and intimately. Every letter that comes in therefore must be gone into properly and every letter that goes out must have regard to the particular interests of the person concerned. Let me just add this. Something like 400,000 files are in daily circulation in the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, and in those files there is a record of the history of the individual persons whose interests have to be looked after. I want to say this to the credit of the officials of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions: We have an agreement that we do not simply dispose of cases in general, that every case must be studied on its merits, and it is because every case is studied on its merits and thoroughly studied that we have this enormous number of files circulating daily. It goes without saying that mistakes are sometimes made. In a vast organization such as this one cannot possibly expect that no mistakes will be made. Mistakes are made sometimes. Delays which could have been avoided are often caused by mistakes which are made, and we are always very sorry when delays do take place. I have asked my Department to give me some sort of estimate as to the percentage of mistakes that are made in such a vast organization that has to deal with so many details, and they tell me that they have worked it out at 5 per cent at most. In such an extensive organization, which has such a great variety of functions, this is indeed an achievement on the part of the officials of the Department, and I want to thank them for it.</p>

<p>I have said that I should not like to curtail the opportunities to discuss this Vote, and the reason why I do not want to do so is because I think that these are matters in which we have a particular interest. They are matters in which not only we have a particular interest, but they are matters in which thousands and thousands of people outside share that interest with us. I just want to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact again that not only does this matter of social welfare, and to a large extent also the question of the destinies of social pensioners and others, receive the attention of the State but they also receive attention daily from a host of organizations and people in the private sector and from Church bodies. I would be failing in my duty if I did not once again, after the experience that I have had in the past year and in previous years, express my greatest appreciation of the contribution that has been made by the private sector, including Church bodies of all the various denominations and by the more than 2,000 registered welfare organizations and the hundreds of organizations which are affiliated with them, assisted by the private initiative of people in our community who take a loving interest in those members of the community who are less favourably endowed and who are struggling. I know from my experience from time to time what it means to have such an interwoven organization consisting of the State, the Church and the community, and that it is essential that in such an interwoven organization we should always concentrate on promoting a spirit of goodwill between the various branches of that organization. It is necessary in this organization to have State channels through which the closest contact can be maintained with the organizations in the private sector. Those channels have been created and are kept functioning smoothly so that the contacts built up over the years will not be broken down. We have our field services, we have our regional offices, we have our district offices. Apart from our district offices we have links with every magistrate&#x2019;s office, and specific instructions have been given to the officials of the regional offices&#x2014;and every regional office is headed by a well-trained, capable official, assisted by the best men we can give him&#x2014;to acquaint themselves with the difficulties that arise in connection with old-age pensioners and to keep in constant touch with all branches of social services which are included in this organization. They have to keep in touch with them and send out their officials, each in his own region. I then convene a meeting of all the regional heads in Pretoria once a year; we hold a regional conference which lasts approximately a week, and there every regional official has to submit a written report on the position as he found it, the difficulties that arose and the hitches that he discovered in the region that he represents. We then discuss the various problems there. I open the conference myself and we then get a full report of the difficulties that have arisen in the course of the year so that we can take systematic steps in this connection.</p>

<p>Whenever this Vote has come under discussion I have extended an invitation to members of this Committee and I have said that as far as I am concerned, as far as the Department and the regional offices, the district offices and the branch offices are concerned, our doors are always open to hon. members of this House and to members of the public, during the recess as well, to bring cases to our notice. Since appreciation has been expressed by hon. members, amongst others by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), of the spirit in which we approach this matter, I too want to express my appreciation to hon. members. But I want to ask them to have no hesitation at all in bringing to our notice difficult<span class="col_4605-4606" refersTo="page_0929"/> cases which may occur, where it looks as though difficulties may be caused. It is our duty to give attention to those cases as far as we can.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) that we may only come at a later stage to the details that he discussed here to-day, because I have said already that we would not like to curtail the discussion, but at this stage I want to reply in connection with some of the specific matters raised by him. In the first place he referred to the annual report of the Department. It is true that the last report is the 1959 report. We are considering the question as to whether annual reports can be issued at shorter intervals. An annual report will be issued again next year. We are working on the report at present. As hon. members are aware, this House passed the Children&#x2019;s Act some time ago and we are now going into the practical implementation of the Children&#x2019;s Act. That is one of the matters that we would like to deal with in the next report, and that is one of the reasons why the report has been delayed. It goes without saying that we would like to make available as much information as possible to people who are interested in the work of the Department of Social Welfare.</p>

<p>The hon. member talked about the possibility of issuing booklets or brochures containing details that will be of value to interested parties. I can only say to the hon. member that it will, of course, be an impossible task to send full details to everybody, without knowing whether or not the person concerned is interested.</p>

<p>The question of making available information at the various offices such as the magistrates&#x2019; courts or the regional offices or the district offices, is a different matter, of course. We shall ascertain where inquiries have been made and in what connection, and on the basis of that information we shall decide to what extent we are going to make such information available.</p>

<p>The hon. member touched upon another matter of exceptional interest. Hon. members will recall that both here and in the Other Place I frankly stated my attitude on a few successive occasions with regard to this question of co-operation between the Church, the State and the community, and I stated in connection with the care of children and the care of the aged that it was my honest conviction that it would be a sad day for South Africa if the care of children and the care of the aged were to be entrusted solely to the State and if the State alone were to look after them. If we did leave it entirely to the State, we would be doing harm to what is an essential requirement in dealing with these cases, the requirement of love and a sympathetic approach. What these people need is not only money for them to spend. I do not say that we should not do what we can in this respect, but what is also necessary is to give these people a certain amount of love. What they need is a little sunshine and the knowledge that their fellowmen in the community are interested in them. If we simply accept such a plea and say that we are going to abolish the means test entirely as far as social pensioners are concerned, we shall be breaking down that stronghold, because we will then be making it possible for everybody, for the irresponsible people to say, &#x201C;As far as social services are concerned we can leave everything in the hands of the State now; it does not matter in what way this is done and in what spirit it is done&#x201D;. If it is necessary to do so, I shall go into this matter further. I do not want to make any comparisons here this afternoon. In the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill I mentioned what improvements had been brought about from time to time since 1947 up to the present moment in connection with social pensions and other grants under the Department. But it is of no avail to mention all the figures here and then to come along to-morrow or the next day and to say that we have now abolished the means test entirely and that we have placed the responsibility for the care of the aged entirely on the State if we then find that the aged have to face life without any love. To my mind the fine feature of our system is that we cooperate in such a way that we get the attention and the contribution and the labour and the love and the co-operation of the public, of the welfare organizations and of the Church bodies. Let me mention an example to illustrate what I mean. About five months ago I personally went to Johannesburg at the invitation of a committee to go and investigate the position of the blind in Johannesburg. I spent the whole day in Johannesburg, and together with the chairman of the committee, Mr. Ramsay, and Mrs. Dr. van der Merwe, members of the committee and the welfare worker I visited the workshops; we met these people, and from the workshops we went to the places where they live and investigated the circumstances. But the committee dealing with the care of the blind asked me to give them a little advice. I then said to them. &#x201C;My advice to you is that we should all co-operate to see whether we can improve the position of these people&#x201D;. I do not want to detain this Committee with a description of the conditions that I saw there. I outlined a target to them and said that the committee, in co-operation with the public of Johannesburg, should try to collect a certain amount for this specific purpose. They then asked me what I thought their target should be. I said that I thought about &#x00A3;10,000. Just two days later the committee reported that land had been donated to them in Johannesburg for the erection of better accommodation for these people. Last week they asked me again to come to Johannesburg for the preview of a film shown by African Theatres where the fund-raising effort reached its culmination.<span class="col_4607-4608" refersTo="page_0930"/> After four or five months the public of Johannesburg collected R20,000 through that organisation. I mention that here as an example. There are numerous cases of this kind throughout the whole country, but the public is just waiting to be organized to make their contribution and to assist in caring for the aged and in developing children&#x2019;s institutions, etc. There are many people who are prepared to take the necessary interest and to give the warm love that is so necessary in this matter. I want to point out to the hon. member for Umbilo and other hon. members who referred to this matter that it is very easy to say, &#x201C;Abolish the means test&#x201D;. It is very easy to say that the means test should be relaxed. This matter has been gone into very thoroughly by Government after Government but it is very difficult just to abolish the means test.</p>

<p>That is why we asked for a commission of inquiry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>This matter has been investigated by commission after commission and by committee after committee. But I want to say to the hon. member that if a commission were to investigate this matter and find that we must say farewell to the system that we have to-day in connection with social pensions for the aged, for example, and that the State should accept the full responsibility for it, I would not be prepared to accent such a recommendation Decause of the defects that I have already mentioned. Changes will be brought about from time to time, just as there have been changes in the past. The hon. member for Umbilo also asked what the position was with regard to the inquiry by the Bureau of the Department of Education, Arts and Science. This inquiry is nearing completion and we hone to make the report available in the near future. Then the hon. member for Umbilo as well as other hon. members referred to the problem of the value of the pensioner&#x2019;s house in calculating social pensions and allowances. My Department and I have been giving attention to this question of housing since the previous session of Parliament last year. We have instituted a very thorough and intensive investigation to see to what extent relief can be provided in those cases where people own and occupy their own houses. We have devoted a great deal of time to this matter, and perhaps I should just say this on this occasion: The inquiry that we ordered into this matter through our regional offices and through our district offices, throughout the country, has revealed that there are something like 125,000 White persons receiving social pensions, It is estimated, according to the data at our disposal, that of the 125,000, 105,000 are already receiving the maximum pension, and it is estimated that of the remaining 20,000 only about one-half, about 10,000, are people occupying their own houses. What is the position going to be? If we do something for the pensioners who own their own houses, in addition to what is being done already, only 10,000 out of the 125,000 will benefit from it, but these 10,000 will be from the upper stratum of pensioners and not from the ranks of the less privileged. I do not blame people for bringing to the notice of the Minister or of the Department matters which they regard as being of importance and in connection with which they feel that an improvement can be brought about. The position is that R2,400 is allowed as far as the value of a house is concerned. An unencumbered value of R2,400 is exempted. Let us assume that the amount is increased to R3,400. The estimated expenditure in respect of that concession would then be R340,000 per annum, and this would benefit only one section of our social pensioners. But there is also this important aspect that we must not lose sight of, that out of the 125,000, the 10,000 pensioners who would benefit as the result of this, constitute only 8 per cent of the pensioners. Furthermore, it must not be overlooked that we would then be making a concession to the most privileged section, in other words, those who own their own house. The rest, many of whom are living in rooms and struggling hard, would not benefit. Many of them are people who have to pay rental. What are we to do in connection with those who pay rental? The suggestion put forward would benefit a section of the more privileged pensioners while the remainder would receive no benefit. I mention this to indicate clearly that every possible inquiry is instituted where we receive suggestions to bring about improvements. And this is not a process which comes to an end, it is a continuing process.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni raised the question of war pensioners. I shall deal with the details in this connection later on. I have already informed the hon. member privately that this matter has again been brought to my notice and that we are continually in touch with the B.E.S.L., and I have already given instructions that this matter must be fully investigated again, because if there is anything at all that can be done we should like to do it. It is true, as the hon. member has said, that in other Commonwealth countries this 10-year limit has been abolished, whereas we still retain it, but it is also true that in many of these countries the position as a whole as far as total benefits are concerned, is not as good as it is in this country. But this matter will be gone into thoroughly again. I shall give and deal with the further details later on. I now move&#x2014;</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>By means of this Bill we are again bringing into operation the appropriate legislation that was used previously to grant moratorium protection to soldiers on active service. I refer to the Defence Special Pensions and Moratorium Act, 1940, and the Public Welfare Act, 1914-1919, or portions of those Acts. Nobody likes the idea of disturbing the ordinary course of business by means of moratorium legislation, but since South Africa has always been dependent to a very large extent for her defence on her citizen forces, we must see to it that we do not do an injustice to those whom we compel to serve in our citizen forces, and particularly now that we are compelling our young men to serve for long periods, it is necessary that they be given protection of this nature. During the two previous world wars we had similar moratorium legislation to boost the morale of the men in our defence force and to protect their financial position. Provision was also made during the disturbances of 1960 for moratorium protection for the people who were called up during the disturbances. But there is a difference between what was done then and what we are doing now. The previous moratoria were introduced during periods of war or unrest. This is a departure therefore. We are now asking for the first time for moratorium protection during a period of peace, but that is due to the fact that we are taking men of the citizen forces out of their civilian occupations for nine months and compelling them to undergo military training. We feel therefore that it is only right that they should also be given moratorium protection. It is perfectly clear that we intend to give this moratorium protection only to those who undergo compulsory training. In the first place we do not want anybody who undergoes voluntary military training to volunteer for military training in order to seek protection against his lawful creditors. It will therefore be applicable only to people who undergo compulsory training.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of the Bill brings into operation certain provisions of the Defence Special Pensions and Moratorium Act, No 29 of 1940, in so far as they are applicable in the circumstances. Clause 2 also applies this Bill to the territory of South West Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has given a brief outline for the reason of the presentation of this Moratorium Bill. He has made it clear that it is linked up with the extended period of training of nine months, which the young men of the country are being called upon to undergo. The hon. the Minister has also made it clear that the Bill will only apply to ballotees, in other words those who have no option but to attend military training. If I heard him correctly, I think he implied that if we extended it to people who volunteered for service, some people may volunteer for military service in order to avoid other responsibilities incurred by them. That may be so. As the Bill reads now, it is confined to ballotees, and we propose to support the Bill, but I think the hon. the Minister may find at a later stage that he will have to give further consideration<span class="col_4611-4612" refersTo="page_0932"/> to the volunteer element, because as the number of trainees increases, which we understand is the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;the Minister has stated before that each year it is proposed to increase the number of ballotees called up&#x2014;he will find that it is essential to have a bigger proportion of trained men to mix with the new trainees in order to preserve a balance between experienced men and the balloted trainees called up by him. Therefore volunteers, although they come of their own free will, may well prove eventually to be necessary and an essential feature of the new expanded training system, as the resouces of the Permanent Forces in the supply of the instructors and suchlike are over-taxed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has explained also that the Bill now before us, a very short Bill it is, in effect renews certain portions of the Moratorium Acts which it was found necessary to introduce both during the two world wars, and at a later period when circumstances necessitated such a step. As a general rule, Sir, a moratorium such as provided by this Bill, or any Moratorium Bill when it comes to that, can only be justified by very abnormal conditions, something by which the economy of the country in one particular phase or the other, is moved well out of its normal conditions. A period when a certain amount of emergency is attached to that particular sphere of the country&#x2019;s economy and therefore one has to take precautions, or to take some action which normally one would not take, if it could be avoided.</p>

<p>The Bill provides in its very brief clauses a temporary remedy for hardships which result from the expansion which at present is being carried out in our defences. There will be a much larger call-up of trainees and with it the financial problems which automatically go with such an expansion will be increasingly felt. The effect in a year or two&#x2019;s time when the number of trainees has greatly increased may well be considerably more serious even than it is to-day. When we consider that aspect, we have to take into account the hon. Minister&#x2019;s ultimate vision of something like 38 or 33 battalions, some of whom it is true will have moved out of the training sphere back to civil life, but at the same time it gives us some idea of the numbers of people likely to be affected. As I said, a moratorium usually visualized some very unusual conditions affecting the people it affects, and is something that is not lightly entered into. Although we on this side of the House under the conditions under which this Bill is introduced are supporting it, we feel that it has to be exercised with considerable caution because it cuts right across the accepted principles of the normal economic life of the country; in other words, the individuals affected by the moratorium are relieved of certain financial obligations which they might have incurred prior to joining, or may have to incur subsequently due to family reasons. Therefore it cuts right across, to a very considerable extent, both the financial and the commercial business methods in the country. Although the Bill itself now protects the individual ballotee who is called up, under many conditions the commitments which they have entered into affect both the commercial houses, or the financial bodies with which those commitments have been incurred. They, in turn, themselves have to meet the cost of a large number of financial transactions with people who now may be protected and for the time being no longer have to meet their financial commitments. The firms concerned, however, most probably will still have to meet their commitments to the financial bodies or the banks, or whatever it may be which finances them. Therefore it is not a measure which is confined simply to the protection of the individual. It has ramifications which go far beyond that.</p>

<p>The difficulty which the Bill is now meeting is not one to cause surprise because it is a difficulty which one expects to meet with the type of call-up that we are having. In fact it was mentioned in the debate on the amending Bill which gave authority for this call-up, when the financial difficulty likely to arise in respect of people who have already incurred commitments, or young people who are being called up for the first time, but who in the normal course of events would have gone into employment and assisted in the upkeep and maintenance of their homes. It was mentioned and at that time the hon. the Minister and the Government were asked to give consideration to meeting that particular disability which they would suffer under, once they were called up.</p>

<p>The Bill itself now to some extent suspends their liabilities. It provides a temporary remedy, but it does not provide the ultimate cure for this type of difficulty. Because when these lads go back into civil life, after the period during which they are protected by the moratorium, they will then have to face up to whatever liabilities they may have incurred and which were suspended for the time being. Therefore it does not provide the full answer to the problem which the Minister has to deal with, and that, it appears on close examination, can only be met if in the cases which have to be examined and found to warrant consideration, some subsidiary allowance is made to the earnings to those individuals while they are in service. It would apply particularly to the trainee ballotees who are being called up from business houses where the business itself is not prepared or unable to make up the difference between their civil pay and the military pay. It does not apply so much to state officials whose cases are being met by the state, and one can only express the hope that firms where possible&#x2014;there are some cases where it is impossible&#x2014;will follow the lead of the Government and endeavour to make up the difference between the individual&#x2019;s normal pay and the reduced amount he will receive when he is called up for training. In suggesting that, one knows that it is very, very difficult to find any hard and fast rule to govern all cases because there are so many variations in it, but<span class="col_4613-4614" refersTo="page_0933"/> we do hope that the country as a whole will realize that it is a responsibility which must be met and that as far as possible they will follow the lead of the Government in that respect.</p>

<p>Section 9 of the Act of 1940 (Act No. 29) sets a date for the suspension, or rather for the ceasing of the protection of the moratorium in respect of the people to be protected. Section 4 of this particular Act protected the volunteers of those days for a period of three months after they were returned to civil life. In the case of the Bill before us, and owing to the completely different set-up of the country as a whole, the three months&#x2019; period will not apply, but instead a period will be fixed as from 15 June 1961 (the original date of the Act for the call-up) and a date to be fixed by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>There is provision for the three months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain that when he replies, because what I want to ask here is: Having to face the position that for some years ahead at any rate, this state of affairs will continue, because it looks as if this period of extended training will be necessary for some time, and, as the number of young people being called up to the services is likely to increase rather than to decrease, the hon. the Minister should take into account in fixing the date for the suspension of the moratorium for each group of trainees as they move out of the training period back into civilian life, that he should take into account not only the fact that there is suspended action in respect of any liability for these three months, but also take appropriate steps to see that as they are discharged back to civil life, some orderly form of aid to assist them back into employment in civil life will be afforded. You see, Sir, many of these trainees that will now be protected by this moratorium have never been in employment. They will come straight from their educational institutions into the forces; they have never had a job. The normal range of job-seekers in the country, due to the school-leaving age, has generally been accepted as being round about the beginning of the year. But under your quarterly call-up system now in force, the position will be different. You will have 2,500 people moving back into employment at the end of each quarter, and it will be necessary in some shape or form to have, what one might describe for the lack of a better term, as a demobilization scheme, to see that these young people go back to good jobs and that where they have not been employed before, some form of assistance will be given to place them in sound employment, and that until such time as they find satisfactory employment, they should continue to be protected by the moratorium if necessary, because such protection will be even more necessary at that stage. So I am asking the hon. the Minister in considering the longterm aspects of this legislation, to give consideration to that. It is something the importance of which will grow as the number of these trainees grows.</p>

<p>I said that paragraph (f) of sub-section (2) of Clause 1 says that the date when the moratorium will cease to apply will be fixed by the State President. It appears to lay down that the State President himself will have a certain amount of latitude in fixing that date; and if that is so, that might afford the appropriate opportunity to provide the protection I have asked for. It would mean very close collaboration between the Department of Labour and other Departments to see that they are assisted back into work.</p>

<p>I want also to state that there will be a much wider need for examination of the problems which will arise from what is in effect a mobilization of the young people of the country. Such examination should also include the reasons which give rise to the necessity for this moratorium. Those reasons are that, as is to be expected when one is called to the armed forces, your level of earnings is not sufficient to maintain you at the standard of living you would be able to maintain if you had not been called up, the standard of civilian homelife. Where your deficiency in pay is met, that disability is overcome, but the hon. the Minister will find that there will be many cases where people are called up from employment they will suffer a very serious drop in their earnings. Although for the time being whilst they are called up, the moratorium will protect them, it does not do away with their liabilities. Those liabilities will automatically come into force again at the end of the term of their call-up, and here I would express the most earnest hope that many of the big firms, and some of them are not blameless, which are benefiting as a result of this mobilization, as a result of this expansion in our defence commitments, by being concerned in very large Government contracts, that they at any rate will give a lead, that as they are benefiting from this defence expansion, they will see that their employees do not suffer as a result of being called up to serve in the Defence Force.</p>

<p><span class="col_4615-4616" refersTo="page_0934"/>Finally in saying that we on this side support the Bill and will vote for it, I want to say also that we feel that whilst it is something that is inherent to-day under the conditions under which we are living, the world conditions as well as our own country&#x2019;s conditions, we feel that it is a form of economic control which should not be perpetuated one day longer than is absolutely essential. It seems that period can be shortened by a more realistic approach to the earnings necessary for the people whilst they serve. We would ask the Minister to consider that, and to remove the control of the moratorium as fast as is possible, without hardship to the trainees or to the firms and the other interests concerned in the matter. That removal should take place as soon as possible after their completion of training.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the official Opposition is prepared to support this legislation. I want to express my gratification that the Minister has brought this legislation before the House. The extension of the period of training of our young citizens to nine months will entail hardships for some of them. Fortunately we can say that in this case they are all young citizens, whereas in war-time one has to deal with people who have already reached an advanced age and who may have many obligations. It is also anticipated that particularly as from next year, when the new provision that our young citizens have to register in their seventeeth year and be called up from their eighteenth year comes into force, this legislation will become even less necessary. Once that provision comes into operation, very few of them will have started working and earning a salary or wage by the time they have to go to military camps. The time will come when protection will have to be given under the provisions of this Bill only to those who have left school at an early age and to those who have obtained a deferment of military training.</p>

<p>We must bear in mind that a fairly large number of the slightly more than 10,000 boys who are called up will suffer hardship, particularly this year. Some of these young men have bought a motor-car, a radiogram or something of that kind at an early age; they have accepted certain obligations and in many cases the compensation that they receive, namely 50 cents a day or, if they have dependants, an additional R1.70 a day for their dependants, will not make up the difference in pay. Public servants, as the hon. member for Simonstown has said, are covered because the Government pays their full salaries, but the ballotees who are taken out of the private sector of our economy will not in all cases receive their salary. Not all employers would be prepared to pay them their full salary. Certain constituents of mine have made representations to me in this connection. I think it is wrong for our young citizens to take heavy obligations upon themselves by buying a motor-car, for example, but because of our high standard of living that sort of thing does happen, and that is why it is necessary to make provision for it to some extent. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Simonstown, that one is grateful for the fact that the provisions that were in force in World War I and also in World War II, will come into operation again. I hope, however, that with the experience we gain we will also be prepared in due course to introduce slightly more favourable conditions for our young men. It must be remembered that we are not living in war-time; it is not as though we do not know for what period provision has to be made. Here provision has to be made for a specific period of nine months&#x2019; training, and since we are calling up these young men, I hope that our experience in implementing the Act will show that we can perhaps create even more favourable conditions for them, although we welcome the concessions which are being made here. It is necessary perhaps to point out that this Bill suspends all civil proceedings in respect of ballotees; no civil action of any nature can be instituted against such a ballotee, except in those cases where provision is made for it by the Acts which are now being applied again. I want to point out that it will still be possible to recover certain debts, as in the case of a partnership, for example. In that case the debt can be recovered if one of the partners remains in the business. This will not happen often perhaps in the case of our young men who are called up, but where one partner remains in the business, a civil action can be instituted to recover debts in respect of such a partnership. There are also other debts in respect of which civil actions may be instituted, and that is where people who are in military camps contract debts, either in respect of rental, in respect of necessaries or in respect of boarding and lodging, etc., after their admission to the military camp. Debts in respect of these essential items, can be recovered. It is clear therefore that the legislation provides that once the young men are in the camp, they cannot simply contract all sorts of obligations. If traders give credit to young men for all sorts of purchases, they must realize that it will not be possible to collect their debt from them in all cases, and the young men must realize that they are not protected in every respect. This legislation, as the hon. member and the Minister have said, is not applicable to young citizens who voluntarily apply to undergo this training of nine months. It may be said that in war-time many people join the army in order to evade their debts, but fortunately in this case that will not be possible because the Act provides that people will not be able to do so.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly also to the hire-purchase provisions in the measures which are now being brought into operation again. In this case particularly I think that in the course of time it may be possible for us to introduce better conditions so as to give even greater assistance to these people. According to the<span class="col_4617-4618" refersTo="page_0935"/> Acts which are now being brought into operation again, hire-purchase contracts are excluded from this legislation. In other words, civil actions may be instituted under hire-purchase contracts either for payment or for the return of the goods. The legislation provides for certain procedures that a debtor may follow to try and protect himself. The legislation now provides that he Department of Commerce and Industries may appoint an official, who was called an assessor in the old provisions of the Act, and the trainee can go to the assessor and ask for protection. He can do one of three things. In the first place he may return the goods that he bought under hire-purchase if the assessor gives his approval, and then he is not called upon to make any further payments; he simply returns the goods that he purchased. I realize that is a very drastic provision. If, for example, a young man has bought a motor-car it is far-reaching to say that he can simply return the motor-car. I hope therefore that it will be possible later on perhaps to make other concessions. But he can also follow a different course, and that is that he may, for example, return a portion of the goods, if the assessor agrees, and the assessor must then determine whether the goods returned by him cover the remaining portion of the debt, whether he has to make further payments or whether the value of the goods returned by him is in excess of the amount that he still owes. In the latter case he can claim that the amount in question be refunded to him by the creditor. That is what the citizen who is called up can do to protect himself, but we feel that there may still be a certain amount of hardship in this connection and that there may be a certain amount of dissatisfaction. But at the moment I can put forward no suggestion to improve the position. I only hope that in the light of practical experience it may still be possible for us to lay down more favourable conditions in respect of hire-purchase contracts. But generally speaking we are grateful for the introduction of this legislation and we are grateful that some method has been found to give a certain amount of protection to these young ballotees who will have to suffer deprivation and that they will not be dragged into the courts unnecessarily. I am pleased therefore that the Opposition supports this legislation.</p>

<p>I should like to put two points to the hon. the Minister in regard to this Bill. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) quite rightly pointed out that as a result of the amendments in the Defence Act last year, the ballotees that are now being called up will be called up in their first year of registration, and that therefore the average age of the ballotee who will be serving this nine months&#x2019; period, will be that of a young fellow who has just left school.</p>

<p>There are others too.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am talking about the bulk of the 10,000 ballotees that will be put under training in the course of the year; the bulk of them will be young fellows of an average of 17 to 19 years, who largely have not entered any business commitments. I think the hon. the Minister recognizes that one of the effects of this Moratorium Bill will be that business and commerce as a whole will think twice before extending any credit facilities to any citizen whose name had been drawn in the ballot, even if there is a delay of six to nine months before he is actually called up for his period of service. That being so, the point I want to make to the hon. the Minister is this: As I read paragraph (d) of this clause, the Minister has gone out of his way to exclude a further period of training for which a ballotee will be liable, or even periods of training. Now in terms of Section 20 of the original Act, any ballotee is called up for a period of four years, and apart from the nine months&#x2019; period of service that he has to immediately undergo, continuous training, he still remains liable in terms of the Act for two further periods of three weeks&#x2019; cintinuous training in subsequent years, may be immediately the next year, or there may be a lapse of period. But he is liable for two further periods of training. The point I want to make is that if the Minister accepts that, where this moratorium will apply, a large number of ballotees will not be affected at all because they have not had an opportunity of entering into any business commitments where it is necessary to apply a moratorium, he will also admit that after having entered civil life again a ballotee may be called upon two years later, after having accepted commitments, to go and fulfil these periods of continuous training. The hon. the Minister has an option in this regard. The hon. the Minister or an official can lay down a shorter period, but the Minister may see fit in the national interest to call upon that trainee, who is no longer a ballotee but a trainee to come and fulfil these extra periods of continuous training. At that time he may need the moratorium. He may be in his third year or fourth year as an apprenticed mechanic, for example: he has accepted certain responsibilities; the moment he is called up to complete his further period of continuous training, he is immediately placed in the position as a weekly or an hourly paid man, that his income is reduced, and that he cannot meet the commitments he has entered into. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will give particular consideration to this point, particularly in view of the fact that the moratorium is not going to apply to the broad mass of 10,000 men. They will not need it; there will be a percentage who will need it. The Minister must however consider the time when these men will need this moratorium, the time when they have entered civil life and accepted responsibility and are called upon by the Minister to do these further periods of training when their whole level of<span class="col_4619-4620" refersTo="page_0936"/> income will be upset. I hope the hon. the Minister will give some consideration to that aspect when we come to the Committee Stage and accept a small amendment which will adjust that position.</p>

<p>I also wish to support the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) in regard to what he had to say about volunteers. As the Minister knows the Act makes full provision for the acceptance by him of volunteers for these periods of full-time training. If a man has not been drawn in a ballot and it is his wish to do military training he can volunteer. There are many families in this country with a military tradition who would like to see their sons follow in their footsteps. In terms of this Bill those men are being prejudiced. Surely their position in the Active Citizen Force is no different from that of a man whose name has been drawn in a ballot. I am sure the Minister does not wish to create the position where the volunteer will say: Well, this is going to be to my disadvantage. The man whose name has been drawn in the ballot will enjoy these privileges whereas I, as a volunteer, will not enjoy them. The effect will be that there will be a decline in the number of volunteers. The Minister will agree with me that the volunteer will probably make a better soldier than the ballotee. He is keen, he wants to do the job but he says to himself: &#x201C;I am now going to be prejudiced: why should I be required to meet both ends of the financial stick because I am a volunteer and am keen to follow a military career in the service of my country?&#x201D; I would ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to that aspect. The Minister will recall that he even has the power to fix the number of volunteers that may be taken into the A.C.F. On occasions the number has risen to as high as 1,500 to 2,000. It can become as high as 20 per cent of the men coming forward for training. I therefore ask the Minister when we come to the Committee Stage to consider some means of giving the same measure of protection to the volunteer as the ballotee will get in terms of this measure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) mentioned the fact that the Bill did not afford protection for the three months. Well, it does. According to sub-section (v) of Section 5 of the Public Welfare Act of 1919 it gives the three months&#x2019; protection after the nine months&#x2019; training. Clause 1 (2) (f) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">to the war or the present war shall be construed as a reference to the period from and including 15 June 1961&#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the date when the last Bill came into force&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to a date to be fixed by the State President by Proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></block>

<p>That means that when we find that we no longer need that additional protection the Act can be repealed by the State President. The hon. member also pleaded for the volunteers, so did the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant). But. Sir, we must remember that this is not a time of war. That is the big difference. During a time of war you must give protection to volunteers. But this is peace time. We cannot allow people to come into the Army just for the sake of escaping from their creditors. We must protect the businessman as such. The hon. member for Turffontein said this number of volunteers may be quite a big number. We must protect the businessmen; this is peace time. We force the ballotees to come into camp and because we force them to do so by law, we are prepared to protect them but not volunteers. This is not a time of war; this is peace time.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is the difference: The ballotee comes in because we force him to come in and the other one comes in voluntarily. That makes all the difference in time of peace. For that reason I will not be able to accept any amendment in that respect. We must protect the businessmen, too.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) has said that he hopes that in the future it will be possible to make better provision in connection with hire purchase. I must say that on the three previous occasions when this legislation was applied in practice, no plan could be devised to make better provision for hire purchase, nor can we suggest a better plan to-day. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) has said himself that he too has no better plan to put forward. If he or we can think of a better plan to make provision for it, we shall certainly consider whether it can be introduced in the future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) has raised the question of a moratorium in respect of volunteers, a matter which I have dealt with already.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to ballotees who will be brought back for two periods of three weeks&#x2019; training during the subsequent three years. He wanted to know what protection we would give them during those periods. I agree that it will be most difficult to protect them for such short periods. If any hon. member can suggest something practical I will consider it.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on Friday last, just before the adjournment of the debate and in the last stages of my speech, I had dealt briefly with two matters. The one was the qualifications, if any, of the inspectors to be sent out in terms of Clause 4 of this Bill in order to investigate and report on any matter in respect of which particulars were required for the register. Without repeating what I have said before, I want to say that in order to be able to provide the authorities with an accurate, reasoned and objective report, the inspector will have to be something of a judge. He will have a very heavy onus to discharge. He will have to possess a great deal of experience and wisdom. In my view, the person best able to undertake a task like that, in normal circumstances, will be a Judge. I can hardly visualize the appointment of an itinerant Judge. We know about circuit Judges, Sir, but it is very unlikely that there will be itinerant Judges knocking on all doors to which they have been sent, in order to inquire and investigate, and then to submit a reasoned and objective report. That opens the door to the abuses with which I dealt under the second point which I raised, and that was the question of corruption. If people were appointed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, people who have previously been unemployed, people with no experience in these matters and people who regarded this merely as a channel of employment, then clearly the opportunity for bribery and corruption would present itself on quite a wide scale. Let me give an example, Sir. We remember the years when price control inspectors were very active in this country. You need only think of the number of cases which came before the courts to realize how easy it was then for a so-called inspector, who was supposed to go back with the facts and nothing else, to try to abuse his position by placing a person who had something to conceal&#x2014;and in many cases a person who had nothing to conceal, but who only did not know what his rights were&#x2014;in a position where he found it to be the easiest way out for him, to pay-off. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will consider these matters before he presses on, regardless of the consequences, with the enactment of this Bill. There is a further possibility, Sir, of a neighbour, for reasons of his own, deciding to place certain information before the authorities with regard to the antecedents of the person whom he wishes to have removed from the environment, or whose land he wishes to acquire, or whose house he covets. All those possibilities exist. I merely wish to leave this thought with the hon. the Minister as far as this clause is concerned&#x2014;that I believe it opens up a very wide and very unpleasant field for misdeeds, misdeeds which will certainly not do anything to cure the evil which the Minister sees in the present position, in regard to the existence of loopholes. On the contrary, I think it will do much greater harm than good.</p>

<p>I was very much struck by the observations of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). In dealing with this question of appearance, he was heard to say that Spaniards or Italians, though swarthy in complexion, would not be classified as Coloured in South Africa. I want to ask him whether he is sure that they would not be classified as Coloureds? We heard the Minister telling us that every man in South Africa was virtually his own mobile race classification board. He said that when you walked down the street, or when you sat in a train or when you were at any public place or driving in a motor-car, you involuntarily classified the people whom you saw. I can only think of that as the activity of a mobile one-man classification board. I cannot understand how the hon. member for Heilbron can say that a Spaniard or an Italian with a dark complexion will be allowed to pass unnoticed by those people who are apparently making it their business to look very closely at others, and to determine their racial origin. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that he may perhaps not have had the privilege of seeing, say, Sophia Loren in the flesh&#x2014;I should not say &#x201C;in the flesh&#x201D;, I should say, not on the screen&#x2014;but if he were to see this lady, who is very famous throughout the world as a film actress, in terms of his own contention that he automatically puts people into their racial pigeon-holes, he would say she was a Coloured; because I have seen many hundreds of Coloured women in this city who are much lighter in complexion than Sophia Loren. Mr. Speaker, it is irrelevant to pursue this argument any further. I do not proposed to do so. I just wish to say that you cannot convince any thinking person that it is possible to classify everybody who lives in South Africa or who is likely to live in South Africa in the future or anybody who visits South Africa, by appearance. It is impossible. You only have to move about, particularly in the southern part of Europe, to realize how impossible it is. And if you go to the Western capitals of Europe to-day or to London for that matter, you will realize even more how impossible it is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron also said that the United Party was responsible for the unfavourable world opinion of South Africa. He said that what we were trying to do&#x2014;presumably for the Coloured people&#x2014;had never been published in any newspaper. It may be that the newspapers have neglected their duty. We hear those charges every day. But the Department of Information and the Department of Coloured Affairs have certainly not been neglecting their duty, Sir, as is evidenced<span class="col_4623-4624" refersTo="page_0938"/> by this publication &#x201C;The Coloured People of South Africa&#x201D;, which I have here. In this publication, a great deal of information is made available about the subject of this debate. I maintain, Sir, that as long as we talk about the rights and the wrongs of the definition, it is important that we understand the nature of the people we are discussing and whom this legislation is designed to affect. These two Departments have combined to produce this very glossy publication, in colour; in fact, so much colour is involved in it that instead of having been titled &#x201C;The Coloured People of South Africa&#x201D; it should have been titled &#x201C;The Technicoloured People of South Africa&#x201D;. This has cost a small fortune to produce. By coincidence, it only became available last week when this debate was started. I must say that anyone who reads this will be struck by one or two statements contained in this particular brochure. It is obviously intended for overseas consumption, where our position has been misunderstood. I would suggest that it would have been as well for the hon. the Minister to have read this before he introduced this Bill. For example, Sir, the Secretary for Coloured Affairs, Dr. du Plessis, in one of the two forewords on the front page, says in regard to the development of the Coloured people&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; people who already have a proud record in those spheres in which they have found scope.</block>

<p>We are telling the outside world that when we give the Coloured people the &#x201C;scope&#x201D;, they are capable and have in fact been proved capable of great achievements. I leave that without further comment. Under the heading &#x201C;Cultural Development&#x201D; we have this statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The culture of the Coloured people is largely Western.</block>

<p>I am not saying that. Sir. My opinions are irrelevant here. This is the official brochure of the two Departments in combination: &#x201C;The culture of the Coloured people is largely Western.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; they have adopted many of the customs of the Whites in the Union.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This is about the Malays, who are apparently also Western, though less Western than the Coloureds.</p>

<p>What is your argument?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I think the argument is perfectly clear, Sir, if the hon. member is prepared to see it, and it is that we are trying to legislate about people who, on our own admission, belong to the Western group in this country. We are continually told that we will stand by the Western nations; during the debate on the Defence Vote we were told that the West would immediately rush to our aid. Surely the West sees us all as one people&#x2014;White and Coloured; we are telling the world that the Coloureds are Western. I am sorry, Sir, that I had to enlarge on this argument for the benefit of that hon. member opposite. I thought that the proverbial nod to a blind horse would also apply in his case.</p>

<p>There is also a brief reference in this brochure to the Eoan Group which I think is also relevent&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Coloured opera ballet group symbolizes the high cultural attainment of the Coloured people of South Africa.</block>

<p>Overleaf is a picture of Mr. Paul Sauer, the Minister of Public Works, being presented to some of the performers of a certain opera, back-stage. We in South Africa are supposed to know who the Coloured people are. We are spending a great deal of money and time on trying to convince the outside world that they belong to the Western group, like we do. I am amazed at that, Sir, because we take such a very different line when it comes to internal consumption. With respect of the two Departments and Ministries concerned, this is clearly for overseas consumption. Let us come back to the local position; let us assume that these statements have never been made, and are not intended to convince the outside world, those countries where friends do exist and where more friends would exist if we took the trouble to tell them the truth. On more than one occasion we have been taken on a conducted tour of the world of David Song&#x2014;some people will prefer &#x201C;The World of Susie Wong&#x201D;; and I do not blame them. But time and time again we heard about the difficulties which arose from the actions of David Song. Why is it that one mischance, as it were, under a set of rules, can spark off this Bill, the debate which has followed and the controversy which is inevitably bound up with this sort of legislation? It was just one person who happened to get by, as it were, and into the White group of people. The fact is that despite all the talk that we had last week about &#x201C;herkoms&#x201D; and &#x201C;afkoms&#x201D;&#x2014;I got the impression from the hon. the Minister that in his view the two meant one and the same thing&#x2014;we were told later in the debate that &#x201C;herkoms&#x201D; and &#x201C;afkoms&#x201D; meant two different things. We were told not to confuse ancestry with origin. That was what we were told, and if the Minister thinks I am wrong he will see, if he reads the Hansard reports of all those who have spoken, that I am speaking the truth. When we come to the question of the origin of the Coloured people&#x2014;not of one individual who succeeded in getting into the White group&#x2014;then I think we see the position in its proper perspective. I remember clearly that the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) said that the two members who had spoken before him knew nothing at all about the history of South Africa. He then referred to the fact that Simon van der Stel had passed an ordinance prohibiting the association between White soldiers and Native<span class="col_4625-4626" refersTo="page_0939"/> women. He spoke in Afrikaans, but I think this is more or less a literal translation of what he said&#x2014;I took it down. Having said that, he took a long leap in history. He skipped the entire period after the passing of that ordinance by van der Stel, and started to deal with the present-day position. He ignored that period and said there was a report in 1937 which took the view that all racial groups were against mixed marriages. This gap, in my humble opinion, has to be bridged. We, quite reasonably, expected the Government side to do so, but no one has referred to the history of the people about whom we are talking. During the time which is left to me, I want to refer to what I believe is considered by all persons interested in the Cape Coloured people, whatever their political outlook may be, as the authority on the subject. This book is called &#x201C;The Cape Coloured People, 1652 to 1937&#x201D; by Prof. J. S. Marais, then Professor of History at the University of Cape Town. I think the reading of this book would be rewarding to anyone who was really interested to see where the rights and the wrongs in this matter lay. I can do no more than summarize it, obviously. This book was written in 1938 and it starts with a preface in which the author says that the book is&#x201D; essentially a study of race relations&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of the relations between the Europeans and that group of non-Europeans with whom the former have been longest and most closely&#x2014;I may say intimately in contact&#x2014;and who have in consequence become completely assimilated to European civilization.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This was written 25 years ago. And I may say that it is extraordinary that this man had the gift of prophecy which he displayed in this particular book. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As an Afrikaner nurtured in the traditions of a Western Cape farm, the colonist mentality has formed, and still forms a main obstacle in the way of the Coloured man&#x2019;s achieving a satisfactory position in South Africa.</block>

<p>He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This history of the Coloured people is the history of the contact of aboriginal Africans (and a few Orientals) with Europeans.</block>

<p>He says that his aim has been to establish facts and to draw valid conclusions from them. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Justice, which has been rightly represented as blindfold, does not allow the use of two measures, one for ourselves and our own people, and another for those who differ from us in nationality or race or the colour of their skins.</block>

<p>There is a great deal of material in this book about &#x201C;origin&#x201D; which I think should at least have been referred to by the hon. the Minister, or some of the hon. members who support him. It is perfectly clear, Sir, that the origin of the Cape Coloured is to be found in the Bushmen, Hottentots, slaves and Europeans. Marais says it is there you will find the ancestry of the Coloured people. I am well aware of the fact that recently publicity was given to the appearance of a text-book in the Transvaal, for school-children, a text-book in which it was averred that the Coloured people were not the product of miscegenation between White and non-White. That was for the children. I would say that is &#x201C;for the birds&#x201D;. But this book was placed in the schools without any regard to the history of the matter. One then asks oneself, where do these Cape Coloured people come from? If one does not know, one need only turn up the records, Sir. The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) seems a little incredulous. One of the aspects which is very interesting about this matter, Mr. Speaker, is that miscegenation&#x2026;</p>

<p>With respect, Sir, the Bill deals, as the Minister has indicated, with the origin of these people and it refers to the descent of people. With respect, Sir, I believe that I am entitled to refer to that, from the historical point of view. That is all I am trying to do. I am dealing with Clause 1 (b) which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">is generally accepted as a White person and is not in appearance obviously not a White person.</block>

<p>I submit that in order to be able to deal with this matter at all, you must be prepared to consider who these Coloured people are. If you rule that out of order, I will not pursue the argument&#x2014;but I appeal to you to give your ruling on the basis that I am trying to deal with the people who are affected by this Bill, who are citizens of this country and who are thus affected.</p>

<p>The position according to this historical and very accurate protrayal of this so-called problem which is in our midst to-day is aptly summed up by Prof. Marais in his conclusion. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the history of the Cape Coloured people three periods may be clearly distinguished: during the first, which came to an end in the decade 1828-38, they were subjected to compulsory labour and many of them acquired such skill and such habits of regular work as enabled them to survive in a civilized society; during the second, which lasted until the 1920s they were allowed to find their level under conditions of <i>laissez faire;</i> during the third, which we are in to-day, the State began the process of excluding them from occupations which they would have had under a system of free competition. Having spent a great deal of effort<span class="col_4627-4628" refersTo="page_0940"/> on the task of forcing or persuading the Coloured man to become civilized, we Europeans are now attempting to deny the logical conclusions which he draws from our actions in the past.</block>

<p>The logical conclusion which the Coloured man draws from our actions in the past is, that having created him in the sense that we are at least partly responsible for the existence of this 1,500,000 Coloured people, having ostensibly endeavoured to educate and instruct them in the ways of Western civilization, having held out to the whole world that this was our main objective in regard to the Coloured people, that it is a complete negation of that attitude to come forward with a Bill like this, which can only create, not the advancement of the Coloured people or their enlightenment or their betterment, but the embitterment of the Coloured people. In their opinion, the White man has failed to be reasonable and just. To say that a White person means a person who in appearance is obviously a White person and who is not generally accepted as a Coloured person, means in effect that the rights of anyone who has up to a certain stage been generally accepted as a White person, cannot be tampered with; he cannot be told, after the event, that another investigation must be commenced to see whether in fact during the period that he was accepted as a White person, he was entitled to be so accepted. How can you reconcile it with your conscience, Sir, to say that we are now adopting a new standpoint, purely as a matter of domestic policy? Furthermore, I believe that those hon. members who represent constituencies in the Cape, and particularly in the Western Province, are failing in their duty if they support this Bill, because we have been told for many years&#x2014;I grew up with this idea&#x2014;that the &#x201C;Cape liberal tradition&#x201D; was something which would always ensure the rightful place of the Coloured people. Therefore for me, now regarded as a Transvaler&#x2014;we are the people who come from the north, the hard-hearted people who have no liberality&#x2014;to come here and to find that this sort of legislation is devised and is supported by the very people who should be supporting the so-called Cape liberal tradition, is one of the more amazing things in my short parliamentary career. Something has happened along the line, Mr. Speaker, which requires a great deal of explanation. [Interjections.] I can only appeal to the Minister to think again, before this Bill is forced through the House. It is clear from any considered opinion of the legislation and of the history of the matter or the history of the people affected, that this legislation is unnecessary and objectionable, and can only do the good name of South Africa further harm. After all the effort we are now making to convince those who up to now have had doubts about our Western way of life, we are doing untold damage by introducing legislation like this, because we are deliberately opening the wound again, as far as the people of this country are concerned, but as far as the people overseas are concerned, the Minister has surely travelled, and knows how quickly opinions are formed as the result of one particular incident. In this brochure you show them a beautiful picture of the Coloured people of South Africa, and then the Minister comes along and removes the picture&#x2014;and the whole world can see the large, dirty blot on the wall. I appeal to the Minister, because I believe him to be, basically, a reasonable man, to think again before he presses on with this legislation, because if he withdraws it, I am convinced he will be rendering a greater service to South Africa than by pursuing this unnecessary and ill-conceived Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>I have seldom if ever listened to arguments from the Opposition which are based on as many misconceptions and false premises as the arguments which have been advanced in this debate, and I can give no better example of that than the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down. The hon. member is apparently under the impression that where reference is made here to Coloureds, it is purely a reference to the Cape Coloureds, but that is not the position. This reference to Coloureds is a reference to Coloureds as defined in the 1950 Act, that is to say, a person who is neither a Native nor a White person. That is what a &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; means. It may be an Asiatic or a Cape Coloured; it may an Indian or a Japanese or a Chinese. [Interjections.] I have become sick and tired of this parrot-cry of &#x201C;Japanese&#x201D;. According to the existing Act a Japanese is a Coloured. In terms of the proposed legislation a Japanese is also a Coloured, but he is exempt from the provisions of the Group Areas Act. But for the purposes of the Population Registration Act a Japanese remains a Coloured. For the purposes of the Immorality Act he remains a Coloured, and for the purposes of the Mixed Marriages Act he remains a Coloured.</p>

<p>That is news.</p>

<speech by="#pelser">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members opposite do not know what they are talking about. They argue on false premises, and then they come along with heartrending stories about suffering and injustices. I do not want to follow hon. members along those lines. At the moment this House is dealing with a legal matter, and I should like to approach it purely from the legal aspect. In order to be able to do so, it is necessary first of all to determine what the position is that we are seeking to cope with.</p>

<p>The position is very simple. In 1950, after a lengthy discussion, this House decided upon a system of race classification and population registration. After that discussion, the Bill went also through the Other Place and it became the law of the land. Three definitions were laid down for the purposes of that Act. The first is the definition that was laid down for a Native, and it reads that &#x201C;&#x2018;Native&#x2019; means<span class="col_4629-4630" refersTo="page_0941"/> a person who is a member of any aboriginal race or tribe of Africa, or who is generally accepted as such The second definition is that of a White person, namely&#x201D; a person who in appearance obviously is, or who is generally accepted as a White person&#x201D;, but does not include a person who, although in appearance obviously a White person, is generally accepted as a Coloured person. Then there is the third definition, the definition of a &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;, &#x201C;a person who is not a White person or a Native&#x201D;. It is very simple. There is no reference here to Cape Coloureds. A Coloured person is a person who is neither a Native nor a White person, and if hon. members will only realize that, we will have less false reasoning from them.</p>

<p>This system of population classification and registration has been applied under the Act over the past 12 years: it has progressed very far already, and during those 12 years it has never been necessary to change one of these three definitions. The definitions were very carefully framed in the 1950 Act and, as I say, it has never been necessary to alter them, but what happened recently was that in spite of this Act and in spite of the definition of a White person, a Chinese, who himself admits that he is a full-blooded Chinese, who says that he was born in Canton and admits that he looks like a Chinese, succeeded&#x2014;and lawfully succeeded&#x2014;in getting himself declared a White person, purely on the strength of the fact that he had proved that he was generally accepted as a White person. And what is the Minister of the Interior doing now? He is doing what every responsible Government ought to do, and that is to put the matter right immediately where a farce is made of legislation of this House. That is the position that we have to-day. How does he propose to put it right? He is not interfering with the definition of a &#x201C;Native&#x201D; or of a &#x201C;Coloured person&#x201D;, because that is not necessary. But a loophole was discovered in the definition of a &#x201C;White person&#x201D; and that is why he proposes to substitute for the old definition of &#x201C;White person&#x201D; the following definition: &#x201C;&#x2018;White person&#x2019; means a person who in appearance obviously is a White person and who is not generally accepted as a Coloured person or is generally accepted as a White person and is not in appearance obviously not a White person, but does not include any person who admits that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person&#x201D;. And the Minister says that in the Committee Stage he will move the addition of the words&#x201D;unless it is proved that his admission is not based on facts&#x201D;. The Opposition is strenuously opposed to this new definition, so strenuously that the Leader of the Opposition did not even make an attempt to propose an improvement to the definition so as to meet the position in that way. No, he proposes that the Bill be rejected from A to Z and that is why he moves that it be read this day six months. In other words, his attitude and that of his party is that even though a person is a full-blooded Chinaman and admits it, or is a full-blooded Japanese and admits it, or is a full-blooded Indian and admits it, as long as he can prove to the Board or satisfy the court that he is accepted as a White person, he and his party have no objection at all to that person being declared a White person and being absorbed into the White community and associating socially with White persons and inter-marrying with Whites. That is his attitude. I do not want to make political capital out of this debate, but I want to say to the Opposition that this is something that we will rub in on political platforms. [Interjections.] Yes, hon. members opposite will again come forward with the cry, &#x201C;What do you propose to do about the Japanese?&#x201D; Absolutely nothing as far as the Japanese are concerned. The Japanese are in precisely the same position as the Chinese, Song, as far as this Act is concerned. The only difference is that for good reasons the Japanese are exempt from the provisions of certain legislation. [Interjections.] Those good reasons are that is in the best interests of the country. There is a very small number of Japanese here. They visit this country for the purposes of trade (which is to our advantage) and these people are exempt from the Group Areas Act because we do not want to cause them unnecessary trouble and because we want to make things easy for them. But that does not mean that they are exempt from the provisions of this Act. If hon. members do not even realize that, then they have no right to discuss this legislation.</p>

<p>What are the objections of the Opposition? They have a whole series of objections. The first, of course, is the basic objection to race classification and to a system of population registration. That appeared very clearly from the sneering reference of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to a &#x201C;human studbook&#x201D;. That shows the basic objection that the Leader of the Opposition has to race classification. But let me say this to him. When he used the term &#x201C;human studbook&#x201D; my mind went back to 1953 when he and other speakers of the United Party went from platform to platform throughout the country and tried to ridicule this &#x201C;human studbook&#x201D;. But there sits the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty); he will still remember the defeat that his party suffered in that eleciton. But there is a second thing that I want to say to him. At that time when he went from platform to platform he was just an ordinary member of the United Party. To-day he is the Leader of the official Opposition and I want to say to him in all honesty that the words &#x201C;human studbook&#x201D; do not behove the Leader of the official Opposition. I do not think it behoves him to use that expression.</p>

<p>The second objection that they have is the one which the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) also tried to raise but never did raise, and that is the objection that the test of acceptance is being subordinated to the test of appearance. Let us see what the difference is. Portion (a) of the present definition is precisely the same as the old definition, that is to say, &#x201C;a person who in appearance is obviously<span class="col_4631-4632" refersTo="page_0942"/> a White person and is not generally accepted as a Coloured person Then the 1950 defininition goes on to say, &#x201C;or a person who is generally accepted as a White person,&#x201D; without any qualification. In the new definition there is a qualification, namely &#x201C;a person who is generally accepted as a White person and is not in appearance obviously not a White person It is now argued that because there is this qualification, appearance is the main test and that the test of acceptance becomes a subordinate one. But let us analyse that paragraph for a moment&#x2014;&#x201D;a person who is generally accepted as a White person The definition does not go on to say&#x201D; and who is possibly not a White person It does not say a person who is accepted as a White person &#x201C;and is apparently not a White person&#x201D;, nor does it say a person who is accepted as a White person &#x201C;and who is apparently not a White person&#x201D;. It is stated in the most specific terms, &#x201C;a person who is generally accepted as a White person and is not in appearance obviously not a White person&#x201D;. My contention is this: If a person is obviously not a White person, how on earth can he be accepted as a White person? He would simply not be accepted. In a genuine case that could not happen. It may very well happen that a person is accepted by a small group as a White person, but if he is removed from his immediate environment, or if he is taken away from his liberal friends and thrown into the ordinary community, then I say that such a person who is obviously not a White person will not be accepted as a White person. As far as that is concerned, therefore, acceptance remains the test, but it must be remembered that acceptance is based on appearance, and if his appearance is such that the man is obviously not a White person, he will simply not be accepted by the public as a whole.</p>

<p>What is the next objection? It is this: Who is to decide that a person is obviously not a White person? Sir, who decides that at the moment? In the first place, the official, secondly the Secretary, and if the man is not satisfied, then in the third place the Board has to decide, and if he is still not satisfied with the Board&#x2019;s decision, the Supreme Court has to decide, and if he is still not satisfied the Appeal Court has to decide, and what difficulty is there in deciding that a person is obviously not a White person? The courts have to decide much more difficult cases than that. And let me say this here. In view of the fact that his is a difficult matter, the courts will always be inclined in these cases to give the benefit of the doubt to the man. Furthermore, it must be remembered that all that the man has to allege is that he is generally accepted as a White person, and then it is for the Secretary to prove the opposite. The onus of proof does not rest on the individual but on the Secretary; it is a very difficult onus to discharge, and that is why the individual concerned will be given the benefit of the doubt in all genuine cases. But if it is an obvious case of a Chinese who admits that he comes from Canton and that he has no White blood in his veins, he will not be classified as a White person in the future, and that is the intention here.</p>

<p>The next objection is to the word &#x201C;admission&#x201D;. The Leader of the Opposition wanted to know how the person concerned is to make the admission. The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) says that if a person casually remarks in the street that he has non-White blood in his veins, that will be regarded as an admission. The admission is naturally made in the usual way. You fill in a form and where you are dissatisfied with your classification, you sign an affidavit in which you say that you are accepted as a White person, but that you have been classified as a Coloured, and you then submit that you are a White person, because you have been accepted in the White community. That is the admission that will be made and it will be made voluntarily. And if a person appeals, he may perhaps make an admission under cross-examination, but surely if a person voluntarily admits, in reply to a question, that he is a Coloured person by descent within the definition of the Act, there is nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>Then he is finished!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pelser">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>What about it? If by descent he is a Coloured person within the definition, how in heaven&#x2019;s name can he be a White person then? But when a person admits that he is a Coloured person&#x2014;if he is an Indian or a Chinese, to take a specific case&#x2014;and I leave out the Cape Coloured&#x2014;I cannot see how he can be declared a White person. It cannot happen and it ought not to happen.</p>

<p>At this stage I just want to make the point again that hon. members must distinguish very clearly between the loose use of the word &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; and its legal use in terms of the definition. They mean two totally different things. [Interjections.] There are groups of Coloured persons but that is not a matter that is under discussion in this Bill.</p>

<p>The next objection, the next fear, is that there will be a witch-hunt if the Secretary is given the right to make investigations himself or to appoint somebody to do so. When we deal with legislation and the position is that a person can make an allegation on the strength of which he can be classified as belonging to a certain race, I think it is an elementary proposition that the official who has to see that the classification is right should be able to institute investigations to see whether all the facts deposed to are correct. What is the position under the existing Act? The position is that at most the Secretary can say to a person who makes certain allegations, &#x201C;Produce evidence in support of your allegations&#x201D;. The person concerned then produces the evidence that he wishes to produce, as Song did, but the Secretary&#x2019;s hands are tied. He is unable to adduce evidence to the contrary. Surely that is a ridiculous and stupid position. The Secretary, <span class="col_4633-4634" refersTo="page_0943"/> as the competent officer, should be in a position to obtain al the facts and be able to say to the Board in the event of an appeal, &#x201C;This man alleges so and so, but I must also bring these facts to your notice&#x201D;. And I contend that in this case of Song the Board would not have given this decision if the Secretary had been in a position to obtain those facts, to approach other people who also knew Song and obtain statements from them as to whether Song was generally accepted as a White person. I think the proper course, which is in the best interests of race classification, is that all the facts should be submitted to the Board and to the Appeal Board and to the court. And then the hon. members for Hillbrow and Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) come along and say, &#x201C;Not because of a single Chinese!&#x201D; Sir, there is only one Progressive Party member in this House, but look at the strenuous fight hon. members opposite are putting up to prevent more Progressives from entering this House! That is no argument. It is stupid to argue that if a single one slips through, one should close one&#x2019;s eyes and do nothing about it. Who says that it will remain at one? Who says that the other Chinese of Port Elizabeth will be satisfied?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>He may be accepted in a small little circle but not generally. And the next thing that will happen is that the hon. member for Houghton and her assistants will come along with more Chinese and Albert Luthuli and they will tell us that these people are accepted as White persons. That is why it is absolutely essential, when a loophole is discovered in a measure such as this, to close it at the very first opportunity, and that is what is being done very effectively here.</p>

<p>We have listened here to all the stories about human suffering and how an injustice will be done to people who are close to the colour borderline. Mr. Speaker, I say that when one looks at this definition and studies it it is perfectly clear that this definition is designed to ensure that all genuine cases are dealt with in a humane way but at the same time to ensure effectively that all cases which are not genuine are prevented from slipping through. Reference has been made to the suffering that has already been caused but do hon. members not realize that there are nearly 10,000,000 people who have already been classified; that of those 10,000,000 only 3,953 lodged objections, and that all the objections were satisfactorily disposed of? There were only 277 appeals, and practically all of them were decided in favour of the appellants. Only 44 appeals were thrown out. Where is this human suffering? There is no such thing. This measure, far from causing human suffering, has removed human suffering in many cases. Before the passing of the 1950 Act it was a common thing to find whispering campaigns amongst women and even amongst men in connection with certain families and about people who were under suspicion and who practically had to hide because of certain things that may have happened. When the Population Registration Act was passed and those people were properly classified, a stop was immediately put to that sort of thing because they were accepted as Whites and they could always produce their identity card. People no longer dared to say those things therefore. I contend that race classification under the Population Registration Act has removed much more suffering than it has caused, and for that reason I support this measure.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying this to the hon. the Minister: I want to congratulate him and his Department and the legal draftsmen most heartily on this definition. I have studied this definition very carefully and I repeat that it is watertight. I repeat that under this definition no genuine case will suffer, but I also repeat that the cases which are not genuine, the fabricated cases, will no longer slip through in the future under this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to make a small wager with the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) on the penultimate sentence of his speech this afternoon in which he said that this definition was a watertight one. I should like to hear him repeat that in about a year&#x2019;s time.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one mystery that is growing every time hon. members on the other side speak and that is the mystery of the inscrutable Oriental and his position under this particular Act. The hon. member for Klerksdorp has now confirmed that Japanese will be regarded as Coloured, except that they will be excluded from certain provisions of the Group Areas Act. Am I right in assuming that a Japanese businessman, coming to do business here in South Africa, can go to the office of his South African colleague, probably a person who is a director of a steel company; that they can consult on business matters; that in that particular area they can even have lunch together, but that should they decide to go out to the factory in Vereeniging by taxi, not having ordinary transport, then the South African businessman must travel in a European taxi while the Japanese businessman will have to travel in a non-European taxi since he still falls under the provisions of the Separate Amenities Act? Would that be the position? I wonder what the hon. member for Klerksdorp will do, for instance, if he were faced with the problem of receiving in Klerksdorp itself, in a hotel, members of the Chinese community, or even if he had to be with them in a bioscope in<span class="col_4635-4636" refersTo="page_0944"/> Klerksdorp? Somebody tells me that has happened; how did that happen? How watertight was the law in that respect?</p>

<p>I believe that this is a vicious Bill. It is another Bill of blood and of race, of which we have had so many in recent years. It is creating new hardships, new misery and new fears. Indeed, if I may paraphrase a famous saying, what the hon. the Minister is offering us here is nothing but blood, threats and fears. This Bill is bad in law, it is bad in practice and it is bad in logic. It is aimed against individuals instead of being a Bill for the benefit of individuals. Let us look at the three provisions contained in the Bill itself. The hon. the Minister told us in his introductory speech that certain changes were being made in regard to the principles of admission, of acceptance and appearance; that certain changes were being made in regard to those three basic principles in so far as they apply to the classification of Whites and non-Whites. Let us take each of these in turn and see how they do apply and whether they are more fair than they were in the past.</p>

<p>First of all, in regard to admission, the hon. the Minister said, &#x201C;Someone who admits that he is non-White by descent will not be classified as White.&#x201D; That is a change in the principle, the rule, the criterion of admission. I again ask the hon. the Minister, as he has been asked before, at what stage does a person admit that he is non-White? It is very easy if one is Coloured and accepted as Coloured in one&#x2019;s community, if one lives in a Coloured area or if one is Coloured in appearance. But there are the borderline and difficult cases where it is possible for a person to make a mistake in admitting that he is White or non-White. One finds the instance where a person might be presented with his birth certificate, and on that birth certificate it may be stated that his father was Coloured. Does that person admit that he is a Coloured? Possibly the hon. the Minister will say that in this instance he will have to admit that he is one, once he accepts that birth certificate as his. But suppose he is presented with a birth certificate or a baptismal certificate, before the time when birth certificates were introduced, saying that one of his grandparents or great-grandparents was a Coloured person? Does he in that case admit that he is Coloured or does he not admit that he is Coloured? Again the Minister will have difficulty in laying down a real criterion in this matter of admission itself. After all, we have to admit the fact that Coloured blood is widespread amongst the European population of South Africa. It has been estimated by writers like Fielding, Sheila Patterson and others that between 30 and 60 per cent of Europeans in this country have some degree of non-White blood in them. In fact a person might, in admitting that he is not a Coloured, unless he knows what the criterion is, have to be dishonest.</p>

<p>The second respect in which the hon. the Minister is seeking to change the present definition is in regard to acceptance. He says that &#x201C;someone who is generally accepted as a Coloured will not be classified as White even if he looks White&#x201D;. One can think of many instances where people look White, where they are blond-haired, blue-eyed, and yet the hon. the Minister says that they will not be classified as White persons.</p>

<p>The hon. member says it depends on whether that person lived amongst Coloureds. That is a particularly interesting point. The hon. member should know that there are many people who are accepted as Coloured here in the Cape by people who know the Coloured people here and who pass for White when they go to the Transvaal. It can happen that a person can be accepted as a Coloured person in the Western Province while his brother is accepted as a White person in Johannesburg. What happens to those two brothers under this particular clause which says that someone who is generally accepted as a Coloured will not be classified as a White? He is accepted as a White in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>He is a Coloured in the Western Province; he is accepted as a Coloured here, and when he goes to the Transvaal he is accepted as a White. I have here a copy of an article written by a columnist in a paper called the <i>Banier</i> which, as the hon. the Minister knows, is partly subsidized by the Government. Many copies of these are bought for distribution among the Coloured people. I should like to quote from an article written by a columnist in the <i>Banier.</i> It is written in the typical Coloured language so you will forgive me, Sir, if I switch from one language to the other. This is what he wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As julle wil weet hoe suiwer die ras is. moet julle kom kyk na die 30,000 of 40,000 rassuiwere Blankes wat van die Kolonie na die Rand gekom het, en waarvan &#x2019;n geleerde man &#x2019;n tydjie gelede beduie het dat hulle nog heelwat niggies en nefies agtergelaat het aan die anderkant van die &#x201C;goeie grenslyne&#x201D;. Good luck as dit hulle begeerte was en good luck to the brainy fellows wat wil probeer om hierdie opmiksery nog uit te soek. Dan kan ek hulle darem nog wel &#x2019;n paar ander plekkies wys as net die Rand. Mark my words and thank you in advance.</block>

<p><span class="col_4637-4638" refersTo="page_0945"/>The third criterion which the hon. the Minister is changing in this particular Bill is in regard to appearance. He has stated that &#x201C;someone who is non-White in appearance cannot be classified as White even if he is generally accepted as such Sir, here we find the hard-luck cases and they are more than hard-luck cases; they are tragedies. We know that in many families there are throw-backs, cases where people are the children of accepted European families but show certain very well-defined characteristics usually associated with Coloured people. Again, if you accept this definition, you will find one brother classified as White and the other as non-White. These are more than hard-luck cases, they are tragedies.</p>

<p>When it comes to the question of appearance, there are other factors, too, which affect the appearance of a person. Here I am thinking of a medical factor such as Addison&#x2019;s disease, for instance. A person suffering from Addison&#x2019;s disease has a skin colour often much darker than that of an ordinary Coloured person. In the normal case, I take it that the Classification Board will take cognizance of the fact that this particular person may be suffering from Addison&#x2019;s disease and say, &#x201C;No, you are a White person in any case,&#x201D; but if you find a borderline case, not knowing that he is suffering from Addison&#x2019;s disease, what happens then? Without the disease he might have been classified as White on the borderline; with the disease he will be classified as Coloured. These are cases that we may very well find under this new definition.</p>

<p>I have said that I believe this Bill to be bad in law. It is bad in law. We know that the Government is more and more applying the Population Registration definition and making use of identity cards to determine whether a person is White, Coloured or Native. In other words, this new definition will be progressively applied to all or most of the other racial legislation where the Government has to classify people. Identification cards are being used at the present moment in regard to race classification under Acts such as the Pensions Act and the Disability Act. People who may have drawn European pensions in the past may now, if they are re-classified, have to draw the pensions for Coloureds. Under the Natives (Urban) Areas Act and under the Separate Representation of Voters Act it may well be that this particular definition will now be progressively applied so that people who to-day are accepted as voters on, say, the White Voters&#x2019; Roll will in future be excluded because under this new definition they will now be Coloured. These things can happen. What the Minister is doing in this Bill is by no means logical.</p>

<p>There is one point which I believe has not been raised and stressed sufficiently during this debate and that is that this particular definition as it stands here, will do our country&#x2019;s good name irreparable harm in future. It is quite clear that before we had this change in the definition there was always a way out. Distinguished visitors from certain countries who appeared to be not 100 per cent White could be regarded as White during the period of their stay in this country; you could make use of that sophistry. It was done in the case of Mr. Song, and it has been done in many other cases in the past too. With this new definition, however, I cannot see how that can possibly happen. You see, Sir, under this particular Bill you are not only denying Mr. Song certain rights and placing him technically in an inferior position, but you are placing the same stigma on 600,000,000 Chinese in the rest of the world. You are placing the same stigma on people from the East&#x2014;from Indonesia, from Japan, from the Philippines and Formosa. A stigma is now being placed on them under this Bill, and the harm this may do to our country may be almost irreparable. After all. I do not think that there was any harm in regarding Mr. Song as a White person for the purpose of this particular Act. The Chinese are a great people; they were civilized long before our forefathers were. They have achieved great things in culture, in the arts and in the history of the world. They invented gun-powder; they knew about writing, about parchment, about literature, long, long before our forefathers did. But, Sir, let us come closer. We will often find instances of distinguished visitors coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy. In appearance many of them are non-White. In fact many of them actually have Moorish blod in them. What will happen to people of that kind when they come to this country? Then I think of two other instances. Supposing a citizen of Holland who has Indonesian blood in his veins, or a citizen of Israel who has Yemenite blood in him, wishes to come to this country and after having looked around and seen the economic development in this country, decides that he wishes to settle here. Is he going to be classified as a Coloured? Is this another slap in the face for Dutch citizens, for Israeli citizens and Portugese citizens?</p>

<p>Take our Portuguese neighbours. We know that many of them have non-White blood in them, yet normally they are accepted in our country as Whites. Is this Bill going to change that position? Is it going to harm those good neighbours of ours whose goodwill we are seeking?</p>

<p>And what about Egyptians? I know, of course, that the hon. the Minister will immediately say, &#x201C;Egyptians as we all know, are Africans and we cannot do anything about that.&#x201D; But now I want to place the Minister before a certain test, and the test is this: Let him indicate to me now whether he is going to be the politically stupid one, or whether his Bill is going to be the stupid one. At the moment we are reading in the newspapers of a certain film called &#x201C;Cleopatra&#x201D; being made in Rome. Cleopatra, as we all know, was an Egyptian non-White Queen. Cleopatra had a torrid love affair with Antony and Caesar. This picture depicts the love affair with Antony. It will be coming to South Africa. It depicts with approval relations<span class="col_4639-4640" refersTo="page_0946"/> between what is basically a non-White Egyptian Queen and a White Roman General, Mark Antony. Is the hon. the Minister going to be so stupid as to refuse to allow that picture to be exhibited in this country? I do not think he will. I do not think he can be so stupid, but I know what he will do.</p>

<p>I withdraw the word &#x201C;stupid&#x201D; and I substitute &#x201C;politically unwise&#x201D;. Sir, I do not think he will be so politically unwise as to bann this picture &#x201C;Cleopatra&#x201D;. What he will do, of course, is to admit that his Bill is stupid, and he will allow that picture to come into the country, even if it goes against the provisions of his own Bill. Let us hear what he will do in this particular case.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill will be harmful to the leading role that we seek to play in Africa. After all, we cannot be isolated here at the southern tip of Africa; we must have contacts with the other nations in Africa, and if non-White delegates come to this country from other countries, think of the insults to which they will be subjected under this measure. How can we advance the cause of our country when a Bill such as this is applied to those delegates? You cannot even say that they can be treated as Whites while they are here as visitors because this Bill says that once they admit&#x2014;and they will admit&#x2014;that they are non-White, they will be treated as non-White.</p>

<p>Thirdly, this Bill is bad in logic. We hear a lot about how logical the Nationalist Party is and how illogical we of the United Party are. We are told that this is, after all, a logical Bill and that we must be logical. I am going to give the hon. the Minister a small lesson in logic, if he will permit me to do so. I understand that he is the Rector of the Potchefstroom University, and I heard a rumour some time ago that logic would no longer be taught as a subject at that University. I mention it in passing. I heard that rumour and I hope he will deny it. Sir, we are trying to do something in this Bill which is called division; we are trying to create a distinction between two different categories of the same thing&#x2014;between the White person and the non-White person. In every textbook on logic there is a chapter dealing with division, with classification. Classification and division can only be done on certain basic principles. Unless you are true to those principles you are being illogical. One of the basic principles of logical division, is this&#x2014;and here I quote from the textbook on Logic by Mellone&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each act of division&#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, each act of classification&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; must have one basis only. Violation of this rule leads to &#x201C;cross division&#x201D;, which practically means that the species overlap.</block>

<p>Sir, this is my point: This particular Bill has not got one basis of classification as logic demands; it has four, namely, appearance, general acceptance, admission and descent. It has even more than that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is making logic stand on its head.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>It has more than that Appearance alone cannot be a criterion in this Bill; acceptance alone is not to be the criterion; admission alone is not to be a criterion, and descent is not to be the criterion. In other words, we increase the bases of your logical division. Your basis now, instead of being only four, will have to be&#x2014;appearance plus general acceptance, or appearance plus admission, or appearance plus descent, or general acceptance plus admission, or general acceptance plus descent, or admission plus descent&#x2014;seven or eight different bases. No wonder that this Bill is a mess when it comes to applying the rules and the laws of logic. There are several instances in which this Bill vitiates the laws of logic. I am tired of hon. members opposite using the word &#x201C;logic&#x201D; and saying that we are illogical. They do not know logic.</p>

<p>Sir, logic also recognizes the fact that you can have two different categories of the same thing but that it may be impossible to draw a dividing line between them. In other words, you can have Whites and you can have non-Whites but it may be impossible to draw a dividing line between them. Logic recognizes this. I believe Aristotle, the father of logic, used it in the following example and it has become famous as &#x201C;the argument of the beard&#x201D;. In logic, when they use this example, they say that you can clearly distinguish between a bearded man and a man without a beard; that is easy. But now you get the following problem: Take a beardless man and let him have one or two or three or ten short hairs on his face. Is he bearded? No. Make it 100 hairs. Is he bearded? Now it is difficult to decide. Make it 101 or 102. Is he bearded or not? At some stage you get to the position where by adding a single hair you might be challenged to say whether a man is bearded or not bearded, and obviously it would be impossible to distinguish with the ordinary eye between those two categories. What I am trying to prove here is that you do find categories of the same thing which are very different but in logic you cannot draw a dividing line between them. And that is what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill. He is being illogical; he is violating the laws of logic.</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4641-4642" refersTo="page_0947"/>I believe that the strongest argument against this Bill is the endless misery that it will cause, and here I believe that the words of the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) should not be forgotten. The hon. member said in this House a couple of days ago: &#x201C;Hierdie wet sal ook smart en ellende veroorsaak&#x201D;, and despite that &#x201C;smart en ellende&#x201D; he stood up in this House and tried to defend this Bill.</block>

<p>Well, it was someone on the cross-benches. I think it was the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). I apologize to the hon. member for Boksburg. I do not think he would have used such language in this House. Sir, when you use that type of argument, when you say that there will be &#x201C;smart en ellende&#x201D;, that there will be tears and sorrow but that those tears and sorrows must be accepted, you are using an argument which reminds one of the evil argument which was used by that madman Hitler who tried to justify his racial murders by saying, &#x201C;If you want to remove a malignancy you must also remove some healthy tissue.&#x201D;That is not the argument of humanity; it is an evil argument; it is the argument of the racialist.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude, and I say that we on this side reject this evil, this vicious Bill. It is bad in law, it is wrong in morality, it is obnoxious to the freedom of the individual, it is harmful to our country&#x2019;s reputation, it is pernicious in its application, it is mischievous as a weapon for the gossiper, it is venomous as a knife for the blackmailer; it is destructive of home and family in its violent effects on the condemned; it is shabby in its treatment of the innocent. Accordingly we reject and oppose this accursed, diabolical and depraved Bill, a Bill which destroys and corrupts human dignity&#x2014;the human dignity not only of those who suffer under it but also the human dignity of those who have to apply it and administer it.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>Certain things have been said in the course of this debate which we certainly cannot allow to go unchallenged. The basic objection of the Opposition to this measure is that there will be great uncertainty as to who is White and who is not White, and in an attempt to prove that, they exaggerate in two directions. In the first instance they exaggerate in the direction in which the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) exaggerated. The hon. member for Durban (North) said, &#x201C;I sometimes wonder whether half of the Europeans in this country would not in terms of this definition become non-Europeans overnight&#x2014;perhaps more than half.&#x201D; He did not say that once only; he said it twice. The next time he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you go back further, as I have said, I am sure the hon. the Minister will find that is the position in the case of half the population of this country.</block>

<p>In the second case he says &#x201C;half the population&#x201D; but in the first case he stated very clearly that half or more than half of the Whites in South Africa were of non-White descent. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to use strong language, but I think that is one of the most scandalous statements ever made in this House. The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford), who likes to be known in the newspapers as a person who speaks with great authority when he talks about anything, said more or less the same thing here in a previous debate, that a very large section of the Whites in South Africa are of non-White descent.</p>

<p>He referred in the course of his speech to a scientific survey which has allegedly been made and which supposedly proved that statement. I asked him subsequently what scientific proof there was and what survey had been made, and he then said to me that Dr. Oswald Shearer had told him of a booklet in which that statement appeared. Later on when we inquired on which booklet the hon. member had come to this conclusion, it appeared that it was a booklet entitled &#x201C;Miscegenation&#x201D; written 25 or more years ago by Stuart Findlay, who had written this booklet in an attempt to prove that there were not as many light-skinned Coloureds as darkskinned Coloureds. It was not a scientific inquiry, and it was not written by an authority on this subject. It was purely a propaganda document and it was written about 25 years ago, but the hon. member for Durban (Central) refers to it as a scientific survey to prove that half the Whites in South Africa are non-Whites, and that was repeated in the language that I have mentioned by his colleague, the hon. member for Durban (North). I want to ask these hon. members again what scientific evidence there is for this scandalous smearing of the White man in South Africa. I would not have risen to take part in this debate, but I feel that I must protest against this sort of calumniation of the White man by a party which holds itself out as the alternative government in this country. I think it is our dduty to draw the attention of every White man and every White woman in South Africa to the fact that is the language and that is the opinion of this party which hopes to get the majority of votes amongst the White voters of South Africa. I want to say with all the emphasis at my command that during all the years that I devoted to a historical examination of this question, I did not come across one tittle of evidence that substantiates the allegation of these hon. members. I do not want to deny for a single moment that non-White blood was introduced into certain White families, generations ago in some cases and in other cases not so many generations ago. That<span class="col_4643-4644" refersTo="page_0948"/> is an acknowledged fact. But to say here that half the White population is of non-White descent is not only false scientifically but it is one of the most scandalous things that a White man can say in this Parliament.</p>

<p>And then they exaggerate again in the other direction. In the first place they set out to prove that under this definition a large proportion of the White population would be classified as non-White. They know that is not true, or they ought to know that is not true. I challenge any one of them or any one of their supporters outside this House to produce even a semblance of evidence to prove that statement. It is a fact which is well known to honest research workers throughout the world that there is no country in the world where the different races have preserved their identity with as much purity as we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite must not run away now from what they said previously. They must first produce proof of what they said, and they must do so before the end of this debate. Because this statement by the so-called alternative government in South Africa that more than half the Whites are of non-White descent will re-echo throughout the length and breadth of South Africa. I can tell them that they will still have to run away from many meetings; they must not start running away already. After the scandalous exaggeration, they now want to try to make us believe that a very large percentage of the Coloureds are of White descent. They did the same thing in a previous debate. Last year when I stated here that the admixture of White blood in the veins of the Coloured population was no more than 10 per cent or 15 per cent, the hon. members for Orange Grove and Yeoville referred with a great flourish to a few cases such as those of Coenraad Buys and a few others to show that there was a very great degree of admixture. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel), who has now come along with the same story, quoted from the book written by Prof. Marais. If he had read the book properly he would have known that even J. S. Marais, who is not and never has been favourably disposed to the National Party, lays down the proposition that basically the Coloured population is descended from the Hottentots and the slaves. In the third place he mentions the Bushmen, and in the fourth place only does he mention the Whites. He could also have mentioned the fact that since the appearance of that book, Indian and Bantu blood has also found its way into the veins of the Coloured population.</p>

<p>I had conversations afterwards with various people who had made a study of this matter together with me, and without a single exception they told me that the only mistake I had made was that I had probably put the percentage too high. The consensus of opinion is that the admixture of White blood in the veins of the Coloured group can be no more than 6 to 8 per cent. I want to prove that statement, and in order to prove it I want to draw attention to the fact that on 1 December 1834 the slaves in the Cape Colony were emancipated. At that stage there were 39,021 slaves. They did not disappear; they did not all die of the plague. They were not absorbed into the White population; they became part of the present Coloured population. It was estimated, according to the census of 1856, that there were about 28,835 Hottentots roaming about in the Cape. And when we look at the evidence of a man like Campbell, one of the English missionaries, who was certainly not favourably disposed to these Border farmers either, we find that he made a survey of the forebears of the Griqua population. He put the number at approximately 4,600, and he said that more or less than half of them would be &#x201C;basters&#x201D; (bastards) and the others Hottentots and Coranna. I just want to point out that a person who in those days was referred to as a &#x201C;baster&#x201D; was not necessarily the product of miscegenation between White and non-White persons. We have the writings of the &#x201C;heemrade&#x201D; of Stellenbosch and we have the writings and petitions of the &#x201C;heemrade&#x201D; of Swellendam who protested to the governor before the end of the eighteenth century. Swellendam pointed out that &#x201C;basters&#x201D; were being born on their farms as the result of relations between emancipated slaves, or slaves still in service, and Hottentot women. They referred to these children as &#x201C;basters&#x201D;. The &#x201C;heemrade&#x201D; of Stellenbosch complained that many slaves were deserting their masters and then holding themselves out as &#x201C;basters&#x201D; because they were then free to enter the service of any person and thus evade their obligations to their master. These people make up a large portion of the 4,600 whom Campbell calls &#x201C;basters&#x201D;. There was no admixture of White blood in their veins. In the case of a small percentage it is true that there was. I would remind hon. members that so far I have mentioned the emancipated slaves, the Griquas, with their Hottentot and &#x201C;baster&#x201D; population, and the Hottentots themselves, who numbered about 85,000 in roundabout 1834, or, to be precise, 82,621. It must also be remembered that when one goes through the requests put forward to the Government, one finds that most of the requests were for the setting free of some slave or other. In the century before the actual emancipation of slaves in the Cape Province, slaves were being set free from time to time. If all this is taken into account, it is safe to assume that in 1834, when the emancipation of slaves took place, there were between 90,000 and 100,000 people in these groups that I have mentioned, of whom a very small percentage had an admixture of White blood.</p>

<p>I am proving that in making the allegation that the White man is the father<span class="col_4645-4646" refersTo="page_0949"/> of the Coloured population, the Opposition is guilty of a gross and scandalous exaggeration, to the shame of the White man. I say that they are making use of a scandalous exaggeration to oppose this Bill. Let us take it on a conservative basis that there were 95,000 of these people in 1834, and let us assume that their numbers did not increase at the rate at which we know the Coloured population has been increasing; let us assume that their numbers simply doubled every generation. The position then is that in 1864 there were 190,000, in 1901 there were 380,000; in 1934 the number was 760,000 and in 1954, 1,520,000. And that is more or less precisely what the number is today. I say that if these figures prove anything, they prove that the Coloureds by descent have a very small admixture of White blood in their veins and that they descend mainly from the emancipated slaves, the &#x201C;basters&#x201D; and Hottentots and the nomadic Hottentot tribes in the Cape. I just want to repeat that everybody who has tried to make a proper scientific study of this matter has come to the conclusion that there is not a single nation in the world, where White, Coloured and Black people have lived together, where there has been so little miscegenation as in this country. And it is precisely because that is the case that it is not difficult at all, but comparatively easy, to classify the vast majority as either Whites or non-Whites. This Bill deals with the small number in between, and nobody with a sense of responsibility would dare to say that we must not tackle this matter at this stage, that we must not come to a decision now, so that we can lay down the traditional colour line that we have maintained of our own volition throughout the centuries and settle once and for all who the members of the non-White groups are.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the nonsense that was uttered by the hon. member for Durban (North), who is not here at the moment. It was scandalous nonsense that he propagated. That is the sort of language that the enemies of South Africa would like to hear abroad, namely, &#x201C;I sometimes wonder whether half of the Europeans in this country would not in terms of this definition become non-Europeans overnight, perhaps more than half&#x201D;. The reason why we must have this legislation is because we are saddled with a party which seeks the votes of the Whites and which, according to their Leader, is on the threshold of getting the votes of the Whites but who first says to the Whites, &#x201C;Half of you are non-White&#x201D;. The hon. member for Turffontein is making a noise here; he believes what the hon. member for Durban (North) said, and I can expect that from him, but he will never stand up here and say it aloud. He talked here about &#x201C;courage&#x201D; recently. The hon. member must not talk about courage.

He said at least ten times what a scandal it was, as he alleged, that the hon. member for Durban (North) should have suggested that some 50 per cent of the Whites in this country might have Coloured blood in their veins. It comes surprisingly from that hon. member if one bears in mind that he was the first person to point out in this House that an honoured and historical figure in our history, Simon van der Stel, was in fact a Coloured man. Sir, bearing that in mind, it is particularly surprising that this sort of attack should have come from the hon. member for Fort Beaufort. But I think to begin with, one should get the record straight. What the hon. member for Durban (North) said was that he wondered how many of the Whites had some Coloured blood in their veins, and he was dealing with the latter part of Clause 1 of this Bill which deals with the question of descent. It was in that context that he made those remarks and he did not say what the hon. member for Fort Beaufort alleges.</p>

<p>But why should the hon. member take up this attitude, even if it was said, when one bears in mind that not only the hon. the Minister, but also the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) said two or three times that if one was a Coloured man one should be proud of it, and who said that even if one was classified as a Coloured man, what was wrong with it? Now we have from this hon. member what I believe to be purely simulated indignation that it was a scandalous thing if somebody said that somewhere in the background there might be a drop of Coloured<span class="col_4647-4648" refersTo="page_0950"/> blood in many Europeans. Sir, that remark was made purely so that the hon. member can go round the platteland to smear this party. One expects that from that hon. member.</p>

<p>Now I should like to deal with the point that he made, the attempt that he made to show that the Coloured people after all are not an offshoot of the Whites, but they are the results of unions between Hottentots and Bushmen and slaves and one or two others. May one say to him that everybody in this House knows that is utter nonsense. Even his own party members were not impressed when the hon. member tried to pass that off.</p>

<p>Surely the answer is quite simple: Why is it that every Coloured man in this country has an English name or an Afrikaans name?</p>

<p>Before coming to the main point of this Bill, I should like to reply to some of the remarks made by the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser). I am sorry that he is not in the House, but he raised, unwisely perhaps, the interesting topic of the reason for this Bill being the question of the Chinese. One gathered from him that was really the sole reason for the bringing in of this measure, and he described how under this legislation a Japanese would be classified as an Asiatic, that is under the Population Registration Act, whereas under the Group Areas Act, a Japanese would be exempted for the purposes of that Act, and he would be classified as White. Now to take the analogy of the hon. member for Orange Grove, a Japanese businessman, on that hypothesis, having got into his Asiatic taxi at Vereeniging, would then be unable to proceed to Johannesburg for a meal at a Chinese restaurant, because that would be classified as Asiatic under the Group Areas Act, while a Japanese businessman is White under the Group Areas Act. And the nonsense and absurdity does not end there. Because if that Japanese were to marry a Coloured then in terms of the Group Areas Act, he would become a Coloured, and if he were to marry a Chinese, he would become Asiatic in terms of the Group Areas Act. Sir, how can anybody approaching this sort of thing dispassionately, possibly say that there is any merit at all in this sort of legislation when one has results which are as absurd as that? Finally, I would like to deal with the remaining point made by the hon. member for Klerksdorp, viz. that it was necessary to have the powers of investigation in terms of Clause 4 of this Bill because as things stood at present, the Secretary concerned could merely ask a man like Wong to produce the evidence required to substantiate any facts required under the Act and that he could produce merely the evidence which was favourable to his case, and that it was accordingly necessary to give to some official the power of investigation to bring forward that evidence which would counter that brought forward by a Chinese person. But, Sir, the information which the Department has is principally obtained from the census, and in terms of the present Census Act, the enumerators have power to correct on the census return any errors which may there appear, and what is more, it is a criminal offence for anyone to put into his census return information which is incorrect. Sir, those enumerators under the Census Act, act under oath and there are penalties provided to make sure that there is no fiddling or hanky-panky business with those returns. What benefit can there be, Sir, to give to an official powers of investigation, not under oath and in respect of which there are no penalties to ensure that the investigations are proper? How can that be an advance over the existing system where in terms of the Census Act as it stands, there are these powers to correct errors, which powers are exercised under oath and are subject to the penalties to ensure that there are no <i>mala fides?</i> No, Sir, that cannot be the reason. There must be other reasons. We have not been told what they are, and hon. members on this side of the House have given vent to the suspicions as to how this sort of power of investigation can be misused, and those suspicions have not been refuted.</p>

<p>This Bill has been described by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition as a vicious Bill. It is a Bill whose propensities the hon. the Minister has tried to obscure in a speech which can only be described as sanctimoniously unconvincing. That was specially noticeable, Sir, because we had piloting this Bill a gentleman who is blessed with undoubted debating powers, a man whom we know has great skill in that regard. But despite that, he has not been able to make this Bill appear even apparently acceptable. Sir, this is a bad thing for the Government when a major measure such as this is put forward and one is left with that impression. It is a bad thing for any government, and my only objection to it is that I am embarrassed that I have to live under a Government who cannot make this thing seem any better than we believe it is. But, Sir, it is not only a bad thing for the Government, but it is a great tragedy for the country, if we bear in mind that the hon. the Minister who has got to present this abroad, is the hon. Minister of Information, a man without the undoubted talents of the hon. the Minister of the Interior. If this Minister cannot paint the thing white, how much less so can the hon. Minister of Information.</p>

<p>On a point of order, the hon. member used the word in the sense of &#x201C;sorrowful&#x201D;, &#x201C;dismal&#x201D;, not in an offensive sense. Sir, the word has two meanings.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw the word &#x201C;wretched&#x201D; and will use the word &#x201C;unhappy&#x201D;. This unhappy hon. Minister has to try and present this legislation abroad to a suspicious audience.</p>

<p>I have described the hon. Minister&#x2019;s speech as sanctimonious and I have used that word designedly, because listening to him when he spoke earlier in this debate, bearing in mind that he was describing a Bill, which we accept is going to cause untold hardship, he put it forward in a tone as though what he was doing was for the benefit of the Coloured people. I expected him at any moment to say that he had a sheaf of letters from the Coloured people asking him specifically to put through this legislation. That is why I have described his speech as sanctimonious because it was. I have said that it was unconvincing. Sir, you only have to look very briefly at the reasons which have emerged for the bringing in of this legislation to realize that there is some truth in the allegation that was a thoroughly unconvincing performance, by a most able Minister, and if it is unconvincing under those circumstances, one can fairly say that it is completely without merit. The reasons put forward were twofold. I shall not dwell on them at length because they have to a certain extent been dealt with already. I should like to say this. The reasons were twofold. Firstly, 15 Coloured people who had been classified as White requested that they be re-classified as Coloured and secondly the case of one Chinese who had been classified as White. If ever a major measure is brought before the House on a ground as slender as that you need no further proof of the undesirability of that piece of legislation. It is within the Minister&#x2019;s power under the existing Act to re-classify those 15 people as Coloured if they wish it. If that is so, why is the whole complex machinery of Parliament set in motion, taking up time and energy, simply to put right something which can be put right administratively without all that clamour? Why do the same in respect of one Chinese, even bearing in mind what the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) said that there may be others following? Because, Sir, 15 Coloured people and one Chinese are not going to endanger the purity of 3,000,000 Whites. We ask again what is the need for this? So far it has been demonstrated to be wholly unacceptable. I do not believe that there is any necessity at all for amending the definition under the Act. The definition, as it stands, is that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">a White person means a person who in appearance obviously is or who is generally accepted as a White person.</block>

<p>Great play has been made of the case of Mr. Song, who, the hon. the Minister quite rightly says is a full-blooded Chinese; he admits that he is a full-blooded Chinese. Now, Sir, no matter how many affidavits are submitted, a full-blooded Chinese can never be accepted as a White person. He is not a White person. He cannot be accepted as a White person under the existing definition, nor can he be accepted as a Negro, because he is obviously Chinese. He can be accepted as a person, or he can be a Chinese acceptable to the White community, but he cannot be accepted as a White person, because clearly he is not. Looked at in that light, the decision of the Board is wrong, clearly wrong, if they brought in the finding that he was accepted as a White person. Quite clearly he was not, and could not have been any more than a coal black Negro can be accepted as a White person, no matter what his attributes may be. He may be acceptable as a person in a certain society or a certain community, but he is accepted as a Negro, not as a White man, because he is obviously a full-blooded Negro. Surely on that simple basis there is no reason at all to amend the definition as it stands at the moment if the real reason for this legislation is merely to cover the case of Mr. Song. It can be put right if the Minister wishes to do so by representations or an application to court. He has his remedy in that regard.</p>

<p>I should like to refer for a moment to the question raised by the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;). The hon. member made a speech which can at best, regrettably, be described as words, words and more words. He did refer to the administrators&#x2019; support of the idea of a national register in 1948. Perfectly true, Sir, there was support by the administrators of the various provinces for a type of register in either 1948 or 1949&#x2014;it makes no difference what year it was. But what they did not ask for&#x2014;and that is the point which the hon. member for Parow did not make clear&#x2014;was a population register of this kind. We have always had a register of some sort or other. We have always had a register of births, deaths, marriages; there is nothing new in the concept of a register. In the report they refer to a type of national register. A national register in itself can be a most desirable thing, but that depends on what sort of register you have and for what purpose you want a register. If you have a register which is reasonably framed and which is not the standard by which you measure the status of<span class="col_4651-4652" refersTo="page_0952"/> every single individual, it is desirable to have it. But when the object of your register is that every facet of a man&#x2019;s life thereafter shall be gauged by where his name appears in that register, then of course it is objectionable. And that is why we oppose this measure.</p>

<p>There is another factor which, I believe, renders this Bill undesirable. Of all spheres this is one in which you require certainty and permanence so far as standards are concerned. You require certainty and permanence in definition, in administration and in the effect of the measure concerned. That is elementary. Because once a man is classified and you are given the power to reclassify him, you are opening the door to hardship and unnecessary hardship. There is at the present time, as a result of numerous decisions by the court, a great deal of certainty and permanence as far as the 1950 legislation is concerned. We know what the definition means. We know what the dissatisfied applicant has to prove in order to be properly classified. We know where the onus lies in any litigation over classification. We know what the powers and the functions of the secretary are. We know what records the secretary can look at in order to decide on the classification of an individual. We know what investigations can be made into a person&#x2019;s circumstances by the officials concerned. All those things have been decided by the courts in cases where ordinary working people have spent their life&#x2019;s savings in going to court to have these things made certain. People have been able to say: &#x201C;Well, I do not like any of this, but at least I know where I stand&#x201D;, which means that there was not that dreadful uncertainty, that dreadful uncertainty of not knowing whether he was going to be classified on this or that side of the colour line. When this amending Bill is brought in the whole of that field is to be re-opened. I need quote only one instance so far as the definition is concerned. There is a presumption in favour of the man who is obviously White. The Minister will know of that presumption. But what is to happen to that presumption when, in the definition of a White man, you delete the little word &#x201C;or&#x201D; and substitute the word &#x201C;and&#x201D;? In that case, of what use is the presumption as contained in Section 19 of the principal Act? You will now have to prove two things instead of only one, as was formerly the case. There is again this question of reclassification. I hope the hon. the Minister will be a little clearer as to what the position is in regard to reclassification, as far as his Department is concerned. All the assurances in the world, given with the best intentions in the world, given by the Minister, do not deal with the damage that can be done by reclassification. Because, in terms of Section 5 of the existing Act and also in terms of Section 11, there is a duty on the secretary to make investigations and to reclassify, not only if an objection is raised by the Department, but when an objection is raised by any member of the public. Any member of the public can object to a classification and any member of the public can come along, when this Bill becomes law, and say to an individual: &#x201C;You were all right under the old definition; but you are now incorrectly classified under the amended definition.&#x201D; That old case can then be re-opened. It is not a question of what the Minister would like to see done in that regard. It is a question of there being a public duty on the secretary if an objection is lodged by any member of the public. That is the damaging aspect of this question of amending the definition.</p>

<p>I should like to show for a moment that my objections in this regard, to the question of any member of the public asking for a reclassification, are not fanciful; they are not figments of my imagination. I should like to refer this House, and you, Sir, to the facts of an actual case which is reported in the 1958 <i>Law Reports.</i> It concerns a certain cabinet maker by the name of Nicholas. This gentleman bought a house and he wanted to take transfer of that house. He approached the officials concerned and, as a result of a personal inspection, the production of his birth certificate and so forth, he was held by the Department concerned to be White and he took transfer of his house. He paid for it. I may say that this case rose under the Group Arease Act but it is directly applicable to the sort of things which can happen under the amendment which we are to-day contemplating to the Population Registration Act. This gentleman was seen by the officials concerned, he was passed as White and he was able to buy that house. The opening words of the Judge concerned, Mr. Justice Hiemstra, set the tone to the whole case. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a particular poignancy in this case the result of which will affect a whole family throughout their lives. The very organ of State which set the law in motion to uproot this family from the area where they have been living since 29 December 1951 is the one that expressly sanctions their residence in that area.</block>

<p>It is of interest to see how that came about when I say that there is a danger of re-classification here because anybody can object to a classification. It happened in this way, Sir: The neighbour of Mr. Nicholas, who himself was a Coloured man, but who was able to go on living in that declared White area because he had been living there presumably for some time previously&#x2014;although the Judge says &#x201C;How he manages to stay there undisturbed is not explained&#x201D;&#x2014;said to Mr. Nicholas who had been told that he was a White man by the Board and that he could live in that area: &#x201C;This is what I am going to do. I am going to the factory where your wife works as a European with all the information I have and witnesses and expose her to the Europeans with whom she works. If the race of you and your wife is not the same on the other certificates I will report the matter to the Registrar of Births and police investigations will follow.&#x201D; The Judge says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4653-4654" refersTo="page_0953"/>His real motives are revealed by a document which was put in, written by himself. It was a threat directed by Fillis (the man next door) to the accused and is revolting in its vicious vindictiveness.</block>

<p>That is exactly the sort of thing that is going to happen under the amendment which is at present before this House. A vicious and vindictive neighbour can lodge a complaint and there will be necessarily, as a duty, a re-classification because the definition of a White man has been changed. All the goodwill in the world on the part of the hon. the Minister cannot stop that from taking place. Here, Sir, is a concrete example of what can take place and has taken place. We do not know the reasons why Mr. Fillis lodged the complaint in this particular case but the motive was a vindictive one and it can happen again.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has said the emphasis is being placed on appearance rather than on association. It is difficult to understand how the hon. the Minister could have devoted the first half of his speech to applauding the ability of the ordinary man to judge between races in society, applauding society as being the best judge of those who waver between Black and White. Yet, Sir, he comes forward with a Bill whose main object is to do away with that and to substitute in its place, in effect, appearance as the dominating criterion. Many examples have been given as to how that does not work and as to how that creates hardships. As I have said the objections can mainly be levelled not only at the effects of this legislation but at the stated reasons given for its introduction. They are inadequate. They are unconvincing and I believe they show this to be a piece of legislation completely devoid of merit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the United Party has one characteristic which I have come to admire and that is their ability to talk nonsense for such a long time in a relaxed and self-confident manner. And, Mr. Chairman, that is obviously not where it ends, but the hon. member who has just sat down took it upon himself to describe the way in which the hon. the Minister introduced this Bill as sanctimonious (skynheilig). He probably used the word &#x201C;sanctimonious&#x201D; because I think the Chair has already ruled its synonym out of order. I wish to tell the hon. member that if he describes the Minister&#x2019;s presentation as &#x201C;sanctimonious&#x201D; we describe his argument as downright boorish. In the first place, in defending the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) he tried to refute the Hansard report of the speech by the hon. member for Durban (North) which was quoted. Not only is it boorish but it is also childish to try to argue away a literal piece of evidence which has been submitted.</p>

<p>The hon. member then continued and launched his attack on this legislation. What was his first charge? It concerns Section 4 and he says that Section 4 is entirely unnecessary because all the information which the director requires can be obtained from the census forms in respect of which the enumerators can in any case ask for further information. The proposal which the hon. member now wishes to make to this hon. House is that according to him, before a dispute arises as to the classification of anybody, it will be sufficient if a census enumerator conducts an investigation in respect of the person whose details he is enumerating, and possibly improve upon those details. I maintain that it would be madness to administer the law in that way. You can only imagine it happening under the United Party that census enumerators are instructed generally to obtain additional information left, right and centre about persons whose census details they are enumerating with a view to a possible dispute as to the race in some case or other. This section makes the necessary provision, that when data have to be obtained in respect of a specific case, a person can be appointed to investigate the case concerned and submit evidence. Mr. Chairman, in this respect I wish to refer to what the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) said when he suggested that there would be corruption on the part of the inspectors, that they would be itinerant Judges or classification boards. No, Mr. Chairman, they will be itinerant channels of information, channels which will convey that information to a responsible official who will use that information in order to make a human decision and not to make a hateful or malicious decision. That is the great difficulty, Mr. Chairman. Hon. members opposite do not want to see any good in this legislation. That was why the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) tried to condemn this legislation as the grossest symbol of injustice towards the Coloured people, in such flowery language that the rhetorician Bilderdyk would have envied him his ability to produce doggerels so rich in alliteration. It is in the spirit in which they view this Bill that the difficulty lies. Because what is the law itself? In the first place the most important provision is Section 4 which amends Section 12 of the principal Act and which provides for new methods of investigating a case. Let us at least say this that when such an important question has to be decided, it is always important for the sake of justice and in the interests of justice, also to obtain information in respect of it. I have never heard the principle criticized that you should try to obtain as much information as possible before you come to a decision. Hon. members opposite are attacking the establishment of a mechanism to obtain more facts. Is that the logic of the United Party as represented by the hon. member for Orange Grove, or is prejudice at the root of this criticism? I say, Mr. Chairman, that there is no real ground on which Section 4 which amends Section 12 of the principal Act can be attacked.</p>

<p>We have the important matter, namely, the amendment of the definition. In that respect, <span class="col_4655-4656" refersTo="page_0954"/>too, the learned gentleman from Zululand (Mr. Cadman) argued that this amendment was absolutely unnecessary, because no person, on account of general acceptance in the White community alone, can be classified as White. I am impressed by the gentleman&#x2019;s erudition and that is why I do not wish to state my opinion against his but I wish to give him the opinion of Justice Snyman in connection with this matter, and perhaps he will then realize that even he in his wisdom has made a mistake. Justice Snyman said the following in connection with the application of the old definition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be seen from this section read with the definition of &#x201C;White person&#x201D; that there are really two legs to the inquiry, firstly, whether the appellants are obviously White persons, and secondly, if they are, whether there is evidence to prove the contrary; that is, whether there is evidence to prove that they are generally accepted as Coloured persons.</block>

<p>The hon. Justice Snyman says that if you depend on the first part of the decision, the obvious appearance, a second question still arises namely whether, in spite of your obvious appearance, you are generally accepted as a Coloured person. The learned Judge goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Or (b) if they are not obviously White, whether there is evidence that they are generally accepted as White persons.</block>

<p>In other words, the second test which should be applied under the old definition is that in the case of a person like Mr. Song, who is not obviously White, the B-test should be applied and evidence called for as to whether or not he is generally accepted as a White person. And if in that case the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) willingly organizes a mass of evidence that such a person is accepted in the White community, and the new Section 4 does not provide for an inspector to make some report on the circumstances, the hon. Classification Board and the court have to accept their word that the person is White. The hon. gentleman opposite shakes his head. I suggest that he reads the judgment in the case of M. and Others v. the Race Classification Board which appears in Vol. 1 of the March 1962 <i>Law Reports.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have allowed myself to be somewhat diverted. I merely wish to say what the position is in respect of the definition. The position remains unaltered under the new definition as far as those people who are obviously White in appearance are concerned. It is only qualified in the negative sense. They are White unless they are usually accepted as Coloureds. No new yardstick is being introduced. But as far as the second basis of classification is concerned, a new yardstick has very definitely been introduced. That is the question as to when is a person generally accepted as a White? I readily admit that this definition makes the position worse than it was before. Previously the position was that if there was evidence that a person was generally accepted as White, although he was a coal-black Native or an unmistakable Chinaman, he was White in terms of the definition and had to be recognized as such. We have now qualified this definition. We have added the qualification that he will nevertheless not be recognized as White if his appearance is obviously not that of a White person. In other words, if in appearance he is obviously a Coloured person. I admit, Mr. Chairman, that we have narrowed this loophole but we have not narrowed it unreasonably, because the doubtful case must still be classified as White. He is only excluded when his appearance is obviously not that of a White person. If his appearance can possibly be that of a White man, he is not excluded, not even under this definition. He is only excluded from being classified as White, in spite of the evidence that the person is generally accepted as a White person, if any lay person can see he is not a White person&#x2014;on this basis: my eyes tell me that. Is that unreasonable? The hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) has already made the point in the debate that, when a person is as obviously a non-White as that, even a legal classification will not assist him, because he will not be accepted as such by the people of the whole country.</p>

<p>Finally, a provision is added to the definition that if a person admits himself that he is not White, he is not a White person either. A little tail has also been added to this&#x2014;what is an admission? The hon. member for Orange Grove, who is particularly blessed&#x2014;I think I should say stricken&#x2014;with logic to-day, advanced this &#x201C;logical argument&#x201D; that a person would be admitting that he is a non-White, if he received a birth certificate which indicated that a forefather of his was possibly a non-White. I think that logic of his is even beyond his United Party colleagues, and I do not think one of them will support him in that. In the first place, surely an admission, in the ordinary grammatical sense of the meaning of the word, is a statement by yourself, on behalf of yourself, in which you admit something.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, on a point of difference. An admission under the law always has something to do with a point of difference. How any evil meaning can be attached to that is not clear to me. What is of importance, however, is that it is surely illogical to classify a person in conflict with his own admission. Surely a person cannot come to you and say in one breath: &#x201C;I am a Bantu&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am a Chinese&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am a Coloured&#x201D; and continue to say in the same breath: &#x201C;But I demand to be registered as a White person.&#x201D; Or you cannot be heard to say: &#x201C;I am White but I demand that I be registered as a Coloured.&#x201D; That is in conflict with the <span class="col_4657-4658" refersTo="page_0955"/>logic with which we are all acquainted, except the hon. member for Orange Grove.</p>

<p>That is why I say, Mr. Chairman, that this legislation is essentially reasonable. That brings me to the real attack which has been launched by hon. members of the Opposition who have asked whether this legislation is really necessary. They say that this is an unnecessary and evil piece of legislation. I merely wish to ask the hon. member one thing, and the hon. member for Zululand has admitted that his side also regarded it desirable at one stage to compile a population register. Quite apart from the legislation which this Government has passed as a result of the Population Registration Act, do you not admit, Sir, that it is necessary in South Africa to have certainty as to whether a person is White or Coloured or Bantu? What has been the requirements as far as land ownership in the Transvaal and the Free State is concerned during all these years? Apart from the regime of this Government, was it not necessary to determine whether a person was White or Coloured? Only Whites and Malays could own land in the Transvaal. You had to be able to determine the race. What about this problem of the conditions governing the establishment of hundreds of towns, from Milnerton to Bryanston, where certain rights are granted to certain racial groups and where certain rights are withheld from other racial groups? What about the question of admission to schools? I think that has already been mentioned. What about the provisions of the Defence Act which places certain obligations on the Whites, obligations which do not rest upon other racial groups? What about the old electoral laws in the northern provinces, where you have to have race classification and what about the liquor laws? How can any party seriously argue that it is unnecessary in South Africa to determine accurately to which racial group a person belongs? Must every borderline case first of all determine what his rights are by means of individual litigation and ruin himself in order to prove that he is White, rather than obtain that proof by means of these administrative processes? It is false to argue that this legislation is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Apart from the legislative structure which this Government has erected as far as apartheid is concerned, the entire administrative and legislative structure of South Africa and the whole of South African society are based on the question of which racial group a person belongs to. I ask myself this question: Why do we have this campaign against this legislation? I think that is the interesting question and I think the reply is to be found in an article which Prof. Edgar Brookes wrote two years ago when he advised the liberal-minded sections in South Africa that a frontal attack should not be launched against this party&#x2019;s conception of separate development but that the attack should be launched on the flanks, on the sides, to break down in every possible way the conception of the separateness of the races indirectly. It was then suggested that as far as possible opportunities should be made available to the various races to have mixed discussions, mixed conferences, even mixed parties, stage performances where the colour barrier is crossed, and ultimately sport as well, yes sport was also mentioned at that time. I say that an organized campaign has been launched in South Africa in an attempt to prevent the idea of the various races living separately from becoming a reality, amongst others, the weaknesses in the old definition were also deliberately abused by people of that disposition to try to undermine the separate co-existence of the races in South Africa and to replace it by a mixed co-existence. I want to ask the Opposition this: Do they wish to uphold the mechanism for the maintenance of the colour bar or do they wish to break it down? Are you in favour of it that this traditional co-existence which is based on colour bars, which runs like a thread through the conditions governing town planning, and through the Defence Act and the hundred and one other laws, should cease; do you wish to abolish the mechanism which upholds that colour bar, or do you support it? To judge by the behaviour of the United Party they wish to break down that mechanism for the maintainance of all other colour bars.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants me to give him the long history of lawsuits in connection with land ownership in the Transvaal, lawsuits to remove children from certain schools. This is not the time to give him the history of that unfortunate period when there was an ineffective definition. This is a simple definition and we are smartening up a reasonable definition. The United Party are trying to get away from the principle, however, that they wish to break down the mechanism for maintaining colour bars. Our party wishes to recognize the differences in South Africa and that is why we find it necessary to have a proper definition and we wish to maintain these differences, not in a spirit of malice but as something which is a social and historical reality, a reality with which we have to live here in South Africa. But in addition to that&#x2014;let me say this, because it seems to me that it is regarded as bad manners in the <span class="col_4659-4660" refersTo="page_0956"/>entire Western world to say this&#x2014;our party wishes to maintain our White identity in South Africa. We are set on it that the people of this Republic, that section who has the political say, the leading element of the population, should be White and we are proud of the fact that we are trying to keep it White. Consequently we are against it that a person should be classified as White against his own admission or in conflict with the evidence of your own eyes. That does not mean, however, that we do not wish to give the person who is not classified as White, in his capacity as a Coloured or as a member of another race, sufficient room to live. We welcome this definition because it does not plunge anybody into darkness but it brings many people from the twilight of uncertainty into the light of complete certainty, as far as their status is concerned. Our object is not to do away with the differences, nor to make them painful. If it is insinuated that the person who is not classified as White is of necessity condemned to an unacceptable fate, I wish to doubt that. It will be a bitterly hard blow to hundreds of thousands of Coloureds if you offered them the obligations which accompany the White man&#x2019;s existence. In his own way of life, the Coloured gets as much satisfaction as the White man gets in his. If hon. members opposite want to argue on the basis that the Coloured person has not sufficient living room and facilities in his own way of life, I am always willing to discuss that and do the best I can for all inhabitants of this country. But if you think that the Coloured person is subjected to certain limitations in his own way of life, that is still no reason why we should try to classify him artificially as a White and in conflict with the evidence. After all, the questions as to whether the Coloured person has sufficient living room in his own life to meet his own requirements, is a totally different question but that is a subject which must be discussed on another occasion.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by asking this: Why this misrepresentation that our party is introducing this amendment because of an obsession about colour, a misrepresentation couched in the strongest possible language? Hon. members have spoken about &#x201C;arguments like those of the madman Hitler&#x201D; in order to identify us internationally with most revolting memories. Hon. members have spoken about &#x201C;pool of blood and race, blood, threats and fears&#x201D;, an inflated and exaggerated attempt to make this country and the world believe that this Government is burdened down with a colour obsession. What is the objective of this proposal? Is it in the interests of the Coloured? Of what benefit is it to the Coloured to suggest that this piece of legislation harbours evil intentions towards the Coloureds? The Coloured person is not affected [Interjections.] The hon. member for Boland was one of those who tried to use this law in an attempt to represent the Government as a Government imbued with racialism and blood. To suggest that, is not in the interests of the Coloureds and certainly not in the interests of the Whites. Just as little is it in the interests of the Western nations. It can only raise doubts in their minds as to the basic policy of South Africa. It can only create the impression that this party also supports the idea that the White should always be the master because he is White or that he should be afraid to maintain his White state. That cannot be in the interests of the Western nations. The trend of the debate which we have had from the side opposite can only be in the interests of one thing and that is in the interests of international communism because over the past 15 years the outspoken object of international communism has been that they should avail themselves of the so-called struggle of the under-developed non-White races for freedom. The object of the criticism can only be to suggest to the non-White of the world that he is being oppressed and that the Government is not giving him his full rights. It is a service rendered directly to communism. That is why we find that this type of debate evokes unrest locally and that it has repercussions overseas. That is what that party has done. They have not rendered a service to either the Coloured or the White man. They have served those whom they would have us believe are their enemies. When will the United Party reach the stage where they regard necessary legislation soberly and on its merits and not try to draw poison from it and to spray that poison all over the world, poison which they unjustifiably draw from a normal administrative measure. No, they are satisfied to sit their as outcasts, and that is why the electorate have discarded them time and time again.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I should try to reply to the speech made by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). He destroyed his entire speech, particularly towards the end, with the wonderful adjectives which he used and with the sort of statement that this side of the House wanted to do away with the colour bar. The hon. member knows that is not the case. He knows very well what the feelings of this side of the House are as far as the White man in South Africa is concerned, and it is not necessary for me to repeat them. But I do believe, nevertheless, that when you consider this legislation, you should remember that during all the years prior to 1950 there was a natural division of the races in South Africa. It was a division which came about naturally, and the test which was applied, was the test of which the Minister is so proud, the test of public opinion. That was a good test but the Nationalist Party Government was not satisfied with that; 1950 arrived and they passed an Act and entrenched the same test in it. We have a very peculiar phenomenon to-day, however. While public opinion was the test, there were many difficulties but we never heard about those.</p>

<from><span class="col_4661-4662" refersTo="page_0957"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>For the simple reason that when public opinion applies a yardstick, it is the human being, the elastic human being, who applies it, and not the inflexible law. It is only since this Act has been placed on the Statute Book that we have heard about all these sufferings and tragedies. I had hoped that in view of all this tragedy the Minister would not have gone further but to-day we have a Bill before us in which the Minister says clearly that he is no longer satisfied that public opinion should be the test. For the first time descent is being introduced into the law. We have this peculiar situation that if a person admits that he is Coloured he is classified as a Coloured; or let me rather put it this way: If a person is classified as White, if public opinion makes him a White person, even though he has coloured blood in his veins, he has only been sufficiently clever not to admit it, he is a White person. He must not admit it voluntarily or under coercion or in error. I have so often seen people signing documents without knowing what they are signing, and it is for anybody to make such an admission. You may ask me, Sir, whether I wish to have a person classified as White knowing that he has coloured blood in his veins? I need not reply to that, because the law is very clear on that point and hon. members opposite are very clear on that point. A person can have coloured blood in his veins and he can be classified as White as long as he does not admit it. [Interjections.] Let us deal with the effects of this measure. You find the position particularly in Cape Town where somebody&#x2019;s father or mother had coloured blood and with the passage of time, without his being able to do anything about it, he finds himself in the position where he starts to associate with Whites. His skin is reasonably White and he is accepted as a White person, and the powerful yardstick of which the Minister is so proud classifies that person with the Whites. That person&#x2019;s own father has coloured blood, but he was sufficiently clever not to admit it. However, you find the poor soul whose great grandmother came from Mauritius. In the meantime he too has been declared White and he is in all probability married to a White woman and has children in White schools, and one day, in error or due to pressure of circumstances, he admits that there is coloured blood in his veins, and the moment he does that he is declared to be a Coloured, even though only one eighth of his blood is coloured; and the person who may perhaps have 50 per cent coloured blood remains White simply because he has not admitted it. This to me is a very tragic matter. This is the first time that the test of descent has been applied. I know the Minister has dealt very mildly with the question of admission but nowhere in the Bill do I find that mildness. It says that if you admit&#x2014;the circumstances in which you admit are not mentioned&#x2014;that you have coloured blood, you are a Coloured person. The point I wish to make, however, is this. The Minister has told us that is not a test. He has said that it is a voluntary admission, but I nevertheless think this Bill has a deeper significance. The hon. member for Kempton Park said that we were looking for all sorts of motives behind the Bill, but you cannot forget the past completely, Sir. I should like to read something to the Minister from col. 2521 of Hansard of 8 March 1950 when the original Act was before this House. The then Minister of the Interior said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Mixed Marriages Commission of 1938 said that the test of racial classification by one&#x2019;s fellow citizens is to a large extent a true test, because we are living in a small country where a person&#x2019;s descent is generally known. I am afraid, however, that in respect of borderline cases, we are gradually arriving at a position where the practical and easy test will no longer be acceptable and where it will become necessary to adopt the more difficult tests which are applied in America.</block>

<p>I feel inclined to accept the word of the Minister, but when I look at the existing Act I find so many anomalies as far as this admission is concerned that I think we should read it not as indicated by the Minister but as it ought to be read, and in that case I see in this provision regarding descent the test which will in future be applied to classify people. We are dealing here with a brand new test which has never before been applied in South Africa, a yardstick which will be applied to classify the borderline cases, to classify those people who find themselves in a no-man&#x2019;s land, the land which everybody is exceedingly anxious to leave, the majority undoubtedly for the White side. It is no use arguing that a person should be proud of his race. It is no use arguing that person is a weaker person because he would rather be White than Coloured. Reality refutes all those arguments, because reality shows that 99 out of 100 borderline cases want to go over to the White side, the side where they, rightly or wrongly, think they will share in the rights and privileges of the Whites. It is no use our saying that is wrong. They want to do that and to the extent to which they will be thwarted by this measure, to that extent will they suffer. Hon members may say we talk too much about sufferings; like the hon. member for Heilbron who said that all laws caused suffering. But the interesting point is that under other laws it is the guilty person who suffers directly and if the innocent person suffers under the law, it is merely indirectly. This law, however, punishes the innocent directly and the guilty person gets away, and the punishment under this law is no light punishment.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because if you desire to be with the Whites and you have to remain with the Coloureds, it is a punishment which is inflicted upon you your whole life through. <span class="col_4663-4664" refersTo="page_0958"/>You cannot simply say that person has no pride of race. No, it goes much deeper than that. I was pleased to hear the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) say that this is a delicate matter. I find that peculiar because when we deal with the deepest emotions of the human being, hon. members opposite hurl emotions of a political nature across the floor of the House. An hon. member opposite gets up and says we want to do away with the colour bar. Have we no case? Do these people not suffer, and if we can prevent it surely it is our duty to do so? I think we have a good case. One hon. member said that the newspapers exaggerated this issue. Sir, for every story which appears in the newspapers there are 50 cases of suffering and sorrow which never appear. Those are the cases we are pleading for and if I can succeed in bringing one person from that No Man&#x2019;s Land to my side, I will do it because I regard this matter in the spirit enunciated by Dr. D. F. du Toit Malherbe in his book &#x201C;Drie-honderd Jaar van Nasiebou&#x201D;. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a few instances people are very upset and disappointed when they discover that centuries ago their ancestral mother was not completely White. On the other hand, some are afraid to delve too deeply into their family history. We did not have the strong colour consciousness and revulsion of miscegenation at that time which we have today, and the Dutch Church did not object to marry such couples, provided the bride had been Christened in the Church, had been confirmed and was of good character&#x2026; Nobody in South Africa should be worried about a drop of non-White blood&#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) started off by creating the impression that we are really establishing a blood register. We are not establishing a blood register. We are trying to evolve a legal mechanism to be used effectively in the application of our various Acts, in which we take notice of the race to which people belong. We have, as the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. S. F. Steyn) has said, various provisions which refer only to certain races, certain groups. We find now that the defintion which we had is defective and therefore we must improve it. If hon. members opposite want to say that this new definition will be ineffectual and that the old one was in fact effectual, then they must explain to us how it was possible under the old Act for a Chinese to be classified as White. We object to that obvious ineffectualness, and that is what we want to remedy by means of this definition. The question now is whether this remedy is a good one. If it is not good, hon. members opposite must tell us so. Now I want to put this question: If we are to accept this definition, which persons who should be classified as Whites will not be classified as Whites; or which persons who are not classified as Whites ought to have been classified as Whites? I have not yet heard the reply to that question.</p>

<p>A lot of stories have been told here, without mentioning names, to show that there is terrible suffering and injustice taking place in this country. I can only say that the Opposition actually has a basic objection to the population register. They object basically to the fact that we classify people. But they are not as honest as the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), who says: I want to know nothing about the population register; I think it is unnecessary and gives us bad publicity. But hon. members of the United Party would very much like to enjoy the benefits of the population register, but they do not want the population register itself. Actually they are opposed to the 1950 Act, but do not have the courage to propose that it be repealed. How many times have we not asked them to propose that Act be repealed? They have never done so. But when they get an opportunity, as at present, they tell us about all their objections to the Population Registration Act of 1950.</p>

<p>Why not? It could just as well have happened under the United Party, but it would not have been spoken about. No, the hon. members of the United Party do not want a legal mechanism by means of which the various racial groups can continue to live alongside each other.</p>

<p>The question arises whether this legal mechanism will be effective. Let us accept the fact&#x2014;and the people of South Africa as a whole accept it&#x2014;that we have four communities in this country who have existed and lived within the same political entity. We have the White community, we have the Brown community, or the Coloureds, as I learnt to know them; we have the Asiatic community, or the Yellow people, and we have the Black people. We have these four communities, each with its own set of values and its own opinions and prejudices, and we only give expression to that when we passed the Population Registration Act, because there are certain Acts which apply only to those belonging to one of these groups. If we bear that in mind when reading this definition, then a White person is one who by appearance obviously belongs to the White group and is not ordinarily at home in any of the other groups. That is the definition we had and it is an an intelligible definition and one which can be applied. Then we have the second: Someone who ordinarily passes for a White, i.e. who is generally considered as belonging to the White community, but who in appearance does not really belong there. What is wrong with that? Cannot we apply it as a legal mechanism? The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) says that this is a Bill which is bad in law and that it will be ineffective. That is just so much nonsense.</p>

<p>Let us analyse the arguments of the Opposition further. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) makes the statement that nobody has the right to be placed on the register. To that extent I agree with him. That is one of the defects in the Act, and therefore we now amend Section 12, because in terms of Section 12 any person, in respect of certain information received for the purpose of being registered, can be told to submit proof of the accuracy of such details. I will read the section, omitting all the unnecessary words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Director can direct any person in respect of whom any details&#x2026; have been received or supplied in any form prescribed by Section 9, to submit proof of the accuracy of any such details.</block>

<p>That is all. But there is a big defect, because details may be submitted to the Director which are obviously inaccurate. And what do we do now? In order to make that Act more effective, we now give that section two legs, namely (a) which I have just read out, and then (b) as contained in Clause 4, which will be the new Section 12&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Director may investigate or appoint someone to investigate and to report to him in regard to any matter in respect of which details must be noted in the register.</block>

<p>What is wrong with that? What is wrong with gathering more facts in respect of details already recorded or about to be recorded? That makes the Act so much more effective. Who can object if we say that additional information is to be collected for the consideration of the Director which the applicant himself may consider (perhaps it is in his favour); which the Board which makes the classification can use, and which the Court may use later? Hon. members should not think that when the Minister appoints somebody to collect information, that provision also provides that this official can weigh that information, accept it and make a classification accordingly. I simply cannot understand hon. members of the Opposition making use of every opportunity, when the racial difficulties of this country come to the fore as they do now, immediately to group themselves on the side of the enemies of South Africa, of the enemies of this classification.</p>

<p>But I want to expand further on this. The hon. member for Kempton Park said that this matter started with the article by Prof. Brookes in which he said that a frontal attack should not be made on the racial policy of this Government. But it goes much deeper, and what I am now going to say will reflect the Opposition in a light even worse than that in which they are already seen by the electorate. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) has already pointed out that it has clearly emerged from this debate that the Opposition wants to eliminate all dividing lines based on colour, and what is more, every time they are faced with a difficult situation they get a fright. When we want to remedy a difficult situation, they sneer. They try to run away when they should take a stand and tell us what to do in regard to this difficult position. By doing that they are only the minions of the enemies of South Africa. They will deny it, but that is so. As someone who faithfully and very carefully reads the foreign periodicals and brochures, I know there is the Anti-Slavery and Aborigine Society of London, <span class="col_4667-4668" refersTo="page_0960"/>which was established in 1815 and which tried to set free the slaves right throughout the British Empire. But in recent times they have not really done anything more, because they are afraid of going to those countries where slavery actually still exists. There are certain dangers involved. But they can come to South Africa, a state which is reasonably civilized, and quite safely point to certain things and even take snapshots, and say that this is slavery. That, according to the English Cypr&#x00E9;s doctrine, enables the Society to comply with the terms of its objects and provides the authority for spending the Society&#x2019;s money. They have accumulated a lot of money over more than a century, which they are now using for making attacks on the racial policy of South Africa. One aspect of that policy is the Population Registration Act.</p>

<p>I want to mention another society. There is the International League for the Rights of Man. Its object is to uphold the so-called elementary human rights in all countries where those rights are violated or are alleged to be violated. Then there is the Union of Democratic Control. These three organizations in 1948, just after the National Party came into power, sent a woman called Monica Winkley to South Africa. She wrote a report in which she said two things. The report appeared about 1952. She said that all the legislation dealing with racial matters should be combated, but in the way suggested later by Prof. Brookes. She was the authoress of the passive resistance movement we had in 1953. She was sent here by those three bodies.</p>

<p>Then there is the Congress of Peoples against Imperialism. They are the people who at the moment are waging the so-called anti-colonialism campaign. I do not know who the officebearers are. Then there is a fifth one, the National Council for Civil Liberties. The members of this body interest themselves particularly in sport for the non-White, and discrimination in sport. They started at the time with table tennis, in regard to which they succeeded in debarring us from the international sports association. Then there is a newfangled association, Racial Unity. That is the association of Canon Collins of St. Paul&#x2019;s fame, of whom we have all heard.</p>

<p>All these associations attacked the Population Registration Act after 1950. I continue. There is the Africa Bureau, an association which receives money from all kinds of sources.	It was established by Michael Scott, and it is this association which sends him to UNO. If we read the publications of those associations, in which they refer to South Africa, we find that they say that their strategic point of attack is on the Population Registration Act. Then there is the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Just see what a nice name it has! That body, which is supposed to preach the gospel, preaches a campaign against South Africa in various publications, and every time they come back to the Population Registration Act.</p>

<p>Then there is the Citizens&#x2019; Council for Human Rights. They concentrate particularly on sport, but it is an association which specially holds a protective hand over Ambrose Reeves. This association gave the advice that when they want to attack the population register they must try to get one individual after the other across the colour line. I do not know who discovered that they should make sworn statements, for example, to the effect that Mr. Song was a White man in order to get him classified on the population register. The advice was given that they should try to get one individual after another across the colour line, so that eventually it will become ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Opposition is talking the language of those people. They make the sneering remarks to which the others give publicity overseas. I want to mention another one. There is the Overseas League. I have seen only one pamphlet of theirs, and that was directed against the population register. Then there is another association of Canon Collins, Christian Action. In their latest publication, I am told, they did not attack the population register but the pass laws. I must tell hon. members of the Opposition that they will not be able to apply the pass laws either unless they have the Population Registration Act.</p>

<p>I refer, further, to the International Society for the Scientific Study of Race Relations. Mr. Speaker, these people are very clever. They know the Greek adage to the effect that one is as strong as the length of the arms of one&#x2019;s friends. They try to discuss the racial problem of South Africa in all kinds of ways, preferably inside South Africa. They try at all costs to hold a mixed meeting. That was the case with the World Council of Churches a few years ago, at which I was present. That was specially done so that South Africans could listen and become ashamed of themselves. And this invitation which I received in the post just to-day Conference on Human Relations and Communication To-day, is an affair arranged by the University of the Witwatersrand and by the S.A. Institute of Race Relations. I should like to know how many of these 12 associations are behind this movement. I am sure that not one of the people mentioned here know that they are being used as the tools of these various associations, and there are honoured names amongst them. They do not know what is behind this thing; they do not know that all these high-sounding words are meaningless and that their object is that we should become ashamed of ourselves.</p>

<p>They are the parliamentary front, but they do not even realize that they are the parliamentary front.

Therefore I can do only one thing, and that is to accuse them every time of being the greatest organized unpatriotic group in South Africa. [Laughter.] They may laugh, but they ought to ask themselves whether they are not prehaps just that. In April 1960 when the hon. member for Constantia made a speech here in which he said that he wanted to tell the world that his party dissociated itself from all the racial measures passed by this Government, I read it in the <i>London Times</i> and in the <i>News Chronicle.</i> It is in this regard that the Opposition simply does not keep in touch with the realities of to-day. If the hon. members for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) and Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) and Durban (North) wish to sell their country for a headline in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> to which I will not refer, or a headline in a London newspaper, they should just continue in the way they are doing now.

The many instances of human misery which have been referred to from this side of the House certainly have not assisted the position; they have done the opposite, and the hon. member has not attempted to refute one single instance that was quoted. I need not refer to all the instances that have been quoted; I will only refer to the instance referred to by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). Nothing has been said to refute the allegations of hardships and difficulties and tragedies that were caused in those cases. Instead of that the hon. member chose to fling around abuse rather freely.

<p>I will come back to the subject of debate and try to deal with the situation which has arisen as a result of the introduction of this amending Bill. Sir, the textbooks tell us that good government is the art of promoting human well-being. But here we are concerned with a measure in which the promotion of human well-being is to have no part. Indeed the direct opposite is likely to take place because Parliament is now being asked to introduce into the machinery of State a new race definition which must inevitably lead to human suffering and to distress amongst an untold number of individuals. I stress the word &#x201C;individuals&#x201D; because for more than a decade now this Government has been preoccupied&#x2014;perhaps I should use an even stronger word and say that it has been obsessed&#x2014;with legislating for racial groups. The concept being that the group comes first and that the individual takes a very poor second place. It is rigidity of race discrimination which has now become the rule. If anyone has any doubts about it, I think the speech of the hon. member for Kempton Park is a very clear indication of that. It becomes all too obvious that this rigidity has now become the essence of the Government&#x2019;s planning and it is also an indispensable political virtue in their eyes. That is why <i>ad hoc</i> legislation of this sort is now being introduced. As the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) has correctly pointed out, we are now concerned with <span class="col_4671-4672" refersTo="page_0962"/>passing legislation possibly arising from one single incident, and that is the incident of a certain Mr. Song. It is because of this rigidity which has now become the rule in race differentiation that the individual is once again being overlooked here. The hardships and any suffering that may be brought about to him must be ignored in the interests of the group.</p>

<p>Other speakers have referred to the fact that our Statute Book abounds with a bewildering variety of statutory race definitions. I do not want to pursue that line of argument, but I do want to point out that our law reports also abound with evidence of anomalies, complexities, and difficulties which confront the individual in practically every sphere of human activity to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the business of the House was interrupted I was explaining that in addition to the bewildering variety of statutory race definitions which have come onto the Statute Book, the law reports also abound with evidence of the anomalies and complexities and difficulties which confront the individual in practically every sphere of human activity. We certainly have reached the stage when individual life in South Africa has become circumscribed in one way or another from the cradle to the grave by racial definitions.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I accept your ruling. I think you will permit me to point out that an eminent legal man recently prescribed the position in these words: &#x201C;In South Africa the political, economic and social status of every individual is conditioned, if not predetermined, by his race&#x201D;. Sir, it is not only the political field that is affected; every field of human activity is affected; and now Parliament is being asked not to ameliorate the lot of the individual, but rather to make confusion worse confounded for him by the addition of this new elaborate definition of a &#x201C;White person&#x201D;. Paradoxically, the law with which we have lived longest and which is the very basis of our legal system, that is the Roman-Dutch Law, is completely colour blind. In that regard it is very much our common law to-day, because our modern statutory law is becoming more and more based on so-called race differentiations.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am trying to indicate why the amendment is being introduced. The reason is that we have now reached the stage when definitions must be more complex and more elaborate than previously, and therefore I say it is no wonder that we find on our Statute Book race definitions, and amended race definitions, and race definitions to amend amending race definitions. When the Population Registration Amendment Bill 71 of 1956 was introduced, the then Minister of the Interior (now the Minister of Finance) claimed that the race definition in the original Act would be the basis for all future Acts. I quote the exact words which he used (Hansard 1956, Vol. 92, Col. 7836)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want the definition in the Population Registration Act to be the basic definition for all other Acts.</block>

<p>Of course he was wrong, because the most essential of his basic definition is now being altered to tighten up race classification. It is likely not to be the last amendment, because the Government is quite intent on bringing shades of colour even into &#x201C;White&#x201D; and it is attempting therefore to define the indefineable.</p>

<p>Sir, the original Act, which this Bill is now amending, has also been described as the corner-stone of the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy. But suddenly a loophole in the law, or a crack in the cornerstone, has become noticeable to the hon. the Minister, and he has now set out to replace his predecessor&#x2019;s corner-stone by abandoning the definition which had been applied for 12 years.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the Minister is making too much of a song of this new crack in the corner-stone. Sir, bigger cracks have been discernable from this side of the House in the legislation all along. Now I will not make the point, Sir, which has been made by other members that the Bill does not contain provisions for the protection of persons who have already been classified. That point has been made. I merely want to indicate that those who have already battled their way through the entanglements of the law as it now stands, are now faced with a possible repetition of such attempts. What is now being revived is this 12 year old feeling of personal insecurity which the individual has had. No wonder therefore that a learned Judge some time ago said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The whole fabric of our society is now based on colour discrimination.</block>

<p>I come then to the point which I have often made in this House, namely, that in the interests of good government, it is better to <span class="col_4673-4674" refersTo="page_0963"/>have a law, even a bad law, which is certain than one which is subject to change. You see, Sir, perfection is not for man-made laws and even a casual glance through the Statute Book over the last 12 years would indicate the justification for saying that. But to reach certainty about the meaning and effect of a statute usually takes time. In this case we have had only 12 years. But more often than not it takes more than time, it also takes the wits of the lawyers, the ingenuity of the Judges and last, but not least, the cost of litigation to bring about the necessary certainty and to settle the meaning and effect of a statute. And as this Population Registration Act is such a law, many of the persons who have been affected by it, and who have paid dearly to get personal security and economic safety in terms of their race classification, as defined in the Act, will simply now be faced with the fact that all their costs and all their efforts and all their time was futile.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Under the law as it now stands&#x2014;I am referring to the hon. member for Kempton Park&#x2019;s (Mr. F. S. Steyn) argument&#x2014;membership of the White group is determined by two alternative criteria or tests. The one is &#x201C;obvious appearance as White&#x201D;, the other is &#x201C;general acceptance as White&#x201D;. The first criterion could only be overruled, as the law now stands, by evidence of general acceptance. The second criterion was irrefutable. The hon. member for Kempton Park is therefore wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But that is exactly what I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>He is wrong when he says that although the door is being narrowed there is only one alteration being made in the definition. That is not so. The effect of this change in future is that both these criteria &#x201C;obvious appearance as White&#x201D; and &#x201C;general acceptance as White&#x201D; can be overruled by evidence of an admission by the person concerned of Coloured descent. And the second effect of course is that in future the second criterion, that is &#x201C;general acceptance as White&#x201D;, will no longer be irrefutable, but can now be ruled out by evidence that the person concerned &#x201C;is not in appearance obviously not a White person&#x201D;. Sir, that phrase is certainly a masterpiece of legal drafting in the negative, and the clause as a whole has enough &#x201C;nots&#x201D; in it to-day to tie up even the most astute lawyer into knots&#x2014;this time you spell it with a &#x201C;k&#x201D;. But the general effect of the new definition is that the legal obstacles to anyone claiming membership of the White group will now be set higher. This surely will rank in history as the setting up of the golden image of &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; to appease the cult of the race.</p>

<p>I come then to the question what is probative significance of this word &#x201C;admits&#x201D;? In the last portion of the new definition we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;White person does not include any person who admits that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I ask the hon. the Minister whether a wink or a nod is to be regarded as evidence of &#x201C;admits&#x201D;. I ask that quite seriously because of the danger of this provision being there to eliminate the mass of borderline cases which exist. Because it is quite obvious that the whole force of this legislation is directed at the borderline case and it is in the borderline case that the hardships and the human distresses in the application of the law are to be found. Sir, I admit that the criterion of descent, the so-called blood test, has been tried in other statutory definitions. But the sufficiency of proof of the descent by evidence of an alleged admission is something entirely new. It is something I think very dangerously new and is easily subject to abuse. It is here where the door will be opened to the efforts of the vicious and vindictive person who wishes to revenge himself on the individual.</p>

<p>The husband does not make the admission.

If you therefore look at the practical effect of this&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>And therefore it should not be admissible. But it will be admissible <span class="col_4675-4676" refersTo="page_0964"/>in terms of the Act and the evidence will be dealt with by an administrative body, because that is precisely what the position is going to be. It is true that evidence of an admission by a litigant against his own interests is admissible in a case of civil litigation, but to have probative value the fact must be within the knowledge of the person concerned. The courts therefore will not lightly accept evidence of any such admission by a person against his own interests. They examine the position very carefully and evidence of that kind is not easily accepted. Also the rules of evidence provide the necessary safeguards to prevent any miscarriage of justice by a so-called admission. But here the safeguards which are applicable in a court are to have no place at all, and therefore I say that such a provision is dangerous and can be subject to abuse, unless adequate safeguards are introduced into the Population Registration Act itself.</p>

<p>I say therefore that it is important to prescribe in this Act to whom such an alleged admission is to be made, and what form that admission is to take. I say that it is equally important to know at what stage of the proceedings of race classification such an alleged admission is to become evidence, and how evidence of that nature is to be recorded in the official documents of the Department. These are practical aspects. I have got away from the so-called emotional side. These are the practical aspects of this new rule in the long history of race discrimination which we have to examine. I hope the hon. the Minister will state quite categorically how this new rule is to be applied. Therefore I want to ask quite categorically these four questions: (a)	To whom such admission is to be made; (b) what form the admission is to take; (c) at what stage of the proceedings it is to become accepted as proof of the fact; and (d) how is the admission to be recorded in the official records?</p>

<p>This change in the definition of &#x201C;White person&#x201D; makes the need for having safeguards in this legislation greater than ever before, because without safeguards there can be no security for anyone. The hon. the Minister is opening the door for possible abuse and leaving the individual practically unprotected against the unscrupulous informer. Once an alleged admission of descent from a Native or a Coloured person is recorded, it obviously will stand. How, I ask the hon. the Minister, once it is recorded, how can it be undone, if in fact it is completely unfounded and untrue?</p>

<p>How does one set about disproving an alleged admission? You cannot prove the negative. This does raise a very serious and practical problem connected with that portion of the definition which is governed by the &#x201C;admits&#x201D;. It is quite obvious therefore that an added complication is now to be found in this new provision that a &#x201C;White person&#x201D;, &#x201C;does not include a person who admits that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person&#x201D;. How is the test going to be applied in practice? And how is the individual to know what the legal definition of &#x201C;descent&#x201D; is before he makes an admission of this nature?</p>

<p>I said that our law reports abound with examples of hardships and difficulties that confront the individual in matters of this kind. Let me just refer to two such examples. The expressions of &#x201C;White by descent&#x201D; or &#x201C;Native by descent&#x201D; have been settled by the courts as meaning that both parents must be White and both parents must be Native. But the court has left unanswered the vexed question as to what degree of colour admixture would render the person otherwise White as non-White, or a person otherwise Native as non-Native. The juridical complications and difficulties presented by race admixture in South Africa are well expressed in a passage from the judgment in the case of Rex V. Radeb delivered in 1945 in the Appellate Division, which I shall quote. In that case the court, in trying to apply the test of descent in respect of the son of an Indian father and an African mother, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No doubt scientifically there may be more inherited characteristics of the one parent than the other in any child&#x2019;s makeup, but in the present stage of our knowledge, no accuracy in these matters is possible. Certainly mere external appearance would not furnish a guide to the extent of the respective parental contribution. The only practical approach is to assume that the contributions are equal and that is habitually being done. That being so, I do not think that it is either logical or in accordance with the ordinary use of language to describe a person who is half-Native and half-Indian as a &#x201C;Native by descent&#x201D;. Where the cross is between a Native or African and a European, we commonly employ the term &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;, though &#x201C;euro-African&#x201D; might be more accurate. A cross between a Native and an Indian would perhaps not ordinarily be called &#x201C;a Coloured man&#x201D;. The correct term would be perhaps &#x201C;Indo-African&#x201D;. But whether or not, there is a word in common use to describe the third applicant from the standpoint of his racial composition, this cannot alter the fact that he is, according to his descent, neither an Indian nor a Native. It is not necessary to discuss the application of this or other definitions of different degrees of so-called blood mixture.</block>

<p>This is complicated enough in all conscience; complicated certainly for the litigant who will usually be reluctant to take action in the matter and complicated enough for the court which has to decide and interpret and determine the meaning of these racial definitions. The position of course is now being made more complicated, because by legislation the effect is now this: the natural race grouping, which this court was dealing with, is now being <span class="col_4677-4678" refersTo="page_0965"/>replaced by statutory race grouping, and the courts in determining the position in future will have to have regard to the statutory arranged groupings that is now taking place, because a Coloured person is now also defined. It is true that it is an entirely negative definition by saying &#x201C;a Coloured person is one who is neither a White nor a Native&#x201D;. But the fact is that a Coloured racial group is now being established by law and therefore it behoves the hon. the Minister to be quite specific as to what is to be the meaning of &#x201C;descent&#x201D; when it does not affect what the courts have already settled &#x201C;White by descent&#x201D; or a &#x201C;Native by descent Persons in the new statutory group are the individuals who are going to be affected by this legislation and it behoves the hon. the Minister, I think, to be quite clear and specific about this position and to be quite clear as to how the term itself is going to be defined. Because unless the word &#x201C;descent&#x201D; is defined and unless the person who is alleged to have made an admission of colour descent knows what &#x201C;descent&#x201D; is, I say that any admission of that nature should be ruled out as being entirely valueless.</p>

<p>Sir, this bit of legislation I can only describe, as I have already done, as the golden image of &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; to appease the cult of the race, and it is likely that very soon it will have to be recast in some way by a further definition, certainly a definition of &#x201C;descent&#x201D;.

<p>Order! Before calling on the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel), I want to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that a very wide and protracted discussion has taken place and hon. members should now confine themselves strictly to matters relevant to the Bill under discussion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) has put four questions to the hon. the Minister. The first was in connection with the admission in regard to descent. He asked, &#x201C;To whom must that admission be made?&#x201D; But it is surely obvious that it must be made to the body investigating the matter. He asked what form it should take. I do not know what the hon. member means by that. It can be in writing or it can be made verbally, so long as it is an admission. Then the hon. member asks at what stage it should be made. Surely at the beginning of the investigation, if possible. I do not know at what stage the hon. member would like to have it. And then he asks how it is to be recorded? I do not know what he means there either. It must just be written down, or typed. I do not know of any other way in which it can be recorded. Surely that is the only way in which it can be done. The hon. member referred here to the Appellate Division case of Ghabebe in 1945. I also know that case, but he did not actually say why he quoted that case, because he proved nothing by it. I will come to the point later. That was a judgment by Judge Schreiner, and we know what Judge Schreiner&#x2019;s attitude is in regard to questions of colour.</p>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I then come to what was said by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan). He mentioned some very pathetic cases this afternoon. The one case was that of a person who can be regarded as a Coloured in the Cape, whereas his brother in the Transvaal can be regarded as a White man.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, that was not the case as I put it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member has such a pathetic case, I shall be glad if he will mention that specific case, so that the hon. the Minister can investigate it. The hon. member&#x2019;s whole speech consisted of &#x201C;It may happen&#x201D;, &#x201C;It can happen&#x201D;, &#x201C;It could happen&#x201D;. He just gave hypothetical cases of what might possibly happen, but did not mention a single specific case which could be investigated by the Department or the Minister. But he said that this legislation casts a stigma on 600,000,000 Chinese. Here I must agree with the hon. member for Kempton Park, because the hon. member says that through the case of this one Chinese we are casting a stigma on 600,000,000 Chinese. Who are these 600,000,000 Chinese? The Chinese in Red China? In other words, does the hon. member by means of this Bill want to satisfy the communist Chinese in Red China? But why should we not satisfy the Natives of Africa? Then we must surely also introduce legislation to satisfy the 200,000,000 Natives in Africa. Then all the discriminatory legislation must be repealed in order to satisfy the 200,000,000 Natives in Africa, according to the argument of the hon. member for Orange Grove.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman). He argued here that most of the Coloureds in South Africa bear Afrikaans or English names, and therefore the Afrikaners or the English must be responsible for their existence. The hon. member does not know South Africa. Many of the Coloureds, the majority of them, who grew up and lived with the White farmers took over <span class="col_4679-4680" refersTo="page_0966"/>the names of those people, without any stigma being attached to it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>There are many by the name of Cadman.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>He also said that the Minister of Information would now have to explain this legislation to the world, and he asked how he would be able to do so, in view of the fact that he himself in 1950 spoke against this legislation. In 1950, yes. Will the hon. member tell me whether they will repeal this legislation if they come into power? Will they repeal it? I am prepared to give the assurance to-night to this House that this legislation will never be repealed by the United Party if they should come into power, because if when they have to fight an election they say that they are going to repeal it, they will not come into power in any case.</p>

<p>hon. member further said: What does one Chinese matter; what does it matter if one Chinese is taken up into the White group? But that is the beginning. This was a test to see how far they could get past the law, and they thoroughly succeeded in doing so, and therefore the Minister had to introduce this Bill. I will pause to deal with what the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) said. He said that public opinion had always determined it. But we have definitions of &#x201C;Native&#x201D; in our Statute Book. Does he want us to remove those definitions, too? Surely that did not come about through public opinion? It was legislation passed by the United Party and by the National Party which embodied those definitions. He also admits that there were cases of hardship, but in this case he does not want to accept it. He goes further and says that a penalty is now being introduced by this Bill. What penalty? Is it a punishment to be a Coloured or to belong to one&#x2019;s own group? It is no punishment. Is it a punishment to be a White? It is no punishment. Or is it a punishment to be an Indian? It is no punishment. I just want to make a comparison and I say that the legislation which will be adopted now and the 1950 Act are really pieces of legislation which are less drastic than any previous legislation. You will remember, Sir, that in the begnining our legistion was based on &#x201C;descent&#x201D;. Then the courts, because it was so drastic, introduced &#x201C;preponderance of blood&#x201D;, and it was this Government which in 1950 framed this definition under the Immorality Act and the Mixed Marriages Act, and provided a different definition which was less strict.</p>

<p>I just want to show how strict the old definition of &#x201C;descent&#x201D; was. What is the provision in regard to the admission of children in Natal? I think that definition still exists to-day. Hon. members asked to-day in regard to this Bill what would happen to the children. They alleged that they would not be admitted to the schools. But now I want to show how drastic the requirements were in Natal. The requirement there was, and I think still is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A teacher is satisfied by the parents or guardian that a child is of pure European ancestry for three generations on both sides</block>

<p>In other words, before a child is admitted to a White school there, the school must be satisfied that child has been of White ancestry for three generations on both sides. Sir, note that this is the position in Natal. In this regard I wish to refer to the case of Seneque v. Natal Provincial Council (1939, N.P.D. 271). The judgment in that case has never been upset, and consequently that requirement still stands to-day. For the purposes of my argument it does not matter, in any case, whether it still stands. The point is that is did exist, namely that the child should be of pure European ancestry for three generations on both sides. It reads, further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The onus of proof of European ancestry shall be with the parents or guardian.</block>

<p>The Judge who gave this judgment was Feetham, J. We know him&#x2014;he was one of Lord Milner&#x2019;s kindergarten.</p>

<p>Sir, I am only trying to show that the definition in this Bill is less drastic than the definition contained in other statutes and ordinances passed by the United Party.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the emphasis laid on the so-called hardships. Just listen to what Judge Feetham said about hardships&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is no doubt true that serious hardships may be caused to a person in the position of the applicant by the exclusion of his child from school, but under conditions existing in South Africa such hardships are unavoidable.</block>

<p>He says it is unavoidable. It simply does not upset him in any way. He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The classification of schools on the basis of racial segregation involves the necessity of making difficult decisions in individual cases. There is always the risk of mistakes being made and differences of opinion are bound to arise.</block>

<p>That is what he said, and that is what hon. members opposite accepted without any protest.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<p>Does the hon. member suggest that when that judgment was given there was a population register?</p>

<p>No, there was no register, <span class="col_4681-4682" refersTo="page_0967"/> but the hon. member obviously does not understand my argument. My argument is that the amendment now proposed by the Minister is much less drastic than any definition which already existed in statutes or ordinances. Hon. members therefore cannot squeal about this definition. This is child&#x2019;s play compared with other definitions.</p>

<p>What about the present definition?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment now proposed by the Minister is less drastic even than the present definition. In that regard I will have no qualms of conscience. Hon. members now talk about descent. What is descent really? There is no reference here to descent having to be proved. All the Bill provides is that a person must admit that by descent he is not a Native or a Coloured. It is therefore not necessary for the Minister, or for anyone else, to prove descent. All that is required is that the person concerned must admit it, and only then does it become relevant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>How must he admit it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Surely that is simple. He must simply get up and say whether he is a Coloured or a White man. I cannot see what difficulty the hon. member has in this regard. The person must get up before the Board and say that he cannot be classified as a Coloured because he is a White man, or <i>vice versa.</i> It is true that the Minister is now proposing an amendment to investigate whether he is telling a lie or not, but nevertheless that is the only way in which a person can admit what he is. That is the only interpretation that can be attached to it, and if the hon. member wants to put a different interpretation on it it will be an impracticable one. I admit that these are matters which can be very important to certain persons. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) quoted decided cases here and I also want to refer to one, viz. the case of Moller v. the Keimoes School Board. In this case there was reference to &#x201C;European extraction&#x201D;, and the hon. members who are lawyers will remember it. The children involved in the case were not allowed in the White school because they had 15 per cent Coloured blood. But still I consider that under the proposed definition it is quite possible that those children will be allowed into the White school, in spite of the fact that they have 15 per cent Coloured blood. I therefore want to repeat what I said before, that this definition is much less drastic than any other one in the Statute Book. And still the United Party is opposed to it. Why? Simply because they do not understand it, and because they are against race classification. That is the whole reason for their opposition to this Bill. Lawyers on the side of the United Party know as well as I do that this is a much less drastic definition, but just because they are opposed to population registration they are now opposed to this Bill also.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member who made the interjection is one of the less liberal members of the United Party, and I predict that the day the United Party decides to repeal this legislation he will leave the caucus. As things are, he is just sitting on the edge of the caucus!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for the reasons I have mentioned I can vote for this Bill with a clear conscience, and if it is compared with the definitions used in the past the United Party has no leg to stand on.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the Government is intent on introducing a definition of a White man which will stand the test for all time and at the same time interpret the definition of the population register, then it is inevitable that the hon. the Minister will be called upon to amend the original definition. That I think can be accepted as inevitable. &#x201C;Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive&#x201D;! Whom did we practise to deceive, Mr. Speaker? Simply ourselves. We deceived ourselves into believing that it was possible to define a White man by means of a definition of this kind. We imagine that we are the direct descendants of the Caucasian race, a race which is acknowledged by all ethnologists as being the White race of history. But we do not belong to those people since we are, all of us, the products of a fusion of races. It is, consequently, exceedingly difficult for anyone to give a definition of a White man to-day in the general sense of the term. Our particular definition will be in accordance with the South African interpretation of what is meant by a White man, and even that varies from man to man, from province to province, and from city to city.</p>

<p>I should now like to say something about what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) had to say about the Coloured people. He referred to the Natal test for a White child, while the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) made a similar reference to the admission of children in the Transvaal schools. I should like to quote an example in this respect which falls within my own personal experience&#x2014;the example of a typical three-teacher school in the Transvaal when I was an inspector of schools. In this particular school there were three children who were darker than the others. During the interval I asked the principal who these children were and where they came from. He thereupon told me their story. From that it appeared that of their four grandparents, one was Black&#x2014;a Native and not a Coloured&#x2014;while three were White. These children were, therefore, three White quadroons. I asked <span class="col_4683-4684" refersTo="page_0968"/>the principal what the school committee had done about the matter, to which he replied that nothing had been done as the school committee accepted these children as being part of the community. When I asked him whether he had told them what the interpretation of the law was, he said he had. They, however, said that these children were accepted because their history was known. These children, in other words, will satisfy the definition of &#x201C;White&#x201D; in the present law because they will be accepted as such by the community. I asked the principal what the reaction of the other children was to them. He replied that these three children were amongst the most popular children in his school. Finally I asked him what they were like in so far as intellectual capabilities were concerned and he replied that they were standing very high in their classes. Now, Sir, this is an humane approach. Under the definition in the present Bill they will, of course, be disqualified on the grounds of descent because everybody knows what their descent is.</p>

<p>But children will never be asked! They are minors. When a child goes to school, he is never asked what his descent is! Are hon. members on the other side suggesting that a child of five years of age should be asked to say what his descent is? [Interjections.] In regard to the position in Natal to which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) referred, I understand the ordinance provides that if the child&#x2019;s father served in a White regiment, or if his father&#x2019;s brother served in a White regiment, it will be a guarantee that child is White. If the hon. the Minister of Defence had been here, I am sure he would have supported me in this. The hon. member also ridiculed the suggestion that it was a &#x201C;straf&#x201D; to be a Coloured. In this connection, the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) stated the other day during this debate that there was such a thing as pride of race. That is so, Mr. Speaker. If, however, the present position were reversed and the law made provision only for Coloured men to sit in this Parliament; that only Coloured men could go to the Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch; that only Coloured children could be privileged in schools; and that job reservation would operate only in favour of Coloureds, then we would all be trying not for White, but for Coloured!</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>We were told that it was the case of a Chinese which brought about this legislation. I do not know whether hon. members have already been to Northern China. The Chinese are not one race and do not all look alike. On the contrary, the Chinese from Northern China, on the border of Manchukuo, are, one can almost say, tall White men. They will pass for White men. When we speak of the Chinese, we should not be deceived into thinking that the Southern Chinese are typical of all Chinese and we cannot, therefore, generalize as hon. members have been generalizing in this debate.</p>

<p>I should now like to say something about the remarks made by the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze). I want to say, first of all, that I regret very much the remarks he made about the circular we received in connection with the proposed conference on human relations. Whatever the differences of outlook between us in South Africa and whatever differences there might be between us in regard to the desirability of this conference&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The patrons of this conference are people of importance in South Africa, and I do not think it does credit to this House if they are referred to in the manber in which it was done by the hon. member. I should like now to come to the Bill as I see it and as I should like to interpret it. The proposed definition stipulates that a White person is a person who, <i>inter alia,</i> is in appearance obviously a White person. Obviously to whom? To the official who is visiting him under Clause 4? Or to a Select Committee of this House? Or to the Minister? When I walk through the streets of Cape Town I can see quite a number of people who are not obviously White, or who are not obviously Coloured. &#x201C;Obviously&#x201D; should, therefore, be defined more closely. The requirement &#x201C;in appearance obviously a White person&#x201D; is exceedingly difficult to define. I do not think you can take 100 people from the streets of Cape Town and say that they are obviously White or obviously Coloured. A further stipulation in Clause 1 (a) of the Bill is that a White person is a person who &#x201C;is not generally accepted as a Coloured person&#x201D;. Again I want to ask &#x201C;generally accepted by whom&#x201D;? By South Africans? And if so, do we mean South Africans in Cape Town, in Johannesburg or in Durban? I say this because the code in Cape Town is quite different from the code applicable in Johannesburg and a man who will be classified as being Coloured in Cape Town, might escape that classification in Johannesburg. Quite apart from general acceptance, the Capetonians would know the man&#x2019;s family. That is a factor<span class="col_4685-4686" refersTo="page_0969"/> which does not operate to the same extent in the Transvaal. In Clause 1 (b) it is stated that a White person is a person who &#x201C;is generally accepted as a White person&#x201D;. Generally accepted by whom? Do we mean generally accepted by his immediate community? What is his community and where is he accepted? The same criticism applies to the second portion of Clause 1 (b). That brings me to the question of descent. How far does this go back? How many members of this House, for instance, know the maiden names of their maternal grandmothers? Many cannot tell us their names and if you go even further back, even fewer can tell. In other words, unless we have a genealogical tree so that we can trace our ancestors, it will be quite impossible to comply with this provision. The hon. member for Standerton also referred to the effect of what we say here on world opinion. But, Sir, the effect of this Bill on world opinion is impossible to calculate!</p>

<p>We who have listened to this debate must come to the conclusion that the Opposition has not succeeded in doing what they are supposed to do, viz. to prove that this amending Bill is not necessary in order to implement an already existing Act. On the contrary, the Opposition has all the time been attacking a different Act. As far as this side of the House is concerned, we accept it as our duty to convince the House of the necessity for this amending Bill. We need not go far to do so&#x2014;many examples are at hand. I want to mention only one of them, which comes from the constituency I have the honour to represent. There we have a number of families who throughout the years have been known as non-Whites; they have never mixed with the Whites, and never put their children into White schools. For all the years they have been classified as non-Whites. On the basis of their membership of the N.G. Kerk they, however, claimed to be Whites, and as the result of that association they were in fact later classified as Whites. That created a problem for us.</p>

<p>There was no appeal and therefore I infer from that no such statements were made. I think it was quite a normal case which went through without people being aware of it. When we opened our eyes we were landed with a problem. Reference has been made here to hardships and problems as a result of this legislation. Now we are landed with the problem in my constituency that the children of the group of people to whom I referred have in the meantime reached school-going age, and now the question arises as to which schools they should attend. Because we are being accused left and right of over-sensitiveness and awareness of colour, I want to appeal to the hon. member for Kensington, who is a person with much experience of education, to try to get these children accepted in Bishops, St. Cyprian&#x2019;s or St. George&#x2019;s Grammar School! It must be remembered that this problem was created there because the existing legislation contained loopholes, and these people made use of them and forced themselves on to another group. It creates an unfortunate problem not only for us as a White community there, but also for the children of these people. These children are going to have a very hard time at school. In view of these difficulties, it is a good thing that the hon. the Minister has now introduced an amending Bill to close the loopholes in the Act. This Act embodies our traditional policy and has the approval of the voters. It is therefore the duty of the Government to give expression to it. Therefore if there are loopholes in the Act they must be closed, and that is what we are doing. When we are now reproached because this Act causes hardship, I will not deny that sometimes hardship may be experienced to some extent. That is, however, the natural consequence in a multi-racial country where there has to be demarcation. We have already made this demarcation to a large extent. Now people like this, however, come and create a new form of apartheid&#x2014;a new demarcation, because people are transferred in an artificial manner to another group. I wonder whether the Opposition thinks that they are rendering these people a service by adopting this attitude. In fact, they are only rendering those people a disservice, and if we approve of it we are not only rendering a disservice to ourselves, but also to the generations to come. Therefore I make bold to say that this amending Bill has become very necessary, in my opinion, and that is why this side of the House fully supports the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to deal <span class="col_4687-4688" refersTo="page_0970"/>briefly with the official snooping into a person&#x2019;s descent that may take place in terms of this amending Bill and, secondly, with the amendment moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and in connection with the latter I want to mention a few reasons why I believe that this is not the appropriate time for the passing of this Bill. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) asked the Opposition in whose interests they were opposing this Bill. My reply to that is simply that it is in the interests of ordinary humanity. And if the hon. member cannot understand that humanity also enters into politics, he should go and make a study of the things that underlie Western Christian civilization. He went on to say that in opposing this measure the Opposition were serving the cause of international Communism. Sir, I would not have replied to such an allegation but for the fact that it comes from such a strange quarter. The fact of the matter, however, is that it is this very Government that causes the West the greatest embarrassment in the latter&#x2019;s struggle against Communism. In point of fact it is the deeds committed by this Government in the name of the White man which are making the position of the White man so difficult every where in Africa, and indeed it is in the interests of the struggle against Communism that a halt should be called to legislation of this kind which is passed in the name of the White man. Ever since South Africa has existed, we have always had a traditional form of race classification. In our private lives and in the administration of State affairs we have used different ways to distinguish between the races without a Population Registration Act and without a system of general compulsory classification. I want to mention just one example. There was a time when the Coloureds and the Natives voted together with the Whites, but their names were printed in a separate section on the voters&#x2019; rolls, where a clear distinction was drawn between Coloured and Native voters and White voters. But that was done without a Population Registration Act, without snooping into a man&#x2019;s descent and without a general system of caste classification. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I mention it only by way of introduction. This distinction was drawn in a perfectly natural way, whenever that distinction was necessary, but no more than that was ever done, this system worked as satisfactorily as it is possible for any system to work in a multi-racial country, the reason being that the element of legal compulsion, of inflexibility and of unreasonableness, which always goes hand in hand with legal compulsion in matters of this nature, was absent. Race and descent were important factors and will perhaps remain important in South Africa, but they were never the subject of political idolatry. [Interjection.] The relationship between White and non-White found its natural level in a peaceful way and the life of this country was based on a natural sorting-out process which in turn was based on a sensitive and observant White public opinion which, in the words of the hon. the Minister himself, has always been the best determining factor in dealing with race relations. The difficulties which face the Minister to-day and which will face us year after year in the future, all derive from the fact that the Government departed, and is again departing now, from our traditional policy and from the traditional way of handling race relations.

<p>I say that nobody expected the Government to come forward with an amendment of the main principle, because it is difficult for a Government, once it has accepted a principle and entrenched in legislation, to withdraw it again. But what absolutely amazes one is to find that in these particularly difficult times that South Africa is going through, the Government amends the existing position, however unfortunate it may be, in a way which again lays bare to the world this whole repugnant conception of compulsory caste classification, and whenever it looks as though we are achieving some measure of peace and quiet in South Africa, the Government comes along with legislation which stirs up the whole country again.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment reads that this measure should not be allowed to go through. May I explain why it should not be allowed to go through? My whole argument is that the time is inopportune. [Interjections.] An amendment has been moved which amounts to the rejection of this Bill. I support the amendment and I say at this time when we are being attacked from outside this is the wrong time for the Government to come along with a Bill of this kind. [Interjections.] In the face of everything that South Africa is experiencing to-day, the Government comes along and again provides world news against South Africa and breaks down whatever goodwill has been built up for us in recent times by certain circles. I want to ask the Minister whether he realizes what harm this measure is doing to South Africa? Does he realize the great harm that is being done to our name by the speeches of his colleagues and by the whole spirit of contempt that these speeches radiate in respect of people who through no fault of their own are not of White descent? [Interjection.] I ask the Minister how many cases on a par with those of Singh and Song are likely to occur; and even if there were a few hundred, does he really think that will affect the position of the White man and the course of history in South Africa so drastically that it is necessary to come along with this type of legislation at this stage? The Minister has given the assurance that the new rules introduced by him will be applied in a humane way, but every time the Minister says that, he admits by implication that the amendment itself is inhumane. [Interjections.] How can human principles be applied if the process which the Bill introduces in fact creates cruel (&#x201C;onmenslike&#x201D;) situations? I have repeatedly had evidence of the unnecessary mental cruelty that this sort of legislation inflicts. I had a practical case recently where a women, completely broken down, asked me to visit her house, a neat house in a White suburb. Their I found a family in a state of feverish anxiety because their classification had been questioned. The wife is unquestionably White in colour and by descent; the husband is unquestionably White in appearance. He is employed as a White person, is married to a White woman, lives in a White residential area and is accepted by everybody as a White person, and he has two young daughters who are White in every respect. This family is an ordinary attractive White family like tens of thousands of other White families in South Africa. But at some time or another one of the forefathers of this man indicated in an official document that he was of mixed descent. The family admitted this to me. The fear, the anxiety of that family, their concern about their children, is something which I should not like to witness again. This happened not so long ago. It is quite possible even that this case may still be under consideration. These people have everything at stake&#x2014;their house, their employment, their social status and, most important of all, their children. There are thousands of similar cases throughout the country which have been left entirely to the mercy of a State machine which has made an idol of its colour policy.</p>

<p>If that is how you feel, I shall naturally obey you. According to the amendment before us, in terms of which descent must be taken into consideration, the person whom I have mentioned, if he is pressed to admit&#x2026; [Interjections.] But he will be asked. What else does it mean? When will a person admit his descent? When he is asked by an official. Strictly speaking, this individual is a White person in appearance and by acceptance and his children are Whites. But under the new provision, if he is asked about his descent, he will be in trouble immediately, and strictly speaking he is not a White person in spite of the fact that he is obviously White and in spite of the fact that the circumstances under which he lives are those of a White person. And this is not the only case that I have had. I cannot help saying that I feel that there is something mean, to put it mildly, in legislation of this kind. My attitude is that 300 years of experience in this country has taught us that it is unnecessary to introduce this sort of provision into our legislation, because inevitably it must lead to an inquisition, to an inquiry into the man&#x2019;s descent. There are <span class="col_4691-4692" refersTo="page_0972"/>speakers on that side who made promises on election platforms to the voters in my presence that the Government would never introduce the question of a person&#x2019;s descent in determining his classification.

<p>I cannot discuss the original Act, but at the time of its introduction very great concern was expressed in South West Africa that people&#x2019;s descent would be gone into, and the hon. member over there repeatedly told people at meetings in my presence that descent would play no role in this matter, and he knows that is true. [Interjections.] I say that in my opinion the hon. the Minister gave the best answer as to what we ought to do instead of this amendment that he wants to introduce. He said that there was no better yardstick then the verdict of White public opinion. He said that White public opinion was still the best judge, and he concluded by saying that with few exceptions, this approach had always produced the best results. That is absolutely true, but now the Minister talks against himself and his words quarrel with his deeds. He himself gave the best answer as to the way in which this sort of thing ought to be regulated, instead of making the existing legislation more far-reaching and more disruptive. I believe that the best thing that we can do, if the Minister cannot do away with the original Act, is not to depart any further from what has always been the traditional policy in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition brilliantly stated the attitude of the Opposition as a whole to this Bill. I subscribe to his arguments and support his amendment. Finally, I just want to repeat one question to the Minister, and I put it for this reason that the first person who replied to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was a member from South West Africa. That hon. member defended this measure, he and his South West colleagues want it, but I cannot think that hon. members would be so politically immoral as to help to force upon the Republic something which they do not want for themselves in South West Africa. [Interjection.] Let me put this direct question: Is this official inquisition into a person&#x2019;s descent also going to be introduced in South West Africa? If not, why not?

<p>Mr. Speaker, when you are dealing with a measure such as this which touches the very dignity of every citizen of the country, perhaps it is as well in this closing stage of the debate to examine some of the arguments in support of this measure that we have had from hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>Order! I think every argument from the Government side has been thoroughly canvassed.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>If you will permit me to take my point a little further, there are certain aspects of the arguments with which I wish to deal, which in my submission have not yet been dealt with adequately. There were roughly four main arguments presented by<span class="col_4693-4694" refersTo="page_0973"/> hon. members opposite and I am not going to deal with all four of them, but I wish to deal with some hon. members in particular.</p>

<p>The first argument in support of this measure amounted to pleas of sweet reasonableness in the application of this measure, should it become law, to the Minister. There was the request for consideration and leniency in its application. That in itself is an admission that the measure, to a large number of our citizens, will be unacceptable. Then we had the second category or arguments of hon. members of the legal fraternity, who dismissed the legislation purely as a juridical mechanical set-up to outline the racial barriers that exist in our country, such arguments as those of the hon. members for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) and Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser). Then we have those hon. members who look upon this legislation as nothing more than an amendment to the consitution of the Cattle-bredders&#x2019; Association, such as the arguments presented by the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse). Then we come to those hon. members who were placed in the very difficult position in defending this measure in that they had to quieten their own political consciences, such as the arguments of the vociferous member for Vereeniging (Mr. B.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>We take the attitude that the amendments proposed by the Minister are not matters which can be lightly dismissed, and the effect they will have on the people is precisely the argument used by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort at the time the Act was introduced.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister stated that it was no disgrace to be a Coloured or a Native, and it was not a disgrace to any White man to recognize his group responsibility within this multi-racial society. I hope the Minister will permit me to add this, that nor is it a disgrace to admit that you are a human being, and when you get measures of this nature, which affects the people to whom the Minister made reference in his speech, then the measure itself becomes obnoxious and justifies the amendment moved by this side of the House that the Bill he read this day six months. It is a disgrace to belong to a Coloured group, and as for acceptance, having worked with this Act for the past 12 years, a man is not only admitted to the White group by virtue of his appearance, but in our multi-racial society it has become the acceptance of a man in a higher civilized society and his ability to enjoy greater privileges, and without a doubt the amendment proposed here will shut out that class of person to whom the White group in South Africa has been able to grant a privilege. May I put this to the hon. the Minister. There has been a great deal said about the Chinese community in the course of this debate and the Minister gave as one of the main reasons for the introduction of this legislation the case of David Song, who was accepted by the White group as a White person in terms of the original classification. The Minister has argued that because he is of Chinese origin, he cannot be accepted in the White group. I want to tell the House and the Minister that the acceptance of David Song as a member of the White group was done on the Minister&#x2019;s own personal assurance. It was a personal assurance given by this Minister to the Chinese community of South Africa that if any member of the Chinese community was accepted by the White people he could be accepted as a White person.</p>

<p>Does the Minister deny it? You see, Sir. I was approached as a Member of Parliament by the Chinese community on the Rand and they represented to me the difficulties they were experiencing in respect of their race classification, and asked me whether it was not possible to obtain from the Government and the Minister some <span class="col_4695-4696" refersTo="page_0974"/>clarification of their position in our community, and I undertook to raise the matter in this House on the appropriate occasion, and I did so in 1960. The Minister may recall it. I raised the issue with the Minister and asked him to give a clear statement of Governmental policy as to what would be the position of the Chinese community in our country, of South Africans of Chinese origin, if they were accepted by the White community as their equals. Now let me tell the House and the country what the Minister has to say on that occasion. I quote from Hansard, Vol. 108&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) talked about the Chinese. The principle on which the whole of the Population Register is based is the principle of acceptance. People are not classified into different nationalities on the basis that they belong to a certain race. They are classified on this principle: Which group of the community accepts them?

What is that assurance worth in the light of the assurances given to the Chinese community? But more than that, the Minister seeks to introduce a measure now where the White man should be proud of his group and of his position, but here was one White man, myself, approached by the non-White group, who raised the matter in the highest Legislative body of the country, and when the Chinese community of Johannesburg came to me at the end of the session and asked what the Minister had said, I said: You need have no fears at all; the White community of South Africa is a civilized community and you can accept the word of the Minister. You can accept the word of a Minister, if one Chinaman is accepted in this community of Turffontein by the White community as a White person, I will sign an affidavit for him.

<p>If a Minister of a Government which seeks to maintain the White superiority in our country, what is that White superiority worth if a minority group cannot even accept the word of that Minister? This Nationalist Party Government has created such an inferiority complex amongst the Whites that we have to resort to measures of this nature to ensure that we will remain White, which, as the hon. the Minister has stated, is the main objective of this measure. What difference does it make, in the words of the Minister, if we did recognize the entire Chinese community of South Africa? Will they sabotage our position? Are they not as civilized as we are? If they are accepted in a White community and enjoy all the privileges which that community enjoy, what difference will it make? Will it undermine our position as Whites? Will it make us any weaker?

[Interjections.] I can only say that we have reached a position where, because of the inferiority complex which hon. members opposite have created amongst the Whites of this country, we have to come forward with a measure of this nature in order to maintain our position as White men in this country. Relate this position to any other group of people on the African Continent and to any other group within our own community. In what respect can it be expected that the White racial group of our country will be carried away as far as the other minority groups are concerned? If a South African citizen of Chinese origin wishes to cross the colour line because of the additional privileges he will enjoy as a member of the White group&#x2014;because we as a White group enjoy greater privileges&#x2014;is he to be blamed?</p>

<p>Of course I believe in the colour barrier. I have greater faith in my own group, I have greater pride in my own group than the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) because if the hon. member makes interjections of that nature, he must be fearing for the morals of the White people of this country. If he makes that admission then at the same time he is admitting that the White group of South Africa has not got the ability or the superiority or the pride of race to maintain their position as a White group without legislation of this nature.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>When you weigh this measure against any argument that has been advanced during the course of this debate by hon. members opposite, you cannot escape the fact that if this measure had to affect but one applicant in respect of the Population Register, if it had to upset the dignity of one South African citizen in respect of his position, his future, his life, his association with his fellow human beings, if the dignity of one South African is dragged through the mire of scandal and the rest of it, then, Mr. Speaker, the Bill is objectionable. There is only one attitude which this side of the House can adopt and that is to say: This day six months Let me add this, Sir. I think if we have to resort to it, as a White group, in the course of a debate of this nature, that members on the Government benches accuse members of the Opposition of being saboteurs, when members of the Opposition state their principles and their sincere belief in the way in which they wish to maintain the White race in South Africa, when they accuse the Opposition of wishing to create a bastard race in South Africa, then I hope the public of South Africa notice that. Those hon. members will need legislation of this nature to maintain human dignity; they will not be able to maintain it any other way.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>One wonders why at this stage the hon. the Minister comes forward with a Bill of this sort, Sir. It is an admission that the Government have been unable to prevent people from crossing the colour bar, that their previous legislation has failed and that there have been appreciable numbers of escapes. This is an effort on the part of the hon. the Minister to rebuild the colour bar, but he cannot find the place at which to construct that colour bar. He is trying to find some way of distinguishing the people who have blood of Coloured people in their veins from those who have not. And there is no scientific method by which he can do it. There is no scientific method by which blood can be tested which will show whether a man has part of the Coloured races in his system. The hon. the Minister must therefore search for some other method of distinction. Firstly in this Bill he turns to inheritance, inheritance by the germ cell. Formerly the decision depended on the inheritance of the environment. Provided a child inherited a civilized White environment, was brought up in a White environment, grew up in a White environment and was generally accepted by the community as White, then, Sir, he was White. But the Minister is not satisfied. It appears that somehow or other people are escaping the bar and he must try to stop them and so he turns to these two new methods, the method of descent and the method of investigation. Let us consider first the question of inheritance of the germ cell, that is inheritance as it were, through the blood. How far, Sir, is the hon. the Minister going to go back? There can be no doubt that history in this country shows that miscegenation commenced in the early stages of the White settlement. I think there can be no doubt about that in spite of to-day&#x2019;s speech by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker). As was said by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort history reveals that one of the early governors was Coloured. We know of a lady called Eva who associated with the early settlers. How far back is the hon. the Minister going to go? Because with counting a generation as 30 years there have roughly been nine generations since van Riebeeck settled here. If amongst van Riebeeck&#x2019;s companions there was miscegenation&#x2014;and there does seem to have been&#x2014;then there will be 1/512th part which is not White in the present descendants. How is he going to investigate this inheritance of the blood cell? It is quite simple. He should engage the services of the archivists. Get the archives to give him the history of the early settlers. The names will still be here. The genealogical trees of the old families are all there. Is the hon. the Minister going to have the courage or is he going to use his courage on the unfortunate person whose one great grandmother, three generations ago, had Coloured blood? Is he going to have the courage to declare once and for all the colour out of our group of people? It is no use pretending that there are no escapes. There are escapes. People continue to escape through. Let me quote as near an authentic history as I can. For the period 1911 to 1921, according to the census, the Bantu population increased 16.89 per cent, the Europeans by over 19 per cent. In the meantime the Coloured people increased by 3.7 per cent. This is really a most astonishing phenomenon. We know that if anybody practises birth control it is the White group. We know that the Coloured people are a fertile group and they look after their children rather better than the Bantu do so that a high proportion of their children survive.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, Sir, I will come back to the Bill. I want to ask the Minister how is going to investigate. He has to investigate firstly the ancestry. As I have suggested he can use the archives. It would be as well to start there. If that does not suit him he can ask the various families for their genealogical trees. There are many old families in this country who are proud of their genealogical tree and they do not mind very much if there is a strain of Coloured blood in it. We do know that miscegenation between the early settlers and the slaves was moderately common and that the offspring was frequently accepted into the household. That still happens in parts of the world although not here. How is the hon. Minister going to inquire and advise his new&#x2014;I hesitate to call it a Gestapo but it might be something of that nature&#x2014;investigators to snoop into the antecedents of people? How is he going to examine physical features?</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I want to explain how I have done this when faced with this problem. Because the Minister is reduced to external appearance; he is reduced to whether the hair is crinkly, he is reduced to the fact that there is colour somewhere. He is reduced to whether or not a person has a bridge to his nose. Is he going to teach his investigators to look for thick lips? Because those are the characteristics of the Bantu group and the Hottentot group.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>How is he going to arrive at that? What is he going to instruct them to look for? I, as a member of this House, am sometimes requested by people to give certificates whose origin and race are doubted by the population registrar. The last time I spoke to him I asked him on what he based his decisions. He told me that I should base it on whether I would accept such a person in my home, whether I would have him to my table. I think that was presumption, Sir, on the part of the population register officer. I do not know his name. I thought to myself that there were Indian doctors with whom I would not mind sitting down at table with. I would not mind sitting down to eat with people of my profession. I have sat down at association dinners with people of my own profession who are Bantu. I have even sat down with Nationalists! When I ask myself as a man trying to be honourable and as a man trying by scientific objective observation to arrive in each particular instance: How can I say whether this man or this woman is Coloured or White? I say to myself: Where do I find a specimen, where do I find specimens of White people who have been completely vetted by the highest judgment of the land? And I say to myself; in those benches opposite. I say to myself: There is no man on the Nationalist Party benches who has not been vetted and who is not undoubtedly 100 per cent White. So I looked at the woman and I said: I know a man in the House with hair like yours. Or I say to the next person: I know a man in the House with your colour. Or I say to the next: I know a man in the House whose nose is like yours. So I gave him a certificate. Not on my judgment. Mr. Speaker, I took an objective view and I gave judgment in my<span class="col_4701-4702" refersTo="page_0977"/> mind and I am satisfied that I did it honestly. I judged purely and simply on the basis of members of the Nationalist Party sitting in this House.</p>

<p>Finally, before I sit down&#x2014;I am sorry there is a lot more I would have liked to say&#x2014;I want to ask the hon. the Minister and point out something to him which he has not thought of. He said 15 people came to him and asked to be re-classified as Coloureds. He takes great virtue unto himself for that. I can assure him that within the next year or two he will have many coming with that request because they want to escape military service. According to his own law, if they admit that they are Coloured, he must classify them as Coloured. I want to ask the Minister this: Why is he afraid to say whether he is going to apply this Act to South West Africa?</p>

<p>Before I deal with the points which I want to deal with, I do want to take up a challenge issued this afternoon by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) in the fairy tale speech of his in which he told us about the origin of the Coloureds.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>When introducing this Bill, Sir, the hon. the Minister quoted us some figures. He said that up to 27 March of this year 3,593 formal complaints had been dealt with either by the courts or by the boards, of which 269 were dealt with by the Supreme Court and the board; 233 were granted and <span class="col_4703-4704" refersTo="page_0978"/>36 were turned down. I do not think those figures give us the correct idea as to the number of people who will be affected by this amendment in Clause 1. Because on 14 April this year the hon. the Minister gave some other figures in the Other Place, figures which I think will put the picture in a better perspective. During the course of that debate the Minister said that up to 31 December 1960 there has been 3,269 objections by people objecting to their classification. He also said that the total of those whose classification was doubtful was 128,586. So you see, Sir, that when you take that figure and you consider what the effect of these two clauses is going to be, you will realize that it will not apply to a mere 3,593. The provisions of this Bill are going to apply to some 130,000 odd people, because the proportion remains the same. That is why, in the first place, I want to make my particular point. If you look at it in that light, the powers of investigation which the hon. the Minister is taking under Clause 4, are not going to apply to only 3,000 odd people. They are going to apply to something in excess of 100,000 people. That puts it in a very different light. I think that takes us to the next point. The hon. the Minister will not give us an assurance that he is going to write into this Bill that those people who have been classified before will not be re-classified. He gave us a lead on that in his opening address on this very Bill. Because he said that many of these people had certain forms to fill in. This is another indication of the tightening which has taken place since this Minister took over. When this Minister took this portfolio over people had to go through a comparatively simple procedure to get certificates to the effect that they were accepted as White or Coloured or whatever the case may be. But since this hon. Minister has taken over he has introduced this new form which I have here. This is where his difficulty lies; this is why he wants to investigate. This form provides that three of the following persons must give affidavits, not just certificates: the officer in charge of a police station, a school principal a minister of religion, an employer, a senator, a Member of Parliament (of their particular constituency), a Provincial Councillor (of their particular constituency). In addition to that at least two family friends must declare that they regard and accept the person concerned as a White person in their own family circles and in the other White social circles to which they belong. The friends must not be related to the applicant and they must furnish their full names and identity numbers. All these people have to submit affidavits, not just certificates. In spite of that, Sir, in spite of the fact that five people have to submit affidavits, there are so many people in this country who think that this legislation is so revolting that the Minister has run into difficulties. Of course he has. I will quote him a case, the case of a girl who came to me. She had been accepted as White. She had been accepted into church circles and social clubs and the like as White. She came to me with affidavits from ministers of religion. I did not know her very well, but I did go and see the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s local representative who was of the opinion that she was Coloured. Perhaps rightly so, I do not know. But that is an instance where people have found this legislation so revolting that they were prepared to give affidavits, from a humanity point of view. And that is the problem with which the Minister is confronted. He admitted it in his speech when he introduced this Bill. What is he doing now under Clause 4? In addition to these five affidavits, he is now going to investigate not 3,000 odd people but 100,000 odd people as I have just pointed out. That is what he is going to do. But he has been doing this for a long time. This is merely legalizing what they are doing now. That is what this Bill is doing. Since this Minister&#x2019;s Department has been put on a regional basis, with these local people, what has happened? What is the purpose here? The purpose is very simple, Sir. The officials, in whatever region they are, are the people who decide whether people are White, Coloured, Indian, Bantu or any other particular group that have to be classified under this register. They have already been conducting investigations, Sir. More than a year ago when I handled a case for the previous hon. member for Durban (North), a case of two brothers who both had these forms sent to them, what was the position? The one brother was supposed to be living and associating with a Coloured woman. I went to see the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s local representative. And what did he tell me, Sir? He told me that he had had a man watching that person&#x2019;s house and that he spent more time with the Coloured woman in her house than he spent in his own home. For that reason he was going to classify him as Coloured.</p>
