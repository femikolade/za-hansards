<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has moved this motion and one would have expected an intimation as to the legislation that the Government intends to pass during the remainder of this Session, a final intimation as to the legislative programme. Therefore I must protest against morning sittings starting at this time of the Session. Earlier this Session there has been a protest of the manner of the introduction of legislation and certain deficiencies, if I may put it that way, were pointed out. That was on 22 and the arrangement of business for the House February. It will be recollected that we started the evening sittings later than normal due to the non-availability of work at the time. The legislation brought forward to a very large extent at the beginning of the Session was not of a particularly contentious nature and the Order Paper was not built up sufficiently to occupy the House in the evenings. So it was not until the 29th sitting day that regular evening sittings started. Then there is a somewhat minor point: It was not until the 71st sitting day that the Tuesday evening was taken away. That is not a particularly important point. It is possible that we did so earlier in previous years to the extent of probably two Tuesdays evenings. It is normal at this time of the Session to take morning sittings, but I contend that the hon. the Minister in his motion is proposing that we take them too early. I can&#x2019;t see in view of the programme before us that Parliament can finish within the next three weeks or before the end of the month, and to my mind that is asking rather a lot of the House to sit morning, noon and night during that period, particularly when there has been the opportunity of dealing with legislation earlier had legislation been on the Order Paper. And, Mr. Speaker, I must point out that it is becoming quite a problem. I do not deny that it has also been the problem with every government in the past, but I must say that it seems to be a practice, willy-nilly of this Government that contentious and difficult legislation tends to be left over until the end of the Session, the days when we have to sit morning, noon and night. We then have to deal with the most contentious legislation, whereas if it were brought forward earlier it would facilitate the work of Parliament considerably. I would give one instance of a Bill <span class="col_6813-6814" refersTo="page_0653"/>that is on the Order Paper at the present moment&#x2014;I am not going to discuss the Bill, but simply the machanics of placing it before the House. The hon. the Minister of Justice gave notice to the country as far back as I think December or November, of the General Law Amendment Bill. To process that Bill&#x2014;that is the drafting of the Bill, the meetings of the Cabinet, the drafting of the Bill by the Department, the sending of it to the law-advisers to knock it into shape&#x2014;took up to the middle of May and then only did it appear in this House, and then Parliament had to deal with it a week or ten days later, after that long time had been given for consideration of the Bill by the Department. To show the nature of the rush that takes place, Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister is in the position of only being able to place members in possession of the amendments that he is going to move to this Bill to-day on the Order Paper, the same day when we are going to consider it in Committee. The Opposition finds itself in the same difficulty with Bills. Because of the arrangement of the work, you have to go on with the matters before you and you have not had time to get the amendments on the Order Paper. It has happened during this Session that when dealing with Bills, we gave the hon. the Minister typed copies of amendments when moving them in the House, a most unsatisfactory way. I think that will be admitted by everybody. I am not trying to make a political point of these things. I am mentioning this in the general interest of the House. Because this machine ultimately does not work, unless we take care of these things, it breaks down. I do not think there is anyone sitting here who desires this machine to break down. From what I hear from my colleagues on the other side of the House they don&#x2019;t desire that to happen. Therefore, if that is not to happen, we have to find some remedy for the situation we find ourselves in. There is another Bill on to-day&#x2019;s Order Paper, the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Bill. That Bill is a Bill of 136 clauses and within a day or two of it appearing in print, the House was asked to consider the second reading of the Bill. For two good reasons. Firstly, the hon. the Minister is going away on public business and the Opposition agreed to facilitate its passage. I do not deny that. There was an agreement that we should try and facilitate the passage of that Bill, which is being done. But, Mr. Speaker, a Bill of that nature should have appeared much earlier. Everybody in this House wants the Bill. There is nobody opposed to the principle of the Bill, it is a highly technical subject and many members who have a knowledge of the subject were desirous to discuss the contents of the Bill. When we came to the Committee Stage there was little or no time for discussion. The Minister was even forced into the position of saying when amendments were put before the House: &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t accept the amendment, but I will consider it in later legislation&#x201D;. Why? Because he could not get the Bill reprinted in time before he goes away. No fault of his! We agreed to facilitate his departure so that he can attend to this public business, but it is quite wrong that we should have this sort of situation in the House in respect of important matters of that nature.</p>

<p>The other question that arises&#x2014;and it has been said repeatedly, and I hope the hon. the Prime Minister will take note of this&#x2014;is that you cannot get Bills before the House or for publication because of the difficulty of the law-advisers. If there is a difficulty there it is high time that steps were taken to remedy that situation. If more law-advisers are needed, they must be found. I agree that they don&#x2019;t grow like berries on a tree; they are specialists and are hard to come by, but this situation has now been going on for some time and steps should be taken to train those people to be available in sufficient numbers for the job in hand, to prepare the Bills and make them available to this House in time. Because by doing this sort of thing, and having morning sittings as we are going to have now, we tend to make a farce of Parliament. It becomes to be legislation by mere exhaustion.</p>

<p>I think that is bad. I would appeal to the hon. the Leader of the House to use his best efforts to remedy this situation. I believe he has proposed morning sittings far too early in this motion of his. I wonder how Hansard is going to stand up to this, because normally we have had 11 or 12 morning sittings on an average, for several years past, and in the nature of things Hansard can hardly cope with that. There are too few people, if one may say so, doing far too much, as I understand the situation to-day. Another matter that needs vital and urgent attention, is the recruitment and training of further people, and I would ask the hon. the Leader of the House to go into that matter and see to it that it is brought before the appropriate Committee. I would ask him too to go into this matter of the preparation of Bills and to consider whether they cannot be published during the recess so that a full programme is ready at the meeting of the House at the beginning of next session. I think it would be the wish of all members of Parliament that that should be done. It would certainly make for better legislation. I believe that many of the amending Bills that come to this House are due to the rush and the manner in which legislation is put through this House on occasions, because there has not been an opportunity of outside interested people to express their opinion on the Bill. This very Bill that I instanced, the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Bill, which quite rightly, I think, the Minister recommended to the House as an agreed Bill, is a Bill in respect of which when the hon. the Minister was giving his second reading reply to the debate, we were receiving communications from some of the unions and other interested parties to the effect that they had not yet seen a copy of the Bill. Sir, to me that is farcical that that should happen, that we should have to deal with legislation in that manner. Therefore I make this earnest appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House to take steps to endeavour to remedy this situation in the interests of Parliament, and in <span class="col_6815-6816" refersTo="page_0654"/>the hope that next session we will not have such a situation as we are having here at the end of this Session.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from> <p>I would ask the hon. the Leader of the House whether it is still the intention to come before the end of this Session with a Bill to amend the Shops and Ordinance Act. I may remind the hon. the Leader that at the beginning of the Session there was a private motion asking for certain advantages to be given to the white-collar workers. In his reply the hon. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs indicated that a Bill would be introduced this Session, amongst other things to make compulsory leave applicable to this type of worker. May I know whether that promise will still be kept this Session. I understand that the Bill has been published in the <i>Gazette</i> for some time.</p>

<p>It seems to me there already is a difference of opinion inside the United Party. One hon. member complains that we are going too fast and the other complains that we are not going fast enough.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) has raised a number of points here to have the business of the House disposed of in a better and more satisfactory manner. He said at the outset, which is quite true, that the things he complained about were not new things; they have always been there. Both he and we are interested in having the business of Parliament disposed of in a more satisfactory manner, and he now makes certain suggestions. To show that that has always been so, I can recall, for instance, that 15 or 20 years ago the complaint was that Bills were rushed through and that then they had to be amended the following year. I still recall that the then Minister of Labour introduced an amending Bill during the second half of the Session to amend an Act that had been passed at the commencement of the Session. I am not blaming him, but these things do happen and have always happened. If we can bring about improvements, we shall certainly do so. As the hon. member himself has said, one of our difficulties is to get Parliament going at the commencement. Parliament is like a great vessel; it begins rather slowly, but once you have it going full-steam, it is difficult to bring it to a halt. I realize, and the Prime Minister realizes, that we should try to introduce important legislation that will evoke discussion at the beginning of the session. The hon. the Prime Minister has now given all the Departments notice that the deadline for legislation to be brought into readiness will be advanced by two months, with a view to the very problem which the hon. member has raised here. We hope&#x2014;and all other Governments have tried&#x2014;that if the period within which Departments have to prepare their legislation is accelerated it will contribute to an improvement of the position.</p>

<p>I do not want the speech of the hon. member for Von Brandis to create the impression that there has not been a very good relationship between the two parties in regard to the business of Parliament. I think this side of the House has gone out of its way time and again to meet objections from that side of the House, or to assist them in drawing up the Order Paper in such a way that matters, in which they are interested and for which they are unable to have speakers here on a certain date, can be postponed to a date that will be suitable for them. There has been a very good relationship and we have met them on many occasions. I think that the relationship between the two parties, as regards the business of Parliament, has been better this year than it has been for a number of years.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked why we were starting with morning sittings so early. He said it was too early and that the staff would not be able to cope with the work. Those were his two main arguments. Now, Mr. Speaker, why do we start to sit in the morning? The main reason is that the work of the Select Committees have been disposed of or nearly disposed of. We would have started morning sittings much earlier had it not been for the fact that members were engaged in the morning with work on Select Committees. The time to start sitting in the morning is when the work of the Select Committees has been disposed of. The second reason is that we do so at a time when the staff will be able to cope with the work. He expressed his doubts as to whether the staff would be able to cope with the work once we start morning sittings. I have discussed that question with the staff, and I have been given the assurance that there will be no difficulty for the staff to cope if we start morning sittings on Monday. So these two reasons as to why we cannot start morning sittings both fall away. The last thing is the legislative programme. Some time ago I announced what legislation would still be introduced during this Session. We are adhering to that. As regards this Order Paper, we shall take all the Orders, with one exception. The only one we shall not take this year, is No. 11, the Publications and Amusements Bill. That is a very contentious piece of legislation. The hon. member for Von Brandis wants us to introduce contentious legislation early in the session, and I want to assure him that this piece of contentious legislation will be introduced during the first week <span class="col_6817-6818" refersTo="page_0655"/>of the next ensuing session. The complaint that he had to-day will then disappear to a large extent. For the rest we shall take everything that appears on the Order Paper to-day.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a third time.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The contents of this Bill now make provision amongst others for the following main points: Firstly, there will be three stages of pneumoconiosis instead of, as we now have, four stages. This is a most important provision and it is something which this side of the House has asked for, for a number of years. We hope that this provision will make it possible for more miners who previously entered the fourth stage too late in life, to derive the benefits which were previously paid in the third stage. The disability of the miner due to pneumoconiosis will now be measured scientifically, by taking into primary consideration the cardio-respiratory function. This has been a great step forward and I feel that the mine-worker is going to be more than satisfied with this provision. It will make sure that he is correctly diagnosed and that his disability is correctly assessed. After he has been examined and it has been found that the miner is suffering from one or other stages of pneumoconiosis he will be placed in one of the three categories and will receive compensation, according to this Bill, in relation to his state of disability caused by pneumoconiosis. The compensation further varies according to the size of his dependant family. Provision is made as previously but on a slightly higher scale for the wife and children who are dependent on the miner to receive varying sums of compensation depending on the stage of disability suffered by the mineworker. This question of the size of the <span class="col_6819-6820" refersTo="page_0656"/>family is very important. There is one point which I hope the hon. the Minister will take into consideration because as I see it, the Bill is not perfectly clear on it. I should like to ask him this question: Does the Bill make provision for children who become disabled after the miner has become dependent on the pneumoconiosis grant? Will those children receive compensation irrespective of their age? In other words, we might find that due to such an illness as poliomyelitis the child may become permanently disabled. The child may be unable to make a living and that attack of poliomyelitis may come on after the mineworker has been awarded his final stage of compensation. In such a case will that child receive compensation and will he be recognized as a permanent dependant of the mineworker?</p>

<p>The amounts which are given to the mineworker according to the Bill are such that they may prove inadequate. I do not want to deal with these provisions in detail because I am not sure whether you, Mr. Speaker, will allow me to do so. But I do say that we on this side of the House feel that the provision which is made for the final stage to be plus 75 per cent of pneumoconiosis disability is far too high. We on this side of the House say to the Minister that that provision must be altered as soon as possible and brought down to 65 per cent. I feel that the number of people who are going to be affected by the present provision in the Bill are going to be so small as to make the increase virtually worthless to those people whom we had hoped to bring into the present fourth stage of pneumoconiosis. We were hoping that by bringing the three stage scheme into operation the Minister would provide for more people &#x2026;</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Another provision which is most important is the fact that in future all Bantu who work on the mines either underground or on the surface will be medically examined. I think that is very important. Firstly it will make sure, I hope, that no case of pneumoconiosis amongst the Bantu will be missed either in workers on the surface or underground. And secondly is will be possible to deal quickly with the Bantu who are discovered to be suffering from fibrosis of the lungs so as to prevent tuberculosis also infecting the lungs. I feel sure that this provision will serve the purpose of stopping the spread of tuberculosis and at the same time reducing the numbers of Bantu who are getting tuberculosis on the mines and taking it back to the reserves.</p>

<p>The Minister has given us the assurance during the discussion of this Bill that the Director will be a medical man. We on this side of the House are insisting on that. The Minister said that he would look into the matter and I hope that as soon as possible he will amend the necessary Clause in such a way that it will provide for the director to be a medical man.</p>

<p>The next change which is being brought about in this Bill is the re-introduction of some form of appeal. In this case, Sir, it is a reviewing committee which consists of people who examine the mine worker plus the people who certify him. If it becomes necessary these two bodies will sit together and review the case if there is a dispute and settle definitely whether or not the mine worker is suffering from any stage of pneumoconiosis. This is a very, very important step which the Minister has taken and we on this side of the House welcome it.</p>

<p>Mr.Speaker, we welcome these new provisions in the Bill. We hope it is going to be what the Minister has said, namely a Bill which will be flexible and which will be possible to alter whenever it is found necessary to do so. The Minister must realize that the criticisms which have been offered from this side of the House primarily come from those people who have had some experience in dealing with the mine worker. We hope that if in due course it becomes necessary to alter this flexible Bill the Minister will have no hesitation in bringing it back to this House in order to effect the amendments which we have suggested. It is a step along the road of improving the position of the mine workers but it is far from a perfect Bill. I want to say this, that although this appears to be the road along which we will give to the mineworker some of those things which he desires, it is not as yet a road paved with gold.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome, on behalf of this side of the House and on behalf of the miners, the new principles in this Bill and to put forward one request to the hon. the Minister when this Bill comes into operation. What we welcome in the first place is the new method of diagnosis, namely that it will now be done in a scientific manner; it is clear that the cardio-respiratory function is now going to be the decisive factor; that it will be tested in a very scientific manner, and we think that it will generally bring about a very great improvement. That is why we welcome it. The second principle I wish to welcome on behalf of the miners is the provision in the Bill that there will now be a pension from the very first stage of pneumoconiosis. The lump sum is being replaced by a pension to which the mine worker will be entitled, and later on his wife and children too. That is a second thing we want to welcome very heartily. The third thing we wish to welcome, in the question of the Revision Board, so that there will be a right of appeal if a person is not satisfied with the findings. We think that is really a great improvement upon the old Act. Those are the three matters in respect of which I wish to thank the Minister on behalf of the mine workers and on behalf of this side of the House.</p>

<p>Then I should like to put another request to him, and that is that after this legislation has <span class="col_6821-6822" refersTo="page_0657"/>been in operation for a year, and we are able to judge how many people are being certified on the new basis in comparison with the number of people certified according to the old basis, the Minister will reconsider the whole question if the comparison is not a favourable one.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) and the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) and also to hon. members of the House for the support they have given the great principle of this Bill, and for the manner in which they have assisted us to reach this stage. I should like to give hon. members the assurance that I shall watch the operation of the Bill, once it has become law, very closely and if any amendment is necessary, I shall be the first to come along with that amendment.</p>

<p>I just want to say to the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) that I have promised to go into the whole question of the director. There are very strong arguments in favour of it that the director should be a medical man. Successive Ministers of Mines in the past, since the very start of this law, have always refused to have this clause amended. They have always wanted to retain a discretionary power. I will go into this matter very carefully and if necessary I will bring about the necessary amending legislation. I have already told hon. members of the House in the Committee Stage that I could not accept the amendment to change the fourth stage from 75 per cent to a 65 per cent minimum. The reasons are quite clear, namely that we do not know what the financial implications will be. We know that under the present formula miners will arrive about 10 per cent earlier in the next stage and we do not want to bring about a change which may lead to unemployment amongst miners.</p>

<p>I want to reply briefly to the question raised by the hon. member in regard to the child of a miner becoming disabled. The reply is contained in Clause 72 (5) of the Bill which amounts to this that a miner may be paid a pension in respect of a child who has reached the age of 18 years and who, due to permanent ill-health or physical or mental disability, is unable to earn a living, only if such ill-health or disability was present when the miner became entitled to a pension in respect of himself. Subsequent ill-health or disability of a child does not entitle the miner to a pension. This has been the position since the Act of 1946 and the Act of 1956. The idea is that children who become disabled after the miner has been awarded a pension will be taken care of by the Department of Social Welfare.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is generally felt in our country that the time has arrived when we should have uniformity, particularly in respect of the registration of livestock brands, as regards file control of it, and that it should be of such a nature that it covers the whole Republic. There is legislation in the various provinces; in some provinces it has existed for 80 years; providing for the registration of brands. But this legislation differs from one province to the other, and in those days it also differed because they were still colonies and republics that passed those laws. This Bill now before the House repeals those pre-Union laws. This legislation will therefore replace those old laws. This will then be the first time that we in the Republic of South Africa will have a livestock brands Act that will apply to the whole country.</p>

<p>This Bill should be regarded as supplementary to the Stock Theft Act that came into operation on 1 April of this year. When one reads the provisions of this Bill, one should not look for the provisions that have actually already been included in the Stock Theft Act. This Bill is not intended to be an obstruction for our farmers, but it should really be an aid to farmers when they have to identify stolen or strayed stock. The branding of stock has never been compulsory in South Africa, nor in any of the provinces of our country. This principle of no compulsion in respect of the branding of his stock by any person, is being maintained in this Bill. No one will be compelled to brand his stock, but he who wishes to brand his stock will only be able to do so with a brand or brands registered in his name. In other words, he is compelled, if he wishes to brand his stock, to register those brands in his name so that he can enjoy the protection provided for in this legislation, which gives him ownership of those brands, and so also then the statutory protection that the stock so marked are his stock.</p>

<p>We did not want to incorporate the principle of compulsory brands in this Bill. I believe that in course of time, as more people realize the significance of it, the time will come when we shall have compulsory branding of stock. But that is something I think one should first test out, as the farmers become more accustomed to it. In our country the experience has been, because there were various measures and laws governing this matter in the past, in the various provinces&#x2014;where we are now applying <span class="col_6823-6824" refersTo="page_0658"/>it throughout the Republic, I think it will be wise first to let the people get used to the change before we introduce that compulsion.</p>

<p>I should just like to refer to what happens in some other pastoral countries. You have compulsory brands in New Zealand, except for pigs, or cattle and horses kept in a properly fenced enclosure. In Tasmania you have compulsory brands, but it is limited to sheep only, except for a few exceptions as regards other stock. In Queensland and in South Australia there is no compulsion, save for stock sold by a poundmaster. In South West Africa it is compulsory for White owners in respect of cattle and donkeys, and permissive in respect of horses and mules.</p>

<p>Now I should like to refer to a few aspects of the Bill. Provision is made for the appointment of a Registrar and the keeping of a proper register of all brands that have been allocated. The Registrar will from time to time, on the direction of the Minister, publish a guide of all brands that have been allocated, together with quarterly returns, in the Gazette, and for the convenience of the public it will be open to inspection without charge at all Government offices. That alone is an considerable improvement on the present systems in operation in the various provinces. All registrations and incidental matters will be dealt with by the Registrar and the magistrates are being relieved of these duties they had in the past. The fees that will be the same throughout the Republic for registration, will be prescribed and will be kept as low as possible, so that it will be just sufficient to cover the costs of administration. At regular intervals of not less than five years, free re-registration may take place to prevent large numbers of unused brands appearing. You may have the case of a man dying and the brand is still in his name, and your list is not effective; it is not up to date, and for that reason we want the right to make re-registrations at intervals if we find it necessary, even with the cancellation of brands, but you do not want to do it at too short intervals either. We are merely providing that the right be given to do so at intervals of not less than five years, but it may be longer too.</p>

<p>Another important provision is that brands will be prescribed for every group of stock. Different brands will be prescribed for different classes of stock, such as cattle, horses or ostriches. In other words, you will not be obliged to place the same brand on all your stock. I may mention that the Transvaal Ordinance prescribes a three-piece brand with various combinations for each district, and that it has already had the result that in certain districts of the Transvaal it has become very difficult to obtain combinations of brands, because practically all the possible combinations have been exhausted. I have here a whole list of combinations that are valid in certain districts of the Transvaal. Here I show hon. members one, and there is another, and here is still another. They do not seem very attractive to me. These brands are valid in certain districts only. In other words, if a man has farms in various districts, he has to register more than one brand. The object of this Bill is to give one owner one registered brand for a class of stock, and he will be able to use it in any district of the country wherever he may have stock.</p>

<p>Another matter we wished to combat by means of this Bill, is the elimination &#x2026;</p>

<p>What will become of the present brands in the Transvaal?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to give a final reply to that. It may be that we shall be able to incorporate them in the registrations we contemplate, but if that cannot be done, I am afraid that the one province for the sake of all will lose its brands as presently registered. I do not wish to give the assurance that everybody in the Transvaal will keep his registered brands, for it only applies to certain districts, and there are too many, so that you will have to make changes, and it may be that they will all disappear. The other provision we wish to make is to prescribe the size of the brand and the places where the animal has to be branded. We wish to limit it to that part of the animal&#x2019;s body where it can do least damage to the hide, and yet have the advantage that it will be easy to see for identification purposes. It is estimated that the annual losses we suffer in respect of our hides trade, amount to at least R500,000 and arise from wrong branding that damages the hide unnecessarily. From the economic point of view, it is such an important factor for the farmers that in the Federation there is a bonus of 5s. paid on every animal that reaches the abattoirs and which is properly branded in a spot where the hide is not damaged, in addition to the price the animal realized on the market, just to encourage farmers to brand properly.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>I am not sure; it may be 10s. Regulations regarding the size and shape etc. of the brands, as well as the manner in which and the part of the animal upon which branding shall be effected, will be made. We contemplate a few concessions in the Bill, which I think may be made in fairness. The Minister e.g., may grant exemption from the registration of brands to stud marks that are used in accordance with the rules of the South African Stud Book Association. Provision is also made that bodies such as the South African Native Trust and Coloured Councils may use group marks with the Minister&#x2019;s approval. Provision is also made for stud breeders and the brands they have been using for many years on their stud book animals, and whereby they may also have achieved fame, to be retained and to continue to be used on their stud book animals. But these brands will of course not be able to obtain lawful registration, for it would not <span class="col_6825-6826" refersTo="page_0659"/>fit into the new series. It will be a concession that those brands are exempt from registration under the law, and if it serves a useful purpose for the owners, they will be permitted to be used, but they are not the lawful brands that are registered and enjoy the protection of the Act. Under the Act it will also be possible that a farmer may be able to register a tattoo mark for use on his sheep and goats, but not on the horns, for other marks on the horns and ears of animals that a farmer requires to facilitate the management of his herds, are specifically excluded from the operation of the Bill. In other words, he will be able to use them lawfully for those management purposes, but he will not be able to register those marks that he uses with clips in the ears etc.</p>

<p>As regards the rest of the Bill, I do not believe any explanation is required. The powers in regard to the making of regulations, as well as the proposed penalties for offences, are obvious. The Bill has been discussed beforehand with organized agriculture, and the Stud Book Association, the Provincial Administrations and other interested parties, and the measure has received general approval, and I do hope that it will meet with the approval of not only hon. members, but also the farmers of the country.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from> <p>In general, and in principle, we on this side have no objection to this Bill. There are a number of points which we would like to discuss, and probably most of them can be dealt with more adequately in the Committee Stage. There are one or two points I would like to make arising out of the Bill itself and what the hon. the Minister has said in his introductory speech.</p>

<p>As the Minister has pointed out, this Bill does not make branding compulsory, although he did say that later it might become necessary for measures to be taken to make it compulsory. I hope the Minister will go very slowly in that direction. What is wanted, I think, is that the benefits to be derived from a measure such as this, which will be applicable all over the Republic, should be appreciated by the farming community. Let the farmers appreciate the benefits resulting from the application of such a measure and they will join in voluntarily. I will come back to this later in connection with one of the clauses, but I think that this is the way we should look at this type of legislation. Let the benefits be seen and get the farming community interested in it and they will adopt the measure because it is to their benefit, and let us take them along with us instead of having to force them.</p>

<p>This Bill will be of immense use to us in fighting disease. It seems to me that some of the provisions here have that in mind, in connection with certain regulations that may be made. But there is one point I wish to raise now, namely that provision is made here for the cancellation of brands. I think we have to be very careful in our use of language, because there are two meanings even to a sentence like that. There is the cancellation of a brand registered by the Registrar of Brands. There is the cancellation of a mark placed on a beast, which is a brand as defined in this Bill. So when we speak of the cancellation of brands, one has to be careful and make it quite clear whether one is referring to the cancellation of a brand registered with the Registrar, or the cancellation of a mark placed on a beast as a brand. I want to deal with the latter case. There is provision in the Bill for the cancellation of a mark placed on a beast as a brand, as defined in the Bill. I hope the Minister will withdraw all reference to the possibility, in this Bill, of cancelling a brand placed on a beast as a brand mark, and that a beast, once branded, will carry that brand without mutilation or change throughout its life. You see, Sir, I know that provision has been made in laws in other countries for the cancellation of a brand mark on a beast, but on this side of the House we think that is quite wrong. We think that the moment you provide by regulation in terms of the law for a legal method of cancelling a brand mark on a beast, you have opened the door to that method being used by all sorts of elements which may be engaged in stock theft or in other unlawful activities related to the livestock industry. The moment it is lawful to cancel a brand mark on a beast, you cannot tell who the previous owner was, because it does not matter what kind of brand you and what kind of mark may be defined by regulation, but the defacing mark, for the purpose of cancelling the brand, placed on top of existing brand mark, which is legible, can immediately be made illegible. We think the law should not permit any alteration or mutilation or cancellation of a brand mark on a beast. I know the Minister and his advisers will have some little difficulty over this matter, but we believe it is fundamental to the good working of the Bill. To in regard to large stock it is proposed to have a brand mark on the cheek&#x2014;because we agreed with the Minister that one object of this Bill is to protect the hide and skin industry by preventing the placing of brands in such a way that it depreciates the value of the skin, and loses income not only for the farmer but for the country: so if you want to escape that and provision is made for the branding of large, horned stock on the cheek, the Minister and his advisers will have to look at it from the angle of the laws of heraldry, and visualize the cheeks of an animal and the precise position in which in order of priority succeeding owners must brand that animal, so that at a glance any farmer or auctioneer or livestock dealer will know the order of precedence of the ownership of the beast. In other words, the sequence must be certain and it must be unmutilated so that you can trace the ownership of the beast.</p>

<p>The question has been asked outside this House what happens in the case of farmers who have not yet registered their brand with the Registrar. The answer is simple. This is one of the matters where we believe that it is not necessary to have compulsory branding in <span class="col_6827-6828" refersTo="page_0660"/>the Bill, because the farmer who does not register a brand will be the man who has to take care of himself. He will be handling animals branded with another farmer&#x2019;s brand and if any question arises he will find himself in the position of having to prove that he is the legal owner of a beast with a brand placed on it by another owner. He will perpetually be in the position of not only having to beware when buying another man&#x2019;s cattle, but he will continually have to beware that he is not running cattle on his property which may have a multiplicity of brands. The only way to do that is to have all those brands clear and unmutilated. I do not want to pursue that any further except to say that we hope that all reference in this Bill to a lawful process of cancellation of brands lawfully placed on an animal will be withdrawn from the Bill so that there will be no method of legally cancelling a brand mark once put on an animal. That brand mark must remain identifiable for the lifetime of the beast.</p>

<p>There is another provision of the Bill, in regard to the powers of the police to take possession of any thing which they find in the course of investigating stock theft. I think it is Clause 15 (1) (d). It says that the police may seize and remove for detention any thing found by them. I am not sure that it is quite clear whether that includes an animal; whether an animal is a &#x201C;thing&#x201D; for the purposes of this clause.</p>

<p>There is another point in regard to this matter of the brand placed on the animal. We, on this side, feel that it must be of a permanent character. The use on small stock of what is called tattoo oil, which is not a paint, which is of a temporary character&#x2014;we do not believe that that should be permitted as a brand. You cannot use a paint for large stock.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from> <p>I do not know whether some of these oils would be defined as paint, but the point I want to make is that none of those ephemeral things should be permitted, not only on large stock, but on any stock. It must be of a permanent character. I want to say that what has been called a hair burn amongst stock farmers must be ruled out altogether as a brand. In other words, it must be quite clear that the brand will be of a permanent character, and it shall not be a hair burn. A hair burn is a very good thing at stock sales, where you want something which is easily visible in order to identify the animal for a temporary period, and then it grows over again. But we do not want a hair burn to be used on the assumption that it will grow over again, on the wrong part of the animal&#x2019;s hide. Where you lay down the definition of a brand, we say it should be of a permanent character, and people should be forbidden to put a hair burn on an animal in a place where the hide may be damaged, because it really depends only on the amount of pressure used by the man putting on the brand whether it is a hair burn or a permanent brand.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from> <p>Well, that clears up that point. I entirely agree with the Minister. I take it the regulations will tell us precisely where the branding iron can be applied. That is the point I wanted to make, and the Minister will obviously prevent hair burns on any other spot than the prescribed one. May I say in passing that I am sorry that we have in Parliament to be asked to pass a Bill which says that a horse includes any mule or ass. I think that is very sad. Why not use the words &#x201C;equine&#x201D; or &#x201C;bovine&#x201D;? Perhaps the Minister does not understand those terms, because he is an ostrich farmer. There are one or two other points I would like to deal with in passing. In Clause 13 provision is made for what I may call the five-yearly registration of brands with the Registrar of Brands. It need not necessarily be done every five years, but the period may not be less than five years. It is clear that what is contemplated is a review from time to time by the Registrar of the registered brands. Quite frankly, we do not like that. We think that when once a farmer has his brand registered, it must stay so for all time, until he dies or his son or heir takes over, and he may take over the same brand, because provision is made for it. He may take over the same brand. What we do feel is that the farmer, having got his brand, keeps it permanently, and if it is at any time to be cancelled by the registrar, some means should be adopted of letting the farmer know that that is happening. Provision is made here for a proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>The Minister can use the <i>Gazette</i> to give notice that he is asking all farmers to re-register their brands after a period of not less than five years. But he can use the <i>Gazette</i> for other purposes; he can use the <i>Gazette</i> to advertise the different kinds of brands for different kinds of animals. May I say with due respect and deference, Mr. Speaker, that I am <span class="col_6829-6830" refersTo="page_0661"/>pleased to see you in the Chair, so that when I talk about equine you will understand precisely the point that I am making, because, in the case of equine, quite obviously you want a totally different kind of brand; you should have it in the interest of the animal. The brand should be different to that for bovine. Sir, we do not like the <i>Gazette</i> from this point of view. You have farmers living under circumstances where they do not read the <i>Gazette</i>, and it may well be, even under existing circumstances where farmers have to be fairly well abreast of the times, that they will not realize exactly what they have to do to have their brands registered every five years, or whatever it may be. They may not see those notices in the <i>Gazette</i> dealing with the different kinds of brands for different kinds of animals. Here I want to ask the hon. the Minister to take a bold step. Throughout the years we have been building up farmers&#x2019; organizations in this country, and we have had the S.A. Agricultural Union finally accepted by all, I think, as the mouth-piece of organized agriculture throughout. Has the time not come for us to put that in the Statute and say that the S.A. Agricultural Union is going to be notified? It can be put in the <i>Gazette</i>; I have no objection to its going into the <i>Gazette</i> as a permanent record of the intention of the Government, because that is the way in which we bring laws officially to the notice of the public, through the <i>Gazette</i>, that is used in the police courts as evidence at trials and so on. For all practical purposes we have never found a better way of publishing our laws and regulations than through the <i>Gazette</i>, so that must be maintained, but I would like to see something added. I think the time has come, if I may suggest it to the Minister, when he should take a bold step and recognize the S.A. Agricultural Union. Through that you go back then to the various provincial agricultural unions and to the various agricultural societies and associations that are affiliated. There again I want to say quite frankly that what I am driving at is to show a positive benefit to farmers who belong to a farmers&#x2019; association which is affiliated with the provincial union and which is, therefore, affiliated with the S.A. Agricultural Union. You always get a small group of farmers who want all the benefits and they do not want to have any of the responsibilities; they hope that they will learn through their neighbours what is taking place from time to time, so that they will not be caught on the wrong foot, but they do not have to pay anything towards the maintenance of the farmers&#x2019; associations by way of an annual subscription; they do not attend the meetings; they only wait to milk the old farmers&#x2019; association&#x2019;s cow whenever they get a chance, and they do nothing whatever to keep that cow in condition and to feed it. This is a case in point where the affiliated branches and the affiliated members will get notification of all matters which are set out in this Bill, and those who are not members will just have to chance their arm. In my opinion it will be a positive inducement to the foot-loose farmers to-day who see no benefit in joining a registered farmers&#x2019; association to come in as members so that they can get positive benefits. This Bill, Sir, will not apply only to farmers; it will apply to a group of other people outside. Well and good, they will have to follow the <i>Gazette</i> or, through their own associations and organizations, they will have to take proper steps to keep themselves in touch with what is provided for here; it is up to them to find their own way of keeping within the law. But, Sir, we do not like periodical registrations, and we do hope that the Minister will go beyond the <i>Gazette</i> as a means of publication.</p>

<p>My colleague, the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes), will deal with certain matters affecting the Bantu areas, and I am glad to see that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is here. Sir, the problems that we have to deal with here are really twofold, that is to say, protection of our hides and skins, so far as their commercial value is concerned, and protection against stock theft and so forth. Those two matters have to be dealt with efficiently and administratively by the Minister and his Department, and if I have any doubt in my mind as to whether it can in fact work out successfully, I will say that the breakdown may possibly come about in the Native areas or in the White areas adjacent to Native areas, and there I have certain very strong mental reservations. I can see the Minister and his Department getting into difficulty. That is not to say that he will not get the goodwill of the farmers and that he will not get the support and the cooperation of the farmers and the farmers&#x2019; associations concerned because I am sure he will; I am sure he will find them only too willing to co-operate. But there are certain practical difficulties where Bantu stock is concerned, which I am going to leave to my colleague here to deal with, but it does leave a doubt in my mind.</p>

<p>I think the other matters that I have in mind can be dealt with in the Committee Stage. I will simply say that I think that this is at any rate a first good step forward, and subject to the remarks that I have made we are willing to support this Bill.</p>

<p>I am pleased to see that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), with his practical brain, agrees with us in regard to many points. These are matters we have already discussed with the Minister. There definitely are certain regulations that have to be complied with. As the hon. the Minister has already said, this Bill is really supplementary to the existing Stock Theft Act. Of course the great problem is how to prove that stock has been stolen, and this Bill is an attempt to reduce stock theft in South Africa. I agree with the hon. member for South Coast that we should be very careful in regard to registered brands. There are indeed, people who have not registered their brands although they have been using <span class="col_6831-6832" refersTo="page_0662"/>those brands for years and years. Even in the case of pedigree stock you find that people might have been using their own brands, but never registered them. I am pleased also to see that the hon. the Minister has excluded stud books to a certain extent, for by the registration of your stud books you always have your own colour brand system, etc., that may be followed up. Although they may not be used as registered brands, we feel that this system will help a lot without bringing about any difficulties for the stud books. The stud books, of course, are organized bodies; they have their different marks and numbers, and the Bill will not be concerned with them, and we welcome that. But we do feel that there should be something additional. There I agree with the hon. the Minister that for the future one should have a special registered brand. Registration is not compulsory at the present time, and we hope it will be capable of being made compulsory in the future when people appreciate the advantages of compulsory registration. I believe that compulsory registration will still be the best in the long run. I agree with what the hon. member for South Coast has said in regard to a brand on the hip of cattle; I agree that it is not a thorough test, and the Minister will probably come along with amendments later on to bring about an improvement in that respect. I think the South African Agricultural Union, which is our mouthpiece, has been thoroughly consulted in regard to the provisions of the Bill, and also the stud books. You already have your various groupings in agriculture at the present day, and I do not know whether it is necessary to go further than to remain in touch with our agricultural associations. Every agricultural organization has its specific place in the South African Agricultural Union, and I do not think we should use this Bill in an attempt to increase the membership of the agricultural unions; I think that is the matter for the agricultural unions themselves to take up. We should like to see all farmers belonging to the agricultural unions, but I do not know how we can do something in that direction in this Bill; I think it is a matter that falls outside the scope of this Bill. There is co-operation between the Department and the agricultural unions at the present time, and there is co-operation also with the stud books. As the hon. member for South Coast has said, the object of this Bill is twofold. The one object is to combat stock theft; that is something that is absolutely essential. The suggestions made here by the hon. member for South Coast are very good suggestions, and I think the hon. the Minister is thinking along the same lines as he is. It is a matter that should be thoroughly pondered. It is not something you can rectify within a day or two. I also feel that it should be laid down by regulation on what part of their bodies cattle should be branded. The brand should be placed on the spot where it will do the least damage, for instance, on the jaw or on the shoulder or below the thighs. The exact place should be fixed, and there should be uniformity so that one should not have to look all over in order to find the brand. If the police then examine an animal, they will know exactly where to look for the brand. As regards this matter I feel we are going in the right direction.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we realize that the farmers on the borders will have trouble. The hon. the Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration could co-operate in an attempt to find a solution for the problem of the border farmers, but I do not know whether we can do anything in that regard under this Bill. I think the whole country welcomes this step. Compulsory registration of brands is not being introduced now; it may later on possibly lead to compulsory registration, for I am one of those who believe that if you wish to eliminate stock theft, there has to be compulsory registration of brands. The difficulty at the moment is the old brands that already are on the cattle. How are you going to get rid of those? It is a very difficult matter, and I agree that the eventual solution of the problem of stock theft is the introduction of one system throughout the country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>We fully appreciate that to enable the Stock Theft Act to be effective a universal system of registered stock-branding is essential, so we accept this consolidating measure. We think it is an advantage to have the eight different Acts appertaining to the branding of stock throughout the Republic consolidated in one measure. I am disappointed, however, that in this enlightened age scientific opinion was not sought, or research undertaken, with a view to introducing a more humane system of marking animals than by branding them with red-hot irons, as indicated in this measure. I feel that the system of branding animals with red-hot irons belongs to the Middle Ages and is certainly not in keeping with the Animals Protection Bill which we on both sides of the House eagerly supported during this Session. We fell over each other in support of that measure; in fact, there was rivalry between hon. members in advocating humane treatment of animals. In this debate I would like to hear the opinion of those who claimed to have initiated that Bill. I would like to hear their opinion as regards the use of red-hot irons and even very large irons in branding stock. I think that if the South African Agricultural Union have nothing better to offer than this crude measure, then the Minister should have referred this Bill to a committee of scientists with a view to introducing a more humane method of marking stock. Surely in this enlightened age, with the development of tattoo oils in various colours, it should not be impossible for scientists to devise a method whereby a tattoo mark, visible from outside, could be put on the skin of an animal. We may even have a phosphorescent mark that would show up at night, like the fire-flies have. I think there is a lot of room for improvement as regards <span class="col_6833-6834" refersTo="page_0663"/>the marking of stock. I would like to advocate that the Minister should investigate the possibility of introducing a more humane method of marking stock. The Minister said that provision would be made, in a later measure, for the registration of tattoo marks. I would like the Minister, when he introduces that measure, to provide for everyone to register a tattoo mark. Sir, it has been proved by scientists and by practical men that 400,000 different marks can be put on to one ear, by making use of the numerals and the letters of the alphabet and arranging them in different orders. We have heard the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) advocating that we should not cancel old brands. Of course, if the marks are on the ear, then they could be cancelled by the same mark in a different coloured ink; it is perfectly simple to cancel a mark on the ear.</p>

<p>You could cancel all the marks just by cutting off the ear.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the Minister should make provision in this Bill, as drastic as these clauses are, that not more than a third of the ear shall be removed. I think this provision should be inserted in this Bill as a protection for people who do not brand their stock. I myself have been farming now for over 50 years and I have never branded an animal. Sir, it is tragic to see sheep which have had chunks of their ears removed by those who have acquired them as marked by previous owners. We know that in the Native territories one finds sheep with almost the whole ear removed. In fact, I have seen such cases myself. The Minister says that ears can be cut off, but there is no reason why the Minister should not introduce legislation to make it illegal for anyone to possess an animal with more than a third of its ear removed, or it can be made illegal for anyone to cut off any portion of the ear on which there is a tattoo mark, and the punishment for doing so could be drastic; that would be a perfectly simple matter. Sir, one only has to inspect the stock on our stock markets to see how many of the animals are plastered with brands&#x2014;and not small brands. Many have scars which indicate that these brands were burnt right through the skin. I think this is a matter to which more attention should be paid by the societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals and by the people who initiated the Animals Protection Bill. [Interjection.] Sir, the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) is interjecting but he is a stud-breeder, and he is quite pleased to hear that there will be registration of tattoo marks. I doubt whether the hon. member for Cradock ever found it necessary to brand any of his stud-stock. If there is a mark, on the ear, the animal can always be identified. There are many ways of branding that could be investigated. The hon. the Minister knows very well that when a tiny little mark is made behind the leg of an ostrich chick when it is hatched, with a little heated hairpin, which is not painful, it lasts the animal&#x2019;s whole life. As the animal grows, so the mark becomes larger. There are many ways in which we could mark animals, ways which are more humane that the method used at present. There is no doubt that an identification mark in the ear would be much more effective than the usual registered brand. Sir, the Minister is laughing at me &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; but I think there is much in this measure that could be improved. For example, no limitation is placed on the number of brands that any particular owner may have. It is also provided that on a change of ownership, a brand has to be cancelled. That means that every time there is a change of ownership there has to be a new brand, and if it is a cancellation brand too it has to be a deep brand. When the Minister replies perhaps he can tell us what the cancellation brand will be; we would like some enlightenment in that regard, especially if the brand is one that obliterates a previous brand or that crosses out a previous brand, or of whatever nature it is to be. I have had to cancel brands myself; I have seen it done, and I know that nobody could regard the cancellation of brands as humane. Generally with the branding of stock the animal is thrown onto the ground, and especially if it is a wild animal there is a certain amount of rough handling, and there is no doubt that when a wild animal is branded the person who inflicts the brand puts in a deep one to make sure that it will not have to be done again. I do say that with the advance that has been made in science we should be able to find some means of tattooing a visible brand, perhaps on the cheek, for example, as the Minister has indicated, and it should not be necessary to do it with a red-hot iron.</p>

<p>Sir, when we speak of brands we know what they are, and we know that it is not permissible under this Bill to use paint on sheep but only on certain other animals. When we speak of brands we mean the brands that we see on horses, on donkeys, on asses and all livestock. Animals are branded throughout the country to-day and I think that when a Bill of this nature is introduced the Minister should take a more enlightened view and try to introduce a measure which will induce people to mark and brand their animals in a more humane way than the method that is being used to-day.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FAURIE</person>:</from>

<p>The benign hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) is so concerned about the ill-treatment of animals that he has given free rein to his imagination. I do not know whether it is so very cruel to animals to brand them if one only does it judiciously. The hon. member will come along just now and tell us it is ill-treatment <span class="col_6835-6836" refersTo="page_0664"/>of animals if one were to milk by hand a cow that is a tough milker. I think if one uses a good hot iron to do the branding properly, there is no ill-treatment of animals. There are many practices that perhaps cause more pain than the ordinary branding provided only that it is done properly.</p>

<p>We welcome this Bill, especially because the registration of brands is not being made compulsory. I do not think it is quite practical at this stage to come along with a system of compulsory brands. People who use brands, do so to enable them to identify their animals, and the people who are not prepared to brand their animals in order to identify them thereby, will just have to bear the consequences thereof. Then of course there are many people also who have only one or two head of cattle and who will not take the trouble to register a brand. So I do not think it is necessary to introduce a system of compulsory registration of brands. The people who do require it for identification purposes, will of course use the system. I should like to refer to the system of branding in the Transvaal. The hon. the Minister has already referred to that. I think the system used in the Transvaal was a splendid system. There is this difficulty, of course, as has been rightly stated here, that with the numerous applications it now becomes difficult to get a registered brand for every person under the existing system in the Transvaal. But the system has worked very well so far. A letter has been allocated to each district&#x2014;the first letter of the brand&#x2014;and then there are two additional marks. In other words, there is a three-letter system that has been used in the Transvaal.</p>

<speech by="#faurie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FAURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Two letters and a number. Now I should only like to request that if it is at all possible, the existing brands that are in use, should be retained; in other words, that people who already have registered brands, should be able to re-register those brands. One would not like to have a whole lot of brands on your stock, and where people have had their fixed registered brands for years, I think it is no more than fair that they should be permitted to continue with that system. As regards the regulations, we are glad that provision is being made that the places where the animals should be branded will be indicated by way of regulation; it is very necessary. As has been rightly said here, much damage is done as a result of bad branding that damages the hides. The size of the brands and the age at which the brands should be applied to the animals, are very important. Furthermore, I should like to draw attention to the use of figures, in addition to the usual registered brand. Where people have their registered brand, they sometimes also use figures because the ear-marks are sometimes lost. People who wish to improve the breed of their cattle, grade their cattle and they frequently make use of numbers. I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to permit the use of ordinary figure numbers, apart from the registered brands, and that such numbers need not be registered, for a figure number alone will be of no value without a registered brand. As regards the brands guide, I would agree that I feel it is not a very practical clause. I am now referring to Clause 13, in terms of which persons who have registered brands will have to give notice every five years if they wish to retain those brands. In the first place, it is going to mean considerable extra work for the officials concerned, and you can be very sure that a number of people will not know that they have to give notice if they wish to retain their brands. Quite a number of letters etc. will go astray, probably, and in the long run you are going to have only a lot of dissatisfaction, and I feel the game will not be worth the candle. I feel that once a brand has been registered, it should remain there until the person dies and somebody applies to take over the brand. Where there is a complete sell-out, one could make use of the stock inspector or the inspector of brands to give notice that the person concerned is no longer farming. But do not expect every person to apply every five years. You are going to cause a lot of unnecessary work and I cannot see what benefits will be derived from it. Let the existing brands remain. It will avoid a good deal of wasted time, inconvenience and dissatisfaction among the farmers. One wants a system that will work well, but will not cause unnecessary bother and unnecessary dissatisfaction. Even if it were to be published in the <i>Gazette</i>, it will not help much. All people simply do not get the <i>Gazette</i>. And even if use were made of the farmers&#x2019; associations, everybody will still not receive notice. There will be numerous people who will be quite unaware of it, and then brands will be cancelled unnecessarily. One would not like to see an animal having too many brands, nor do I think it is necessary. If animals are stolen, you always have a brand, a mark of identification you can rely upon to trace the animal. Personally, when I buy an animal from a person who has a brand, I do not apply another brand to such animal because I do not like to see a number of brands on an animal. It disfigures the animals and is quite unnecessary. But if I buy animals bearing certain brands, the seller has under the Stock Theft Act to furnish me with a certificate to indicate that I have bought the animals and that is the proof that they are my animals now and protects me from prosecution. That is all one needs.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>One good thing this Bill will do is that it is going to stop the indiscriminate branding of stock on any and every occasion. To-day on our stock sales, if you travel around the country, you see a number of animals with huge brands all over the valuable parts of the hide, quite apart from the suffering, the unnecessary suffering of animals. Under this Bill the hon. the Minister can prescribe by regulation the size of the brand and where a <span class="col_6837-6838" refersTo="page_0665"/>brand shall be placed, which as I have already said, will save very valuable hide and valuable tanned skins being discarded, or the best part of the hide wasted as far as the cattle industry is concerned and as far as the leather tanneries are concerned.</p>

<p>But I am also concerned with this question of the obliteration of brands. As the hon. member for Natal (South Coast) (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), I am very disturbed to think that a man can legally remove another man&#x2019;s brand. To-day we all own cattle bearing other people&#x2019;s brands. If you are dealing in cattle, you buy store-oxen for fattening, or you buy trek-oxen, and most people have in their possession branded cattle with brands other than their own. There is no difficulty under the Stock Theft Act, and, of course, if the police come on your property and say: &#x201C;Jones has lost, van Zyl has lost, so many oxen, and they are looking for them; there are oxen of his brand amongst your stock, or amongst the stock owned by your Natives on your farm; how does it come that they are on your farm?&#x201D; Then you produce your receipts. You have purchased them and there is no difficulty. I can see no difficulties on that side as far as the possession of branded animals is concerned. But the moment you allow anybody legally to obliterate a brand or cancel a brand, then you play, to my mind, right into the hands of the stock thief. He can obliterate all brands. Because it is arbitrary to own cattle with obliterated brands and no other brand. One of the most important things under this Bill is that people are allowed to register brands, but branding is not compulsory, as hundreds of farmers do not brand at all. I have not branded an animal for the last 35 or 40 years. To-day, of course, I have only got pedigreed stock, and they are registered, and there is no difficulty, but people who are farming near Native territories and near Native reserves, or who go in for ranching, find it essential to brand stock, and if, as the hon. member for Natal (South Coast) suggested, you have a sequence of places where a brand shall go&#x2014;in other words, the first brand goes here and the second one there, and the third one on the next spot, then you have only got to look at the animal and you know immediately who was the last man who owned that animal, who had a registered brand. There is no difficulty at all. That applies to the police, the farmer, anyone. But we must not overlook the fact that a large number of farmers do not brand at all. They may buy store-oxen, and we are coming to the stage now that you have highly organized farms where even the store-oxen do not run in huge paddocks, or over the veld almost ad lib, but they are almost always kept in small camps and are fed until they are ready for the market, and that owner who does not brand has no difficulty in proving to anybody that he is the legal owner of that stock. But the man who owns an animal with a number of brands, one or more obliterated, will find it more difficult to prove that it is his animal, and it will be more difficult for the police to pick it up. I think it will be much wiser, quite apart from the fact that you are mutilating the hide, not to have this provision in regard to the obliteration of brands in this way. You know the definition in Clause 1 (iv) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Cancel&#x201D;, in relation to a brand on any</block>

<p>livestock means cancel in the prescribed manner.</p>

<p>However, in Clause 22 (h) it says that regulations can be framed by the Minister as to how brands may be cancelled. I do appeal to the hon. the Minister to have the officials of his Department to go into this matter again before we come to the Committee Stage, because I think it is necessary to amend those clauses from the point of view of everybody, and especially the farmer.</p>

<p>There are difficulties already arising from the application of the branding and marking of animals under the Stock Theft Act, which came into force only last month. On 1 April the new regulations in relation to this question of brands and marking on sales came into force, and it has caused so much difficulty in Natal that I see in the latest <i>Naunlv</i>, the official organ of the Natal Agricultural Union, that they are having a special meeting either this week or next week with the police, Government officials, representatives of the Agricultural Union and other interested bodies, such as livestock auctioneers, etc., to discuss the difficulties. I understand that there have been difficulties over driving the stock, some just returning home, others being driven to new homes, and the police have had difficulty in identification in relation to stock passes that the Natives have to carry. Within a matter of two months we have already run into difficulties in respect of the practical application of brands and markings. These things often look well in theory. It sounds quite nice just to obliterate a brand and apply a new brand, but when it comes to the practical application you will find there are very many snags, and it is not easy at all. So I would ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to that before we get to the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Then there is this question of the registration of brands, or rather the re-registration every five years. I take it that when there is reregistration, it will be a re-registration for the whole Republic. If that is so, why cannot the hon. the Minister have a notice printed, where you just have to fill in the name and address, notifying all owners that re-registration is taking place on such and such a date? You have the same thing with radio licences, and there must be many more radio licences than you will have registered brands. Can he not give notice to the owners of registered brands, informing them that their renewal is due next month or in two months&#x2019; time? You don&#x2019;t have that every year, but once in five years only, and it would not be difficult to do so, it would not take that much time, and would not cost a lot for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department <span class="col_6839-6840" refersTo="page_0666"/>to send out such a notice. It could be done by the registrar or by his own Department. As a matter of fact, I think we could even go further and have a form which could be torn off in the form of a postcard, informing the farmers, printed on one side. Then the farmer could, on the other side, just mark the necessary words saying that he wants to re-register or does not want to re-register. He could then sign it and send it back. I think, from everybody&#x2019;s point of view, that would lead to better registration and more efficiency for the Department.</p>

<p>When we come to ear-marks on sheep in particular, we don&#x2019;t have quite the same difficulty in the case of cattle, because you have got the colour of the cattle, and shape, and one thing and another by which you can recognize cattle. But when you come to sheep, it is a different matter. I would appeal to the hon. the Minister to make provision, if possible in this Bill, that nobody should be allowed to own a sheep of which more than one-third of the ear has been removed. That is provided for in the old Act. Of course I know that it sometimes happens that a sheep tears off its ear in a wire or something, but in that case you can cull that sheep, because culling an odd sheep when an accident like that happens is neither here nor there, but it does stop people from removing two-thirds of a whole ear, so as to remove the identifying mark of ear-marking, although obviously you can see that an old brand has been combed out of the fleece. When a sheep has been carrying its wool for some time and a brand is getting rather broken up, the stock thieves, especially those in certain of the Native territories, comb out that side of the sheep where the paint mark was, cut off two-thirds of the ear, and you cannot do anything about it. Even if the ears are still bleeding. We have had cases where we went to a Native location or a reserve and found sheep with bleeding ears, two-thirds of the ear cut off and you can&#x2019;t do anything; you have to prove that it is your sheep, and the police are quite powerless. We had a lot of trouble some years ago when I was sheep farming in the Kliprivier area. You follow up sheep right into the location, and you find a number of sheep, perhaps the exact number of sheep you have lost, with ears cut off, well-combed, so that there are no paint marks of the original paint left on the side of the sheep. So I would appeal to the hon. the Minister to give that further consideration. If you want to stop stock theft, it is essential that we should be able to identify animals, and, as I have already said that if a particular person does not brand his cattle, he can then prove that he purchased the cattle from a certain party. As I said before, many farmers do not brand at all to-day. In my particular area, the Midlands of Natal, most farmers do not brand, and ownership may pass three or four times of animals before they are slaughtered, especially breeding animals. But it is quite easy to prove that you are the owner, and I see no difficulty in that regard.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I welcome the Bill in so far as it is an attempt to make it possible, in carrying out the Stock Theft Act, to have certain marks of identification established and registered. But in carrying out the application of marks of identification upon animals, we have not yet reached the best possible method, in my opinion, to put it beyond all doubt. I refer, for instance, to the case where one uses a registered branding iron in terms of the provisions of this Bill. There you will still have confusion if e.g. you were to use the letters &#x201C;J.S.&#x201D;, which you register, and somebody else were to use &#x201C;J-5&#x201D;. It is required that an animal shall have the identification brand applied to it at a certain age and on a certain place, but now we know that a comparatively hot iron frequently blots such brands, and where animals grow up and the hide of course stretches, the provision that the branding iron shall be of a certain size is not in my view sufficient. But under present circumstances we have not yet found an improved method of determining identification beyond all doubt, and for that reason we have to accept that the provisions of this Bill are, at the present time, the most obvious and practical. However, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, in view of the problems we have experienced in applying these identification marks to cause an investigation to be made to see whether a better method of identification cannot be found than the application of a brand.</p>

<p>Now we come face to face with the problem that in addition to the damage to the hide of an animal when the Department of Finance, and now also the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, have to apply certain identification marks to an animal, the registered brand will also have to be applied to such an animal, which will necessarily damage the hide much more than for instance the application of the first marks of identification. In that process, the hide is damaged more and more. That is why I should like to suggest that in applying identification marks for government subsidies, etc., other means should also be considered of making identification very clear. In regard to the matter of notification, referred to in Clause 13, I should also like to express the thought that I do not believe that mere publication in the <i>Gazette</i> will be sufficient to notify the farmers that they have to re-register. I should like to suggest that other methods, that have already been mentioned, be borne in mind when re-registration becomes necessary. The <i>Gazette</i> is read in very limited circles, and that is why another system of notification to the farmers should be put into operation. As we are supporting the Bill in broad outline, I should like to ask the Minister to have regard to the few points I have mentioned to see whether we cannot devise a better system for the application of brands for the purposes of identification.</p>

Rall) to a <span class="col_6841-6842" refersTo="page_0667"/>certain extent, that it will be a very good thing if another method of branding could be devised instead of the branding with a red-hot iron. If one looks at the branded stock on any farmer&#x2019;s farm, you find that unless it is a very careful farmer who brands his stock himself, that of 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the stock that has been branded with a red-hot iron, the brand is such that you cannot identify it any longer; it has been branded too superficially or too deeply, with the result that it is useless for the purpose for which the farmer wished to brand the stock. I also wish to agree to some extent with the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) that the branding with a red-hot iron is a brutal thing. You cannot deny that. The hon. member for Nelspruit (Mr. Faurie) has said that it is not so brutal or cruel. I do not know but anything done with a red-hot iron to the hide of an animal, a live animal, must be brutal from the very nature of the things. But until we have discovered something else in the place of that, I suppose it will just have to remain.</p>

<p>I do not think we can say much at the second reading of this Bill. The points that cause difficulty I suppose we could better deal with in the Committee Stage. The hon. the Minister has said that the main object of this Bill is to achieve uniformity. I agree with that. In the various provinces there are different laws that have been passed relative to the branding of animals, and one has had the position that where a person has had farms in more than one province, he has experienced difficulty in observing the various laws, especially when moving animals from one province to the other. This Bill will now eliminate that. But I do think that the biggest service this Bill will render the country, will be to prevent the damaging of the hides of animals, and that the Minister takes the power to provide by regulation where brands should be applied to the animals. That is the most important and the best provision in the whole Bill.</p>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that the definition of &#x201C;brand&#x201D; in Clause 1 is not satisfactory. As it stands here, it reads &#x201C;a mark made or applied&#x201D;. I think the word &#x201C;permanently&#x201D; should be inserted before the words &#x201C;made or applied&#x201D; in Clause (1) (i). A brand will only be a brand if it is a permanent mark. Then it will make farmers much more careful when branding animals, to see to it that it is a permanent mark.</p>

<p>Then there is the cancellation of marks. The hon. member for South Coast has said that we on this side of the House are opposed to the physical cancellation of brands on an animal, e.g. that they may be cancelled by a cross-line across the mark that has been made already. I am not so very sure that that is the right thing to do. I have thought a lot about it, and have come to the conclusion that I am in agreement with the hon. member for South Coast, that if the Minister is going to take steps to prescribe by regulation that a brand shall be physically cancelled on an animal, you will frustrate the objects of this Bill and of the Stock Theft Act. I think once a brand has been made on an animal, it should not be capable of physical cancellation on the animal. If an animal that is branded is sold, and it bears a registered brand, and the next purchaser does not have a registered brand, he should bear the consequences of not having his own identification on the animal, for after this Bill becomes law, he will not be able to place an unregistered mark on the animal any longer. It will also contribute to most farmers having only registered brands eventually. If it is a purchaser of an animal, and he also has a registered brand, then in my opinion a system of sequence should be prescribed, to provide where Owner No. 1 should place his brand and where the second owner should place his brand, etc. I do not believe that although you find different brands on animals, that there will ever be more than five or six. In any event, I have never seen more than that, and I think there is a place on an animal where it can be indicated in sequence who is the owner thereof without damaging the hide. I do not know whether it is going to be feasible for the Department, but if they do not want the provisions of this Act and the Stock Theft Act to be a failure, they certainly must not try to legalize the physical cancellation of brands on animals. In my opinion that will make both the Acts quite ineffective.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to raise a few points with the Minister arising out of this Bill. Let me say this that I think the Bill is widely welcomed particularly in the Transvaal Province whose members in this House have not so far said a great deal about this Bill in spite of the fact that that is the province with the greatest number of cattle in the country. In the course of his speech the hon. the Minister referred to the present system of branding and registration of identification marks of animals in the Transvaal. I asked the Minister across the floor of the House whether it was the intention, when this Bill became law, to retain the existing system of branding and the registration of brand marks in the Transvaal. The hon. member for Nelspruit (Mr. Faurie) made an appeal to the Minister to retain the existing system. The Minister replied to me in these words, I think &#x201C;Ek kan nie &#x2019;n versekering gee nie&#x201D;. The Minister said that he could not give any assurance that this present system would be retained in the Transvaal. The question immediately arises in my mind&#x2014;and I hope the Minister will take this further when he replies&#x2014;whether, when this Bill becomes law, it is intended to initiate an entirely new system of registration of brand marks for the whole country. If that is so it will mean that every owner who wishes to register a brand mark will have to make a fresh application immediately this Bill becomes law for the issue to him of a new brand mark. I can envisage considerable difficulties arising from that, Sir. <span class="col_6843-6844" refersTo="page_0668"/>I think the Minister should state clearly what the intention is once this Bill is placed on the Statute Book. It is of considerable concern to every farmer who runs any number of cattle and any farmer who in the past has had a registered brand mark. If the Minister cannot give us the assurance that the system which operates in the Transvaal at least&#x2014;I cannot speak for the other provinces&#x2014;will be retained, it will mean in effect that the majority of the farmers as far as the Transvaal province is concerned will be required to re-brand all their cattle on the issue to them of a new brand mark by the Registrar. According to the system operating in the Transvaal at the moment each district has its registration letter with subsequent identification letters and numbers. I hope that the Minister will tell us what the intention is when he replies. I think this is an important matter and one which is going to affect a great number of farmers. It is one on which we should have absolute clarity in discussing this Bill.</p>

<p>There is another aspect to which I want to refer. Whilst it is rightly said that there will be no compulsion on any owner of cattle to brand, there is in fact a degree of compulsion in this Bill. I wish to get clarity from the hon. the Minister in regard to the provisions of Clause 18. As the Minister knows there are a large number of farmers&#x2014;I speak for the Transvaal and the Bushveld areas&#x2014;who have brand marks on their cattle which are not registered. In some case the marks have been passed on from father to son. In most cases where a brand mark has been retained throughout the years those people are prominent breeders although that mark has never been registered as a mark. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister this question, because it says in Clause 18&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall:</block>

<p>(a) subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), brand any livestock with a brand which is not registered.</p>

<p>If this Bill becomes law the position will be this that those well-known brands, those brands which by now indicate quality as far as the cattle are concerned, will be illegal. My question to the Minister is this: Will those people have the opportunity of applying to the Registrar for the continuation of that particular brand? Because the moment he continues to brand his cattle with the brand which he has been using for years he will, in terms of this Bill, be breaking the law. I think this is an important aspect of the Bill which I hope the Minister will consider. Because if a new system of branding is to be introduced I think provision should be made in the Bill for exemptions. But nowhere in the Bill do I find any provision in terms of which an exemption can be given in respect of a particular mark.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as far as breeders are concerned. Take the brand XYZ, for example. People have come to know that as a mark of quality, yet it has not been registered. I would ask the Minister to give some consideration to this aspect that an exemption may be granted by the registrar, perhaps endorsed by the Agricultural Union or the local farmers&#x2019; society, in these cases and that that particular mark may be registered even though it does not conform with the system which the Registrar himself has laid down for the Transvaal Province or for the Republic as a whole, because I take it that a completely new system is going to be introduced.</p>

<p>I wish to associate myself very strongly with the plea made by the hon. member for Nelspruit in regard to the numbering of animals. I cannot talk for other provinces but I can talk for my province. It is the practice in the Transvaal amongst numbers of farmers to use a numbering system either for breeding purposes or for checking their herds. The number is usually branded, say, six to nine inches away from the actual registered brand mark. In areas which are thickly populated by cattle it has become a recognized system as an additional form of identification. Also in the case of breeders it is the easiest system which has yet been evolved of checking on the production rate of a cow. There is in fact no easier system for the purposes of keeping records, than the numbering system of the animal itself. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would consider including some provision in the Bill in the Committee Stage in terms of which the Registrar will be empowered to give an exemption in certain circumstances where a case has been made out. I think the Minister should tell us in his reply whether the intention is to introduce a completely new system of branding throughout the Union when this Bill becomes law and whether the existing systems in each province will be put aside completely. I would like to have complete clarity on that point from the hon. the Minister, because I believe the farming community want clarity in that regard.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister and other hon. members have mentioned the fact that it is necessary to have some control over branding to protect the hides. I would support any measure which is introduced for that purpose. I was amazed the other day to hear from the officials of the Government who deal with hides and skins that in the case of the Transkei where we have over 2,000,000 sheep and over 1,000,000 head of cattle, the wool cheque is only &#x00A3;1,000 more annually than the cheque for hides and skins. So if the hides were better cared for the income of the area will be even greater than the income from wool. It is difficult to believe, but that that is what the officials have told me.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister has had consultations with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in regard to <span class="col_6845-6846" refersTo="page_0669"/>the application of this Bill to the Native reserves. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) has referred to the difficulties which have been experienced in applying the Stock Theft Act to Natal. I can assure the hon. the Minister that it will be much more difficult to apply that Act to the Native reserves. In that Act the Minister is given the power to exclude certain areas from the operation of the Act and I have no doubt that representations will be made to him to exclude certain Native reserves from the operation of that Act. I should like the Minister to give us an undertaking that when we come to the Committee Stage of this Bill he will insert a clause which will empower him to exclude certain areas from the operation of this Bill when it becomes law.</p>

<p>My idea is not that the Native reserves should be excluded for all time from the operation of a measure of this kind but what I do ask for, Sir, is that it should be applied gradually, that we do not apply this Bill as it stands to-day to the reserves. I ask for that because in the first instance you will have great difficulty in explaining it to the Bantu people and secondly you will have great difficulty in applying the Act. As the Minister will know the Bantu do brand, although admittedly they do not brand with hot irons as much as they use the ear mark, but they do brand. I can imagine the confusion which will follow amongst the Bantu when they find that they are not allowed to brand unless they have had that brand registered. It will mean that every member of the Bantu race who wants to brand his cattle in future will have to apply to the Registrar for a brand. The Registrar will have to issue a different brand for each Bantu, not only for the stock as a whole, but for each house. Where the Bantu have a different brand for each house it will mean that they will have to have different registered brands for the various houses if they wish to continue marking in that way. I want to support the plea made by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that the Minister delete the provisions in regard to the cancelling of marks. I am not talking about the cancellation of registered brands, but the cancellation of the brand itself. The Minister and hon. members opposite will no doubt often have seen cattle from Native areas and the disfigurement caused by the obliteration of marks. If a stock thief or even a person who becomes a owner of a beast legally, wishes to alter a mark he often cuts the whole mark out. He sometimes cuts the whole ear off, as my hon. friend has said. He obliterates the mark with a hot iron or he cuts it out completely with a knife. Just imagine the suffering of the animal in cases like that, Sir. I say, therefore, that I would rather see it being made an offence for anybody to obliterate a mark instead of giving him legal permission to do so.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was dealing with the cancellation of marks. I said to the Minister that I would prefer to see it made an offence to cancel a mark rather than to make provision in this Bill for a mark to be cancelled. I also pointed out that as far as the Natives were concerned there were innumerable marks. A Native owner would not only hold cattle in his own name but he would hold them in the name of the different houses. He may have a different mark for every house. The difficulty will be to register all those marks. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will bear me out that under Native custom, such as the lobola system, for instance, cattle often change hands. Under the lobola system the cattle have often to be returned and if the cattle are going to be marked by the one owner and then returned to the original owner you may get the same beast with three brands on it, each one cancelled as the beast is transferred and when the beast is returned to the original owner he gets branded for the fourth time. I hope, therefore, that as far as the Bantu are concerned this Bill will not be applied at once.</p>

<p>There is a further difficulty in respect of the branding of sheep. In terms of this Bill a brand is not a brand if it is made with paint on large stock. I take it then that it is a brand if it is made on small stock. If a Native, or a European for that matter, marks his sheep with paint it becomes a brand and unless that brand is registered he commits an offence. I know that there is another Act which makes it an offence to brand sheep with paint unless the paint is a washable oil so that the wool is not damaged. I think it only becomes an offence when the wool so branded is offered for sale; I do not think it is an offence to brand the animal as such. The Minister will know that they do mark their sheep and I feel that in terms of this Act it is going to become an offence. Because even if they do use a washable oil it may still be described as a paint. You will find that the Bantu in particular do mark their sheep in this way. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us in his reply whether it will be an offence for them to mark their sheep in that way, that is, to use a paint. I am raising these points now because we want to know what amendments we must prepare to move in the Committee Stage. The Minister may say that these matters should be raised in Committee but we want to know how the Bill is going to operate as it stands.</p>

<p>As I pointed out before the Stock Theft Act which is now applied to the reserves is causing considerable difficulty. I think the Minister of Justice will be approached one of these days by the Minister of Bantu Administration to suspend the operations of that Act in the reserves. In terms of the Stock Theft Act he can do so because there is a provision which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6847-6848" refersTo="page_0670"/>The Minister may, by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, declare that any or all of the provisions of this Act relating to produce, shall also apply either generally or in any area specified in the notice or any area other than areas so specified in respect of any such class of farm produce not mentioned in the definition of &#x201C;produce&#x201D; in Section 1 as specified in the notice.</block>

<p>So he can exclude certain areas or certain types of stock or produce from the operation of that Act. All I am asking is that in the Committee Stage the Minister will agree to include a provision in this Bill which will empower him to suspend the operation of this Act from certain areas. I do not think he has that power as the Bill stands at the moment. That is why I am appealing to him now to include such a provision.</p>

<p>There is another point, Sir, with regard to the marking of cattle and sheep at sales. The Minister will know that it is the custom, especially in the reserves to mark the cattle with paint. If the cattle are going to remain in the reserve for even a week or longer before trucks can be obtained or transport arranged from the reserves, it is necessary to hot-brand them. Different brands are used by the buyers not necessarily their own brand but the brand which the auctioneer gives them. You will find that buyers, particularly speculators, often use more than one brand on the same sale. They buy the cattle for different purposes with the result that different brands are used by the same owner. As there is a number of buyers at the same sale the auctioneer is the person who keeps the branding irons and he decides which iron will be used. That will also cause difficulty especially in the reserves where the Native Trust organize the sales and invite speculators and buyers to come from other parts of the country to buy cattle there. I want to know from the Minister whether the auctioneer who has such branding irons in his possession will be committing an offence because those branding irons could be used for hot-branding as well; indeed, they are used for hot-branding. I want to make quite sure that the auctioneer who has these branding irons for a good purpose will not be committing an offence in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>I return to sheep. Sheep must be marked at a sale. They are marked with oils and not branded. I want the Minister to make it quite clear that the marking of sheep with oils at a sale will not constitute an offence unless that brand is registered. You cannot expect every buyer who comes to a sale to have a brand registered. He may only be there to buy one or two animals for some special purpose and he may not necessarily have a brand registered. He and the auctioneer may be placed in this position that they will be committing an offence if they mark the sheep with oil described as paint.</p>

<p>I am glad the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is here. I will be pleased if the hon. the Minister who introduced this Bill will tell us whether he has had consultation with the Department of his colleague in respect of the drafting of this Bill and in respect of its application to the Native reserves.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker I should like to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for having supported the broad principles contained in this Bill. Of course it was to be understood that there would be certain misgivings. However, I should like to say that the greatist objections in principle raised by members on both sides are in connection with Clause 13. Originally there was a clause in the Bill providing for the compulsory cancellation of brands, once an animal changed hands. I agree with the idea that has been expressed that if we were to permit that in principle, you would really be destroying the most valuable provisions of the Bill, because if you permitted a method of cancellation of brands, either by a cross-line drawn across the brand or something else, you would be opening the way for stock thieves to falsify that cancelled mark and then there would be no proof that the animals belonged to somebody else. Now the principle of the cancellation of a brand has been omitted from this Bill. Because the principle of cancellation has been deleted, it seems to me that Clause 13 as it now stands is superfluous, and I am prepared to move an amendment in the Committee Stage for it to be deleted. With that there will then also fall away the five-yearly re-registration of brands, as well as the power the Minister has under Clause 13 (2) (b) that such notification may be given in any form, and then also the objection that it shall be published in the <i>Gazette</i> only, and not by the agricultural unions, falls away. I believe that where the Bill in other respects makes provision for the cancellation of the registration of a brand, it goes far enough. One need not cancel the brand itself. Where this Bill possibly in some respects still causes misunderstanding in respect of the cancellation of a brand as such, I shall undertake to put it right before the Committee Stage, and if I am unable to do so in this House, I shall do so in the Other Place. The object of the Bill is that we seek only to cancel the registration of a brand because there may be offences committed by a person who has a registered brand, and he accordingly will have to be deprived of his brand. Then you should have the power to cancel the registration of the brand in his name, and also in other cases of deaths and estates, and of persons in whose name a brand may be registered, but who for some reason no longer use it. Then you want to cancel it out of his name, but you want to have the right to allot it to a new applicant. Does the hon. member for South Coast follow me now?</p>

<p>Where we should really differ is in the Committee Stage. I am prepared to accept any reasonable proposal which will make this Bill as reasonable as possible. I do not want to create any hardships for anyone. I want the greatest possible co-operation from all interested parties.</p>

<p>The question has been put to me by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) as to the meaning of &#x201C;any thing&#x201D;. It means any thing whether it is alive or dead, which may be needed as proof by the police to prove their case. Where the hon. member talks about a brand, it really means a hot brand and not a mark, whether it is made in oil or with paint. The Bill refers only to marks put on an animal by a hot iron, so that it will be a permanent mark. That is the meaning of the word &#x201C;brand&#x201D; in this Bill. No other mark, whether it is placed on an animal by an iron, whether it is dipped in paint or not, can be registered, neither will the use thereof be regarded as an offence in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>I cannot introduce the word &#x201C;permanent&#x201D;, because then you will have to define it. Even a hot brand, if it only scorches the hair, may be regarded by the owner as being permanent, but other people may not regard it as permanent. Then you must define &#x201C;permanent&#x201D; and &#x201C;temporary&#x201D;, and I think that would be a most complicated definition. For that reason we must leave it as it is, that only hot brands can be registered and the tattoo marks on sheep.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Therefore all oil brands on sheep will not be included in that definition.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>No, if you have made an oil mark or a paint mark on an animal, we do not call it a brand. You have simply given it a number or a name, but it is not a brand. In Afrikaans "brand" means a mark made with a hot iron which is intended to be permanent. Accordingly, all the other kinds of marks, whether you made them on the ear or on the body, are excluded from this Bill.</p>

<p>Now we come to sheep. The hon. member for Transkeian (Mr. Hughes) referred to that. The only permanent mark we recognize in respect of sheep, that may be register under this Act, is not a tattoo mark on the ear, because you can remove it too easily. We contemplate a tattoo mark somewhere on the body, behind the shoulder, that is permanent but which you cannot readily see from the outside, but if you pull the sheep down you will be able to see the mark. In respect of the general question whether we contemplate a new series of marks, my reply to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) is emphatically yes. If we wish to apply the law throughout the Republic, it follows necessarily that we have to devise a new series of brands that can be registered. It is not such an easy matter. I believe it will take several months before we will have clarity on what that series will look like. That is why it cannot be provided beforehand already that the brands that have already been registered in the Transvaal, will be included in this series, for it may prove to be quite impracticable. But now the Act provides that in the meantime, before this Bill comes into operation, those brands will still be regarded as registered brands in the Transvaal, and have the force not only of proving identification, but also ownership, for it can be proved that it has been the registered mark of the man; and even if this Bill is in operation, and such animals are stolen, and the owner decides he no longer wishes to have a brand registered, then I think the Stock Theft Act really comes into operation. I should like to tell the House, as general knowledge that this Livestock Brands Bill does not replace the Stock Theft Act. It is only an additional thing or means that will be placed on the Statute Book to make the Stock Theft Act work more easily. But we cannot combat the whole evil of stock theft by registered brands alone. As regards the various loose figures, the reply is exactly the same. If this series of brands is worked out, and figures are not used in the series, I cannot see why it cannot be provided by regulation that people may even brand a number. But if the series includes numbers, it will be a dangerous thing to permit other numbers to be branded.</p>

<p>The question is whether the difficulty exists that all people will have to re-brand their livestock. The fact is that it is provided here that all people who wish to make use of a branding iron will have to register the brand after this Bill has come into operation and the series has been compiled. I may just say that people who have had registered brands, will be able to acquire a new registered brand without any extra charge.</p>

<from><span class="col_6851-6852" refersTo="page_0672"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>He may re-brand but he is not obliged to. The man who has a registered brand, can decide that he is not going to register again and that he will take the risk because under the old registration he has had adequate protection. There is no duty on anyone who used a brand before this Bill comes into operation, when he registers a brand again, to brand his livestock with it again but he may do so if he wishes. Even in the Transvaal that is so. The hon. member for Nelspruit (Mr. Faurie) says he never rebrands livestock he has bought from somebody else while he has a registered brand, because he does not want so many brands on his animals. So it is optional and no owner is compelled to register a brand.</p>

<p>As regards the other matter the hon. member for South Coast has referred to, that we should go slowly, because I mentioned that it may possibly culminate in compulsory branding of livestock&#x2014;I agree with him. There is not the slightest intention to enforce this upon the farmers, but I believe that in course of time people will realize the value of such a registered brand, to the extent that public opinion may compel the State to amend the law and to make it compulsory. It may be after my time, but I believe that this Bill has this value to a farmer who desires protection, and that it will pay him to do so.</p>

<p>To the hon. member for Transkeian Territories I should like to say that there has been the closest cooperation and consultation between Bantu Administration and myself. That is why, in the first place, an exception is made for group brand marks the Department itself wishes to apply. But further discussions are still in progress and we are considering the possibility of introducing an amendment at the Committee Stage that will result in the use of brands for various Bantu tribes. The Transkei now has a brand which we are exempting, which indicates that it is a Transkeian animal, but in the Transkei there may be tribes which want to have a tribal brand, and we are considering that. I should like to give the assurance that we want to be as careful as possible with the Bantu, for we want to take him along with us. But I am afraid that if he wants to apply a hot brand to his animals, as distinct from the tribal mark, to show that it is his property, he will be compelled to register a brand in his name. But there are enough ways in which you can mark your own cattle, perhaps by a mark on the ear, even if it is not quite permanent. But if you want to distinguish your livestock permanently from the others, then we cannot permit some people to use branding irons and others not. I am thinking, e.g. of what the hon. member has said in respect of animals that are sold at an auction sale. I think that if people who have registered brands go to an auction, the least you can expect of them is that they should take their branding irons along with them. [Interjection.] The speculator may also register a brand for himself, but he will not be permitted under this Act to use a hot branding iron if it is not registered in his name. The speculator can also use other means of identification. If it is not practicable to pull down an ox at an auction and give it a permanent brand with a hot iron, he can apply other marks that are not applied with hot irons. But if you want to permit the speculator to use branding marks that are registered at auctions why then do you want to compel the farmers to brand only with registered irons? I think it is a basic principle that will have to be maintained that only brandmarks that are registered may be used to place a permanent mark on an animal. If we abandon that principle we have nothing. I think that will be generally appreciated.</p>

<p>I feel I have now replied to most of the points and objections, particularly now that Clause 13 falls away.</p>

<p>Before requesting the Secretary to read the next Order of the Day I should like to make a few remarks in connection with the instruction to the Committee of the Whole House on the General Law Amendment Bill of which notice has been given by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker).</p>

<p>The purpose of an instruction is to request the House to empower a Committee of the Whole House on a Bill to consider the advisability of incorporating therein amendments which, although relevant or cognate to the subject matter of the Bill, introduce new and important principles not contemplated by the House at the second reading of the Bill. There is, however, another type of amendment which is either foreign to or destructive of the principles of the Bill as read a second time and which cannot be introduced even on an instruction.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) in his instruction requests the House to grant leave to the Committee on the General Law Amendment Bill to consider the advisability of making provision therein for a right of appeal to the courts by any aggrieved person. <span class="col_6853-6854" refersTo="page_0673"/>In terms of this legislation any decisions which the Minister has to make are final, and in my opinion an amendment which gives an aggrieved person the right to appeal to the courts of law against such decisions would be completely destructive of that principle. I therefore regret that I cannot allow the instruction to be moved.</p>

<p>On Clause 2.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 2 relates to an organization which, in the opinion of the State President (which means the Cabinet or the Minister) is carrying on the activities of an unlawful organization. If we read the whole clause or section, as it will now be completed, it provides that the State President may declare an organization unlawful if he is satisfied that (a) the organization professes Communism, or (b) the object of the organization is to further Communism, or (c) the organization engages in activities which are calculated to further the aims of Communism as defined in the Act, or (d) the organization is controlled by a communistic organization, or (e)&#x2014;which is the new provision now being inserted&#x2014;the organization carries on or has been established for the purpose of carrying on, directly or indirectly, any of the activities of an unlawful organization. Now, I think. Mr. Speaker, that we should examine for what type of organization the Minister tends to use his additional powers of banning, and why he declares certain organizations to be illegal or unlawful. I must refer, of course, particularly to one committee, the Centlivres Committee for the Defence of Civil Rights. That is the one the Minister attacked so venomously. In referring to this organization, in regard to which the Minister has shown that he has the most absurd suspicions, we must not overlook the fact that he did not even know its name. He confused it with another organization, the Civil Rights League. May I ask him whether he intends to us the powers given to him by this clause to ban either or one or both of these organizations?</p>

<p>What I say is in connection with the clause which gives the Minister the power to ban organizations like this Defence of Civil Rights Committee, which is headed by the Hon. Mr. Justice Centlivres, who is its chairman. I am referring to the fact that the Minister has clearly shown that anyone who opposes this Government is called a communist and that he intends to ban organizations consisting of law-abiding people. He has no hesitation in calling great, honourable South Africans communist agitators &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>That is untrue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is untrue. The Minister said in the second-reading debate that this Committee for the Defence of Civil Rights is led by the Congress of Democrats, and then he went on to say that the Congress of Democrats are communists. He said that I subscribed to an organization which is led by communists, and inspired by communists. Now, in terms of this enlarged clause he can declare an organization unlawful if that &#x201C;organization is controlled by a communists organization&#x201D;. In fact, he did say it was. As he believes that, so he can use this <span class="col_6855-6856" refersTo="page_0674"/>section as it now stands, getting additional powers from the amending clause where he introduces the vague term &#x201C;directly or indirectly&#x201D;, in order to ban these two organizations. He may ban organizations like these as &#x201C;unlawful organizations&#x201D; and thus classify people like Prof. Beinart, Mrs. Ballinger, Adv. D. B. Molteno, the Ven. Wood, the Very Rev. King (the Archdeacon and the Dean of Cape Town) and Mrs. Stoy of the National Council of Women, in addition to ex-Chief Justice Centlivres, with communists, merely because they oppose this Government. I say that we will not let him ride roughshod over us in this way; we will not let him goosestep over the grave of democracy, which he is now digging. I say that this clause will be used in a shameful way. I say that the Minister should not be trusted with the powers contained in this measure. I say this because he has shown that he judges by hearsay; he is the judge and he is going to decide what should be done in terms of this clause; he decides whether an organization is or is not &#x201C;unlawful &#x2019;. What a judge! He listens to telephone snoopers and bases his decisions on what he hears &#x2026;</p>

He has shown that he relies on unchecked telephone-tapping stories. That is the only way in which he could have got the information on which he based his false charge against me. I challenge him to deny that allegation. Added to that he did not even know how to distinguish the one organization from the other! Sir. I conclude by saying that we cannot and will not be prepared to grant powers of this wide nature to a Minister who has shown himself quite unfit to exercise impartial justice in any cause that might come before him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. FOUCH&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite clear from Clause 2 what is envisaged and which kind of organizations the hon. the Minister has in mind. We have often been faced with the problem in the past that having gone through the long procedure of banning unlawful organizations, a new organization simply pops up under a new name which carries on along the same lines and then the whole process has to be gone through again to ban that new organization which is simply a successor of the previous one. Those organizations are the only ones which are aimed at in this clause. If the Minister is convinced that the new organization is simply a continuation of the old one, he should have the right to ban it. It is a very clear fact that those are the organizations which this clause is aimed at and I appeal to the hon. the Minister to insist upon this clause.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know what the long processes of the law are to which the hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;) referred. As far as I can see the hon. the Minister has vast powers already in terms of the existing laws. The section which the hon. the Minister wants to amend by means of this clause, that is, Section 2 of the principal Act, already gives him vast powers. In terms of this section as it stands he may ban any organization that professes. Communism, propagates or furthers the principles or objects of Communism, which engages in activities which are calculated in the opinion of the hon. the Minister to further those objects, or even one which is controlled by any other organization of the kind just mentioned. He has very vast powers already to ban any organization which he believes is calculated to further the aims or objects of Communism. But every now and then the Minister strikes a snag. Some organization that he has banned, some meeting that he has banned, some gathering of persons that he bans, appeals against the ban and the Minister finds every now and then that he loses the case in the courts of law. Sir, these are not long processes of the law that we are talking about; they are the normal rights of redress enjoyed by people whom the hon. the Minister has banned or gatherings that he has banned. As I say, he already has vast powers in terms of Section 2 of the principal Act. People have appealed against his decision in the courts of law and they have had redress there. It is to this, Sir, That the hon. the Minister takes exception and that is why he now comes forward with an amendment to Section 2 of the principal Act, which in fact will empower him to ban the activities of any organization, even if such activities were entirely lawful and had nothing whatever to do with Communism. It also enables the hon. the Minister to ban any organization which indirectly in his opinion, may be carrying out the objects of an organization which has been banned&#x2014;directly or indirectly. For instance, one might even get to a stage where the hon. the Minister decides that an organization which has been set up to try to raise funds to defend persons whom the Minister is prosecuting under the Act, should <span class="col_6857-6858" refersTo="page_0675"/>be banned. Any organization of this kind which attempts to provide normal defence will now be banned by the hon. the Minister, and that is the purpose of this clause. It is not the long processes of the law that the hon. the Minister is trying to circumvent; it is in fact any redress to the courts whatsoever. Sir, I hope that this House, if it has any concept of democracy as it is practised in any other country in the world this side of the Iron Curtain, will think very hard indeed before it grants the hon. the Minister even more extensive powers than he now possesses under the principal Act. I hope therefore that the Committee will negative this clause.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. member who has just sat down I think I can honestly say to this Committee that there is nobody in the Parliament of South Africa whose meetings have been more often prohibited under the Riotous Assembly Act than mine. I, therefore, wish to put a pertinent question to the hon. member. She belongs to the Jewish race. There were seven or eight Jews in Parliament at the time and not a single one of them got up in this House to plead for me the way she is pleading for the communists to-day. The hon. member can check it in Hansard; not a single one of them did. Morris Alexander was here and Morris Kent-ridge and a number of others; they were members of the Jewish Board of Deputies and they did not say a word. I say that if this is a question of freedom of speech, which is what the hon. member professes to be pleading for, then a voice should have been raised in protest from those benches, either by the Opposition or by the Government, in those years when I was persecuted like that by Gen.

<p>I really think that this clause is drafted in the widest possible terms. In terms of this clause, as drafted, the Minister takes the power unto himself to deal by way of banning with any organization which carries on or has been established for the purpose of carrying on directly or indirectly any of the activities of an unlawful organization. The hon. the Minister will appreciate that an unlawful organization may carry on lawful undertakings as well as unlawful undertakings, and as I read this clause, the hon. the Minister would be able to ban any organization which carries on any of the activities of an unlawful organization; in other words, let us assume that an unlawful organization carries on some perfectly lawful activity; in terms of this clause the Minister would be entitled to ban such an organization. I do not think the hon. the Minister intends taking such power. I think all he intends doing is to deal with any organization which carries on any of the unlawful activities previously carried on by a baned organization. I do feel that the hon. the Minister should take this clause back for the purpose of further consideration, because as it is presently drafted it would be competent for any Minister of Justice to ban an organization merely because it carries on some of the lawful activities of an organization which has been banned. The clause, to my mind, is so widely drafted, that it will cover any organization carrying on any of the lawful activities of an unlawful organization. If the Minister thinks that additional powers are necessary, then I think this clause should be re-drafted so as to curb the powers of the Minister to deal with organizations which carry on unlawful activities and not lawful activities. I agree with the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) who has already pointed out that under Section 2 of Act 44 of 1950, there already exists adequate powers under which the Minister can deal with any organization which carries on unlawful activities. I say that as this clause reads the Minister&#x2014;not necessarily this Minister but any Minister of Justice&#x2014;could curb the activities of any organization even though it carries on lawful activities once it is proved that the activity carried on by it is similar to the activity carried on by an unlawful organization. I urge the hon. the Minister to give re-consideration to the drafting of this Bill.</p>

Can the hon. member give me an example of any legal act which an unlawful organization can do? He did not give us any example, Sir. If an organization is an unlawful one that organization cannot perform any lawful activity. But that is not all; I should also like to know from the hon. member what innocent organization has ever been banned under this Act? All the organizations which have been banned were undermining organizations and nothing else. If the hon. member can give me an example of one organization which was banned and which functioned legally, I would be prepared to listen to him but the hon. member cannot give me such an example. The problem which faces the Minister is the fact that the same people who belonged to the organization which was banned, simply continue their activities under the following organization. You find that they subscribe to the same principles; the same documents are found in their possession; it is exactly the same organization except that it has a new name and the hon. the Minister only wants to take action against those organizations under this Clause, not against innocent organizations. I shall be pleased if hon. members will give us the name of any innocent organization which has been banned in the past</p>

<p>I do not want to go back again to the remarks that the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) except to say that he justifies the clause with which we are dealing for a very peculiar reason, and he does so for a still more peculiar cause. Sir. I think the hon. the Minister should take the Committee into his confidence and tell us precisely what type of organization he intends to deal with under this clause. There are a number of organizations in existence, and I think he should tell the Committee precisely what their nature is and why he wishes to deal with them.</p>

<p>Then I come back to the remarks of the hon. member for Smithfield <span class="col_6861-6862" refersTo="page_0677"/>who seems to justify this rather wide and harsh provision on the ground that it would hasten the proceedings. The only hastening of proceedings is that the Minister will now be able, in anticipation, to ban an organization which he will then call the successor to an unlawful organization. Surely the correct procedure in justice is to allow a situation to show itself, and not for the Minister to anticipate what is going to happen. Because that is precisely what this power is that we are now going to give him if it is defined in the way that the hon. member for Smithfield has indicated. Sir, hasty justice is no justice at all, and the hon. the Minister knows that very well. I think that this clause is unduly wide. It is, as I described it in the second reading debate, a monstrous power to give a Minister of Justice, unless he can justify it by examples and I invite him to do so now.</p>

<p>I am surprised at hon. members for attacking this clause the way they are as if it is the first time that they have heard of such a clause in this House or as if it is the first time that hon. members opposite have been asked to vote for such a clause. Those hon. members have very short memories. Not only have they heard about such a clause but they unanimously&#x2014;each one of them&#x2014;voted for this clause. This clause has been taken over word for word from Act No. 34 of 1960 which was supported by hon. members opposite. For the purposes of the record I want to read that clause which hon. members voted for and which was transferred word for word from that Act to this Bill. You can then judge for yourself, Sir, whether hon. members on that side have a case or not.</p>

<p>I take it that certain hon. members will say that they did not vote for it. I read the following from Act No. 34 of 1960&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Governor General is satisfied that the safety of the public or the maintenance of public order is seriously threatened or is likely to be seriously threatened in consequence of the activities of any organization which in his opinion has been established for the purpose of carrying on directly or indirectly any of the activities of any body which has in terms of sub-section (1) been declared to be an unlawful organization, or of any organization which in his opinion directly or indirectly carries on or proposes to carry on any of the said or any like activities, he may, without notice to the organization concerned, by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> declare such organization to be an unlawful organization.</block>

<p>In other words, this section goes much further than the clause to which hon. members opposite are objecting. The position is very clear, as has been stated by hon. members on my side of the House, namely that what we are doing here is to close a loophole which we expect will exist where a communist organization has been banned. The hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), of course, was quick to rise to his feet, even before the hon. member for Houghton who has an amendment on the Order Paper, whereas his party has not.</p>

<p>The hon. member possesses a large amount of the one but unfortunately he does possess too much of the other. Let me tell him at once, seeing that he has asked me the question, that I do not in the least intend to ban the organization of Mr. Centlivres. I will definitely do so even less when that hon. member shows the courage of publicly joining that organization, because if he does so I know that this Bill will receive even greater support than it is already receiving to-day. I want to state it very clearly that the object of this clause is purely and simply this that where an organization is banned, as hon. members know, certain machinery has to be set in motion; it takes that machinery months and months to produce a report. Just as happened in the case of Rhodesia we in this country can expect that when organizations are banned, they will immediately re-appear under a different name. I have given hon. members the example of an organization which was banned by the Rhodesian Government. It was none other than a political party which was banned by the Rhodesian Government. The next day that party continued its activities under the same office bearers and in the same offices under the name of the Zimbabwe Peoples Party. If it were done there there is no reason for us to believe that it will not also be done here because the <i>modus operandi</i> of those people is precisely the same, whether they operate in Rhodesia or anywhere else. Hon. members are at liberty to ascribe motives to the Government and to me as much as they want to. I repeat that the only reason why this amendment has been placed before the House is to close loopholes of that nature. I am determined <span class="col_6863-6864" refersTo="page_0678"/>not to allow this kind of organization to make a fool of the Government as it has made a fool of other governments by appearing the next day, after it has been banned, and carrying on with the same activities as though nothing has happened because they have availed themselves of certain technicalities. That is why this clause simply provides that such an organization can be banned without first setting in motion the machinery to obtain a report on the facts, if you are convinced that that organization, directly or indirectly, is continuing to promote the objects of the banned organization. I think, therefore, that it is right and proper that the principal Act be amended and it is obvious that it is definitely not my intention to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t think anyone can deny that both in actions and intention; in our consistent opposition to its aims, we on this side of the House hate Communism as the devil hates holy water, We dislike the communist as much as the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) both of whom at one time embraced and practised the doctrine of National Socialism, liked Nazism. We have shown where we stand. The hon. the Minister has now become a lover of law and order; he is only a lover of law and order as long as he makes the law and as long as he barks out the orders. He always attacks our courage when he gets up to speak. I say what I think to him straight out. He resorts to sly innuendo after listening to his little telephone snoopers who come to him with inaccurate, unchecked stories. He does not attack openly and directly, always indirectly, through a backdoor. He now says &#x201C;I will not ban the Centlivres organization&#x201D;. Why then did he call it a communist organization. Why then did he say that it was led by communists, by the League of Democrats? Those were his words at the second reading; &#x201C;the Civil Rights Protection Committee was led by communists&#x201D;. Now sub-section (d) of this clause refers to &#x201C;an organization which is controlled by a communist organization&#x201D;. The Minister said in this House that the Centlivres Committee and its members were controlled by a communist organization. Will he deny that? He better read his Hansard report, and he will see that he said it. Yet now he says he will not ban it. I say that he exhibits more than inconsistency. He exhibits all the tendencies of a man who still believes in National Socialism. We should remember, Sir, that only the accident of our winning the war, prevented him from becoming Gauleither of the Eastern Province.</p>

<p>I think for the purpose of the record, it should be made perfectly clear what the circumstances were under which the Act to which the hon. the Minister has just referred, that is the Unlawful Organizations Act No. 34 of 1960, was passed by this House. Hon. members will remember that at that time, March/April, 1960, the country was in a state of emergency. An emergency had been proclaimed over a vast number of districts in South Africa, and the Government came before Parliament and said that this was an essential measure in order to preserve the security of the state, and to preserve peace and order. Now the hon. the Minister read sub-section (2) of Section 1, and I invited him to read the following sub-section (3), which says &#x201C;any proclamation issued under sub-sections (1) or (2) shall remain in force for a period not exceeding 12 months&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister was less than candid when he castigated this side of the House for having supported words similar to those presently being discussed when the Unlawful Organizations Act was dealt with in 1960. The hon. the Minister read a section, a portion of the sub-section concerned where, of course, the words we are dealing with do appear, but one has only to glance for a moment at the context of the amendment we are presently dealing with and compare it with the context of those words in the Unlawful Organizations Act to find that no comparison can be made at all. I invite the hon. the Minister to look again at subsection (2) of Section 1 of the Unlawful Organizations Act, where the words we are dealing with in the Bill presently before the House are directly related to and qualified by the Minister having to be satisfied &#x201C;that the safety of the public or the maintenance of public order is seriously threatened or is likely to be seriously threatened in consequence of the activities of any organization which, in his opinion, has been established &#x2026;&#x201D;, and then follow the words we are dealing with. In other words, he can only make use of that wider qualification if he has satisfied himself as to the requirements of public safety. In that context those words, even if they are capable of the wide interpretation we suggest they are, have a safeguard, quite clearly. But if one looks at the context of Section 2 of the Suppression of Communism Act, and one puts in the amendment which the hon. the Minister now seeks to put in, the wording is absolutely unqualified. All that is required is that the Governor-General must be satisfied in terms of these words, and then he can ban. So quite clearly the hon. the Minister has not scored a point when he attempts &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_6865-6866" refersTo="page_0679"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is so. The one cannot be used as an argument against the other. There is no comparison. Then the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) suggests that one cannot conceive of any lawful act which can be done by an unlawful organization. Well, if he were in trade, I doubt very much whether he would support the point of view that if an unlawful organization tries to pay its debt, it is doing something unlawful. I think the argument of the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) stands. At its lowest, this amendment in Clause 2 is capable of two interpretations: the one is that you get at the organization, which, I believe, is the hon. Minister&#x2019;s intention, and get at a similar organization dealing with similar activities only if it is carrying on its activities for the benefit, so to speak, of the unlawful organization, or if it is doing things which are unlawful because they are what the unlawful organization does. I believe that is what the hon. Minister wants to get at, judging by the speech he has just made, but these words here are so wide that they are quite capable of the interpretation that if there is a mere similarity between one activity of an unlawful organization, although that activity is perfectly lawful in itself, if there is a similarity between that and another activity carried out by some other organization, divorced entirely from the unlawful one, the Minister is thereby empowered to ban the latter of those two organizations. It is that wide. But that is not the hon. Minister&#x2019;s intention, as I understood his speech. He does not wish to have that power. He wishes merely to get at a similar organization, a rose by another name, which is carrying on the activities which were unlawful when done by the earlier one. If that is his intention, surely his road is clear, and he must modify this clause so that it is not capable of the interpretation which we say it is capable of. He should remove the objectionable part of the clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know what the United Party has in mind in opposing this clause. In the first place they have omitted to move any amendments and in the second place the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) has moved an amendment to the effect that the entire clause should be deleted. Had they wished to improve it it would have been their duty to formulate an amendment or amendments; if they want to reject the entire clause it is their duty to second the hon. member for Houghton. They are doing neither of the two.</p>

<p>In the second place, unlike as is provided for in the Suppression of Communism Act, under the Unlawful Organizations Act of 1960 it is within the discretion of the Minister to find that an organization is a danger to the State, and if the Minister, in the exercise of his unlimited discretionary power, finds that he has to ban an organization, then in precisely the same terms as contained in this clause, he can ban the successive organization. I say that it is unadulterated nonsense which hon. members are talking and they know they are talking nonsense when they say that this clause gives the Minister more power than the 1960 Act on unlawful organizations gives him. In this case the provisions are coupled with the Suppression of Communism Act which prescribes a procedure to be followed whereby the original organization should be found to be a communistic organization or one which supports Communism. The only point which hon. members opposite have is that in terms of the Unlawful Organizations Act the proclamation of the Minister is effective for 12 months, and in this case there is no such limit. That is the only point which hon. gentlemen have. Their third attack is based on this that related organization can be drawn into this and even the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) was not serious when he advanced that argument. The first and foremost significance of this clause is obviously that the Minister&#x2019;s power is limited to organizations which carry on the activities of unlawful organizations, in other words, that there is a &#x201C;nexus&#x201D; between the organizations themselves and not only between the kind of activities which they perform. Mr. Chairman, if we were to interpret this clause very strictly according to formula, we would perhaps be able to advance the theoretical argument that in certain respects the clause can be abused or even applied to an absurd extent. Very few powers vesting in human beings do not lend themselves to something like that. But when we look at the record of the Government over the past years and when we consider the fact that no Minister who has been so empowered has abused that power&#x2014;hon. members are laughing but let them mention one instance where the Suppression of Communism Act has been abused&#x2014;they are not able to meet the challenge and to prove that those powers have been abused. Let them mention one instance where it has been abused. Surely there is this guarantee that the Minister has to account to Parliament, not only to members opposite as a powerless Opposition, but to members on this side as coresponsible members of the governing party. Are you suggesting that these powers will be abused here in South Africa? No, I say the United Party is either wasting time on this clause or putting up meaningless opposition, because had there been any sense in their opposition, they would have moved an amendment or they would have supported the hon. member for Houghton, but they are only talking now to show their ill-will.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) suggests that further amendments should have been introduced in relation to this clause. I cannot see the purpose of any further amendments, because my contention is that under the existing law the Minister has ample powers to deal with the banning of any organization if he feels that the activities of that organization <span class="col_6867-6868" refersTo="page_0680"/>are unlawful. I think that the hon. the Minister has ample powers now. The hon. member for Kempton Park has pointed out that no examples have yet been given of any misuse by the Minister or his predecessor of the existing powers that the hon. the Minister possesses. I cannot give any examples of misuse and I do not suggest for a single moment that there has been any misuse up to now, but what I do suggest is that this clause as it now stands is so wide in its terms that there exists a possibility of misuse in the future, because in terms of this clause the hon. the Minister can, without being answerable to the courts or to Parliament for that matter, at his own discretion declare an organization which he considers is carrying on, directly or indirectly, any of the activities of an unlawful organization, place a prohibition on that organization and ban such an organization.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>It is not necessary in terms of the Rules and Orders that that amendment should be seconded, but I am prepared to say that I am in favour of negativing this clause because I think it is unnecessary for the reasons I have mentioned. This clause to my mind widens the scope of the Minister&#x2019;s powers to such an extent that no organization in future will be safe. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) asked whether we can give any examples of an unlawful organization carrying on lawful activities. There are hundreds of examples that comes to one&#x2019;s mind. I will just mention one. An organization is established which has as its object the propagation of Communism in the first place. That is unlawful, but its second object is to collect funds for the Cape Times Fresh Air Fund, which is a lawful object. That is one example. The hon. member laughs, but there are hundreds of activities which are lawful and which can be carried on by an unlawful organization. But in terms of this definition if they carry on such lawful activity, the Minister can ban them, despite the fact that some of the activities of such an unlawful organization are perfectly lawful. The hon. the Minister in trying to justify the wide terms of this clause, drew attention to the fact that there exists a similar provision in the Unlawful Organizations Act No. 34 of 1960. As one of the previous speakers has already pointed out when this Act was passed in 1960, it was passed virtually as temporary legislation. And it was passed at a time when this country was faced with an emergency. This clause, however, which we are considering now is intended to become the permanent law of this country.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Does that affect the principle at all?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I should think so. In an emergency this Parliament is prepared to face up to certain steps of a temporary nature, but it is a totally different thing when it is the intention to make it the permanent law of the country. In terms of the Act No. 34 of 1960, the hon. the Minister before he could do any banning had to be satisfied in respect of various things. In the first place the ban was directed against a body known as the Pan African Congress or the body known as the African National Congress, and by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> he could ban them. Then in sub-section (2) he could only ban a similar organization if he was satisfied that the safety of the public or the safety of public order was seriously threatened, or was likely to be seriously threatened in consequence of the activities of the organization, and if it had been established in his opinion that it was carrying on the activities of a body which in terms of sub-section (1) had been declared an unlawful organization. In other words, there was the prerequisite to any banning that the Minister had to be satisfied that the safety of the public or the maintenance of public order was seriously threatened. Now in terms of the clause that we are considering at the moment, there is no such prerequisite. The hon. Minister can, either he or his successors, if they so wish ban any organization merely because that organization is carrying on one of the activities of an unlawful organization and notwithstanding the fact that that particular activity happens to be a legal and lawful one. I say that it is unnecessarily wide and I think the Minister would be well-advised in the circumstances to reconsider this clause, particularly as this is likely to remain the permanent law of the country. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that the Minister does not require additional powers, and if he does require further powers, they could be so drafted as to bring them within the scope of reasonableness.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to explain once and for all that the object of this clause is nothing more nor less than to make it impossible for a banned organization either directly or indirectly to continue with its activities afterwards. I readily admit that as it stands it is broad, it is wide. But surely I said at the second reading that it was deliberately framed in such a broad and wide way because I did not want to come back to Parliament every second day and because&#x2014;and I make no apology for this&#x2014;I wanted to close <span class="col_6869-6870" refersTo="page_0681"/>the loopholes once and for all as far as this legislation was concerned. I will, therefore, not reply again to the arguments to which we have been listening the whole afternoon. That is my attitude in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) tried to get away from and to elude the fact that the official Opposition voted for the Unlawful Organizations Act in 1960, by shielding behind the preamble to the relevant Section which reads: &#x201C;If the Governor-General is satisfied that the safety of the public or the maintenance of public order is seriously threatened&#x201D;. There is no difference whatsoever between that wording and the wording in this Bill. If the Governor-General is convinced that an organization is dangerous, he can under the Public Safety Act ban that organization, and in this case with which we are dealing at the moment there must first of all be a lengthy investigation. In other words, it is not only a question of the Minister or the Cabinet or the State President having to be convinced. In terms of the 1950 Act a report on the facts has to be submitted and motivated. In other words, this Act goes much further than the 1950 Act to ensure that organizations will not be discriminated against. But in spite of that the Opposition voted for that Act. Let me ask the hon. member for Peninsula this: Does a principle change according to whether you accept it on this day or that day, or does a principle remain the same in all circumstances? My contention is that a principle is not influenced by the time when it is accepted. If it is wrong to accept this principle in these circumstances, in view of the dangers which I have sketched to hon. members which are threatening us on the part of communists and their fellow-travellers, it was equally wrong to accept it in 1960. Time does not affect the principle. A principle remains equally true no matter the circumstances in which you are faced with it. Consequently I do not appreciate hon. members&#x2019; argument. I repeat that to the extent to which we interfere with this clause to that extent will we be encouraging that type of organization which hon. members know will be affected by this clause. Hon. members know as well as I do that no innocent organization will be affected by this clause or will even know of its existence.</p>

<p>That is precisely the point that we have made on this side of the House continually. The Minister is taking far more powers than warranted. This is the first time that the Minister has admitted it. What the hon. Minister in effect has just said is that he is taking additional powers because he does not want to come back to Parliament again. The hon. member for Kemp-ton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) is a lawyer, he admits that this is in effect what this clause does, but all that the hon. member for Kempton Park could say was that we cannot bring any examples of misuse of the powers under the Suppression of Communism Act, and therefore we can trust the hon. the Minister and we can give him the power to curtail and to determine the rights of all these individuals. I must say the remarkable thing about giving this hon. Minister the power is that this hon. Minister is the only Minister of Justice, I think in the history of South Africa, who began his career as a Minister of Justice with the statement to the Afrikaanse Sakekamer, somewhere in the Transvaal, that all rights are getting out of hand.</p>

<p>The hon. member will see what happens when the Chairman puts the question. The hon. the Minister said that he wants the powers in this clause because he does not want a repetition of what happened in Rhodesia between the Zimbabwe People&#x2019;s party and the government there. Well, Sir, the Unlawful Organizations Act banned the A.N.C. and the P.A.C. The P.A.C. and the A.N.C. or any other organization, as has been pointed out, will be affected. If he wants to ban one of them which in his opinion furthers one or more of the objects of the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. he can ban it. Even if it does not and it affects the safety of the State he can ban it. Under this very Act if the Minister suspects that one of the purposes of any organization is to propagate or promote the spread of Communism or further the achievements of Communism he may, by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i>, declare the organization to be an unlawful organization. So, Sir, if it is Communism which the hon. the Minister is fighting in this clause then he already has the power in terms of the principal Act to deal with them. If he is afraid of the Zimbabwe Peoples&#x2019; Party or the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. he was given the power in 1960 to deal with them.</p>

<p>What an incredible thing for the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) to say. The Minister must apply his mind to the organization whether he acts under the clause in this Bill or whether he acts under the old Act; he still has to apply his mind to it.</p>

<p>What the hon. member for Vereeniging seems to forget is this: If this clause were passed into law the hon. the Minister would still have to apply his mind. He still has to determine whether it is an organization which has been established for the purpose of carrying on directly or indirectly any of the activities of an unlawful organization. So he has to apply his mind to it in any case, Sir. If he feels that it is communistic or might further the aims of Communism or has one object which might do so, then he can ban it under the Suppression of Communism Act. If, on the other hand, it is an organization which is not communistic but which he thinks might affect the safety of the State then he can ban it under the Unlawful Organizations Act.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister does not in fact need these powers for the purpose that he has said. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to tell the Committee what he really wants these powers for. I think if the Minister is going to rely for support of this clause on the sentiments expressed by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) and the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) I think the Minister is expecting a lot from a Parliament which hopes to keep any of the powers it has, by saying in effect &#x201C;Give me all the powers then I won&#x2019;t have to come back and bother you any more&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a pity that we have to continue in this absolute nonsensical and shocking way of wasting the time of this Committee. I want to tell the hon. member who has just sat down that he has not been in this House for long, but that every piece of legislation of this type was opposed with precisely the same arguments. Even in those cases where the United Party voted in favour of it, it was opposed by the then Labour Party, by Mrs. Ballinger and others, and precisely the same arguments were advanced by Mrs. Ballinger, Mr. Hepple and their supporters. The argument was the same namely that the Minister can abuse his powers. Let us get this very clear. It is quite correct, and it is not necessary for them to make such a hullabaloo about it&#x2014;of course, the Minister can abuse his powers. Of course he can ban the United Party; of course, he can ban any organization if he wants to. It is not necessary, therefore, for them to make such a hullaballoo about that. He could have done that a long time ago because he has the power today to do so. But if the Minister were to do that, if he were to abuse his powers and ban an organization which was completely innocent, what would the Minister be faced with in such a case? In the first place he has to keep count of the Cabinet. I want to ask the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) this: Does he honestly think that if the Minister abused his powers he would remain in the Cabinet for another week? In that case it will no longer be a so-called Nazi Minister; then it will be the entire Cabinet.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Honestly, Mr. Chairman, surely it is quite true what I meant. It is the party opposite which referred to the Minister as a Nazi Minister&#x2014;not in this House. Their newspapers and their supporters outside did so. It would not be allowed in this House. If the Minister abuses his power he will be faced in the first place with the Cabinet. If he were to abuse his power and were to ban an innocent organization, he would in the second place be faced with the National Party caucus. And thirdly he will be faced with this House. These hon. members would have us believe that the hon. the Minister could simply ban an innocent organization and that that would be the end of the story. Of course it is not the end of the story. The other side of the House say these things time and again. Let us be dear on this point: The Minister can abuse his power, but in that case it still rests with the Cabinet to decide whether he acted correctly; it rests with the National Party caucus and with this House to decide whether he acted correctly, and it rests with the electorate of South Africa to decide whether he acted correctly. If the Minister wishes to abuse his power there are many respects in which he can abuse it. I want to make a test. I want to ask those hon. members this: Do they agree that the A.N.C. had to be banned? I think they agree with that. In any case they agree that the P.A.C. had to be banned. I now want to ask the hon. member for Durban (Point) this question: If he agrees that the P.A.C. had to be banned and imagine the leaders were Sebukwe and Nandela and a number of those people. Very well the day after the Minister has banned the P.A.C. they form, not another P.A.C., but a P.A.D. or a P.A.K. or something else, but Mandela is chairman and Sebukwe is secretary&#x2014;exactly the same people. The hon. member for Durban (North) should be reasonable. If something like that happens does he not think the Minister should have the power to put an end to it immediately?</p>

<p>He has not got the power. The position to-day is this that <span class="col_6873-6874" refersTo="page_0683"/>before the Minister can ban an organization he must institute an investigation. Reports have to be submitted and a long procedure has to be followed before he can ban an organization because if he does not do that the organization can go to court. It is a process which takes months. The point is this that the P.A.C. which was banned yesterday, reappears to-day as the P.A.D. but the leaders are the same&#x2014;Sebukwe, Mandela and the rest of them. The Minister cannot ban them. He must first go through the whole procedure again.</p>

<p>May I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not want to reply to the question. As I say, the Minister must go through the whole procedure once again. Only one duty rests on those hon. members opposite and that is to say that they refuse to give this power to the Minister. If they think that the Minister should have the power when an organization such as the P.A.C. is banned to-day and reappears tomorrow as the P.A.D. with precisely the same members, to ban that organization, they should get up and say it. If they think the Minister should have that power, and if they think this clause goes too far and that it can be done in some other way, those &#x201C;bright boys&#x201D; should get up and tell us in what other way it can be done. Mr. Chairman, if they were to move amendments I am quite convinced that if the Minister were sure that they would serve his purpose, he would consider those amendments. But not one of them has advanced any argument along those lines. I do not believe that hon. members opposite are communists. I do not believe that the majority of them support that type of person, but they are only doing what they are doing to create the impression in the world outside that the Minister is taking far greater powers than he needs and that he is taking these powers in order to abuse them to the detriment of innocent organizations. I say that is a shocking allegation. Had there been any ground for it it would have been a different matter. If one member opposite could give one example or a few examples where former Ministers of Justice, with all the powers they had taken, had abused those powers, they might perhaps have had a case. In that event people would have been scared. In that event they would perhaps have made me scared of giving the Minister such wide powers. But they did not give a single example of that nature to the House. I repeat this Mr. Chairman: If hon. members opposite cannot reply to this they have lost their case completely. If there is such an organization and it reappears the following day under the same people, with one or two insignificant amendments to its constitution, should the Minister have the power to ban it? I say that if they are not prepared to reply to this question they are not serious in this debate and they are only wasting time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) wants an answer to his question. I want to tell him, Sir, that you do not have to be a bright boy to be able to read an Act passed by this Parliament. The answer to his question is very simple, it is this: He asks what is the Minister to do if the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. is banned and to-morrow operates under the name P.A.D.? The answer to that is that if the Governor-General or the State President as he is to-day, is satisfied under the Unlawful Organizations Act that the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. has reappeared in a different form he has the power under that Act to ban it. That is the simple answer to that question.</p>

Another thing which the other dull boys in that corner seem to have forgotten is that it was to be banned for a period of one year at a time. That was renewed the other day during the course of this Session.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Why? I will tell the hon. member why. Because the purpose of this House, as I understand it, is to legislate; to make laws so that the individuals will know what their rights are under the law. Not so that the Minister can determine what their rights are. That is not the rule of law. The rule of law, Sir, which the hon. the Minister earlier in the Session described as a useful political slogan, means simply and plainly that you are entitled to know what your rights are under the law, and to be governed by the law. That is how we on this side of the House understand the law. My answer to the hon. member is that the individual must know what his rights are under the <i>law</i> and he must not have to rely on whether the hon. the Minister will be nice to him or will not be nice to him. The hon. member over there does not believe that the Minister can do anything which is wrong. He does not believe that he will misuse his powers. He may be right; I do not know. But I do not think it is the function of this House to determine the character of the Minister. It is the function of this House to determine what powers and functions he shall have over the individual.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) objects to the somewhat lengthy process which is peculiar to our system and under which there is a greater chance of justice prevailing, having to be followed. Like many other people, the hon. member has also been involved in a court case. In his case it did not relate to Communism, but to pornography.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>How would he have felt if in a case in which he was seeking his rights, the judge could simply use his own discretion without the required legal procedure being followed, and if the judge had been permitted simply to take a hasty decision. Our whole parliamentary system is in fact based on checks to eliminate over-hastiness. The mere fact that we have a House of Assembly and a Senate is due to the fact that, even with the large number of legislators which we have to examine matters, we do not want a Bill of the house of Assembly to become law until it has first gone through the Senate. We are opposed to undue haste, because we want to make sure that justice will prevail. Hon. members opposite are now raising the objection that the Minister cannot act quickly enough. Mr. Chairman, the measure of delay which exists under the present powers and which place some restriction on the Minister are in fact basic to the whole democratic system, and that position should remain.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth North (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) has said that an unlawful organization or an organization which has been banned cannot have lawful objects. Most communistic organizations want the mines to be nationalized. That is one of their many objects. But there is a Minister in the Cabinet who has that same object.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am mentioning this to show how wide the Minister&#x2019;s powers are. One the basis of one such object the Minister can summarily ban such an organization without any inquiry into its general objects. Mr. Chairman, the crux of the matter here is just this. This side of the House feels that no matter what degree of delay the present procedure may embody in order to ensure justice as far as possible, the hon. the Minister has the necessary powers to ban any successor organization without undue delay. The A.N.C. and the P.A.C. have long since already been banned, and identical organizations have not replaced them, as hon. members opposite apparently seem to fear will happen. That has not happened yet. It this has happened, I shall be glad if the Minister will give us the facts. But even if that should happen, we on this side feel that the Minister has the necessary powers to deal with such a situation. Secondly I listened carefully to the Minister during the Second Reading debate, and I must say that my impression was that he is a most imprecise Minister, judging by the remarks he makes. He is so strongly prejudiced politically that I form the impression that he does not investigate a matter sufficiently before summarily forming an opinion regarding such matter. We know the Minister, he is inclined to form an opinion regarding a person or organization without well-founded evidence. I therefore say that the behaviour of the Minister is such that I do not have sufficient confidence in his descretion to give him these further powers.</p>

<p>The accusation that I am politically biased has now come from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). It is true, Mr. Chairman, that I feel very strongly about matters and principles. But the hon. member will obviously not appreciate that because he does not think in terms of principles but in terms of seats. There is obviously a vast difference.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that the sole object of this clause is to deprive a banned organization of the right to continue existing in any form. I think that nobody, who listened to the debate impartially, does not know that this is the intention and does not grasp that this is the intention. But I wish to add that the communists will be laugh heartily up their sleeves to think that, if we do not take steps, we could be such fools that we go through the entire process&#x2014;in which they do not believe; which they have never respected and which will certainly not continue to exist if they get their way&#x2014;that because of the type of arguments which have so far been advanced, we are prepared to allow them to continue doing as much harm as they possibly can until those processes have come to an end, in spite of the fact that we know, as the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) that it is the same persons with the same aims with which we are dealing. They will indeed think that we are the biggest fools in the world and they have every right to think so, if we do not now put an end to that type of action by legislation in Parliament.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister sought to answer the hon. member for Zulu-land (Mr. Cadman) by referring to the fact that an investigation must take place before the powers in Section 2 of the Suppression of Communism Act could be invoked. But I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that this safeguard, if it can be called one, certainly does not apply so far as concerns the new power which the Minister is taking in Clause 2 (b) of the Bill which inserts a new sub-section (c) in Section 2.</p>

<p>My answer to the Minister is this. At the very best from his point of view there is an investigation; but he is no in any way bound to act upon the recommendation of the investigating body, nor does it state that he can only act after there has been an investigation and after it has been determined that the safety of the Republic or the maintenance of public order is seriously endangered.</p>

<p>You can have an investigation but you need not accept their advice nor accept the recommendations of the investigating body, whereas in terms of the Unlawful Organizations Act very different considerations apply.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with a point raised by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn), a point which was also touched upon by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). Because I think the approach which their speeches indicated is possibly genuinely believed by members opposite to be a justifiable one. The hon. member for Kempton Park said &#x201C;Wys my net een geval waar die Wet op die Onderdrukking van Kommunisme misbruik is That was the line on which the hon. member for Vereenigng also proceeded. This, Sir, is the whole point. People can be prohibited from attending meetings, people can have their rights limited in countless ways without the right of recourse to the courts of law. Consequently it is not possible for us, or for hon. members opposite, to say whether there has been a misuse of powers or not. In fact, we know that at least half the people who are indicted following an instruction by the Attorney-General are found not guilty. Therefore the probability is that, if many of these people, whose rights are affected, could in fact resort to the courts, they would be able to show that there has been an abuse of power. This is the fact which emphasizes so much the great wrongs which can follow where there is a denial of the right to approach the court. I think that where the hon. the Speaker ruled that for us to come with a motion for an instruction to the committee to permit an appeal to the courts, was destructive of the principle, bears out the entire attitude of this side, namely that we had to fight the second reading in order to prevent the complete negation of the right to resort to the court. That is the reason, I suggest, why the hon. the Minister has found himself with a misunderstanding with the Bar Councils. Because he thought there were only the two principles in the Bill which he enunciated, namely combating Communism and sabotage whereas we know, and after the Speaker&#x2019;s ruling it has been proved, that many fundamental rights are in fact denied in this Bill.</p>

Whether it is because it is one of the principles in the Bill or not I do not know, but the fact remains we will not be able to put these amendments on the Order Paper. It has now become a principle which we cannot amend. To come back to the immediate clause which we have been discussing, the hon. the Minister in an interjection, said that this side of the House did not understand that before an organization could be banned there had to be an investigation. Precisely, Sir, and that is what one wishes to retain, that the Minister must make an investigation.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am over-rating the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s swiftness of mind. As far as I am concerned he acts only too swiftly. Whenever he does not like an organization or a person it does not seem to take him anytime at all to get his way.</p>

<p>I want to come to a point made by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) when he said that the object of this clause was purely and simply to make sure that people like Mandela and Sebukwe, for instance, former members of the A.N.C. and the P.A.C. which had been banned, could not form a new organization and call it the P.A.D. and continue with the same objectives. The Suppression of Communism Act makes it quite impossible for those people to do that. Any person who has been banned&#x2014;and all these people have been banned&#x2014;cannot, according to Section 3 of the principal Act in any way&#x2014;and I hope the hon. member for Vereeniging will listen to this&#x2014;take part in any activity of the unlawful organization or carry on in <span class="col_6879-6880" refersTo="page_0686"/>the direct or indirect interests of the unlawful organization, any activity in which it was or could have been engaged at that time. Surely, Sir, that will prevent any person who has been banned from continuing with any activity under another name. They could not belong to any such organization. It says &#x201C;any organization carrying on <i>indirectly</i> the objects of the unlawful organization&#x201D;. I believe that the Minister had too wide powers there but he is now seeking even wider powers. He need not investigate, he need not go through any of the processes which the Suppression of Communism Act lays down. That Act has already been amended several times in this House&#x2014;at least twice. And each time a Minister of Justice comes back to the House to amend the Suppression of Communism Act it is to take wider and wider powers. We have had a complete erosion of the normal civil liberties enjoyed by citizens of this county. Not only communists, this goes far wider than only Communism. It can affect anybody. It affects anybody whom the Minister feels is directly or indirectly carrying on any of the objects of an unlawful or banned organization. That is why it is such an objectional clause. I do not care that this is exactly the same clause contained in the 1960 Unlawful Organizations Act. I do not know whether it is the same and whether or not the Minister is drawing the correct analogy. I do not believe he is. But as hon. members here have pointed out, there were prefaces to that clause and additional conditions which did make it somewhat different, but I must point out that the Unlawful Organizations Act is a permanent part of our law, and the question of coming back to the House once in 12 months does not make the slightest difference, because the hon. the Minister comes back to the House. He comes back this year, and he came back last year, and nobody raised a finger against him, so therefore he has those powers and is using them, and it is no good trying to pretend that there are such vast differences between that section in the Unlawful Organizations Act and this clause. As far as I am concerned, both are thoroughly objectionable clauses, and I voted against them then and I shall vote against them to-day.</p>

<p>I want to get on to this question of the abuse of powers. Various hon. members like the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) and others have said: Show us examples of abuse of powers. I will give two examples. One is the banning of the Coloured Convention last year, and the other is the banning of Patrick Duncan as a communist.</p>

<p>The fact is that Patrick Duncan is opposed to the Government and he is vehemently opposed to Communism also. Every argument he has used in every issue of the journal he edited was strongly anti-communist. But I do not believe that examples should be sought. The point is that we want limitations in the statute of the powers of the Minister, and we do not simply want to rely on the Minister not abusing the vast powers he is taking. The point I want to make is that there is an old medical saying that the more you eat the more you want to eat. But I think here is also another saying which we can use in this House, and that is that the more power you have the more you want, and that is what is happening to this Minister and to this Government. It has vast powers, and the more powers it has the more it wants.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Before we discuss this clause, I just want to explain, and I do so for the benefit of the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), that this clause deals with communists and communists only. If hon. members will look at Section 5 of the principal Act they will see that people who are affected by this clause are in the first place people whose names appear on the list, i.e. listed communists or people who were active members of the communist party before 1950 when that party was banned and people who had the opportunity to prove to a legal officer that they were not members of the communist party and who failed to prove it or who ignored it. In other words, it deals firstly with the active members of the old communist party and secondly with people who have been found guilty under Section 11 of the Act in the past, i.e. they propagated Communism. Thirdly it deals with people who are known communists. Hon. members must please not advance the argument that it can apply to any person because it is quite clear that the Bill makes no mention of an intention to do so because that provision relates to communists and communists only. The former section said &#x201C;not to attend any gathering in any place within an area and during a period specified in the notice&#x201D;. All that is being done now is to put this more clearly because of problems which we have had in this respect, but to which I need not refer because hon. members are aware of them. We now put it in two parts, viz. &#x201C;not to attend any gathering or (2) any particular gathering, or any gathering of a particular nature, class or kind&#x201D;. In other words, it is quite clear that in the one case we are concerned with meetings with a common purpose and secondly with meetings with no common purpose. It is to give effect to certain decisions of the courts regarding which meetings have a common purpose and which do not have a common purpose.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation, I want to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the commencement of line 29, to insert &#x201C;not being a gathering or gatherings of a <i>bona fide</i> domestic, social or religious nature, nor necessarily incidental to the carrying on by such person of any lawful trade, business, profession or occupation&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The purpose of this amendment is to try to limit the Minister&#x2019;s powers in regard to listed persons attending meetings. The Minister is perfectly right when he points out that the section which this clause amends is Section 5, which refers specifically to persons whose names appear on the list, or who have been convicted of an offence under the Anti-Communist Act. It is therefore clear that this specifically applies to listed persons, but notwithstanding that, I think the Minister is really taking tremendous powers against listed persons, and if the Minister wants to make political capital out of this I could not care less. The Minister is really going very far now. He says that he does not wish listed persons to attend any gathering whatsoever, be they gatherings with a common purpose or any religious or social gatherings, or gatherings which persons may have to attend in order to earn their living. Far-reaching penalties can be applied to listed persons if this clause is adopted. The Minister gives as the reason for this certain difficulties which arose out of cases decided in the courts. I believe the main reason for this is the case of Rex v. Kahn, in 1955, where the court emphasized that the Legislature could not possibly have intended that the Minister should have power under Section 5 of the principal Act to prohibit a person from all social intercourse with his fellow-men, despite the fact that such a person was listed. The courts held that there were certain limitations intended in the existing law. As the result of this, the Minister finds that he cannot ban listed persons from attending gatherings that are not gatherings for a common purpose, which is the main reason why he is later going to amend the definition of &#x201C;gathering for common purpose&#x201D;, by removing the reference to common purpose from the definition of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;. I think this is a cruel provision, even against persons who are listed as communists, to give the Minister the power to ban such a person from all social intercourse with his fellow-beings, and to prevent him from attending any meeting whatsoever, whether it is social or religious. I think that is going very far indeed and therefore I move this amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 38, after &#x201C;Gazette&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and by notice under his hand addressed and delivered or tendered to them&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Clause 4 empowers the Minister to prohibit certain persons from becoming office-bearers or officers or members or certain organizations. As the clause reads at present, if the Minister wishes to prohibit a person, he need only publish a notice in the <i>Gazette</i> and he need not give any notice to the person concerned. My amendment is designed to make it obligatory for the Minister not only to give notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, but also to give notice to the person concerned. I believe that this amendment is not only reasonable, but, having regard to the severe penalty for failure to comply with the prohibition, I believe the amendment is also necessary. I suggest that it is surely unreasonable that a person should be prohibited from doing certain things without giving him personal notice that he is prohibited. The position is even more unreasonable when one has regard to the type of publication in which the notice is to be published. If the notice were to be published in a publication which is widely read throughout the country, the position would not be quite so unreasonable, but in fact the notice will be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>, which is read by very few people indeed and which has a very small circulation. In order to justify the clause as it stands, the Minister may argue that he may find it impossible to trace the person concerned so as to be able to give personal notice to that person. Sir, that argument may be justified in relation to some parts of the Act&#x2014;I say &#x201C;may be justified&#x201D; I go no further&#x2014;but I suggest that it cannot be justified in relation to Clause 4 because Clause 4 deals with persons whom the Minister should have no difficulty in tracing. Clause 4 empowers the Minister to prohibit a person from being an office-bearer, etc., of certain organizations. There are two types of persons hit by this clause, the person who is already an office-bearer, member or officer of an organization and whom the Minister wishes to prohibit from continuing as such, and the person whom the Minister wishes to prevent from becoming an office-bearer, officer or member of an organization. In the case of a person who is already an office-bearer, officer or member of an organization, there can be no difficulty in tracing him. He can be traced through <span class="col_6885-6886" refersTo="page_0689"/>the organization concerned. In the case of the person whom the Minister wishes to prevent from becoming an office-bearer, etc., I suggest that even in that case there should be no difficulty in tracing the person concerned because if he is likely to become an officebearer, officer or member of the particular organization, then his whereabouts must be known, and the Minister will then be able to serve personal notice on him, as well as publishing the notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. I suggest therefore that it is reasonable to expect that there should be personal notice in addition to notice in the <i>Gazette</i>. But I think one can go further. One can, I believe, show that if one has regard to the severe penalty for failure to comply with the notice, it is not only reasonable that personal notice should be given to the person concerned but it is necessary that that should be done. The penalty is one of imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. The court has no discretion to impose a fine; it must order some period of imprisonment. The person concerned may be completely ignorant of the prohibition and may be honestly ignorant of the prohibition, because he may not see the <i>Government Gazette</i> in which the notice appeared. I believe that it is reasonable and necessary that the person who is to be prohibited should be given notice, in addition to the notice appearing in the <i>Gazette</i>, and I therefore move the amendment which stands in my name.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Minister will not accept this amendment because the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (Musgrave) (Mr. Hourquebie) simply represents a negation of the whole clause. The Minister&#x2019;s difficulty, as he said in his second reading speech, is that these people who must receive this notice and on whom this <i>infamia</i> is imposed so that they cannot hold certain offices, do not make it very easy for the Minister and the police to service the notices on them. The hon. member&#x2019;s amendment cannot be aimed at securing the serving of personal notices, because Section 5 of the principal Act already specifically provides that the Minister must give such a person personal notice. It provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may by notice in writing addressed and delivered or tendered to the person concerned, require any person &#x2026;</block>

<p>But if that person hides away and the police cannot find him at all, then the Minister, according to the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, must still seek him out and serve the notice on him personally. Let us examine the wording of the amendment. It must be signed by the Minister and it must be addressed&#x2014;that is easy&#x2014;and delivered or tendered to the person concerned. Both these verbs imply that this must be done in the presence of the person concerned. If the hon. member wants that, then the position will be very much worse and even more restrictive than the very situation the Minister wishes to counter. I therefore, say that this is an absolute negation of what the hon. the Minister wants to do. In this particular case it only relates to persons &#x201C;whose names appear on any list in the custody of the officer referred to in Section 8 or who were office-bearers, officers or members of an organization which has under sub-section (2) of Section 2 been declared to be an unlawful organization&#x201D;. In other words, these are all people who came within the ambit of Section 5 of the principal Act, that is to say, the communists and the communists alone, as the hon. the Minister has made clear, The hon. member for Musgrave now claims that these people do not know of the position, that they are quite ignorant, that they are like strangers in Jerusalem, that they are sweet innocence personified. Mr. Chairman, before a person&#x2019;s name appears on that list, he has a very long history. A liquidator is appointed if a communist organization is involved. There is a long story involved. The person had the opportunity to say why his name should not appear on the list, and in terms of this Bill he even has the opportunity to ask that his name should be removed from that list. What is more, when he is affected because he is a member of an organization which is affected by other later provisions, he will also know how late in the day it is as far as he is concerned. I think it is no more than right and reasonable to expect of those people that they should know what is in store for them. All the people who are communists, all the people who are communistically inclined, must know that the people of the Republic of South Africa are ill-disposed towards them; they are becoming less well-disposed by the day, an anyone who pleads on behalf of such people is tarred with the same brush. I want to tell the hon. member that the submission he has made here will not be interpreted as a humanitarian plea; it will be regarded as representing great concern for the communists.</p>

<p>I would like to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 48, after &#x201C;except&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;a partnership, company, syndicate or other association of persons exclusively engaged in carrying on any lawful trade, business, profession or occupation or an association of persons membership whereof is necessary for the carrying on by such person of any lawful trade, business, profession or occupation, or except&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The purpose of this amendment is similar to the purpose of the amendment which I moved in Clause 3, and that is to try to limit the powers of the Minister. The Minister already has the vast powers under the relevant section that he seeks to amend, and what I suggest now is at least to exclude from the orbit of ministerial power, people who are engaged in &#x201C;a partnership, company, syndicate or <span class="col_6887-6888" refersTo="page_0690"/>other association of persons exclusively engaged in carrying on any lawful trade, business, profession or occupation or an association of persons membership whereof is necessary for the carrying on by such person of any lawful trade, business, profession or occupation I know that there are certain exceptions already included in the law, that is to say, persons belonging to registered trade unions; I know that they are exempted from certain provisions of the Act, but there are other such organizations which are not exempted. There are all the professional organizations and various other trade associations other than employees&#x2019; associations or employers&#x2019; associations, which fall within the exceptions. I believe that the hon. the Minister should limit his powers so as not to interfere with the normal earning of his livelihood by a person, even though the Minister has listed that person. In his second reading speech when the Minister was discussing Clause 8, the house-arrest clause, he said that one reason why he was introducing this was to enable him to keep people under his control but at the same time allow them to go on earning their livelihood. I suggest that the Minister&#x2019;s own argument could be used here in support of limiting his powers in this particular clause by not making it necessary for such persons who have been listed to get his permission or his exemption before they can join the necessary professional or other organizations which are necessary to carry on their trade or profession.</p>

<p>Hon. members will see that as the clause now reads, it only states that persons may not become office-bearers. The intention is not only to provide for the future; we therefore have to insert the words &#x201C;being or&#x201D;. In other words it relates to the present as well as the future. The words &#x201C;particular organization or&#x201D; are only being inserted to clarify the position. Apart from the amendment of which I gave notice and which I am now moving, I also wish to move another amendment in the same clause, and I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 46, after &#x201C;from&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;being or&#x201D;; in line 47, after &#x201C;any&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;particular organization or any&#x201D;; and to add the following proviso at the end of subsection (1) of the proposed new Section 5<i>per</i>:</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that the Minister shall not issue any such notice in relation to any employers&#x2019; organization or trade union registered under the Industrial Conciliation Act, 1956 (Act No. 28 of 1956), except after consultation with the Minister of Labour.</block>

<p>Hon. members will find this same provision in Section 5 of the principal Act. It was actually not necessary to insert it here as well, but I only do so because I want to put the position very clearly so that there can be no misunderstanding in respect of the matter.</p>

<p>With regard to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (Musgrave) (Mr. Hourquebie), under normal circumstances one would have had no objection to this amendment. In substance the argument which he has used, is quite correct but the hon. member is unfortunately forgetting the circumstances with which we have to deal. Firstly I wish to repeat that the people with whom we are dealing are essentially the same people with whom we dealt in the previous clause, namely listed communists, people who are guilty of offences. Now we are adding people on whose movements restrictions are placed under the Suppression of Communism Act as a result of their activities. I say that under normal circumstances one would gladly have accepted the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment were it not that for all practical purposes it would be impossible to implement his proposal, because if we do implement his proposal it would mean firstly that we would have to serve another notice on all the old members of the communist party. Apart from their numbers, the fact remains that one does not know what their addresses are at the present moment. But apart from that, the fact remains that many of them have run away and cannot be traced or that many of them will run away if one wishes to serve such a notice on them. As if this is not sufficient, do hon. members know that the communist party and the communistic elements  at least 30 to 35 different organizations; it is the Congress of this and the Youth league of that and the Congress of this and the Youth League of that. There are between 30 to 35 communistic organizations who may be affected by this provision. Althought it may sound very good in theory to say that one must serve a notice on the man concerned, it would be impossible in practice because of the circumstances which we have to combat. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument that the people will not see the notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> does not impress me. Hon. members will know that these communists will be the people who will know first what has been published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. They are the people who are wide awake; they are not as innocent as the hon. member for Musgrave thinks they are. In fact they are the most alert people we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that every one of them will know immediately that it relates to them, the fact still remains that every prohibition under this provision, as the hon. member knows the Press and as I know the Press, will immediately appear in the Press. If it does not appear in the daily papers the hon. member can be sure that it will appear in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, and if it does not appear in that paper, and if hon. members want a still worse paper, it will appear in the <i>Sunday Express</i> of that Sunday. But the hon. member can be sure that it will appear in a newspaper <span class="col_6889-6890" refersTo="page_0691"/>and the argument that these people will not know what is going on can therefore not be advanced. I therefore want to repeat that if it were not for the circumstances which I have mentioned, I would gladly have accepted the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment because basically I find nothing wrong with it, but it is impossible for me to put his proposal into practice.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that the Minister disagrees with the argument advanced by the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze). It is unnecessary for me therefore to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. The Minister has made it very clear that what he intends to do under this clause is to deal generically, if I may use that word, with three groups of people: persons whose names appear on the list, persons who were office-bearers of officers of an unlawful organization and thirdly, persons in respect of whom any prohibition under this Act has been served. The hon. the Minister has moved two amendments in effect. The first one is to insert the words &#x201C;being or&#x201D; after &#x201C;from&#x201D;. This means that when the notice is put in the <i>Gazette</i>, a person can then be prevented from being an officebearer. In other words, he might at that very moment when the <i>Gazette</i> is published be an office-bearer or a member of any organization. It means that from the moment it is published in the <i>Gazette</i> that person commits an offence if he does any of those things listed in Clause 10, for which he gets a minimum sentence of one year. I think it is unnecessary for the words &#x201C;being or&#x201D; to be inserted. I presume that by putting this in the <i>Gazette</i> the Minister wants to give them notice, but if the words &#x201C;being or&#x201D; remain, what will the position be in Cape Town, for instance? It appeared the other day from a reply given by the Minister to a series of questions that it takes three days for the <i>Gazette</i> to come to Cape Town. But from the moment that man&#x2019;s name appears in the <i>Gazette</i>, if a policeman in Cape Town asks him for his name and address and he does not give it to him, then he commits an offence.</p>

<p>Yes, but it is nevertheless a prohibition. It says that the Minister may &#x201C;prohibit&#x201D; a person, therefore it is a prohibition in terms of Clause 10 (1) (a), which says that while a person&#x2019;s name appears on any list or while any prohibition under this Act by way of a notice addressed and delivered or tendered to him is in force, if he changes the place of his residence or employment without reporting that change to the police, then he commits an offence for which he will go to gaol for one year.</p>

<p>Or subject to a prohibition. Sir, in the first place it will have that effect. The second point I wish to make is that again it is quite clear that the people in Durban will be placed in a most difficult position because there is no depot in Durban for the distribution of <i>Government Gazettes</i>. I do not know why there is not but there is not. In Johannesburg <i>Government Gazettes</i> are distributed and sold by the Central News Agency, so that the public can go and buy them. But in Durban, unless you are a subscriber, you just do not get the <i>Government Gazette</i>. Sir, why does the Minister not provide in this claue that there must also be publication in a newspaper published and circulating in the area in which the prohibition is to apply?</p>

<p>Again the hon. the Minister has cast the net so wide here that it affects ordinary shareholders in a company. If the hon. the Minister says that you cannot belong to any organization, then it means that no one can own any shares in a company, because the moment he becomes a shareholder he becomes a member, and it is clear that an &#x201C;organization&#x201D; includes a limited liability company. The definition of &#x201C;organization&#x201D; is &#x201C;any association of persons incorporated or unincorporated and whether or not it has been established or registered in accordance with any statute.&#x201D; I think the hon. the Minister should re-consider the first of the amendments that he has moved because it is going to provide for these extraordinary circumstances which I have mentioned, and it is going to make the hon. Minister&#x2019;s task much more difficult; it is going to make the task of the person who is prohibited even more difficult to know from what moment he could reasonably have expected to have notice of the prohibition. Why does the hon. the Minister not take out the words &#x201C;being or&#x201D;? It does not make any difference <span class="col_6891-6892" refersTo="page_0692"/>to his powers.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know why hon. members over there want to inflict so much suffering on this Committee. Let us first examine the provisions of this clause. There are three categories of persons, that is to say, listed communists, the office-bearers and members of unlawful organizations and persons who have been placed under restrictions. These three categories are potentially liable to be affected by this clause. What can happen to these three categories of persons in terms of this clause? The Minister can by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> prohibit any persons falling under any of the three categories or all three categories from becoming members of an organization or office-bearers of a stipulated organization, and in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s amendment they can also be prohibited if they are already members or office-bearers of the organization. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has tried to link this provision to the restriction on movement which is absolutely irrelevant and which has no potential connection with the clause. What I have just set out is all the clause embodies. The criticism is that we are here creating the possibility that a man will commit an offence by infringing the notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> by becoming or remaining a member of an organization after the relevant notice has been published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> before the offender knows about it. But if this were to happen in practice, is the reasonable assumption not that there would be no prosecution? Why assume that under such unreasonable circumstances there will be a prosecution? After all we have the general legal presumption that all regulations which affect hundreds of people and often create offences, are known to the public as a whole if published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. Why make an exception in this instance? I shall tell you why, Mr. Chairman. It is a question of partnership. The United Party has entered into a partnership with the Progressive Party in respect of the first clause which we have discussed, and they have hitherto been the partners of the Progressive Party throughout the Committee Stage. But now they are also in partnership with the communists. This clause and the previous clause deal with the defined and proved communists, the people who want to destroy the Church, the State and law and order in South Africa; and now hon. members opposite are so concerned about these defined and proved communists, the people who deserve the firing squad rather than friendship &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member is talking nonsense; he does not know what is in the Bill, and I readily accept that he does not know what is in the Bill because his powers of comprehension are too limited to understand it. They are taking the proved listed communists under their protection, and they say that such a proved communist will not commit a further offence until such time as the notice has been rubbed under his nose. Are these proved communists people who must be treated with an excessive measure of fairness? Or is this a case where we must adopt the reasonable and practical provision that if the prohibition is promulgated in the <i>Government Gazette</i>, then the prescribed categories of communists are obliged to comply with the notice in the <i>Gazette</i>? Why must everyone of these despicable persons be sought out? Does the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) know the names and addresses of all of them? Does he want to offer himself as the server of notices on communists? Perhaps the hon. member for Hillbrow knows where they are. We do not know in what fox-holes they are hiding. That is why this provision is necessary. The United Party&#x2019;s opposition to this provision is mere a revelation of their unwitting (and I say &#x201C;unwitting&#x201D; in respect of certain members) support of the communists.</p>

<p>There are three categories of persons who can be affected. Firstly there are persons who have already been listed, there are persons who were office-bearers of certain organizations, and then there are persons in respect of whom any prohibition has been served. Now in terms of the new amendment, the hon. the Minister can prohibit them from being (that is continuing to be) or from becoming office-bearers of any particular organization that has been prohibited. That is the effect of this clause. Now the hon. the Minister asks that he should have the right to do that merely by publication in the <i>Gazette</i>. I want to speak perhaps on behalf of some unfortunate misguided Coloured people who at some time or other were listed communists. Now the Minister wishes to have the power, in the exercise of his discretion, to prohibit those persons who are already listed from becoming office-bearers in a particular organization, and the only notification that they will have of that fact will be a publication in the <i>Gazette</i>. I ask the hon. the Minister in all seriousness which Coloured person does he really think ever sees the <i>Government Gazette</i>. They hardly ever come into contact with it.</p>

<p>Some of them in the dim and distant past may have been listed as communists. Although they no longer are communists, they may appear on the list, and in the meantime by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, the Minister is prohibiting them. Surely it is the easiest thing in the world for the hon. the Minister to incorporate in this clause (if the hon. the Minister does not like the working proposed by the hon. member for Musgrave) certain words on the same lines as in Clause 9, where the Minister says that it will be affixed to the main entrance of the last known residence of such person. Surely it would be possible for the Police Force to affix such notice in that way. That would enable him to know that he has been prohibited from becoming an office-bearer of any particular organization, or his neighbours could tell him. The point that the hon. the Minister seems to lose sight of is that this is a penal section. The contravention of this section is subject to a sentence of imprisonment, and surely the hon. the Minister will appreciate that in penal sections of this sort, one of the basic principles of our law is that the accused must have knowledge of the fact that he is committing an offence.</p>

<p>I first wish to reply to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). I am sorry that I have not done so earlier. This clause and the hon. member&#x2019;s argument have nothing to do with the livelihood of a person, nothing to do with his &#x201C;livelihood&#x201D; about which the hon. member is so concerned. Other clauses deal with that aspect of the matter. But what the hon. member wants, and this is what her amendment is in substance, is the free association of communists to do as they please. That is the effect of her amendment.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). He now objects violently to it being published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. The hon. member must then object, on principle, to all Acts that endanger people because every Act that we adopt here punishes some or other person.</p>

Then no objection was made. Individuals were affected then and they are affected now as well. Furthermore, have hon. members not seen these notices in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and the form they take? The notices do not say that &#x201C;from this moment it is illegal&#x201D;.

I really do not know. After all hon. members know the communists. Why must we be so sensitive about a lost communist who perhaps did not receive a notice, although he knows all the time about such a notice? Why must we be so concerned about these people? They will not for one moment be concerned about the hon. member. I am amazed that in spite of the practical difficulties which I have mentioned to hon. members and in spite of the fact that hon. members know what the practice is when notices of this nature are served, hon. members still seek out absurd examples of people who will supposedly not receive this notice. Let us be practical and realistic about this matter.

These are severe penalties and people are at least entitled to know what sort of restrictions are being placed on them before they run an additional risk of a year imprisonment. The second point is that I think the hon. the Minister will agree that this does not only apply to communists. The hon. member for Kempton Park says that it applies to communists and office-bearers of unlawful organizations. But that is wrong. This clause goes much further than that. It applies to anybody surely who was a member of the A.N.C. or the P.A.C.

<p>Yes, and Clause 20 read in conjunction with this clause means that any African who at any time was a member of the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. is subject to these penalties, very severe penalties indeed. Many misguided people joined the communists way back in 1930. They were listed. Many people may have joined the A.N.C. or the P.A.C. without even fully realizing the aims and objects, but they are all subject to this particular clause, and therefore they are entitled to know what is going to happen to them. I think the hon. Minister is not correct, when he says that this does not affect the livelihood of people. This refers to any organization, and if the hon. the Minister looks at the definition of &#x201C;organization&#x201D; in the principal Act, he will find that it is very widely defined indeed. It says in Section 10 that &#x201C;organization&#x201D; means any organization of persons incorporated or unincorporated.

What is to stop the hon. the Minister under the terms of &#x201C;organization&#x201D;, as defined in the principal Act, to specify that any listed communist if he was an officebearer of any banned organization, or if he was a member of an unlawful organization, such as the A.N.C. or the P.A.C., may not be a partner in a business &#x2026;</p>

<p>I come back to the position that the hon. Minister himself accepted that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) was a reasonable one. He set out to say that he could not accept it because of certain practical reasons which made it difficult to do what he conceded was a just and reasonable approach to the problem. Now, Sir, the prohibition which is issued in terms of this clause will not only have executive consequences, but it is quite clear that it is going to have penal consequences as well. That is why there is this need to see that not only justice is done but to know that it is being done. I want to draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to a later clause, Clause 6, where we come to the situation that powers are going to be given to remove people&#x2019;s names from the list.

<p>The hon. the Minister is now trying to make a debating point of something which impinges on real justice, and he knows it. But I say that there are people on the list whose names should not be there. I don&#x2019;t know how long it would take to remove these names from the list, but meanwhile these people are going to be subject to this prohibition, which also has penal consequences. The only reason which the hon. the Minister has advanced is this practical question of being able to reach the people whose names are on the list. I do not think that that is such a practical reason that the hon. the Minister should therefore ignore what he himself accepts as being a just outlook in regard to the matter. I hope therefore that he will reconsider the position, and that he will accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Musgrave.</p>

<p>So far as the second amendment is concerned, I would like to point out that the emphasis on this whole thing is that there should be exemption in respect of any case where it is a &#x201C;lawful&#x201D; trade, business or occupation.

<p>Here we have the situation where via the <i>Gazette</i> anybody on the list, anybody who has been a member of an unlawful organization and anybody who has been prohibited under this Act from doing anything, can now be banned. Sir, let me put it this way: The persons concerned under Clause 10 are persons under a prohibition which can now be imposed under the <i>Gazette</i> in terms of this clause. Now I want to point out that under this clause the hon. the Minister cannot give personal notice. He is only given the power by this clause to prohibit by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>.

Minister says that he cannot do it in another way because he cannot find all the people&#x2014;then he must do it in the most practical way. If he does have practical difficulties, then the hon. the Minister must not insist upon the court&#x2019;s hands being tied if a man is prosecuted for an offence of which the only knowledge that exists is contained in the <i>Gazette</i> which he has not seen, an offence of which he may only know three days after he has committed the offence. He can only know it if he lives in Cape Town three days after the <i>Government Gazette</i> has appeared or in Durban if he is a subscriber, and if the <i>Gazette</i> has reached him in that time. If that is so, then the hon. the Minister must not tie the hands of the courts, because there is no doubt whatever that in normal circumstances, and in such a case, if the accused could show that he did not have any knowledge of it and could not have had any knowledge of it, the court would obviously treat such a person more leniently, and so the hon. the Minister would wish it to be. But here the hon. the Minister has tied the hands of the court so that the moment he does commit such a contravention, because it is in the <i>Gazette</i>, although he has not seen it, he must go to gaol for one year, although if he had seen it, he might not have committed the offence.</p>

<p>So if the hon. the Minister considers that this is the only practical way in which he can do this, he must consider amending the other clauses in this Bill to meet the situation which is obviously going to arise otherwise.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I have said what the practical difficulties are, the hon. member has come with the same argument, notwithstanding the fact that the same argument can be used against the promulgation of any Bill. I told the hon. member emphatically that what would happen in practice would not be what happened before&#x2014;and the hon. member now forces me to repeat what I said during the second reading, when I used the example of the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), when he referred to the &#x201C;kakieridders&#x201D; (khaki riders) as baboons. At that time the regulation was issued on 4 February and on 5 February, the next day, the hon. member for East London (City) got into trouble because he was unaware of the regulation. But that was not to-day. I then took the point that the hon. member did not know of the regulation and the court rejected it, and did so lawfully. But the court ruled that it was not an offence to call a &#x201C;kakieridder&#x201D; a baboon. That was all the court could find under the circumstances. But the hon. member is leading me away from the subject now. It was not an offence then. The people who are objecting now made no objection then because at that time it only affected people whom hon. members on the other side did not like. It was nothing then, it could affect them then. The everyday rule was acceptable because it was aimed at the opponents of the Government and it did not matter if they were affected. But now it amazes me that, while hon. members opposite were not affected at that time, and while nobody rebelled against it, because it only affected Jan Moolman, the Jan Moolman of those days, hon. members opposite are so perturbed to-day when it affects the communists. I cannot, with the best will in the world, understand them. And this despite the fact that I have told hon. members that it will not be customary to act as hon. members acted when they were in power but we shall see to it that from a specified date, published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>, it will be unlawful for them to do so. I do not even want to stalk a communist as hon. members stalked us in the days when they were in power. Let me now very honestly and clearly state what our intention is. I have conceded to hon. members that it would be better if we could personally serve the notice. I made no secret about it. But do hon. members not want to understand my practical difficulties viz. that it is practically impossible to do so in view of the fact that there are numerous organizations, communistic organizations, because communists are so resourceful that they establish new organizations every minute? And yet hon. members would like me to follow all of them and to serve notices on them all! That is after all an impossible task. We are after all not playing the fool or playing with dolls, <span class="col_6901-6902" refersTo="page_0697"/>but we are combating Communism. Let us therefore be serious in doing so.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say this to the hon. the Minister that we on these benches&#x2014;and I am sure all hon. members on this side do&#x2014;repudiate with the strongest possible indignation any suggestion that we who represent the Coloured people by voting against this Bill, are supporting Communism. The Minister has not said so, but we have had that implication from the other side, especially from the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). I want to say this that I will appeal to the Chairman and if necessary to Mr. Speaker if any hon. member on that side again dare to suggest that because we do our duty as we see it, we are aiding Communism in this country. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister as a lawyer not as a politician. I said the other day and I repeat it that he must not allow his legal heart to be misled by his political mind. I want to say this, Sir, that a basic principle in a democratic country, which the Government claims this country is, is that in the case of anything which affects the personal liberty of persons, there shall be personal service on that person. That is the principle which the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has asked and which I am asking the Minister to observe in this Act. We are appealing to him not to destroy a legal principle in this Act which has stood the test of time. Unless the Minister is prepared to accept the suggestion that a notice should be served at the person&#x2019;s last known address, I say the Minister is unreasonable and I shall vote against this clause.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The Electoral Laws Amendment Bill now before the House for its third reading falls into two distinct categories. On the one hand there are the items which affect matters of principle&#x2014;the provision for the restoration of the vote to persons convicted of treason and the provisions which incorporate into the Electoral Laws the Population Register and the population register identity card. On those matters of principle this side of the House and the Government disagree and therefore we shall oppose the measure at this its final reading. On the other aspect of the Bill, that is to say, the administration of our elections and our Voters&#x2019; Rolls and the general machinery required for an election, I think it is fitting that at the third reading one should draw attention to the improvements which have been made in this Bill since it first appeared before this House last year. Perhaps a lesson is to be learned from the manner in which this Bill was handled in being sent to a Select Committee before the second reading and in the work which that Select Committee was able to do to make this measure one which in the administrative field is 90 per cent, if not more, acceptable to both sides of the House. I would like to pay a tribute to the chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van der Heever) for the manner in which the work was dealt with and to the Minister for the attitude which he adopted in regard to the administrative provisions of this measure. I think we have effected improvements which will make our elections take place more smoothly, with less difficulty. The two main problems which this Bill presented in the first place and on which there was full agreement, the question of postal votes and the question of compulsory notification of change of address, are both matters which are now going to be dealt with, and I trust that in the same way that this measure has been altered and amended to produce something on which we can agree, so by putting our heads together we shall be able in due course to produce amendments to the provisions with regard to postal votes and in regard to the question of bringing the Voters&#x2019; Rolls up-to-date, which will give us a model electoral system under which everyone in this House is elected to Parliament. Although we disagree with this measure on matters of basic principle in regard to other legislations, I think we have made some progress as far as the administration of this measure is concerned. On principle, however, we must oppose this third reading as we have opposed these provisions at the second reading and in the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Before I move the amendment standing in my name on page 697 of the Order Paper, I wish to address you, Sir, on the point that my amendment is not affected at all by the ruling given by Mr. Speaker on Friday on the motion for an instruction. The ruling relates to the invoking of the Rule of Law into the provisions of this Bill by allowing a right of appeal to a court; that is what Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s ruling dealt with. Clause 5 is strictly an amendment of the Newspaper and Imprint Act No. 14 of 1934, which relates to the registration of newspapers. The mere form of drafting therefore does not affect the issue that this clause really stands apart from the main provisions of the Bill. But in any case my amendment does not affect the principles of the clause at ali. The clause really contains two principles: The first is that there shall be a deposit of money as a condition precedent to the registration of a newspaper; and the second is that the deposit shall be subject to forfeiture to the State in certain circumstances. The circumstances and the method of forfeiture are matters of detail, and those are matters which are rightly dealt with in the Committee Stage. My amendment is concerned merely with the machinery by which this forfeiture is to be effected. It sets out in clear terms, I believe, the circumstances which will entitle forfeiture to be effected, and it sets out in clear terms the method of determining the particular circumstances. My amendment then is that there shall be a pronouncement by a Judge that circumstances do in fact exist which would warrant forfeiture to take place; and once those circumstances have been determined then forfeiture will take place automatically in terms of the clause itself and not as a part of a judicial decree. Having set it out in that way, I think I have made it perfectly clear that this amendment is not in the least affected by Mr. Speakers ruling. Here we are not concerned with an appeal to a court against a decision. We are concerned with the machinery by which a decision will be established. As I say, the actual forfeiture will not be by judicial decree; it will take place automatically, and therefore if this amendment is adopted it will not affect in any way the amendment which the Minister himself intends to move. In those circumstances I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 20 and 21, page 5, to omit &#x201C;a prohibition is imposed under Section 6 in respect of any newspaper&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a Judge of the Supreme Court, after hearing the evidence which the Minister and the proprietors of any newspaper wish to adduce, pronounces that the newspaper promotes or propagates the principles of Communism, or is published under the guidance of an unlawful organization, or serves, inter alia, as a means for expressing views propagated by unlawful organizations, or serves, <i>inter alia</i>, as a means for expressing views or conveying information the publication of which is calculated to further the aims and objects of Communism,&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of that amendment will be that subclause 4 will then read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If a Judge of the Supreme Court, after hearing the evidence which the Minister and the proprietors of any newspaper which to adduce, pronounces that the newspaper promotes or propagates the principles of Communism, or is published under the guidance of an unlawful organization, or serves inter alia, as a means for expressing views propagated by unlawful organizations, or serves, <i>inter alia</i>, as a means for expressing views or conveying information the publication of <span class="col_6909-6910" refersTo="page_0701"/>which is calculated to further the aims and objects of Communism, any amount deposited in respect of such newspaper together with any interest paid thereon to the proprietor concerned, shall be forfeited to the State.</block>

<p>I think it is quite evident that unless in cases of this nature, truth is quite free to emerge justice can never be done. The machinery of the courts is invoked because the old-age procedure of courts was devised to bring out and to protect truth. I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will agree that this amendment does provide a fair and a just method to decide whether forfeiture in terms of these provisions is justified or not. As I have said, it does not affect in the slightest the amendment which the hon. the Minister himself wishes to move. Sir, I am reminded of the fact that Edmund Burke once said, &#x201C;If I cannot reform with equity I will not reform at all.&#x201D; I leave it to the hon. the Minister to know what the alternative to that statement is; I do not intend at this juncture to refer to it because I do hope that in the circumstances outlined by me, he will accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of sub-section (4) of the proposed Section <i>6bis</i>:</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that the Minister may direct that such portion of such amount as he may determine shall be refunded to such proprietor.</block>

<p>Hon. members will observe that as the clause now reads, the Minister, when it comes to a forfeiture of the amount which is required as security upon the registration of a newspaper, <span class="col_6911-6912" refersTo="page_0702"/>has no discretion other than to declare the whole amount to be forfeited. In this connection, as hon. members already know perhaps, I received representations from the Bar Council, amongst others. May I just point out that the first representations received from the Bar Council were in respect of this particular provision of Clause 5 of the Bill. I received no representations from the Bar Council in respect of the preceding clauses of the Bill. The Bar Council&#x2019;s representations with reference to Clause 5 were to the effect that the Minister should have a discretion when it comes to a decision with regard to the forfeiture of the deposit and that he should be in a position to decide whether the whole amount or only a portion should be forfeited. By means of this amendment I am giving effect to these representations of the Bar Council.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister of Justice has to advise and guide the Minister of the Interior in this connection. It must be done in consultation with the Minister of the Interior therefore. The acceptance of my amendment will have this effect that the whole amount will not necessarily have to be forfeited, but the Minister will have the power to decide whether he will refund to the publishers or owners concerned either the full amount or a portion of it or nothing at all.</p>

<p>I explained in my second reading speech why Clause 5 of this Bill was being inserted. In Section 6 of the principal Act the procedure that has to be followed where a newspaper is banned is prescribed. Steps have also been taken in the past against certain newspapers, amongst others against the predecessor of the newspaper which is presently published under the name <i>New Age</i>. Hon. members will remember that initially this newspaper was known as the <i>Guardian</i> and that it was the mouthpiece of the Communist Party. Hon. members will also know that it was under the management of the communists, Carneson and Bunting, and that it was then banned. Subsequently, however, this newspaper again appeared under two different names and eventually under the name <i>Advance</i>. It was also banned under this name in terms of Section 6 of the principal Act, but immediately afterwards it again appeared under the name <i>New Age</i>. Hon. members will recall that it was possible for it to do so because of the fact that this particular newspaper had been registered under various names in terms of the 1934 Act. It could therefore, the moment it was banned under one name, appear under a different name although the editorial staff, the printers, etc., were the same, and although it still propagated the same poison. Hon. members will concede at once that such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated, and that is why we are inserting this provision in the Bill in terms of which, if persons again want to publish a newspaper which has been banned, they may be required to make a deposit which they run the risk of losing if the newspaper again follows the same course as that followed by <i>New Age</i> and its predecessors.</p> <p>Another consequence of this clause to which I want to draw the attention of hon. members is that the names which have already been registered will fall away in case a newspaper should appear under one of those names just after the passing of this Bill. This clause therefore serves a twofold purpose; in the first place it clears the list of registered names and, secondly, it makes it impossible for communistic newspapers to appear. I want to point out in passing that this clause will in no way affect any of the existing newspapers; it will only apply to newspapers that may appear in the future. I would also point out to hon. members that before a newspaper is banned, a report first has to be obtained in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the principal Act.</p></speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It is all very well for the hon. the Minister to say that hon. members should vote for the principle involved here, because there is not only one principle, but two, involved. The one was mentioned by the hon. the Minister and the other is the negation of justice which this clause entails. I am with him on the principle that newspapers which disseminate Communism should be dealt with, but I am not with him on the other principle, i.e. the negation of the basic tenets of justice which this clause involves. If a newspaper, in fact, disseminates Communism, then it must be dealt with. But that is precisely what this clause avoids, i.e. it avoids a finding of facts. On the contrary, it gives the hon. the Minister the discretion to determine whether or not a newspaper publishes propaganda which will have the effect of furthering the aims of Communism. The hon. the Minister has asked us why we show all this concern for Communism, but the Minister himself comes along now with an amendment in terms of which a newspaper which disseminates Communism could, in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s discretion, be treated leniently, because he need not take away from them the full amount of their deposit. Who is now showing concern for Communism? I say to the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Why not take all their money if they are, in fact, communists?&#x201D; And if they are not communists, then surely somebody else than the Minister should decide on the matter. The hon. the Minister quoted only one example of a newspaper which was communistic, and which kept on changing its name. I am quite sure that if some sort of body sat to determine whether in fact this newspaper was a communistic newspaper, it would no doubt have found it to be such. I cannot understand, however, why the hon. the Minister does not want to give some further protection, because what this provision really amounts to is the imposition of a fine in advance. The fine is fixed <span class="col_6913-6914" refersTo="page_0703"/>and collected before a person is even fined, and then the hon. the Minister has the discretion to decide whether the person concerned should be found guilty and fined a lesser or the whole amount.</p>

<p>I think the Minister has been less than fair with this House when he indicated that the principle involved in this clause was the fighting of Communism, because that is not the only principle. I should like the hon. the Minister, therefore, to withdraw this clause and to review it in the light of the ruling which has been given from the Chair.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and, I expect, also the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), will continue singing the refrain that there is a denial of justice when the Minister is given a discretion. I do not want to do the hon. member an injustice, but I do think that this is an allegation they make <i>ad nauseum</i>&#x2014;when it is unnecessary, when it is irrelevant, and even when they have nothing to say. Every time a Minister is clothed with discretionary powers, the Opposition regards it with suspicion, merely because they do not trust this side of the House with discretionary powers. And then they sing it on a very high note by saying that it is a denial of justice. Let me therefore say, and I hope I will not have to repeat it, that when a Minister is given a discretionary power, he must also obey the elementary rules of justice when exercising it, and not only the Minister, but also every official. This is a legal state which is governed in terms of the rules of the law. It so happens that it is not always possible to go to court to test whether the elementary rules of justice have been complied with. But that does not mean that it cannot be done at all.</p>

<p>The hon. member alleged that this is a denial of justice. I, in turn, want to point out to him that he has every possible opportunity for criticizing the actions of the Minister concerned. He can, e.g., do so by means of a motion in the beginning of a session, or when the Justice Vote is discussed under the Estimates. They can talk for days about it not having been correct to take a sum of money from Mr. Bunting or Mr. Carneson for the registration of a newspaper under a certain name.</p> <p>This clause gives the Minister the power to act speedily&#x2014;something which is necessary if one wants to combat Communism. We had the case where Mr. Kahn, when the <i>Guardian</i> was banned, sold the first copy of the same newspaper, but under a different name, to the Minister of Justice, just to provoke him and to say: &#x201C;Here it is now, just in a different form.&#x201D; And in fact it was the same newspaper, the same press, the same premises and the same staff, etc. Now we say that people who have a standpoint which they want to propagate <i>bona fide</i> can have a newspaper registered even without a deposit, but that those who are suspect and in regard to whom the goodwill of the community has already shrunk, should be treated on a different basis. In my opinion, that is no more than right. Therefore, I think that the measure we are discussing here will be effective. At the same time I want to reject the hon. member&#x2019;s allegation that this is a negation of justice. It is an allegation which is not worthy of him or of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South), in regard to whom I am sure that he will now get up and repeat precisely the same allegation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. member for Standerton for having &#x201C;seen&#x201D; me. The amendment which has been moved by the hon. the Minister does modify to a degree a power which otherwise is an arbitrary and capricious one. You, Mr. Chairman, have earlier this morning ruled that my amendment to this clause was destructive of the principle of the Bill. I do not, of course, want to discuss that. But I do want to say that the clause as it now stands is destructive of justice. I wonder how long the hon. member for Standerton would have taken, if he had been on this side of the House, to show how capricious and arbitrary these powers really are, in view of the fact that it took him such a long time to try to justify this provision.</p>

<p>Because I think they are capricious; that is why I call them so. The fact that the hon. the Minister has been influenced to a certain extent by the Bar Council, goes to show that he recognizes that this clause contains elements of injustice. As a result, he has decided to modify its provisions to a certain degree. When he starts with this measure <i>de novo</i> in the Other Place, he will have a further opportunity of considering this question of elementary justice. In what circumstances, I ask, is a proprietor of a newspaper going to be heard under the clause as it stands now? How is it going to be established that the truth will emerge from an inquiry which might be held? The hon. the Minister knows full well that there cannot be justice without publicity. There will, however, be no publicity here, and the danger, therefore, exists that there will be no justice, or that there will be capricious justice.</p>

<p>I ask the hon. the Minister, therefore, to reconsider the matter to see whether something better cannot be done in the interests of the State, as well as in the interests of justice, by setting out the circumstances under which forfeiture can take place here. As the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has pointed out, this is really a penal provision; it provides for a predetermined penalty; and the amendment moved by the hon. the Minister is nothing more than to say to a person who has been fined, that in certain circumstances, which the Minister himself will determine, a remission of the penalty will be allowed. The hon. the Minister is, therefore, taking unto himself powers of remission more than anything else, because the penal provision is there&#x2014;completely arbitrary and capricious.</p>

<p>I do not think that we should go out of our way to look for hidden dangers in these provisions. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) has stated that this clause is &#x201C;capricious&#x201D;. I do not think, however, that we need look for hidden dangers in this clause, especially since the Bar Council, in making representations to the Minister with regard to this clause, asked for no other amendment than that now moved by the Minister. The Bar Council raised no objection to the rest of this clause. But ] agree with the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) that if a body or a newspaper is communistic and we are convinced that that is so, we should take the whole of the deposit, if necessary. I want to associate myself with what the hon. member has said, that if the effect of the amendment which the Minister is introducing here at the request of the Bar Council is going to be that a portion of the money will be refunded to a communistic newspaper or movement&#x2014;if this attitude of the Opposition appears to be correct&#x2014;then I want to ask the hon. the Minister rather to withdraw this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot speak with any authority on the justice side of this question, but I think it is quite impossible to control the publication of communist newspapers in this way. How does one establish a newspaper? How does a communist in any country establish a newspaper? Not by going along and registering a newspaper. That may be, as the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) has said, an act of defiance, but that is not the usual way. The usual way of obtaining control of a newspaper is to obtain control of the shareholding and that can be done through nominees and in many other ways. The hon. the Minister must surely have read about the take-over bids in the control of newspapers which are taking place in the British Isles at the present time. Here in South Africa it would be comparatively easy for a communist, either in this country or outside of this country, to obtain control of a newspaper which is already established. I have mentioned one way, namely the take-over bid. The other is to obtain control of the shareholding. The other is what the hon. the Prime Minister has demonstrated with the two companies in Johannesburg where there has been an amalgamation. Whether it was a take-over bid or whether it was an honest fifty-fifty amalgamation it is difficult to say.</p>

<p>Exactly; the communist can establish his newspaper in just the same way. My first case is that the registration of a newspaper is something which happens when a newspaper first comes on to the market and the usual way is to take over a newspaper already established. The second is the difficult position in which the hon. the Minister places himself.

But to say to the man who is establishing a newspaper &#x201C;You must put up R20,000&#x201D; is an imposition if the Minister has the right to say to somebody else: &#x201C;I think you are the type of man who need not put it up.&#x201D; It may be a member of his party or of the party in the Opposition.

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) says that the hon. the Minister does not need this clause. But if this clause makes no difference, why does he oppose it? But I go further. If the Minister does not need it, how does the hon. member explain that the <i>Guardian</i>, after having been banned, appeared under a number of different names, and recently, after 25 years, boasted of the fact that it had successors which were banned in their turn and that it now appeared as <i>New Age</i>? But it appears to me that the hon. member has not read Section 6 of the principal Act, which expressly provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the State President is satisfied that any periodical or publication professes by its name or otherwise to be a publication for propagating the principles or promoting the spread of Communism &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the first. The second one is&#x2014;</p> <block name="quote">&#x2026; is published or disseminated by or under the direction or guidance of an organization which has been declared an unlawful organization under Section 2 &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then it passes on to No. 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; serves, <i>inter alia</i>, as a means for expressing the views propagated by such organization or did so immediately prior to &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are all points I quote from Section 6. In other words, the people who apply for registration will be people who have a certain past history, and the Minister will be fully able to judge the character of those people. If they come along to register a name, we know from experience and from knowledge of their character that they want to continue with a publication which has already been banned. And if that is not the case, then why the long list of names already registered, under the names of Bunting and Carneson, as the Minister has told us? There are 30 names which will all be the successors of the <i>Guardian</i>. The present one is <i>New Age</i>. The Minister wants to cancel that list. Now the hon. member says that will be futile, because they can take over a newspaper. Very well, supposing they take over the <i>Eastern Transvaal Advertiser</i> by purchasing it from somebody, and they start publishing communist propaganda in it. Then I said, by way of interjection, that we can ban that newspaper. The hon. member then said that I was simply daft about the idea of banning. But, Mr. Chairman, we do not want persons who at the moment are making communist propaganda to find it easy to continue even with the next issue. As the position is to-day, they can register names and use those names at any time. Even though they do not use those names, they can apply to do so on payment of only &#x00A3;1. The Minister of the Interior does not even have the power to refuse to register the name, unless the name suggested is more or less the same as the name of an existing newspaper. It is as easy as that. When those communists have to take over a newspaper by buying up the shares, it is appreciably more difficult for them than merely to pay &#x00A3;1 for a name. But even the taking over of an existing newspaper will not be so easy. Even though they should try to do so, by buying a rural newspaper, they will find that that newspaper does not exist merely as a newspaper and the advertisements placed in it. Every one also has a &#x201C;Smalls&#x201D; section on which it lives. The only newspaper containing news and advertisements, and perhaps without a &#x201C;Smalls&#x201D; section, are the large newspapers. The <i>Argus</i> Company has a &#x201C;Smalls&#x201D; section just at one place. They exist on the earnings of newspapers as such&#x2014;the sale of advertisements and news. Just try taking over one of those newspapers. The hon. member may have a few hundred thousand pounds, but he will still not be able to take over the <i>Argus</i> Company or the <i>Cape Times</i>, nor the Nasionale Pers, nor the <i>Vaderland</i>, with the combination he likes to discuss so much. It is not as easy as he says it is to take over a newspaper. This is just idle talk, Sir. Basically the hon. member does not want us to curb the communists. He is the person who talks most loudly about it. Again we have here nothing else but the protection of those people towards whom we have no more goodwill.</p>

<p>The hon. member says it is true but he knows that the charge he has made is completely unfounded. We have made it absolutely clear that we are not interested in the Kahns and the Carnesons, but there are principles involved in which we are interested. I say the hon. the Minister should consider the clause very carefully because it is a clause the passing of which might well give this country&#x2019;s <span class="col_6919-6920" refersTo="page_0706"/>enemies an opportunity of damaging South Africa. I am glad that the hon. the Minister has introduced his amendment but I must say that I hope the Minister will reconsider the whole of this clause. There is no question about it&#x2014;the Minister will agree; although I doubt whether the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) will&#x2014;that this is a clause of which there could be gross abuse. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree that there could be gross abuse. I know he will say that there will not be gross abuse, but a power of a type is being put on the Statute Book which, in my view, should only be put on the Statute Book if it is very much more circumscribed and if there is some form of check on the arbitrary powers which are vested in the hands of the Minister. The hon. the Minister has given a good example of a newspaper which has appeared again and again each time under another name and that that is the type of case he wishes to deal with. But the hon. the Minister will be the first to agree that this is a clause which could be applied to any newspaper which wishes to register from this time onwards. It could be so applied and it could be applied to the maximum. It is true&#x2014;as the hon. member for Standerton has said; it is the one thing in his speech with which I agree&#x2014;that there is a right of registration if the person is prepared to pay the maximum which is required. I agree that that is so. But the newspapers which are affected by this are often owned not by strong financial organizations like the newspapers which have been mentioned. They are often little country newspapers. I hope the hon. the Minister will seriously consider introducing a check on the arbitrary powers which exist in this clause. I say to the hon. the Minister that unless that is done I have little doubt that he will find this clause to be just one of those things which is adding fuel to the flames which are being exploited against this country in the world outside.</p>

<p>Order! Before I call upon the hon. the Minister to address the Committee I wish to draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the fact that the principle involved in this clause has been adopted.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I am very grateful for the ruling you have given. Will you permit me just to point out to hon. members that the principle that they are attacking, namely that newspapers may be banned, is one that was accepted in the old Act as long ago as 1950. The old Act not only provided that newspapers may be banned, but Section 6 of the Act of 1950 prescribed the procedure to be followed before a newspaper can be banned; that is to say, that the matter must be referred to a fact-finding committee, and that a factual report must be brought out, and the Minister may then act on the strength of that report. Under no circumstances can the Minister act unless he has received a factual report in terms of Section 6. But, Mr. Chairman, I have mentioned the example that, in spite of this factual report in the case of the <i>Guardian</i>, in spite of its banning, that newspaper was again published, and it had precisely the same editor. It was published by precisely the same company, and it had the very same contributors. It was identical in every respect with the newspaper which had previously been banned. Surely, Mr. Chairman, we would be making ourselves ridiculous if we referred the same newspaper with the same appearance, and under the control of the same people, to a fact-finding committee.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Well, if that is not the hon. member&#x2019;s objection, what are we quarrelling about then? All that we are saying here to those people who published that newspaper in the past is this: &#x201C;You may say that you are not going to make communistic propaganda again; if you are sincere, and if you are prepared to deposit the amount which is required as security, you may publish your newspaper.&#x201D; In other words, we are not preventing anybody from publishing a newspaper, but the people who publish it know perfectly well now that they run the risk of losing their deposit if they make communistic propaganda. What is unreasonable about that? What is unreasonable in demanding this deposit from people whom we know are communists, and who on various occasions in the past have simply proceeded to publish the same newspaper again under different names when we have banned it under one name? Surely there is nothing unreasonable about it inherently. On the contrary, Mr. Chairman, I think we are going very far in being fair to these people by giving them an opportunity to publish a newspaper again. Is the position that hon. members want us to deprive everybody of the opportunity of publishing new newspapers?</p>

<p>Surely it goes without saying that if a local newspaper appears in a town, we will know whether those people are connected with the Communist Party or not, and it goes without saying that no security will be demanded from people who are not connected with the Communist Party; it will only be required from those whom we know are connected with the Communist Party. If hon. members do not understand that and if they do not want to accept my assurance, then I am afraid I can take this matter no further.</p>

<p>It goes without saying. I gave that assurance in my <span class="col_6921-6922" refersTo="page_0707"/>second reading speech, and I also gave it to this Committee. This is not aimed at everybody who wishes to publish a newspaper. I am only concerned with people who are connected with the Communist Party, whose history I know and whom I definitely want to prevent from publishing newspapers. If in spite of this security they want to publish a newspaper, then they run the risk that they may forfeit that money if they make communistic propaganda.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have devoted a great deal of time to this clause, and it provides for everything that is necessary. But I just want to repeat this: Hon. members know the communists as well as I know them. If they are given the slightest loophole they make use of it. They made fools of us in the past by finding loopholes in the previous section. This clause serves one purpose only and that is to close those loopholes. I can take this matter no further, and hon. members cannot expect me to reply again to arguments advanced from the other side, because I have stated perfectly clearly what the object of this clause is.</p>

<p>It is a refreshing if somewhat unusual experience to have hon. members opposite pleading the support of the Bar Council to advance their cause. It is an unsafe course to adopt if one bears in mind that the General Bar Council made it very clear when they made their statement to the Press that they were not dealing with any of the political aspects of this measure; they were only dealing with the purely legal aspects.</p>

<p>Of course it means this too, that where they take objection to a clause that that is not the only objection which can be taken to it. It is merely a limited objection which a non-political body of that kind can take. Hon. members opposite seem to have difficulty in appreciating our objection to the Minister being the judge as to what is or what is not Communism. Because the exercise of his powers under this Clause will be motivated by his decision in that regard. Anyone who has sat and listened to the days of debate which we have had on this clause, anyone who has sat and listened to the hon. the Minister himself who spent at least half his speech at the second reading calling this side of the House the supporters of Communism &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing particularly with the particulars of this clause, Sir. We are dealing here with a provision whereby the Minister, in order to know how much money to take by way of a deposit from any person starting a newspaper, must make up his mind as to whether or not there is a danger that that newspaper will promote the aims of Communism. That is one of the factors he has to take into account and that is the basis of this clause. It is in that regard, Sir, that I am at present addressing the Committee. The test then is the Minister&#x2019;s appreciation of whether there is any danger of the person registering that newspaper being likely to promote the aims of Communism. That is the test. As I have said, this side of the House does not like that test. This side of the House is not happy that the hon. the Minister or any member of that party is a proper judge as to what is or what is not Communism. The hon. the Minister himself has spent a great deal of time saying that hon. members on this side supported Communism by opposing this Bill. Many of the hon. members opposite made speech after speech allying the present English-speaking Press with Communism. We are entitled to regard the speech of the hon. the Minister of Justice as a responsible utterance. We must not regard it as just a political smear. We must accept what he says as being something which he means.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with respect, I am dealing directly with the provision of this clause. There is no way whereby I can criticize the Minister&#x2019;s power which he is given in this clause other than by testing his standard of judgment. And I choose to do that by the only way I can and that is by demonstrating what he has said in that very regard in this House in this debate. Without doing that, Sir, I cannot discuss the demerits of this particular clause. Is it surprising that when the Minister himself and virtually every member of the party in power as much as says that the official Opposition is supporting Communism and saboteurs &#x2026;</p>

<p>I was not in the House at that time. Sir, I make this point that there should be no surprise in any quarter opposite about the fact that we are unhappy that the hon. the Minister or any member opposite should be the judge as to who is and who is not likely to support the aims of Communism. Because, Sir, if we judge them by their speeches in regard to this Bill we have every reason to fear that judgment as being an unreliable one to say the least of it. The hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;, Jnr.) says we <span class="col_6923-6924" refersTo="page_0708"/>must not look for spooks, we must not go on a witch hunt and that it is perfectly obvious what is required. We do not have to look for the spooks, Sir, they are all sitting opposite.</p>

<p>I withdraw the word &#x201C;spooks&#x201D;, Sir. We do not have to look for the magicians to produce those spooks, Sir; they are sitting opposite. The hon. member for Standerton, as well as his colleagues, cannot understand why we object to this power being given to the Minister. He says we can come to the House and expose the matter here; we can deal with it when the discretion has been exercised and we will then see justice. Once again, who are the judges as to whether the persons or newspapers which have been banned are communistically inclined? Once again, Sir, the hon. members opposite are the very same people who have smeared this party, amongst others, as being the supporters of Communism. A further point taken by hon. members opposite is this: They say that we cannot mention one case where there has been an abuse of power by the Minister concerned. What a scandal it would be if one could point to one case where there has been an abuse of power. That is not something to be proud of; that is something which is to be expected in a society such as we have, with this Government or any other in power. We must expect, Sir, that there will not be an abuse of power. That is no argument against objecting to this type of power being given to a Minister. The objection can be quite simply stated. The hon. the Minister wants to prevent a paper like the <i>Guardian</i> re-appearing in another form. But in order to do that one thing he takes power unto himself to control the whole of the Press, not merely one newspaper, but the entire Press. That is something which this side of the House cannot understand and which we believe to be wrong. It is not a question of how often the Minister has abused his power in the past. The whole basic philosophy of Western democracy is not to give to a Minister greater power than he needs to get at the mischief concerned. That is the whole basis of Western democracy to which hon. members opposite only pay lip service; it stops there. You do not give to a Minister more power than he needs. As I said on an earlier occasion the criticism can unfortunately still be levelled that we have not yet had from the Minister piloting this Bill a description of the mischief he wants to get at and an attempt to relate with some measure of accuracy, the clauses of this Bill as a remedy to that mischief itself. That, Sir, I submit with great respect is elementary to any Minister advancing a case before this House if he seeks support for the measure by reasoned arguments as opposed to a blind acceptance without anyone examining the cause why the Bill has been put forward.</p>

The hon. the Minister has told us that this clause was the subject of discussion with the Bar Council, and he has also told us that he is moving an amendment to the clause in terms of an argument advanced by the Bar Council, and for that small mercy no doubt everybody will be duly thankful. But I think the Minister will also admit that the terms of the discussion with the Bar Council went much further than this particular clause, and there were discussions on the rule of law and the Ministerial discretion.

<p>Unfortunately the amendment standing in the Minister&#x2019;s name does not seem to go nearly as far as the suggestions made by the Bar Council. But I want to say one thing in regard to this clause. I want to ask the Minister to tell us how he intends to use his Ministerial discretion in deciding whether a newspaper, not yet registered, will at any time in the future profess Communism? I know the Minister has told us that he knows everybody who professes Communism and he will know whether the people in charge of that newspaper are likely to profess Communism, but what worries me is that the whole attitude of the Government, in its definitions of Communism and professing Communism and advocating Communism or futhering the aims of Communism, has changed rapidly in the last twelve years since the principal Act was passed. I wonder whether this will have a cumulative effect. It seems to me that the Minister will <span class="col_6725-6726" refersTo="page_0709"/>use his discretion extremely widely, and that he will apply it not only to Communism as it is generally understood by most citizens in this country, but that he will apply it to what the hon. the Minister considers to be Communism. I want to give an example. Mr. Patrick Duncan was banned as a communist and confined to a certain area. Now I maintain very strongly that Mr. Patrick Duncan is not a communist. I maintain that he loathes this Government, and he has made his feelings very clear, but I think he loathes Communism even more than he loathes this Government, if that is possible. Yet in terms of the Suppression of Communism Act, the Minister has used his discretion to ban Patrick Duncan. Patrick Duncan is, or was, the editor of a newspaper which is professedly anti-Government, but it is also anticommunist. I am referring to <i>Contact</i>. In terms of the ban which the Minister has imposed on Patrick Duncan, having deemed him to be a communist in terms of his definition of &#x201C;Communism&#x201D;, what is to prevent the Minister, in terms of this Act, from banning <i>Contact</i>, which is not only anti-communist but anti-Government?</p>

<p>I would be prepared to submit the case of Patrick Duncan to any court of law in any democratic country, and let the Judge decide whether, by his writings and his statements and his actions, he is a communist or not, even in terms of the principal Act, even in terms of the vastly wide definition of &#x201C;Communism&#x201D; in the Act. I believe that no court of law would find that Patrick Duncan had been a communist or was professing the aims of Communism. I could produce for the Minister extracts from <i>Contact</i> to prove that Patrick Duncan was even more violently anti-communist than possibly the Minister himself. What is to prevent the Minister in terms of this clause from operating against journals which do not even remotely profess Communism? And having gone that far, what is to prevent the Minister from going even further and banning not only communist newspapers or even liberal newspapers, but anything that is antiGovernment at all? I am not prepared, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) apparently was, to accept the assurances of the Minister. I want to have limiting words in the Act itself, and without that I certainly could not be satisfied, because one&#x2019;s philosophy changes over the years, and we have watched that happening. I must say that my philosophy has not changed at all. I am professing exactly the same things now that I professed in 1952. I have had a few brushes with hon. members in the U.P. caucus on this philosophy, but perhaps I had better not go into that now. But I do not want to be diverted from my main argument. As the Government has moved further and further away from all tenets of democracy, so unfortunately it has dragged other people in this country with it, and I am not prepared to accept any assurances because certainly the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards communism has changed and therefore, as I cannot move the amendment standing in my name, which would at least leave it to somebody else to make the final decision, I shall vote against this clause.</p>

<p>But that is not what I want to reply to. The hon. member wants to know how I am going to decide whether I should call for security from people if they want to publish a newspaper. I have replied to this question already but I shall do so again, and the reply is that I shall get that security from any person who showed in the past that he sympathized and had connection with the Communist Party in South Africa. I would definitely be failing in my duty if I did not demand security from persons who praised and supported the Communist Party in the past and who actually made communist propaganda. And do not let us argue about that; the hon. member knows as well as I do who those people are. Why ask questions now as to whether we are going to ban this, that or the other newspaper?</p>

<p>No, the hon. member keeps on running away from Section 6 of the principal Act, which very strictly limits the Minister&#x2019;s powers. The Minister cannot go beyond those powers. If that is so, why are we arguing then? I have stated repeatedly that I am not prepared to allow people who discovered a loophole in the old Act and who proceeded to publish the same newspaper again the next day under a <span class="col_6927-6928" refersTo="page_0710"/>different name after it had been banned after a cumbersome inquiry, to make a fool of me. Further than that I do not want to take this matter and indeed I cannot take it any further. Since we all know what we want to achieve, and how we want to achieve it, I honestly believe that we are simply wasting time now.</p>

<p>I want to deal with only two aspects of this Clause 5. The one is the effect of this clause on the continued existence of certain newspapers, in other words, on the possible restrictions on the existing free press in South Africa, and also the possible obstruction of the establishment of new newspapers, which is possible in terms of this clause, as the Minister well knows. It seems to me that we have had this, or a similar, situation in South Africa before. I remember the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration telling us on this side of the House that we do not read enough, but he should tell that to the Minister of Justice, too, because if the Minister had read the story of Pringle and Fairbairn, and had known of the struggle there was in this country about 125 years ago to establish a free press, he might have thought twice about taking powers which might be used in exactly the same way as in that historical case.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Here is an example. It is a newspaper which has only four pages, and it advocates certain policies. Assuming such a newspaper were to be established after this Act comes into force, the Minister would then have to decide whether a deposit should be demanded from the proprietors of that newspaper, and if so, how much it should be, up to R20,000. I submit to the Minister that people who start this sort of newspaper do not dream of even a total capital of R20,000, because it is usually established to propagate in a small way a special point of view, or to support a special sector of political views. This paper, which the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration knows, the <i>South African Patriot</i>, has been established to support the point of view of the National Party. But when it goes, as it does, to the extreme of saying in an editorial that the &#x201C;Integrationists under the leadership of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, are not in any sense conducting a <i>bona fide</i> attack on the Government&#x201D;, and then goes on to say that &#x201C;any newspaper which adopts that attitude in regard to the Sabotage Bill forms part of the Integrationists press, &#x2026; which is part of the pattern of subversion by which the communists provoke violence&#x201D;&#x2026; [Interjection.] I want to know what the Minis-would do in the case of a newspaper which he had reason to believe would propagate this sort of point of view if the Minister was of the opposite political persuasion? Would he allow them to start at all, or would he say to them: Unless you have R20,000 to start this two-page newspaper which circulates among a limited number of people, I will not let you start? These are relevant matters, even in the case of the <i>South African Observer</i>, published by S. E. D. Brown and Dr. Haldeman&#x2019;s publications, and the publications of Johan Schoeman. [Interjections.] The whole purpose of my argument is to emphasize that no matter how reasonable this particular Minister is, in terms of this clause any Minister of Justice, in consultation with the Minister of the Interior, can do certain things to prevent the entry into the field of the free Press of South Africa of any such&#x2014;I will not say rag&#x2014;small newspaper which does not support the point of view of the Government. [Interjection.] It is no use that hon. member saying this is nonsense. If he tells me that he would support the publication of a newspaper which, instead of saying this is a good Government, says that this is the rottenest Government South Africa has ever had, and that every effort should be made to do away with it&#x2014;will he also tell me that the Minister will then say: Go ahead, no deposit is required from you, my dear friend; just go ahead with your propaganda, and perhaps your newspaper will achieve a circulation of 400,000 which will help to throw us out of office one day? The hon. member for Middelland (Mr. P. S. van der Merwe) must not stretch my credulity too far. I know I look gullible, but not that gullible, I hope. That is one aspect of the existence of the free Press that the Minister must remember. He should take a leaf out of the writings of Victor Hugo, who said that &#x201C;no government likes a free Press, but the wiser ones tolerate it&#x201D;. This measure is not designed to express the tolerance of this or any other government towards a free Press when the Minister, despite all the arguments that have been advanced against it, insists on inserting this clause in the Bill. One point which he could possibly vary even now is in regard to the maximum deposit of R20,000. Why should anyone who does not have R20,000 but has R2,000 be prevented from starting a newspaper? It may be a university publication, or the organ of a branch of a particular political party, as this one, the <i>South African Patriot</i>, is that of the John X. Merriman Branch of the National Party. Why should such persons or groups be precluded from starting publication?</p>

<p>As long as that hon. member does not call me &#x201C;Soapy Williams&#x201D;, he can call me anything he likes. I am trying to indicate that whichever way the Minister now looks at his Bill, he cannot reasonably deny that in some ways this particular clause can be used to obstruct the free development of a free Press in South Africa. Then the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) intervened in the debate and unctuously cites something from the report of the Press Commission, but he should remember that he himself was a party to the statement that there <span class="col_6929-6930" refersTo="page_0711"/>were certain monopolies existing in the Press in South Africa already.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have. It gave me no pleasure, but I read it. The point I want to make is that the monopoly which already exists now finishes up in the hands of the Minister of Justice, who will in future be the only &#x201C;Press baron&#x201D; in South Africa, regardless of what the Prime Minister thinks. If he looks at it from that point of view, he may at least decide that he can afford to be generous, and so reduce that maximum amount of R20,000. Here I advocate an amelioration, and I am not now arguing against the principle of the Bill.</p>

<p>The other point I would like to make arises out of sub-section (5) of this clause, paragraph (b), of which says that, if the newspaper is not published and printed within a period of a month, its publication may be prohibited. This may create difficulty for a <i>bona fide</i> newspaper. I want to ask the Minister whether he has considered the example of a newspaper which has suffered the disaster of a fire, say the <i>Pretoria News</i>?</p>

<p>You have not read the clause.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have read the clause very carefully. It says &#x201C;unless the Minister otherwise directs I could not agree more that he should, in the case I have cited, &#x201C;otherwise direct&#x201D;, but he is not compelled to do so! If the <i>Pretoria News</i> suffers a fire and its printing works is razed to the ground, and it is unable, within a period of one month, to resume publication, possibly because a competitor demands a ridiculous price, say R6,000, to print each issue, it is for the Minister to direct whether that paper shall resume publication of not after a month has elapsed. With great respect to the Minister, he must not argue that he has the power to &#x201C;direct otherwise&#x201D;, and that, after consultation, he will use it. This is something which depends on the outlook of the individual who, at the time, exercises this authority. It seems going much too far to say that if, at any time, an established newspaper ceases publication, possibly through circumstances beyond its control, then that paper must apply to the Minister, who, in his generosity, may decide that it may resume publication. I think that this clause could well be amended, if the Minister means what he said by way of interjection just now, by providing that, in certain circumstances, a newspaper, even though it has not been published for a month, may resume publication without the Minister&#x2019;s authority. This again is a test of the Minister&#x2019;s own <i>bona fides</i>, because, if he rejects this suggestion, then it is a fact that he wants all the power he can get, and is not prepared to let go of one jot or tittle of that power. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) used a lot of words to make only two points. The one is that he objects to the clause, because it is open to abuse and thereby endangers a free Press. The second is that he objects to Clause 5.</p>

<p>I want to begin by saying that if a discretion is given to an official, that discretion will always be susceptible to abuse. It is quite possible that every discretion we grant to a Minister or an official may be abused. But this clause will probably be less open to abuse than any other. The hon. member ought to know that better than any other hon. member in the House, because he has had experience of it. When in the exercise of a discretion a person takes into consideration matters which have nothing to do with the case, the aggrieved person can obtain an order of court directing the Minister to devote his attention to the matter. There are cases on record where a Minister has been instructed by the court to direct his attention to the matter. Now he asks: What is there in this clause to prevent the Minister from banning a little newspaper of four pages after having devoted his attention to the matter? I say that is contained in Section 6. Section 6 compels the Minister to consider whether the particular applicant who applies for registration will not perhaps at some time or other try to promote Communism. I read it out here a moment ago. It clearly says that the Minister must direct his mind to one thing only: he must ask himself whether the applicant, by means of his newspaper, will promote the objects of Communism.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member does not want to say so, but he insinuates that, in terms of this section, the Minister will first brand as a communist anyone who opposes his party, and then compel him to deposit R20,000. That is his insinuation. There he agrees with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), who says that the Minister can do nothing else but exercise his powers capriciously. I object to the words &#x201C;capriciously&#x201D; and &#x201C;caprice&#x201D;. The definition of &#x201C;caprice&#x201D; in the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> is &#x201C;a sudden turn of mind without motive: a freak; a whim&#x201D;. That is what those two hon. members accuse the Minister of, that without any reason, just because he does not like a person&#x2019;s face or his politics, he will say: You are a communist, and therefore you will promote Communism, and, for that reason, I will make you deposit R20,000. I want to point out that we have a definition of &#x201C;Communism&#x201D;, in Section 1 of the principal Act. Therefore the Minister has not the power to adopt any other attitude and simply to say: This is Communism. It must be Communism in terms of Section 1. When one of the objects of the newspaper is prohibited by the law, in terms of the principal Act, and if the Minister considers that it will promote Communism, it is his duty to ban that newspaper or to demand that deposit. It is far-fetched to say that this is acting against the freedom of the Press, for the simple <span class="col_6931-6932" refersTo="page_0712"/>reason that the Minister tells these people: You are suspect; I have considered your case, but, as the Irishman said, &#x201C;after careful and suspicious scrutiny&#x201D;, I have come to the conclusion that you must deposit R20,000. Therefore that first allegation of his is really, as the hon. member for Middelland said, a stupid argument.</p>

<p>I want to come to the second objection, that, if an existing newspaper suffers an accident or is struck by <i>vis major</i>, it may perhaps be stopped from continuing to publish. He gave the example of the <i>Pretoria News</i>, which, perhaps, burns down and, after a month, it is not ready yet to resume publication. But has the hon. member not read Clause 5, which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless the Minister of the Interior, in consultation with the Minister, otherwise directs&#x2026;.</block>

<p>is it not reasonable for the <i>Pretoria News</i>, which is an affiliated company of the Argus Company&#x2014;all responsible people&#x2014;to submit their case to the Minister and to say: It is impossible for us to get the press going within a month; do not prohibit us from publishing? Does the hon. member think the Minister will be so unreasonable? [Interjections.] Does the hon. member for Hospital think that if the directors of the <i>Pretoria News</i> and of the Argus Company make representations and say: This is our problem, we cannot continue at the moment, but do not prohibit us, the Minister will be unreasonable? If the hon. member continues along those lines, it is a stupid argument, and then he is busy acting the clown, just like Soapy Williams.</p>

<p>My conscience may have troubled me about what I wrote 20 years ago, but it does not trouble me about what I write nowadays. I wonder whether a measure such as this is really necessary. I do not want to go into the other measures which are already on our Statute Book and that we can use, but I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that there is a Bill pending in connection with publications; that Bill provides for the prohibition of communistic propaganda and communistic literature. I want to ask him whether it will not be possible to achieve the same purpose that he seeks to achieve here by making the necessary provision in that Bill which will possibly be introduced next year.</p>

<p>That depends, of course, on how communism is defined there.</p> <p>I should like to say just a word or two again in connection with the newspaper <i>Contact</i> which is about to be banned. I am convinced, and absolutely convinced of it, that <i>Contact</i> is not a communistic newspaper. <i>Contact</i> is a left-wing liberal newspaper. It is extremely pro-left and in many respects, as far as my ideas are concerned, I strongly dislike it. I have known the editor of <i>Contact</i>, Mr. Patrick Duncan, personally for many years. I am not ashamed to say that he is a personal friend of mine. We were together at university overseas, and we have also met each other since that time. I have often discussed political matters with Mr. Duncan, and if there is one thing of which I am convinced, it is that he is not a communist. It is true that he is Leftist; he does advocate &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;; he wants absolute equality in South Africa but he is not a communist.</p> <p>Mr. Speaker, innocent newspapers or contributors to newspapers who may perhaps overstep the mark in a single paragraph may fall under this Act. Here I am thinking, for example, of an article that was written by the editor of a big English-language daily in South Africa, a person who is not a communist, but in that article there appeared a paragraph&#x2014;I have not had time to check his precise words&#x2014;which read more or less as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that parliamentary methods have failed to oust the Nationalists; the time may come when other methods will have to be used.</block>

<p>This is a fairly drastic statement; it was written by the editor of a big English-language newspaper a few months ago. I do not think that that individual is a communist; I do not think for a moment that he need fall under this provision, but I mention this just to show how an editor together with his newspaper may get into difficulties because of a single paragraph written by him in ignorance or annoyance.</p>

<p>Finally, I just want to point out that the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) stated that the Ministers&#x2019; discretion might be abused. He said that that was possible in every case where discretionary powers were given. I readily admit that, but I want to put it to him whether the discretion which is being given here is not too wide perhaps and whether it is not possible that both the innocent and the guilty will fall under these wide provisions?</p>

<p>I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the proposed sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the principal Act and to substitute the following new sub-section:</block>

<block name="quote">(3) A person whose name appears on any such list may apply to the Minister to have his name removed from such list and the Minister may upon good cause being shown direct that such name be removed from such list and shall so direct if satisfied that such person is unlikely to advocate, advise, defend or encourage the achievement of any of the objects of Communism or of any act or omission which is calculated to further the achievement of any such object and that such person is not engaging in activities which are furthering or may further the achievement of any such object.</block>

<p>I am unable to move the second part of my amendment because it conflicts with the ruling given by Mr. Speaker as regards the right of appeal. But I think the first part of the amendment is in order. What it suggests is that subsection (3) of Section 8 of the principal Act, which is being amended by this new Clause 6, be omitted and that this new sub-section be inserted in its place. The point I was trying to make is that under the new Clause 6, the Minister in the first portion of the clause may upon good cause being shown, direct that the name of any person appearing on any such list be removed therefrom, that is to say, the list of persons which is in the possession of the liquidator under the principal Act. This is a concession in that up to now it was impossible to remove names from the list once they were actually there. The hon. the Minister is now making it possible to remove the names of persons who have been included on any such list either wrongfully or possibly because the political philosophy of the person concerned has so changed that the Minister himself feels that the person should no longer be listed, or because people are able to show that whereas they might have joined the Communist Party way back in the thirties, over the last 20 years or so they have played no active part in politics and that they no longer adhere to the communist form of political philosophy. To some extent therefore this is an improvement on the existing Act. My amendment wants to go a little further than that and not leave it only to the Minister to initiate the removal of such names. The hon. the Minister may possibly know of some people who have been politically inactive for a long time. It may be possible, however, that there are people whose names are on the list who have not been politically active for a long time and that these names may not come to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. Therefore the purpose of this amendment is simply to enable such people to appeal to the Minister to remove their names from the list and to give good reasons why they believe their names should no longer be included on such lists. It still leaves the discretionary power in the hands of the Minister to refuse their appeal and since I have now deleted the second part of my amendment, it does not carry the appeal further to the courts of law. I hope that the hon. the Minister will find it possible to accept this amendment, which is really not one of principle at all and which simply makes it possible for people whose names are on the list to apply to the hon. the Minister to remove their name from the list.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>A great part of the attack of this side on the Bill at the second reading was directed against the excessive powers which we felt the Minister was taking. And as we have stated earlier, instead of the hon. the Minister seeming to be astute to preserve all the rights and safeguards that do normally apply here and in all Western countries, he seems to be going out of his way to take all the powers he could need and more. So, Mr. Chairman, this amendment which stands in my name is designed to circumscribe somewhat the power which he is to have. It is designed to limit it to those cases which may be said to be legitimate. Thus where a person engages in activities which are furthering the objects of Communism, we don&#x2019;t in fact seek by our amendment to reduce those powers; but where he goes further and he wants to ban attendance at meetings merely because activities may further those objects, we feel that goes distinctly too far, and the amendment is designed to limit those powers. The word which we therefore seek to alter is the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in line 64 on page 5. The word &#x201C;may&#x201D; simply means that where there is a mere possibility of furthering Communism, the Minister has the power to ban attendance at meetings, etc. We feel that that goes too far if upon the mere possibility of the furtherance of Communism, such steps can be taken. Many people would say that the activities of the Government Party itself do advance some of the objects of Communism, and it has been said by members opposite that the activities of this side do. Consequently, both therefore, strictly speaking, could fall within this provision. I don&#x2019;t think the hon. the Minister has advanced any sound reasons why he wishes to extend the powers which he already has here. I say extend, because the present wording of the Act is &#x201C;whenever in the opinion of the Minister there is reason to believe that the achievement of any of the objects of Communism would be furthered&#x201D;. That is the wording as it stands and I don&#x2019;t think the hon. the Minister has come to the House with any difficulties which require these extended powers. So we seek to cut down the powers from a mere possibility, by inserting for the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; the words &#x201C;are calculated to&#x201D;, that is to say a likelihood. Therefore I move my amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>I again only move a portion of the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, in view of the ruling as regards appeals to the courts. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the commencement of line 74, to insert &#x201C;not being a gathering of a <i>bona fide</i> domestic, social or religious nature, nor a gathering necessarily incidental to the carrying on by such person of any lawful trade, business, profession or occupation and to omit paragraph (b).</block>

<p>The reason for moving this amendment of course is again to try where possible to limit the definition of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;, which is being amended in this Bill to include a gathering of any nature whatsoever. As has been pointed out by the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson), Section 9 of the Act of 1950, as amended, lays down that the Minister must be of the opinion that there is reason to believe that the achievement of any of the objects of Communism would be furthered if an individual were to attend any gathering &#x2026; As the law stands, it involves at least a decision on the Minister&#x2019;s part that such an individual would use the occasion of his attendance of such gathering to further such objects, and I think this power, if it has not been abused already, certainly can be abused, especially having regard to the very wide definition of the word &#x201C;Communism&#x201D; in the principal Act. It seems to me that it is well nigh impossible to prove that the Minister would have abused his powers under the Act. So the position is now made even more difficult in so far as the Minister no longer has to decide whether or not the objects of Communism would be furthered by an individual attending a particular gathering. It is sufficient now for the Minister to think that the individual&#x2019;s activities might further such an object. And even if he is not a communist in any way, he could be banned in terms of this wide power by the Minister if he thinks that the result of his activities may be to further the objects of Communism, quite irrespective of that person&#x2019;s own intention or objects. The Minister does not have to be satisfied even that his attendance of such a gathering must have such a result. So the whole thing is a widening of the provision, and I want to restrict it as far as possible.</p>

<p>The second part of my amendment which omits the new sub-sections (3) and (4) inserted by paragraph (b) is moved for the same reason, as this again widens the Minister&#x2019;s powers to prohibit all gatherings, public or private, <span class="col_6937-6938" refersTo="page_0715"/>although the Minister, as I see, has introduced an amendment himself which at least does not enable him, as he could do as the clause stands now to forbid all meetings provided there is a single communist in existence anywhere in the Republic. That is now curbed to some extent by the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, but it still gives the Minister power to prohibit not only public meetings but all sorts of private gatherings, between any persons for any purpose whatsoever, even without any common purpose if the definition of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; as defined in Clause 1, which is standing over, is going to be allowed to remain. It is impossible almost to conceive of a wider power than this power which the hon. the Minister is taking. Whether or not the Minister is going to use it to its full extent, one does not know, but this again arises out of the law case which, although the State did not lose it because it was settled out of court, and the State paid costs, a case which arose during last year when a ban was placed on all gatherings on the occasion of Republic Day, because the then Minister believed that such gatherings could lead to the furthering of Communism. Of course it was pointed out in the legal discussions that ensued that it was quite impossible for the hon. the Minister to have applied his mind to the meetings in such a way that every single meeting that was going to be held right throughout the Republic could be said to further the aim of Communism. The State paid the costs, and now we have this move to extend the Minister&#x2019;s powers. My purpose is to omit the sub-sections so that the Minister will not have these wide powers, so that he will have to apply his mind to every single case of a meeting that he wishes to ban and that he may not enjoy the power of the collective banning of persons attending any meetings being held anywhere.</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;he&#x201D; in line 14, page 7, to the end of the proposed subsection (3) and to substitute &#x201C;deems it to be necessary in order to combat the achievement of any of the objects Communism&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Then I want to say at once, as far as the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) is concerned, that the attitude that he adopted is precisely the attitude that I myself adopted in connection with this clause, and that is why I do not have the slightest objection to accepting the hon. members&#x2019; amendment. It was our intention to cover the sort of case that he outlined here.</p> <p>With regard to the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) I am sorry that I cannot accept it, because the immediate effect of it would be to emasculate this whole clause.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member admits that that is the idea which she had in mind. That idea is not in line, of course, with our view of this matter, and the hon. member will understand therefore that I cannot accept her amendment. What the hon. member said was perfectly correct. If hon. members look at the old clause, they will see that in essence the new clause is precisely the same as the old one, except that here it is being made perfectly clear that there are two types of meetings which the old clause was designed to deal with but which it did not define very clearly. It was this fact that gave rise to the action between the former member for Maitland (Dr. de Beer) and the State at the time the state of emergency arose here. We want to eliminate that type of difficulty and it is for that reason that this amendment is being proposed.</p>

<p>The amendment is moved for these reasons: Clause 7 (b) as it stands (that is to say before we came to the Minister&#x2019;s amendment) is very wide indeed in the sense that where there may be communistic activities in some part of the country, the Minister would for that reason alone be able to ban gatherings anywhere else, even if they were totally unrelated to those particular activities. The effect of the amendment moved by myself is to relate directly the fear of the furtherance of communistic activities to the meetings which the Minister proposes to ban. I think it is reasonable and fair and that it complies with the basic idea behind the hon. Minister&#x2019;s introduction of this clause. It enables him to have these banning powers but only when he fears that communistic activities will be forwarded by a particular meeting concerned.</p>

<p>My quarrel with the hon. Minister&#x2019;s amendment is that the wording he uses is a little ambiguous. I say this with respect, it is difficult to give those words a precise meaning. It is difficult to say that those words clearly mean what the hon. the Minister intends to convey. I do suggest Sir, that the wording of my amendment more effectively brings about what the Minister intends in his amendment. It seems that what the Minister now desires it to link directly the communistic activities and the possibility of the furtherance of communistic activities with the meetings he seeks to ban. I believe that to be the Minister&#x2019;s wish. I urge upon the Minister that the best way in which he can do that is to adopt the amendment which I have moved.</p></speech>

<p>The hon. the Minister has told the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) that the object of his amendment is the same as that of the hon. member for Zululand&#x2019;s amendment. I may say that the amendment which the hon. the Minister has moved certainly makes the clause look a little bit better but it does not remove the basic objection which we have to Clause 7 (b) which is that the hon. the Minister can ban meetings even though those meetings have nothing to do with Communism.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I want to demonstrate to him how this must be so. His amendment is to remove all the words in line 14 after &#x201C;he&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;deems it to be necessary in order to combat the achievement or any of the objects of Communism The hon. the Minister has not indicated that he does not want to use this clause to ban all meetings on the Grand Parade at Cape Town. If the Minister is going to say all public meetings of any nature whatsoever on the Grand Parade are banned in future, then the hon. the Minister is not applying his mind to whether or not the meetings to be held in future will further the aims of Communism or not. Obviously he cannot do so. As the hon. member on my right says, the Salvation Army or any other similar organization will then be deemed to be furthering the aims of Communism. That is the difficulty, Sir. As the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is before us at the moment it leaves the clause with exactly the same objection, although as I have said, it is less objectionable than it was before. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Zululand is to insert the word &#x201C;thereby&#x201D; so that the hon. the Minister will have to apply his mind to every single meeting which is to take place. He will have to determine whether that meeting will in fact, in his opinion, further one of the aims of Communism. Unless the hon. the Minister has changed his opinion and that he does not want to impose blanket bannings on meetings at certain places&#x2014;I think he mentioned the Grand Parade at Cape Town and the Johannesburg City Hall steps&#x2014;there might be some substance in what the Minister says. But if he still intends to do so I urge upon the Minister to consider whether in fact this does not leave him with precisely the same powers as he had before without meeting the objection of the hon. member for Zululand.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of paragraph (a) of the proposed sub-section</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that no such prohibition shall debar any person from communicating with or receiving as a visitor any advocate or attorney managing his affairs whose name does not appear on any list in the custody of the officer referred to in section <i>eight</i> and in respect of whom no prohibition under this Act by way of a notice addressed and delivered or tendered to him is in force;</block>

<p>and to add the following paragraph at the end of the clause:</p>

<block name="quote">(c) by the deletion in sub-section (3) of the words &#x201C;Subject to the proviso to subsection (1)&#x201D; and the words &#x201C;after the expiration of the period of not less than seven days stated in such notice&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will allow me to make a few remarks to elucidate the amendment. If hon. members look at the old section in the original Act they will notice that that is a section whereby persons can be confined to an area and the principle contained in this clause remains the same as that contained in the old section which is now substituted by this, except in so far as it may perhaps go somewhat further, if it could not be read into the old section, namely, that besides confining a person to an area, persons may, in certain given circumstances, be confined to house arrest. We are also adding this that persons may be deprived of the right to receive visitors. I said during my second reading speech that hon. members would remember that when we had the emergency it was necessary for my predecessor&#x2014;and I wish to repeat that in the circumstances which prevailed and in view of the information at his disposal, my predecessor would definitely have failed in his duty had he not acted the way he did act&#x2014;to take certain steps. If at all possible, however, I want to avoid detaining people in those circumstances, and if the Committee accepts this clause it would mean that instead of detaining those people in similar circumstances in gaol, they would be confined to their own family circles without being locked up for that period. If that happened the position would also be that those persons would not be deprived of the right to earn their living because the clause provides for it that such persons can continue with their work and the clause is sufficiently wide to apply the restriction to them to after-working hours. That will also indemnify us from any reproach that we are taking these people from their wives and children while the clause is sufficiently wide to provide for house arrest. I have also received representations from the Bar Council as far as this clause is concerned. The attitude of the Bar Council is&#x2014;and I am anxious to observe it&#x2014;that nobody should be deprived of the right to get in touch with his attorney or advocate. The amendment which I have moved and which I have discussed with the Bar Council provides that such a person can indeed get in touch with his attorney or advocate provided the attorney or advocate is not himself a communist or subject to any restrictions. I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything further about this clause because it has been discussed in detail during the second reading debate.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to say at once that this clause, with or without the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, is utterly objectionable so far as the official Opposition is concerned. Sir, the hon. the Minister has referred to an emergency. There may conceivably be a case in an emergency for a provision such as this to be made by way of regulation, but as a part of the ordinary law of the land this clause is utterly objectionable. Let me say at once that the Minister&#x2019;s amendment improves the clause as printed slightly; it makes access to legal advisers possible. But the objection to this clause is that here, in a time of peace and even at a time when there is no emergency, we are making it possible for a Minister of the Crown to impose what is in effect house-arrest on a person. I would like to read the clause as originally printed, and I say that the principle remains unaltered&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may by notice under his hand addressed and delivered or tendered to any such person &#x2026; during a period so specified &#x2026; prohibit him from being within or absenting himself from any place or area mentioned in such notice or, while the prohibition is in force, communicating with any person or receiving any visitor or performing any act so specified.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister has conceded the right of a man to see his legal advisers, but of course that will not help him because he has no right of access to the courts in terms of this provision. The Minister is being given a power which could be abused and a power which in my submission should not stand upon the Statute Book of a democratic country. The provision gives the hon. the Minister the right, as one of the newspapers put it, to impose living death on a citizen without a trial.</p>

<p>This clause in fact does give those powers. The Minister can say that these powers will be reasonably exercised, but that is not the point. It is the duty of this Parliament to see that provisions put on the Statute Book of this country are provisions which cannot be abused.

Here we are including a provision which is not in accordance with the tenets of law and order as known to me. To me therefore the clause is utterly objectionable and we on this side of the House will vote against it. We are not prepared to be consenting parties to any Minister of the Crown having the right to impose unlimited detention on a person even if there are to be exceptions. We believe that the clause is wrong and I hope that even at this late stage the hon. the Minister will be prepared to withdraw this clause which I believe can only harm this country.</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (a).</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister in introducing this clause has told us that the new clause goes perhaps a little further than the existing section. Sir, I consider that to be a masterly understatement of the facts. What does Section 10 of the Act do? It allows the hon. the Minister, when he is satisfied that any person is in any area advocating, advising, etc., Communism or the objects of Communism, to prevent a person from being within any area defined in his notice. That is what the existing section does. This clause goes very much further than that. First of all it not only allows the hon. the Minister to prevent anybody from being in any area so defined; it allows him to prevent anybody from being in any place; that is another extension of the clause. It is a house-arrest clause, as the Minister has pointed out, but it is much more than that. It certainly allows the hon. the Minister to confine somebody to his house, incidentally without any time limit, without the opportunity to offer any defence, without any explanation whatsoever other than the notice that the Minister has tendered to the person.</p>

<p>And once the reasons have been furnished and he objects to those reasons he has no redress whatsoever and, as has been pointed out, being allowed to consult his legal adviser does not help him at all since he can carry no further the advice that his legal adviser may give him, so it does not help at all. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell this Committee whether the Bar Council did not ask him to do anything further as regards this clause. Here he is doing one thing, he is allowing somebody to see his legal adviser, but I am perfectly certain that that was not the only thing the Minister was asked to do by the Bar Council when they saw him. He <span class="col_6947-6948" refersTo="page_0720"/>told us that he would let us know what the Bar Council had asked him to do in this case. This clause goes much further than simply allowing house arrest. It can in fact enable the hon. the Minister to confine any person to any place, be it his home, or be it a gaol, or even be it a concentration camp. By a mere process of exclusion. By not allowing a person to be in any other place, other than the one the hon. the Minister specifies in his notice, he may in fact confine any person to any place for any length of time. Not only may he do this, but the hon. the Minister forgot to tell us the further details of this Clause: He may prevent this person from communicating with any person or receiving any visitor or performing any act so specified&#x2014;the widest possible wording has been inserted into this clause. For what purpose? The hon. the Minister told us that this is a concession, that during the state of emergency a couple of years ago it was necessary to confine people to gaol, but that now there is this concession, and he can confine people simply to house arrest, which will enable these people to be with their families and even to continue to earn their livelihood. But he does not allow them to communicate with anybody, to receive anybody, to perform any act at all that the hon. the Minister wishes to specify.</p>

Minister of Justice (&#x201C;of Justice&#x201D;, mark you) can take unto himself powers as wide as those that were given to a Minister of Justice in a time of emergency, when a state of emergency had actually been declared. This is the saddest reflection on the erosion of democratic principles in this country that I can possibly imagine. I take the strongest possible exception to this clause. It is no concession. The hon. the Minister does not have to try anybody, he does not have to stipulate time limits. People can be restricted to any place the hon. the Minister designates be it home, gaol, concentration camp, any place he prefers to designate. The hon. the Minister has given us the assurance on clause after clause that he does not intend to use these powers widely, and I want to say to the hon. the Minister again, as I have said before, that his assurances are not enough. If he does not intend to use these powers, he should insert the limiting words, in this legislation, and without those words, his assurances are meaningless.</p>

<p>I think that the contents of this clause have been framed with the specific intention that the effect of the clause would be that we would be able to overcome the difficulties and problems which we come up against in dealing with communists. I think we should always bear that in mind when discussing this clause. The mere fact that the Minister has moved this amendment to this clause proves the Minister&#x2019;s <i>bona fides</i> as far as this clause is concerned. We are dealing with unscrupulous people, Sir, and that is the reason why this clause should be as wide as possible. But the mere fact that although the clause is intended to deal with unscrupulous people and will go on to the Statute Book to deal with unscrupulous people, the door is being left open so that those people who will be affected by this clause will still have the opportunity, in the first place, of remaining at home amongst their own people and, in the second place, of going to their work and maintaining their families, proves the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister as far as this specific

clause is concerned. I admit that the powers which are taken in terms of a clause such as this are wide, but I repeat that seeing that we are dealing with unscrupulous people and organizations which this clause is aimed at, I think the fact that the Minister is still prepared to amend it in this way is sufficient proof of his <i>bona fides</i> and because it proves his <i>bona fides,</i> I do not think we should make it impossible for the Government to overcome the problems which this clause is aimed at overcoming.</p>

<p>The trouble with this clause is that even though one agrees that Communism should be combated in South Africa, one finds that it takes the question of whether a person is a communist or not out of the sphere of fact into the sphere of mere opinion on the part of the Minister. The hon. the Minister need not find that under this clause a man is in fact a communist before he can be punished.</p>

<p>Look at sub-section (1) (ii); it refers to &#x201C;any person who is likely to advocate, advise, defend or encourage the achievement of any such

object &#x2026;&#x201D; There need be no evidence whatsoever that he is a communist, that he advocates communist activities or that he has

communistic plans. The Minister must merely in his own opinion think that the man is likely to do it. It means that the facts are no longer of concern to the Minister or the people who are supposed to punish a man. It is merely a question of opinion, of likelihood, of possibilities. It is preposterous and ridiculous that we as a responsible Parliament should be asked to pass <span class="col_6949-6950" refersTo="page_0721"/>legislation which is so wide in affecting the rights and the liberties of the subjects. And again in sub-section (1) (iii), it says &#x201C;if the Minister is satisfied that a person engages in activities which are furthering or may further the achievement of any such object&#x201D;, &#x201C;May further&#x201D;, in the opinion of the Minister, completely divorced from fact, subject to a limited appeal to the courts on the question of the Minister&#x2019;s good faith, or whether the hon. the Minister has applied his mind to the subject. But such a right of appeal is of no avail to a person who wrongly falls under this clause; it is impossible to prove <i>mala fides,</i> or that the Minister did not apply his mind to the fact. All it says is that the Minister has to believe that a person &#x201C;may&#x201D; do something to further the ends of Communism. I do think that this is going too far. I cannot understand that we are being asked to consider applying such a clause to the subjects of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I believe moreover that this is the type of clause which will necessitate the Government&#x2019;s coming to this House again and again with amending legislation. I do not see how it can be made effective. First of all we do not want the clause, and then secondly, I think it is our duty to point out that such a clause is useless and meaningless, unless the Minister is willing to put guards on every person to whom this clause is applied. Otherwise it will be completely useless. How is the hon. the Minister going to control from hour to hour and minute to minute with whom a man affected by this clause is communicating, with whom he is associating, what he does every minute of the day, what telephone calls he makes, to whom he speaks at work, or at any other place where he is still permitted to go? It is an impossible clause. Surely the only solution would be that if a man is guilty of a crime, he should be tried and punished according to the law. But because the hon. the Minister is trying to do things administratively which should be done through the courts, by a judicial authority, he lands himself in an impossible situation like this; he is forced to come with a clause in which he seeks to be allowed to punish a man, not on facts, but merely on opinion. I am grateful therefore that I am associated with a party which is fighting this Bill.</p>

If that is the position, I am surprised that the hon. member is happy to be associated with his party which is opposing this clause with all their might. I want to tell the hon. member that this clause is preeminently the clause which is feared by the communists and that may be the reason why this clause is being opposed so seduously, I won&#x2019;t say by that hon. member, but by some of those hon. members, because it is preeminently the clause which will clip their wings. I can assure the hon. member of that. I now wish to assist the hon. member further out of the darkness. It will not be the first time that this clause will be applied in South Africa, if it is ever applied in South Africa. This clause has already been applied in South Africa. Let me tell the hon. member that it was applied when the war was over for all practical purposes, when fighting had ceased in Europe. It was still being applied here in South Africa at that time. I did not want to do so but because the hon. member pretends that this is something brand new and something which has never been applied in South Africa in the past, I want to tell the hon. member that I myself have had practical experience of the application of this clause.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Those are the questions we get from the other side, Sir. The hon. member asks whether I approve of it. I had no option. Let me state this clearly. The Government of the day, for reasons which they deemed to be sufficient, believed that that was a way whereby they could combat undermining activities, as they put it. Those hon. members had no objection at the time to its being put into operation. Not a single member on that side ever objected to it in principle. And if it were not wrong in principle to apply it to people at that time, whether or not you agreed with those people, it is most certainly good and well that this principle should also apply to-day in respect of Communism. If hon. members could say to me that they objected to the principle at that time, I would have appreciated their objection to the principle, but they spoke in favour of it at the time, they approved of it, and consequently with the best will in the world I cannot understand why they oppose it so vehemently to-day because it is aimed at the communists. All that this clause envisages, as is stated in this clause, is, as I have already told hon. members, that in the past there were two ways open to us to take action against these people. In the first place we could prohibit those people from attending meetings and we could confine them to areas. I have already told hon. members, and I wish to repeat it, that I envisage that there will be four stages. In the first place this clause provides that a person may be warned by a magistrate to desist from taking part in any activities which may promote Communism. If he ignores that warning I envisage that that person will be prohibited from attending any meetings so as to render him harmless. Because the whole underlying motive of this clause is to prevent a person to doing any harm, particularly from doing any harm at night, as these people want to do. If in the second place he ignores this injunction and does attend meetings and continues with his undermining activities, it is my intention&#x2014;and that is the object of this Bill&#x2014;to confine him to an area. If in spite of that confinement to an area he continues to associate with other communists and to conspire <span class="col_6951-6952" refersTo="page_0722"/>against the safety of the State, I will not hesitate for a moment to apply this clause to him. Because if we are serious in our endeavours to fight Communism, if we are serious when we say that we should not wait until the actions of these people get us into trouble but that we should ward off that trouble, I cannot understand how there can be any objection to these provisions. When we consider what these people say they intend doing with South Africa, what they have conspired to do in the past, and what they have already done, I think we are being very reasonable, considering the circumstances, in treating people in the way in which this clause provides for.</p>

<p>Although the Minister himself may be guiltless of any malicious intention, he could, perhaps by mistake, confine a man to house arrest and impose some or all of the other penalties under this Bill&#x2014;on an entirely innocent man. It is not often that a member can state his own case by way of example. The Minister made a certain untrue allegation against me. It would be within his power in terms of this clause, because he thought mistakenly and erroneously that I had subscribed to an organization which he said was communist controlled, to decide, without hearing my defence, that I am &#x201C;likely to further (even although innocently) one of the objects of Communism He could then commit me to perpetual house arrest, and I would have no redress. And do not let the hon. the Minister try to persuade anyone in this House that I could demand detailed reasons for this arbitrary action. The hon. the Minister knows that under Section of the main Act, I can ask for reasons why a notice is served on me. But does he not also know that his reasons can be given in such a vague and general manner that it would be impossible even then to define the crime I am accused of or for me to know what charge I had to meet or what I had done wrong. He could simply say that I supported an organization which he regards as unlawful, and therefore, in terms of the Act am likely to further the cause of Communism. That is all he need do and no court could question it. I certainly could not prevent his sentence or avoid its severity. He could confine me to my house and subject me to all the iniquity of his will, whilst I would not even know what I was alleged to be guilty of. I could not even plead my cause to anyone, unless the Minister graciously accorded me the privilege. I need be given no opportunity to point out that he was entirely mistaken. It is fortuitous that the hon. the Minister now knows how mistaken he was just a short while ago. The hon. the Minister will admit that he thought that I had committed an act which he now finds to be quite untrue. I would never even be given a chance of proving my innocence. That is why I say that this clause is not only objectionable, it is an iniquitous clause. The Minister may have the best intentions in the world, but that does not excuse Parliament giving him the uncontrolled powers for which he asks. No one should possess such vast powers over his fellow citizens in a civilized state. This enormity of what he proposes is almost beyond belief &#x2026;</p>

<p>Some of them were extended, temporarily, after the war. In time of war any Parliament is all to anxious to clothe the Executive, temporarily, with all the power it needs to conduct that war successfully. The second thing the hon. Minister always forgets is that our Act was limited to one year after the war ended. In other words, it was not a permanent part of the legislation, as this Act will be permanent. This clause if passed can only be altered by another Act. If the hon. the Minister had limited his powers to combat Communism to one year; If he had agreed that they should be renewed by this Parliament year by year; then we might have been able to get together and discuss some fair way of achieving that end. This Minister is not entitled to the vast powers he now demands. He must admit that this clause, when it goes in to the Statute Book, is intended to stay there permanently. We find this clause not only thoroughly objectionable, we find it quite iniquitous. No one should have the powers this Minister will have over possibly innocent men who can not prove their innocence. There is nothing the Minister can point to in this Bill which ensures that a man has the opportunity of <span class="col_6953-6954" refersTo="page_0723"/>proving his innocence. If he was kind, I presume he would tell the magistrate to warn the suspected person. He need not do it. If he wanted to he could give reasons, but the Minister need not give reasons in detail. And there is no redress an innocent man can claim as of right. Unless the Minister cares to give him a chance, as an act of grace his victim is powerless. He would not care to give such a chance to certain people. It is all very well to say, as he has said, that he will not proceed against me; that he will not proceed against the Committee for the Defence of Civil Rights. But just let his intended victim be some poor Coloured man who has criticized him or his Government too strongly; let it be some dark skinned man, some African, who is the outspoken opponent and critic of the colour policy of this Government; let it be someone who has little or no influence and who cannot defend himself; in that case this Minister would have no hesitation in committing any troublesome man of that sort to the rigours of house arrest, in confining him closely to his house, cut off from all contacts with outside. The kindly hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;) said that the whole idea was that such a suspect should be able to earn a living and not creep about in the night doing unsavoury things. That of course is only if the hon. Minister graciously consents to let him continue to earn a living. He can confine him to his house; he can forbid him to see any friends; the only person he can see is a lawyer; I do not even know if he can see his doctor; I presume he might have to and face the consequences. The fact remains that he can be prohibited from dealing with anyone, from communicating with anyone; from carrying on his business. If he were an editor of a newspaper, he could not even ring up his colleagues and ask for or give them news. He could not conduct his business, unless the Minister graciously allowed him to do so. I am certain of this, that several people, many people perhaps, know that they will never be affected by the mischief of this clause. But we should not ever pass a law that might unfairly touch the humblest person in this Republic whatever his race or colour. Let us pause before we grant to this Minister these too vast powers. We on this side of the House, have no trust that he will exercise his powers with any moderation &#x2026;</p>

<p>I wish to point out that the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) has now reacted to what the hon. the Minister has said namely that a Bill similar to this one was applied by the previous Government. The hon. member for Wynberg replied to that by saying that there was a war on at the time and that it was only for a year after the war, whereas this Bill would form part of our permanent legislation. I want to point out to the hon. member for Wynberg that in those days when a Bill similar to this Bill was applied by the previous Government for a year after the war, it was applied in respect of a set of circumstances which had ceased to exist a year before. In other words, had the war not come to an end a year before, and had the dangers which accompanies the war still existed, the legislation would probably have been applied for a longer period and not only for a year. We are dealing with a set of circumstances, however, which is permanently with us. After the war the advent of Communism and its accompanying dangers assumed a permanent character and that is why it is necessary to place legislation on the Statute Book which is of a permanent character so as to be able permanently to meet the dangers inherent in communists. That is why, other than in those days, legislation of this nature should contain an element of permanency. In the second place I agree with the hon. member for Wynberg that the Minister does indeed have the power to prohibit a person from communicating with anybody if the Minister wishes to deal with him in terms of this clause but as I have already said the mere fact that we are dealing with unscrupulous people makes it basically essential in the first place, that we have legislation of this nature. The mere fact, however, that the Minister has inserted provisions in this same clause whereby such a person will be able to continue to provide for his family, in spite of the restrictions, shows what the Minister&#x2019;s intentions are under this clause. It proves that the Minister&#x2019;s actions are <i>bona fide.</i> The fact that the Minister makes the further concession that when action is taken against a person in terms of this clause, he retains the unrestricted right to get in touch with his legal advisers or legal representative (a provision which was not contained in the legislation of the previous Government), the fact that those people who can prove that the Minister&#x2019;s actions have been <i>mala fides</i> can do so, the fact that the Minister has made this concession is further proof of the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister in respect of this clause. That is why I think this clause should remain as it is. We must bear in mind that we are dealing with unscrupulous people and that we are dealing with a Minister and a Government who are doing their utmost to make this clause operate as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p>The legal representatives will have the opportunity of clearing up the matter and of settling things with the Minister and bring it to his notice that he has charged the hon. member for Wynberg under this clause as a result of a misunderstanding. In that way the whole problem will be solved. That is why the dangers do not exist in this clause which hon. members opposite see in it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;) has fallen into the same error as the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister justifies this clause as being an act of mercy on his part. He said that if he did not do this, these persons would be in gaol. Sir, this is a most remarkable statement for the hon. the Minister to make. Since when is the hon. the Minister going to take over the functions of the court, and the Attorney-General, and the prosecutor and the gaoler?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members over there don&#x2019;t seem to appreciate that under this Bill if you are a communist, if you perform acts which are calculated to further the achievement of the objects of Communism, you commit an offence. And for that offence, if it is proved in a court of law as a fact that you have done so, you go to gaol in the court&#x2019;s discretion and for certain of these offences there is to be a minimum of a year&#x2019;s imprisonment. What the hon. the Minister is doing here is to do what he says he is doing namely to substitute imprisonment by the court with imprisonment by the Minister; imprisonment by the Minister not on any proved facts at all, not on any basis upon which persons normally go to gaol, or upon which persons are normally penalized. The Minister himself used the term &#x201C;house arrest&#x201D;&#x2014;a case of permanent arrest without ever going to trial. That is what this clause amounts to. When the hon. member for Smithfield tells this Committee that the Minister has shown his <i>bona fides</i> by reason of the fact that he has moved that amendment to the effect that persons under house arrest can see their advocate or attorney who is managing their affairs, it seems to me rather remarkable. Is it only the lawyers who are to get the benefit of this; is it only in respect of the lawyers that such a person is to have any benefit at all? And in any event, Sir, what sort of an advocate is it who &#x201C;manages&#x201D; the affairs of the person concerned? Is it only in those cases where the man is a prodigal, or under a court order, or where he has an executor who happens to be an attorney? What about those cases where a man is under an executor who might not be an attorney, or the case of somebody whose firm is under judicial management, or where the man is an insolvent? What about those cases; what is the hon. the Minister going to do about them? Why has the hon. the Minister only dealt with the legal profession? What about the medical profession? If the medical profession had gone to see the hon. the Minister would he have granted a concession in their case as well? In any event, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s <i>bona fides</i> as far as I see it here, is not what the hon. member for Smithfield says. According to the newspaper report, what the General Bar Council wanted was that &#x201C;these people should have the right to make representation and that there should be provision for access to legal advice&#x201D;. The amendment of the Minister does not meet that, Sir. You do not get legal advice only from those lawyers who are managing your affairs, also managing your affairs in the capacity as executor. But the difference between this and the case cited by the hon. the Minister is that I could not be put in gaol by a court. So the Minister will not be doing me a favour by saying that he is confining me to house arrest. Similarly in the case of thousands and thousands of others. The Minister is not doing them a favour by saying to them that instead of going to gaol they are to suffer house arrest, because he cannot put them in gaol; it could never be proved as a fact that they had committed an offence; it could never be proved as a fact that they had done something which was unlawful; it could never be proved as a fact that they had furthered the objects of Communism. It is only a case, as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has pointed out, of what the Minister thinks. Here is the word in (iii) &#x201C;may&#x201D;. As the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) pointed out earlier on this afternoon &#x201C;may&#x201D; can mean &#x201C;if the Minister in his most fanciful moment thinks that he could do something&#x201D;. Once again, Sir, the word is subject to precisely the same objection that it was subject to then, namely that the hon. the Minister is here taking the power of the prosecutor, of the Judge and of the gaoler without having any regard whatsoever to the ordinary precepts upon which the system of justice of any civilized country are based. The hon. the Minister is taking all this unto himself. He himself is punishing people, in effect, without trial, without representation being allowed and I want to point out that that is one of the matters which the Bar <span class="col_6957-6958" refersTo="page_0725"/>Council raised. Under this clause the Minister can prevent anyone from making any representations to him, he can prevent him from communicating with anybody to communicate with the hon. the Minister on his behalf. That was the attitude of the Bar Council according to what was published in the newspapers. That is all I know about it. I hope the hon. the Minister will tell this Committee exactly what each of the items of this Clause is intended to be used for. I can understand the hon. the Minister expecting those hon. gentlemen in that corner just falling into line, but how can he expect us on this side of the House to give him the power to prevent a person from performing any act? Will the hon. the Minister tell us what sort of acts he has in mind? Under this clause the hon. the Minister can prevent an attorney or an advocate from having clients who are Black. From the remarks which the Minister made which I saw reported in the Press on the occasion of the recent law conference, I wonder whether that is not what the hon. the Minister has in mind when he produces an amendment like this. I think the hon. the Minister owes this Committee at least an explanation as to why he wants these powers and exactly how he is going to put them into effect. This refers to all the clauses, Sir; it refers to Clause 7 where the Minister told us that the object of that was to place a blanket banning on all meetings on the Grand Parade and on all meetings on the steps of the Johannesburg City Hall. I hope the hon. the Minister will give us some sort of an idea as to what is involved there. And if the Minister will not do that, Sir, how can he possibly expect to get any support not only from this side of the House but from the people upon whom he will ultimately have to rely to put this clause into effect. As the hon. member for Yeoville pointed out the persons upon whom the Minister is going to rely are the ordinary people. His whole Police Force will be taken up watching all those people who are confined to house arrest. The whole of the telephone department will have to be put on doing the things which they were trying to do to the telephone of the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). And if the hon. the Minister cannot justify the case, if he cannot get the public to support this, this clause in any event is going to fail. I hope the hon. the Minister will do this House the courtesy of telling it why he wants these powers.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, of all the exaggerations we have had here to-day, the one which we have just had from the hon. member must certainly be the worst. The hon. member sets out from the same standpoint as he did before when he said that the Minister&#x2019;s decisions border on the capricious. Just let us look at the clause again, and before we go off the rails completely, let us analyse it. The clause deals with two kinds of people: Those who are listed in terms of Section 8. I presume that even the are hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) will say: &#x201C;I cannot protect those people.&#x201D; Is that right, or is it wrong? Or, if the Minister puts these listed communists under house arrest, will the hon. member for Germiston (District) still be opposed to it? Will he still be opposed to this clause?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Then I can justifiably come to the conclusion that the goodwill of the hon. members for Germiston (District) and Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) and Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) towards these people who are listed communists is just as great as it would have been if they were not listed communists. That is the first point. I should really have mentioned the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) first. Let me tell all four of them, and also the whole of the Opposition, that as far as we are concerned, if someone is a communist he is branded, as I said previously in this debate, with <i>infamia</i>.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? Do you believe that because a person&#x2019;s name appears on such a list he is not entitled to the protection of the courts?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>The facts are these, that before anybody&#x2019;s name is placed on the list, he has had plenty of opportunity to show why he should not be a listed communist. It is considered by an official, not a court, but one who has knowledge of the law. That has already been part of the law of this country since 1950. Surely the hon. member is not against that. Therefore when a man&#x2019;s name appears on the list of communists it means that the goodwill of society towards such a person is rather moth-eaten. It has shrunk. That means that he must not expect to enjoy the goodwill which other people can enjoy. So that is quite correct, because basically the object of those people is to destroy society, and we can have no goodwill towards people who want to destroy the existing order by unconstitutional means. That is the first point I want to make.</p>

<p>If the hon. member asks me whether I do not think that those people are entitled to justice, I say that that is almost a stupid question, because even a convict is entitled to justice. But when the names of people appear on this list, they still have all the rights they deserve. And those rights&#x2014;and that is my reply to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman)&#x2014;are enjoyed by those people in terms of Section 1<i>bis</i> of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Before I come to that, I should just like to deal with the second group of people to whom reference was made, and in so doing I want to reply to the question of the hon. member for Durban (Point). They are the people who, in the opinion of the Minister, e guilty of certain activities which promote <span class="col_6959-6960" refersTo="page_0726"/>Communism. Now hon. members object to the opinion of the Minister, because the hon. member for Durban (Point) says his opinion means nothing to him. I can understand that. He is sitting on that side of the House. He has no responsibility for the maintenance of law and order. He does not believe that the Minister or any one of us on this side will do the correct thing. From his point of view, we are incapable of doing any good and are inclined to do everything that is wrong. That is why he says these things. But even if that is true, there is enough protection for those people under Section 1 his. I will read it to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any person to whom a notice has been delivered or tendered under Section 1 &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are now the listed people and the others who in the opinion of the Minister are suspected of certain activities&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; requests the Minister to furnish him with the reasons for such notice and with a statement of the information which induced the Minister to issue such notice, the Minister shall furnish to such person a statement in writing, setting forth his reasons for such notice and so much of the information which induced the Minister to issue the notice which can, in his opinion, be disclosed without detriment to public policy.</block>

<p>Now it is part of our administrative law&#x2014;the hon. member may shake his head; he may shake it so hard that it falls off, but that still does not change the law of the land. The law of the land is this: Whenever anybody has to exercise his discretion, he must not attain the absurd. The Minister therefore cannot come to a conclusion, as the hon. member for Wyn-berg thinks, which will be absurd.</p>

<p>I have just read it out here. The hon. member for Wynberg should remember the English adage that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I must prepare the hon. member for the argument. The argument is that the Minister is compelled, in terms of the amendment, and it is the only one, to give the reasons and the facts which brought him to that particular conclusion.</p>

<p>It says here that he must give the reasons and as much information as the Minister considers to be in the interests of public safety. Of course he can refuse to reveal certain things. I do not understand the hon. member for Wynberg. He sits here like a parrot, repeating. Every time we say a thing he will repeat the same cry, as if we are two parrots. The fact simply is that in terms of the section, the Minister must give the reasons and the facts and then, if he has come to an absurd conclusion, the hon. member for Point can have it reviewed. The newspapers will get hold of it and I can assure you that there will be such a row in the country that the sanctions which can be applied to the Minister will be much more severe that if the Minister were to make a court case and lose it. The facts are that in terms of this section, with the provisions of administrative law, with the powers a person has who is affected by the exercise of a discretion, there is sufficient opportunity for him to show that in his case a mistake has been made. That is my reply to the hon. member for Germiston (District). He asked whether those people were entitled to justice. I say they are entitled to it, and they have it. Remember, however, that we are dealing with people who, according to this side of the House, have been besmirched with an <i>infamia</i>. That means that they have not as many elementary rights as somebody else has who has not been besmirched with infamia. Now hon. members opposite may say that as far as they are concerned somebody who is a communist and who is guilty of communist activities is not besmirched with infamia in their opinion. We will never agree on that point. We believe that when somebody has the object of undermining the foundations of the State, he is not entitled to all the elementary rights to which other people are entitled. If we do not do this, the other alternative is to wait until riots ensure. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton: How many murders, how much arson, how many rapes, how many assaults, does she want committed before the Minister can be given the powers he is asking for here?

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to waste the time of the Committee in replying to the abstract approach of the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) to the law. He assumes that everybody affected by the provisions of this clause can go to court, either by way of review proceedings or by way of getting a <i>mandamus</i>. Had he had a practical approach to the matter, Sir, he would have known that that can happen in only a very few cases because of the financial inability of the person to do so.</p>

<p>I am rather surprised at the approach of the hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9; Jnr.) in considering the proviso introduced by the hon. the Minister as being a safeguard against injustice, whilst the Minister himself goes no further than simply calling it a concession to the General Bar Council. <span class="col_6961-6962" refersTo="page_0727"/>The mere fact that the person concerned can be visited by his legal adviser is very doubtful help; it is certainly no safeguard. Because he will only hear one side of the case. Had there been provision in this clause whereby he could hear the other side of the case, and not only hear it but test it, the matter would have been vastly different. Merely to have the right of access to your legal adviser really takes the matter no further at all. It only amounts to this that he is getting a certain amount of comfort with little help.</p>

<p>The other strange aspect is that the Minister himself is not only prepared to support but he is also prepared to perpetuate in times of peace, a provision which he opposed in times of war. Because that is in fact how far he takes the position to-day. The Minister knows perfectly well that in times of war one acts cautiously first and with consideration only second. We are not in times of war and that is exactly why we oppose a drastic provision such as this. It is no good the hon. member for Smithfield talking about the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister. It is not a question of our doubting the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister or questioning his intentions. The important thing is to have certainty about the terms of the clause itself. That is the safeguard; that is the duty of Parliament to see not only that abuse does not take place, but to see to it that the terms of the clause are such that abuse cannot take place.</p>

<p>You can give discretion to a court. And if the hon. member for Standerton has not dealt with this matter in this abstract way and had he dealt with it in a more practical manner, he would have supported this side of the House when the question arose of allowing the matter to be adjudicated by the Court. But he dealt with it in such an abstract way that he left out the practical side completely.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day I quoted the statement by Edmund Burke that &#x201C;If I cannot reform with equity I will not reform at all&#x201D;. I indicated what my view would be of how the change had taken place and this clause gives me the opportunity of indicating that unless the hon. the Minister does agree to the suggestion made from this side of the House to abandon this clause entirely I think we can reduce his attitude to this &#x201C;If I do not reform with tyranny I cannot reform at all&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>I think that this clause more than anything else has clearly brought to light the real difference which exists between this side of the House and the Opposition on the other side. I think it is a difference which has been evidenced throughout the second reading debate and the discussions on the clauses with which we have dealt so far. As I see the position, this side of the House is prepared to allow this Parliament to vest the executive authority with certain powers; this side of the House adopt the attitude that the Minister is there because he has been nominated to that position by the Prime Minister and that the whole Cabinet is co-responsible with him for his actions. Furthermore, that the Prime Minister is there because he is the leader of the majority party and that he has been chosen by the majority party to govern the country. The Opposition, on the contrary, is not prepared to vest the executive authority with the powers provided for in terms of Clause 8 or with any other powers. I wonder whether the Opposition would have been equally strenuous in their opposition to this clause had they had higher hopes at the polling booths. The Opposition is continuing with their opposition to Clause 8, to vesting the Minister with power, which is nothing more than delegating Parliament&#x2019;s power to the executive authority, in spite of what they did in 1960 when they were prepared to support the Riotous Assemblies Act. They are also doing this in spite of what they did in 1956 with the Unlawful Organizations Act. I am sorry that the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) has walked out. He served on that Select Committee in 1956 and he voted for it that special powers should be given to the Minister in 1956, powers which were not subject to recourse to the courts of law. I admit that that was a consolidating measure. But if you feel so strongly about a principle as the hon. member for Wynberg says he feels about this principle, I want to ask him this specific question: Why did you not protest in 1956 as you are to-day?</p>

<p>There is one member in this House who protested against it in 1956 and that is the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton). He also voted against it. But the hon. member for Wynberg, together with the Opposition, did not do so. I do not want to act in an un-parliamentary manner. As I have said it was a consolidating measure; but I still say that if you feel so strongly on a principle, I think it was the duty of the hon. member for Wynberg also to have voiced the protestations on that occasion which he has voiced to-day.</p>

<p>If you will allow, Mr. Chairman, I should like to say a few words about the clause. I wish to say to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) that where he says that this clause will greatly damage South Africa outside I want to differ from him. I want to say this to him that there is nothing which will do more harm to the good name of this country in the world outside&#x2014;and I expect him to disassociate himself from those things&#x2014;-than, for example, this protest of Friday &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am referring to the protest at the top of Adderley Street, with the gallows. Mr. Chairman, Clause 8 refers to a provision in the old Act under which the Minister has the power to prohibit a person from being in a certain area. Say, for the sake of argument, that a person has been living in the Cape Peninsula and he is prohibited from being in that area, surely that hits him very hard. I would think so. That is a power which the Minister already has. Clause 8 now confers upon the Minister the further power also to prohibit a person from leaving an area.</p>

<p>Yes, without hanging him from the gallows. So it is much better for anyone who works in the Cape Peninsula, instead of the Minister ordering him to leave this area where he has his home and his work&#x2014;in other words that he may not be here&#x2014;to prohibit him from leaving this area and to confine him to this area. The best place to which you can ban any person, even any member of the Opposition, is to his own home, if it is necessary to ban him. Mr. Chairman, if I contravene the laws of the land, if I commit acts which constitute a danger to this country or to any country in the world, and they place these restrictions upon me and limit me to my home, but they allow me to do my work, to do everything which it is necessary for me to do to maintain myself and my family, I will have no ground for objection. In that case, I as a member of this side of the House, am prepared to vote in favour of it that this supreme body should give to the Minister the powers set out in Clause 8, because I believe that in that case these powers will continue to have a legal basis and that legal basis will be a decision of this Parliament. In spite of what any hon. members may have to say about the rule of law this Parliament is and continues to remain sovereign. That is why I support this clause.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot argue with the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots), because our concepts of democratic parliaments differ, but I want to come back to something which was said by the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) since this was a more legalistic argument rather than a philosophical one. He said that the fact that a person who had been confined to his house by the Minister did not have any legal redress did not really matter very much, because this would become public, the Press would get hold of it and public disapproval could do far more than any redress to the courts could do. But the hon. member has forgotten that there are other clauses in this Bill which may make it impossible for any statement to be published. If the statement emanates from the person, I doubt whether any newspaper would dare to publish it, and the hon. member knows perfectly well that the whole object of the later clause which prevents the publication of anything at all to do with actions under this Bill is to achieve this. The Minister himself told us that the house arrest clause would only be the fourth of the four remedies he could apply, the first step being to stop anyone from attending meetings, and the second step he could take was to prevent anybody from being in a certain area, and the third step was &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and the fourth was house arrest, and that would presumably apply to people who are listed and to people who are restricted in terms of the Act from attending any meetings, and those are the people whose statements or objections are now prevented in terms of Clause 19, So there is no protection at all of public outcry or public disapproval of ministerial action, which I admit in a democratic country is a very strong deterrent to arbitrary action by ministers or government. But in this case I am afraid it would not apply, because the Minister has seen to it that this normal course of the disapproval of the public has been blocked. So the hon. member for Standerton must read his laws a little more carefully before he comes along with arguments like that.</p>

<p>The other thing is that the hon. member for Standerton seems to think there is something specially holy about the list which is compiled. Once a man&#x2019;s name is on this holy list, no one can object to any steps taken against such people. But the Minister himself has admitted that he now needs to alter the law to enable him to take people&#x2019;s names off the list.</p>

<p>Well, they could ask for the reasons for their names being put on the list and they were given a reasonable opportunity, and if they had not objected by that time their rights to object fell away and thereafter the list was frozen. If that was not so the Minister would not need to come to the House with amending legislation to make it possible for him to remove those names from the list, which he now believes should not be included in the list. So therefore, the list can often have mistakes on it and it is because the Minister realizes it that he does this.</p>

<p>Now, I want to come to the core of this matter. On whose representations are people&#x2019;s names put on the list in the first place? The Minister does not just dream up these names in his bath. He acts on information. Where does it come from? Presumably from the Special Branch.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That must be a very old list indeed. The Minister knows that the records of the communist party must be out of date, otherwise he would not want to remove names from the list, because people whose names were put on the list many years ago are no longer communists. But let us bring it up to modern times. The Minister acts on information given to him by the Special Branch. That is his main source of information, and the point I am trying to make is that this information is not reliable by any means. The reason why I say that is that in many cases where the Minister has taken arbitrary powers and detained people, and banned people and listed people, acting on the information of the Special Branch, this information has been found to be completely groundless. Let me give a few examples. How many people were charged after the emergency ended? Not a single person was charged with anything, although hundreds were detained. Those people could have been charged with activities calculated to advance Communism, but no charges were laid against them in all this time. Then there is the treason trial, where again charges were laid, acting on the information of the Special Branch detectives, who took down verbatim reports at meetings, rather inaccurately. The verbatim reports they took of what I said at meetings must have been very garbled indeed. It is not only communist meetings that are being attended these days by the very energetic members of the Special Branch. But the point is that it is on the information given by the Special Branch that the Minister acts, and I say this information is often completely unreliable. It is no good saying that the Minister gives reasons for listing or banning people.</p>

<p>Then I will not continue along those lines, although I must point out that it does not only apply to people who are on the list, but to anyone the Minister wishes to act against, and again he has to act against people about whom he has information. Presumably the Minister has to act on somebody&#x2019;s information, so I come back to the same point, that it is on information supplied by the Special Branch which is by no means reliable. The Minister made the point that these steps were introduced during the war, and that he was reluctant even to mention it. Sir, I dislike any sort of arbitrary action where people do not have recourse to the courts, just as I dislike racialism of any kind. Therefore I cannot say that one approves of everything that was done during the war, but I say that there was far more justification for taking those arbitrary steps then than there is now. [Interjections.] There were thousands of young South Africans dying up north, and on the information that was being given to the enemy by the subversive actions of persons in this country thousands more South Africans lost their lives. [Interjections.] Ships were sunk at sea, and therefore there was far greater justification for such action during the war than action taken now against a handful of communists when the country is at peace, as the Minister has himself admitted. I want to tell the hon. member for Standerton that I do not want murders, or arson, or explosions. He asked how many I wanted to take place. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>When my time expired just now, I was dealing with the point the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), who has just resumed her seat, was dealing with. She herself mentioned the four possibilities there are, or the four steps of dealing with communists. That is the one alternative. The other alternative is to put them in gaol or to intern them after the acts of violence, after the things have happened which the Minister wishes to prevent. Why then are we making this law?</p>

<p>That is what I wish to know.</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>It is to prevent sabotage, violence, arson, because those people want to shake the State to its foundations and to change the political order by acts of violence. We do not want to give those people the opportunity <span class="col_6967-6968" refersTo="page_0730"/>to do so, and that is why the Minister is taking these powers. The other alternative is to do what the United Party has always done. That is just to let matters develop until the worst happens one day, and then you take measures to imprison people. Subsequently you come to Parliament and pass an Indemnity Act. That side of the House passed Indemnity Acts. [Interjections.] In 1914 the old S.A. Party, the predecessor of the present United Party and the old Unionist Party that amalgamated with the S.A. Party, had an Indemnity Act after the strike in 1922. Had they had a Sabotage Act things probably would not have developed that far. They had indemnity Acts after the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45. Do hon. members want us to do that? If that is so, why don&#x2019;t they say so. If they think they are giving South Africa a good testimonial overseas by doing so, why do they not say so? When we had the riots we had here in 1953, 1960 and 1961, when hon. members helped to pass the General Law Amendment Act, and the special Act Criminal Procedure Act&#x2014;if we had to wait for that, it simply means waiting for the trouble we would rather not have. Do not think that Sharpeville and Langa and the riots at East London broke out sporadically merely. It was engineered and we do not want that kind of thing to happen again, for what happens? When such riots occur, there is servile reporting that advertises us overseas in a greatly exaggerated manner. And why? The Minister of Information will still discover it, if he has not done so already. The whole thing is calculated to achieve only this: Because we are the country in the whole of Africa where the greatest peace prevails, where we do not have murder and arson every day, and because there have always been a number of prophets who have been predicting that in South Africa there would be an eruption, that we are sowing dragon&#x2019;s teeth here that will result in us reaping a harvest of violence; and to realize those prophecies a revolution is stirred up. [Interjections.] The fact of the matter is that the propaganda made against us must be realized if they cannot achieve anything else. That is the aim, and the people who caused Sharpeville and Langa said: Thank the Lord for all the riots and now our prophecies have been realized. This clause giving the Minister power to detain people in their homes with their wives and children&#x2014;is it such a crime to place a man under home arrest so that he can always be with his wife and children?</p>

<p>It depends.</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>The object of this clause is to prevent that which the hon. member for Houghton mentions as the only other alternative. It brings me to a further argument of hers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton definitely has not studied the gravamen of Section 1 <i>bis</i> of</p>

<p>Section 10 of the principal Act. It provides that the Minister must furnish reasons as to why he deals with somebody under Section 10; it has nothing to do with the question of why he is included in the list. The Minister also has to furnish so much of the facts as he deems politically expedient, having regard to the security of the country. The hon. member says it will mean nothing, for there are other clauses in this Bill that prohibits the newspapers from issuing that very statement. May I draw attention to the fact that it is a statement of the Minister that is given to such a person&#x2014;I am referring to Clause 10 of the Bill, sub-section (g). She said that the statement of the Minister mentioning the reasons why he is placing a person under domestic detention, means nothing, for it will not have the required influence upon the public. Now that clause refers to a statement or any extract from or recording or reproduction of a statement or a speech made anywhere at any time by a person who has been prohibited under Sections 5 and 9 from attending any gathering. It is not that person who is making the statement, it is the Minister. All that happens is that a newspaper who feels like publishing this statement, will say that the Minister has furnished these reasons why he has restricted Mr. X to his home. Then the ordinary review of public opinion will come into operation, which is much more effective and a much greater brake upon a person with a discretion than a court case. If the Minister gives reason from which one cannot infer that the person&#x2014;I am now referring to the second category&#x2014;makes himself guilty of communistic activities, then we have a position under which&#x2014;according to the positive law of this country, the administrative law&#x2014;the Minister has arrived at a conclusion which on the facts is absurd. Then the Opposition would have an argument that is absolutely conclusive. [Interjection.] I should prefer not to be a complainant in any court proceedings in which I complain that my house has been broken into. I should much prefer to live in a world where there is no crime. But I shall never be a party to an action, as the hon. member for Houghton is, to give people the opportunity to upset the whole country. [Interjections.] The Minister has already said that he will permit the legal representatives to have access to that person. If those legal representatives are worth their salt, they will say: These are the reasons the Minister has given. The hon. member for Houghton need not be afraid that those things will not appear in the newspapers.</p>

<p>That brings me to my last point, namely that reference is made here to only the legal advisers of such an innocent victim who will have access to him. That is in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s amendment. In the Section as originally conceived, it is expressly stated that the Minister in his notice may say who shall be allowed and who not; and I think it is quite unreasonable to expect that the Minister will not permit the parson and the doctor. [Interjections.] There is a restriction on which <span class="col_6969-6970" refersTo="page_0731"/>parsons and which doctors. They must not be communists. The Minister may make exceptions. But does the hon. member want the Minister to give a long list of persons who will be permitted, in the Act? [Time limit.]</p>

<p>It seems quite clear that we are not going to convince the Minister or his supporters. The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), in debating this clause, rather appeared to be under a misapprehension. He seemed to think that the clause applied only to persons who had been listed.</p>

<p>No, I made the point that there are two categories.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I will not press it further, except to say that the hon. member will agree with me that on the correct interpretation of this clause it is still a matter in which the Minister must be satisfied that the person concerned engages in activities which are furthering or may further the achievement of any such object; and of course the persons concerned have no legal right to be legally represented. There is no court before which there is the right of cross-examination. As a lawyer the hon. member will agree that laws of that sort are laws under which grave injustices can be done, even by persons who believe that they are acting on correct information. The history of legal cases shows how often the prosecutors may be utterly wrong in the views they hold. We have the classical case of the treason trial, where the Crown indicted a very large number of persons but they were found not to have committed the offences with which they were charged. The case which we have put up against this clause is perfectly simple and clear. It is that we believe that in fighting Communism, you must to the greatest possible extent leave decisions which affect the rights and the freedoms of people in the hands of the court and not the Executive.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; I want to invite the assistance of the hon. member for Standerton, who no doubt will be able to help me out of my difficulty. We are dealing with the amendment of Section 10 of the principal Act, which gives the Minister the power to ban to certain areas anybody who advocates, advises, defends or encourages Communism, or anyone who does things which are calculated to further the achievement or are likely to further the achievement of Communism&#x2014;who actively does it, or a person who does things which are calculated to do it, or a person who does things which are likely to do it. Now a simple-minded person approaching this would think that those categories would cover all categories of people who are in any way likely to advance the cause of Communism. That is how it stands in the Act. We find in this amendment an additional category, those who may further the achievement of Communism. A child of 15 would know that the addition of that category widens the scope of the people who can be banned very considerably, to an almost unlimited extent. That is common cause. I will issue a friendly invitation to the hon. member for Standerton to give us a simple example of why the existing powers have proved to be inadequate in combating Communism, why the powers to ban those who actively defended or encouraged it, those who do things which are calculated to encourage it, and those who do things which are merely likely to encourage it&#x2014;I should like to be told why those powers have been proved to be inadequate and why this additional <span class="col_6971-6972" refersTo="page_0732"/>power is taken. This is a simple question and the hon. member, being in the Minister&#x2019;s confidence, will no doubt be able to give us a clear and simple reply.</p>

<p>My second difficulty is that in this clause two categories of persons are dealt with. The one is persons who advocate Communism, persons who are likely to advocate it, or persons who may advocate Communism. Those persons the Minister can ban or put under house arrest. Now, one would think that that list at least includes every conceivable person remotely connected with Communism. It is difficult to think of anyone who cannot fall under that blanket&#x2014;actively does it, is likely to do it, or may do it. But the prohibition does not end there. Having covered every conceivable category of communists, that is not enough. The Minister requires also to be able to ban those who are &#x201C;listed&#x201D;, but if those who are listed are only the communists or the fellow travellers, the Minister already has power to ban them under the category I have just mentioned. Why has it been found that those powers are inadequate, and why is it necessary in addition to be able to ban people who are merely on the list? Or are we to understand that this is mere superfluity of language, that the Minister is saying the same thing twice? He is getting at the listed persons, the communists and the fellowtravellers who are on the lists and he provides a second category in the same clause, designed to get at exactly the same group of people. Sir, to do that would be to advocate an absurdity, and the hon. member for Standerton says that that is not done. I agree with him that it is not done. We have these two categories obviously for a reason. If the second category is wide enough to cover everybody remotely connected with Communism, only one inference can be drawn and that is that in putting in listed persons in addition, it is desired to use these powers against persons other than communists. Those are the two difficulties which stem from the very wording of this amendment clause. Hon. members opposite have overlooked giving this Committee the benefit of an explanation. It can, of course, defeat my argument entirely if the hon. member for Standerton, for example, were to rise when I sit down and give us two simple examples, (1) proving why the existing powers under the Act were not wide enough and why it was necessary to bring in the words &#x201C;those who may further the objects of Communism,&#x201D; and secondly to explain by reference to a specific example why it is necessary to deal with both categories of persons in this legislation&#x2014;those who are listed and those who are in any way remotely connected with Communism.</p>

<p>Then one comes to the other new factor introduced in this particular clause which does not appear in the existing Section 10, and that is the question of preventing a person from absenting himself from a certain place. At an earlier stage in these proceedings I venture to pose the question to the hon. the Minister how this was to be implemented and he said that one would find out in the course of this debate. Perhaps he might consider it an appropriate time, seeing that we are dealing with Clause 8, to give this Committee some indication as to how this is going to be put into effect. Is there to be a policeman outside the house of every person who is prohibited from having visitors?</p>

It is obvious that I shall get my information from the police and other judicial officers.

<p>Judging from what hon. members have said, the communists are the most harmless lot of people there have ever been in South Africa. That is the only conclusion one can come to while listening to this debate. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) asked me how I am going to give effect to these provisions. Surely it is very clear that if the conditions set forth in that notice are contravened, a punishment will follow, and it will be a question of evidence in the courts whether or not those conditions have been complied with. If that evidence is lacking, the person cannot be convicted: and if the evidence is there that he failed to observe the conditions, from the very nature of things he will be punished for such contravention. I do not know what value the hon. member now really attaches to the question. It is obvious that those will be the consequences that will flow from a contravention of the conditions. If for instance a person has been prohibited in terms of this section from being at a certain place, and there is evidence before the Court that in spite of that prohibition he was at that place, the Court will convict him, and if the person has been ordered to remain in his home for instance from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., and there is evidence that at 12 o&#x2019;clock midnight he was in El off <span class="col_6973-6974" refersTo="page_0733"/>Street when he was not permitted to be there, surely it is obvious that a punishment will be imposed by the courts, provided the requisite evidence is brought. If in the case of such a person I were to say that such a person may not receive at his home any listed person, and I produce evidence that Mr. Sam Kahn or whosoever it may be visited him that night, it is obvious that a punishment will follow.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, accordingly agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 9,</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This clause enables the Minister to publish any prohibition placed upon anyone in the <i>Gazette</i> instead of serving it upon him personally. I must say that this is the first time I have ever seen a provision, a permanent part of our law, whereby a man can be prohibited from doing something, where disobedience will result in his being imprisoned for one year without the option of a fine, by notice of such prohibition being given in the <i>Gazette</i>. I think when one has regard to this clause, one must also have regard to the provisions of paragraph (a) of Clause 10 (1) because the proposed (d)<i>quat</i> says that anyone who fails to comply with a notice addressed and delivered or tendered to him in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 10 <i>quat</i>, will be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a minimum sentence of a year&#x2019;s imprisonment. I think it is in this clause, read together with Section 10, that one sees the enormity of the powers which are granted in Section 10<i>bis</i> in Clause 9, because were it not for the fact that disobedience of a prohibition published in the <i>Gazette</i>, which a person might not see, was visited with a compulsory sentence of one year, then this might not look quite so bad. But the fact of the matter is that although (d)<i>quat</i> says that if he fails to comply with a notice tendered and delivered to him personally he commits an offence, for which he must go to gaol for one year, it is quite clear that any notice which has been published in the <i>Gazette</i> is deemed to be a notice served on the person. The amendment which is in my name on the Order Paper is to try to some extent to ameliorate the effect of this clause, and it is to ensure that the Minister cannot put a notice in the <i>Gazette</i> unless not only unsuccessful attempts have been made but also that reasonable attempts have been made to serve personally on the person concerned. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that in all cases where substituted service is allowed by publication&#x2014;not only in our law but in many other countries of the world&#x2014;provision is first made for the proper exhaustion of the normal methods of service; in other words, in matters relating to personal status, for instance, no court will order the publication of an Order of Court or an order for the restitution of conjugal right in a newspaper or in the <i>Gazette</i> until the court itself is satisfied that reasonable attempts have been made to serve the papers on the person concerned. I therefore move the amendment which stands in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 65, after &#x201C;Act&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;reasonable but&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of this will be that the Minister would then be able to serve in the <i>Gazette</i> provided he was satisfied that the attempts that were made were not just unsuccessful but that they were also reasonable. I think this is a very reasonable request and I hope the hon. the Minister will accede to it. I would like to point out that this does not go as far as the Bar Council apparently wants the hon. the Minister to go. The Bar Council wants the Minister to say (so it would seem from what they have published in the newspapers) that this service in the <i>Gazette</i> should not be made unless the person was wilfully evading service.</p>

<p>It is quite correct, as the hon. member has said, that the Bar Council wanted me to say that I should be satisfied that there has been a deliberate evasion of service of the notice. Of course, it is impossible for any person or any Minister to be satisfied of the deliberateness of the acts of somebody else; accordingly I cannot insert it in that manner. But I have said in my second reading speech and subsequently also, that as far as I am concerned, I do not want to catch people unawares, and because the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is quite reasonable, I have not the slightest hesitation in accepting it. On the contrary I am going still further, and in spite of the fact that the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is being accepted by me, I am also moving the amendment appearing in my name and of which I have given notice. The position now is that before this section can come into operation, the Minister has to be certain that reasonable but fruitless attempts have been made to find the person, and in spite of that a notice should also be sent to his last address. The case I have in mind here is that of Mandela. I need not go into that matter; hon. members all know that it was simply impossible to have any order served upon him. Then there are other <span class="col_6977-6978" refersTo="page_0735"/>persons too whose names are not in question now because there are court proceedings pending. For those reasons I move this amendment and I am prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. I move therefore&#x2014;</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 10,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>This Clause 10 now brings into being contraventions of the law which are only committed by certain special people and not by the community at large. Anybody for instance can commit the offence of theft, but this crime under this Bill can only be committed by two groups of people, the people who appear on the list, people who are on the list of organizations which have been declared unlawful by the State President, or people whom the Minister may notify in terms of Clause 8 that he is of the opinion that they advocate Communism or that they are likely to advocate it or that they may engage in activities supporting the objects of Communism. Now the objection we have to this clause as it stands, is that people may innocently be committing offences. You may have people whose names appear on lists, and the Minister may have prohibited certain people from doing certain acts, and may in terms of Clause 8 prohibit further persons from doing certain acts, and at the moment these people may not know that it is an offence for them not to notify a change of address. At the moment although they are prohibited from going to certain areas, although they may be prohibited from doing certain things, they are at liberty to change their address provided they don&#x2019;t go to areas prohibited by the Minister, and they will not commit an offence in that case. But now the law is being changed and if the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is accepted, they will commit an offence, I say unwittingly. A lot of these people will not know of the change in the law, and if the Minister accepts our amendment it will simply mean this that he will have to serve a notice of the requirement of the law in writing on these people. I therefore move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end of paragraphs (d)his and (d)her, respectively: &#x201C;and provided that such person has been informed of the contents of this paragraph in writing&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I would like to point out to the hon. the Minister that if any person unwittingly commits this statutory offence, he lays himself open to very serious punishment. He can be sent to gaol for up to ten years. It is a very serious punishment. When an earlier clause, I think it was Clause 4 was discussed, we also asked the hon. the Minister to serve notice on persons personally. He stated that he did not know all the addresses. Now I submit that if the hon. the Minister or his Department are not aware of the addresses of some of the people who have been named already, it surely is an indication that they are not giving him any trouble at the moment. Their names may be on the list, they may have abandoned the idea of taking an active part in communistic activities, they may have repented, and on the other hand some of them may have been placed on the list innocently, but I submit that if they were causing any trouble to the State, the Minister&#x2019;s police would certainly know where they are and they would be able to serve this notice on them personally, and if the hon. the Minister in future has occasion to prohibit any person in terms of Clause 8 from doing anything, he will at that time be able to serve a notice on them in terms of my amendment. I ask the hon. the Minister therefore to accept it.</p>

<p>Sir, I know that promulgation of a law in the <i>Gazette</i> is notice to the whole world of the law, but I submit that in this case these people have already been dealt with; they have already been named communists: their names already appear on lists; a lot of them may not even know that their names are still on the list, and I submit that it will be no inconvenience to the hon. the Minister to serve notice as proposed here, on them. If the hon. the Minister does not know where they are now, then surely they are not causing any trouble. If he knows that they are troublesome and he cannot find them, he could possibly proceed under Clause 9, but I ask him to tell me now if it is not possible for him to accept my amendment.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendments standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 45, after &#x201C;which&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;to his knowledge&#x201D;; to omit paragraph (e); to omit all the words after &#x201C;(d)<i>quat</i>&#x201D; in line 72, to the end of paragraph (g); and in line 5, page 11, to omit &#x201C;thirty days&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The first amendment that I move here is in order to try also to reduce the penalties under this clause as far as people having to give their names and addresses every time they change their address, are concerned, and also to furnish names and addresses to any officer <span class="col_6979-6980" refersTo="page_0736"/>forthwith. I think that this clause is far too wide, and at the very most it should be limited to those persons, not who are on the list, but against whom steps are actually taken under Clause 10, that is persons who are confined to a certain area. I don&#x2019;t think the hon. the Minister should try and extend this provision to everybody who has been on the list, compelling him to furnish any change of address every time he moves, or changes his employment, and what is more to furnish his name and address to any officer forthwith. I think this amounts to unnecessary persecution. The purpose of my first amendment therefore is to try and limit the application of the new Clause 10.</p>

<p>I am also moving to omit the whole of paragraph (e), and this of course is the subsection dealing with the question of recording, reproducing, etc., by mechanical or other means, or to disseminate any speech or statement or any extract from or recording or reproduction of statement of anybody who is prohibited under either Section 5 or Section 9 from attending any gathering. I think this is an absurdly wide provision. The hon. the Minister is prepared to amend this to some extent, but by no means has he reduced the damage done by the inclusion of this new sub-section in the Act. It places people under the most onerous difficulties. People will have all the time to check up in order to make sure that they are not reproducing any speech of anybody who has been banned from attending gatherings, or who has been listed under the principal Act. It can really come to the most absurd situation, where for instance if it happens, that a listed person who holds a position at the university as lecturer is delivering a lecture to his students; those students run the risk under the law as it stands of being prosecuted for taking down a statement by a person who is listed (as actually happens to be the case) and thereafter reproducing in any form whatever, be it in the form of lecture notes or examination replies, the statements made by such a lecturer. They run the risk of being penalized under this clause. And what is more there is a minimum penalty of imprisonment of one year.</p>

<p>Do you now really think that would happen?</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I don&#x2019;t know whether it is going to happen or not. We have had this over and over again in the course of this debate. The point is that there are no limiting words in this legislation. I think this is far too wide. It means that anybody who is on the list, anybody who is under ministerial disapproval in terms of the Anti-Communist Act, which is a very far-reaching Act, and whose definitions are very wide indeed, can be prevented from having any statement or speech recorded or reproduced at any time. The hon. member for Mossel Bay may not know it, but I know for a fact that there is at least one person who holds a lecturership at one of our universities and who is a listed person. Any of his students attending those lectures, run the risk if he takes down his lectures and if they are reproduced at any time, or if he quotes the lecturer at any time, of being subject to punishment under this clause. Now the hon. the Minister has, I think, been told by the Bar Council that this would apply for instance to any member of the Bar, and there is at least one person that I know of who is a member of the Johannesburg Bar and who is listed. This would equally apply to such a person if the Minister had not decided on representations from the Bar Council to introduce an amendment which will exclude such persons from the purview of this clause. Therefore I think he ought to go further and exclude these other persons. But of course as far as I am concerned, the whole clause is too wide and that is why I ask that this entire sub-section should be deleted.</p>

<p>I now come to the other part of the clause which I want to be omitted and that is all the words after &#x201C;(d)<i>quat</i>&#x201D; in line 72 to the end of paragraph (g). This is the minimum penalty part of the clause. I don&#x2019;t think there should be a minimum penalty at all. It should be left to the discretion of the courts to impose what sentence they think fit on anybody who is found guilty of breaking the law in this regard.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to omit &#x201C;thirty days&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;six months&#x201D; in line 5 on page 11, in order at least to give people time to clear the decks, so to speak. I don&#x2019;t believe 30 days is long enough for anybody to get rid of any of the documents which the hon. the Minister does not wish them to have in their possession.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Before I reply to the two hon. members who have just spoken, I should like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 50, after &#x201C;<i>ter</i>&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;is or in line 58, after &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or except for the purposes of any proceedings in any court of law&#x201D;; in lines 60 and 62, respectively, after &#x201C;speech&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;utterance, writing in line 63, after &#x201C;made&#x201D;, wherever it occurs, to insert &#x201C;or produced and in line 74, to omit &#x201C;three&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;one year&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The first amendment of course is clear. It relates not only to persons who become members of an organization, but also to persons who are members of an organization, as it is amended now. I need say nothing further about the fact that &#x201C;utterance&#x201D; or &#x201C;writing&#x201D; are also inserted now, and the other amendments are consequential. Then we come to the amendment that provides that this clause shall not apply for the purposes of any proceedings in a court of law. Unfortunately a difference of opinion has arisen about the matter. There are people who adopt the attitude <span class="col_6981-6982" refersTo="page_0737"/>that you may not mention the court here because it is obvious that it is not applicable to a court of law. There are others again who think you should say it is not applicable to a court of law, for otherwise it may be construed in that way; that is why we are providing in this clause that it is not applicable to a court of law, without me thinking that it is necessary, but in order to put it absolutely clearly.</p>

<p>As regards the amendment of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) I do not think it is unreasonable to require all these people whose names appear on the list, to furnish us with their addresses. Nor do I think it is unreasonable to require people who have been served with notices already, to furnish their addresses. In fact, we require all aliens to furnish us with their changes of addresses, and if I or the hon. member were to go to a foreign country, the people there will expect exactly the same thing from us, even if we were to live there for 20 years or longer. Now I put it to the hon. member whether it is unreasonable now to require a person who has committed acts of Communism to such an extent that his name has been listed as an active member of the communist party and who has had every opportunity to say why his name should not be listed, to furnish us with his change of address? Either he has not availed himself of the opportunity to say why his name should not be on the list, or he has not succeeded timeously in providing that his name should not be there. Is that unreasonable?</p>

<p>I am coming to the point. Is it unreasonable to as some that they will know of the amendment of the law? No law has ever received so much publicity as this very one has, every clause of it. If the hon. member could tell me now that these people will not know that this prohibition will be effective, then I shall admit that there may be something in his argument, but after all the dust that has been raised about this Bill, there is nobody who can say that he is not aware of these provisions. Nevertheless, I want to give the hon. member the assurance that it is not our intention, and I have said so repeatedly, to in just or to prejudice those people who have become harmless. Our attitude has been throughout that we wish to get at these people who are still active and who from day to day, while you and I are sitting here, are engaged in activities to undermine the State, and to render them harmless. But I cannot concede that the onus should now be placed upon the Minister that he should first notify these people. They will be the very persons who are fleeing all over, who have departed from the country, who may at the moment be in Basutoland or Swaziland, and whom I shall not be able to reach.</p>

<p>Yes, but then I have to serve a second notice in respect of each one of these persons, and my contention is that the communists are the very ones who know exactly what is going on, and which we shall have difficulty in reaching, and I honestly do not think that we should go so far out of our way to show so much consideration for those people under those circumstances. If we do not do so in respect of aliens we bring here to become citizens of South Africa, and do not show the consideration to them, and if we impose a duty upon them to make known to us their changes of address, the question arises why should we do it in respect of the communists? If it were a small group, I would have agreed readily, as I have done in other cases, but here we are dealing with the people who were placed on the list in 1950. Every one of them knows that he has been listed, for after they were listed they were notified by registered post, each one individually, that they had been listed. I regret that in the circumstances I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>As regards the amendments of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) I agree with her that her amendments are not aimed at helping us to make the Act clear, but to weaken it, and unfortunately I cannot cooperate with the hon. member to make this Act weaker.</p>

<p>This clause, Sir, amends Section 11 of the principal Act 44 of 1950 and also Section 8 of Act 15 of 1954. It amends the offences and penalties sections of those Acts, provides new, and cruelly increased penalties and creates new crimes. When one realizes that it sets these vastly increased penalties for crimes which may have been unknowingly or inadvertently committed, one realizes why we are against this whole clause itself.

<p>Then say that I think they are arbitrary rulers. I have said that quite frequently in this Parliament. If my amendment is accepted, it means at least this that it will limit the wide powers of the Minister to some extent. It will not curb them as firmly as I would like to see them curbed, but my amendment will limit the Minister&#x2019;s arbitrary discretion as far as we on this side of the House are able to do. It will slightly decrease his otherwise intolerably arbitrary powers. At least, Sir, he will have to relate the new crime he is creating in this sub-clause to a person who is in fact setting out to further the aims and objects of Communism, as the clause now will read:</p>

<block name="quote">Without the consent of the Minister and for the purpose of furthering or in the circumstances calculated to further the aims and objects of Communism or of any unlawful organization, records or reproduces by mechanical or other means, or prints, publishes or disseminates any speech or statement, or any extract from or recording or reproduction of any speech &#x2026;</block>

<p>And there the Minister has added his amendment &#x201C;utterance or writing&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">or statement made or purporting to have been made anywhere at any time by any person prohibited under Section 5 or 9 from attending any gathering.</block>

<p>It seems to me that it is necessary to try and restrict the Minister&#x2019;s powers in this regard. A person who has been prohibited from attending a gathering or who has been banished, cannot be quoted by way of speech read out, or recording played. He cannot be quoted anywhere at any time without the consent of the Minister. I am not sure whether it would not be true to say that I could not quote extracts from the sayings or speeches of banned or prohibited person in Parliament, without asking the Minister&#x2019;s permission. As the clause stands, without any amendment, an offence can be innocently or ignorantly committed. It could be committed even by a person who sets out to combat Communism. If such a person quotes the words of, or an extract from the statement or writings or made a recording of a statement by a person she is listed or who has fallen into the disgrace of the Minister, with the express intention of proving that the communistically inclined author was a danger to the State, technically he would find himself guilty of an offence. Mr. Chairman, the Minister knows that he can ban a gathering even if it has nothing to do with Communism. He can ban it if he deems it to do expedient for the maintenance of public peace. He can deem me to be &#x201C;likely to further the various objects of Communism&#x201D;. Now he can put a notice to this effect in the <i>Gazette</i> which I do not read (because I don&#x2019;t expect to be thought guilty of those offences) and then I might well find myself liable to grievous penalties. Punishments could be visited upon me for a crime which I might inadvertently or unknowingly have committed. Indeed, as the Minister knows, it very nearly happened in my case. And if then, not knowing of this notice, I refuse to give my name to a police officer, or change my address without notification, I would come within the maw of the Minister. This whole clause imposes penalties which have been made very savage indeed. Remember that these over-severe sentences could be imposed upon somebody who had committed a minor crime, a very unimportant misdemeanour. I submit it is always dangerous to take away discretion from the Judiciary. The imposition of compulsory sentence, I think, is a very wrong principle. It should never be lightly done. The sentences here vary from one to ten years, and they should apply only to the most serious crimes, the crime of treason, wholesale murder, diabolical damage, or real sabotage caused by the use of explosives. In these cases where we take discretion away from the courts of law, this Parliament should always be as nearly as possible unanimous in its opinion. Even then it should be done only on a temporary basis. I believe that wherever we grant these vast ministerial powers, and wherever we take the discretion away from the Judiciary to temper justice with mercy, we should force the Government to come periodically to this Parliament for renewal of the laws. We should be able to reconsider whether changed circumstances have not altered the need to continue such severe sentences. We should force the Government to come back and renew the powers, which this side anyway, all too unwillingly gives it, to carry out their intentions. I feel that we should not leave savage and sadistic sentences on our Statute Book in perpetuity, and that is one of my main objections against this Bill. I am sure the hon. the Minister will admit that many of the old laws of England under which a man could be hanged for killing a sheep or firing a rick, would not have remained on the Statute Book if there had been some means whereby those sentences could be aligned with the new circumstances; in other words, if Parliament had been forced to <span class="col_6985-6986" refersTo="page_0739"/>renew them periodically. Parliament should be compelled to reconsider its verdict in the calmer light of later circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to ask this of the hon. the Minister: Did he consult the Judiciary at all before deciding on these compulsory sentences? Did he have any discussions say with the Chief Justice or with the Appellate Division in relation to the necessity of these serious penalties?</p>

We must remember, Sir, that teenagers, children, can be found guilty of these offences. We must remember, also, that the changed onus of proof often makes it difficult to prove innocence.

<p>Having expressed my regret for not being able to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes), I do not wish to express my regret to the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), for I believe that, judging from the language he used, he did not propose the amendment in an attempt to improve the Bill or to show his co-operation, but he merely moved the amendment to deliver himself of the words he in fact used. Therefore he will forgive me if I do not even give further consideration to the amendment he has proposed here. As regards the amendment of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories, having already said that I cannot now accept his amendment, I shall however consider later on, in view of the number of people covered, whether anything can be done in that connection&#x2014;as I have said, having regard to the volume of work that will be involved. If I can do so, I shall consider such amendment in the Other Place. I cannot make a firm promise, but I am prepared to consider that aspect of the matter having regard to the considerations I have mentioned.</p>

<p>As regards the amendments of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) there is one at least I can accept, and that is the one to the effect that people may be found in possession of the articles within six months instead of 30 days.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether his amendment is an agreed measure with the Bar Council. Because the Minister has indicated that as a result of the interviews which he has had he would introduce certain amendments to Clause 10. If this is an agreed amendment then I will not have so much objection to it. However, I wish to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this that the amendment which he has moved presupposes that the hon. the Minister will not debar an attorney or a barrister who is on the list from practising his profession. Because that is what the amendment indicates. It indicates that they shall not report or print anything except for the purposes of any proceedings in any court of law. So they can report that?</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point. The Minister permits these people to practise and that anything which they say in a court of law can be reported. I presume that that is the purport of his amendment. Now I want the hon. the Minister to go a little bit further. These people can also appear before a Liquor Licensing Court; they can also appear before the Group Areas Board. In other words, the Minister is agreeable to everything they say in a court of law being reported. I am not trying to be destructive, as the Minister will see. I think the Minister should say anything they say in their professional capacity can be reported, because they do not only appear in courts of law, they appear elsewhere as well. I think the hon. the Minister should consider that point and not only allow the Press to report what is said by them in a court of law but what they say elsewhere in their professional capacity. There are reporters who feel that because Mr. A is listed and they are entitled to report what he says in a court of law they are also entitled to report what he says in any other legal proceedings such as the Liquor Licensing Board and the Group Areas Board to which I have already referred. That was the only point in this regard which I wanted to make. I think the Minister should say anything which he says in his professional capacity, can be reported.</p>

<p>The Minister also knows that there are certain banned persons who are permitted by the Government nevertheless to serve on certain public bodies such as City Councils and Town Councils or Divisional Councils and other councils. It is intended that any speech made by that person in the City Council on which <span class="col_6987-6988" refersTo="page_0740"/>he is permitted to serve notwithstanding his banning, cannot be reported. I will tell the Minister why I am asking this because I have reason to believe that there are one or two people in that position who are anxious to know whether their speeches can be reported. Because it amounts to this that a man is allowed to serve on a public body but his constituents are not able to read what he says on their behalf in any debate. I do believe that the Minister will be the first to admit that members of Parliament, City Councillors and everybody else in a similar position, when they make a speech regarding matters affecting their constituency which they would like their constituents to know through the Press, should not be debarred from having their speeches reported in the Press thus keeping away from their constituents anything which they may in the interests of their constituents. I should like the Minister to let me know whether he will consider making an exception also in the case of those people I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Sir, I think the hon. the Minister has indicated to the Committee that he has not really given serious consideration to the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). I hope the Minister will desist from this attitude of his of personal animosity towards the hon. member for Wynberg and consider the amendment which he has moved. Because the amendment which the hon. member for Wynberg has moved to this clause will in effect give effect to what the hon. the Minister says is the intention of this clause. Surely the intention of paragraph (e) is to prevent persons from reproducing the speeches of communists for the purpose of disseminating or furthering the objects of Communism. I hope the Minister can unequivocally says &#x201C;Yes, of course that is the object of it&#x201D;. It must be; that is the only objective it can have. Therefore. Sir, if the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg is accepted the position will be that this clause will then be directly related to what the Minister says it is intended to be related to, namely to prevent anyone from disseminating or reproducing the speech of any banned person for the purpose of, or in circumstances calculated to further the aims and objects of Communism or of an unlawful organization. If the hon. the Minister does not accept this amendment then the Minister is putting the lie to what he said at the beginning. In other words, he is contradicting himself. Because this clause by itself, with the amendment which the hon. member for Wynberg has moved, will then be quite unobjectionable, because it will then prevent people from quoting from communists to further the aims of Communism. If the hon. the Minister would accept that amendment that part of the clause would become unobjectionable. As it stands now it means that no one will ever be able to fight Communism by quoting the communists. We in the United Party will not be able to fight the Progressive Party by quoting Luthuli.</p>

<p>It looks as though the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) supports this aspect of the clause because one can do the greatest amount of damage to the Progressive Party by quoting Luthuli. Surely the hon. the Minister appreciates this fact that you can fight the communists best by quoting them, especially in South Africa. I am reminded that one can fight the Nationalists best by quoting from them. I want to inform the hon. the Minister that although we are going to support one part of his amendment, namely that the minimum of three years becomes one year, that does not mean that we support a minimum sentence of one year. We would rather have a minimum of one year than a minimum of three years, quite true.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) moved an amendment and I am glad that the hon. the Minister is going to give that some thought. It is not a question of the Act being <i>Gazette</i>d. Sir, it is a question of a particular prohibition. The prohibition does not necessarily apply to everybody who is listed. It may apply only to a few as the hon. the Minister has said, only to those whom he thinks are active participants not to those who are no more active participants. There is no way for those people to know whether or not they are regarded by the hon. the Minister as being active participants. There is no way at all for them to know. That is why we believe that this amendment is necessary. Because disobedience of the clause carries with it a minimum penalty. One of the circumstances to which a court must have regard is the circumstances in which the crime was committed, i.e. the moral guilt of the accused. And one of those circumstances is whether or not he has, or ought to have had, knowledge of the offence which was committed. One must remember that every one of the offences which are listed here can be committed unknowingly. All the offences in sub-paragraph (a) can be committed unknowingly. And for a breach of one of the conditions contained in the prohibition there is to be a minimum penalty of one year. That is the enormity of it, Sir.</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to revert to the merits of the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). I am glad the Minister has told him what he did tell him. I do not think he deserves to be dealt with on merit. But because the hon. member for Durban North (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has urged that we should give the matter some thought, I should like to reply to him. The reason why these provisions are made under sub-section (g) <i>bis</i> of Clause 10&#x2014;that is the one to which the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg relates&#x2014;is very simple. When a communist is listed, or when he is prohibited from attending a gathering, it is intended that he should not make propaganda for the cause <span class="col_6989-6990" refersTo="page_0741"/>he himself as a communist wishes to further. When we place him under restraint, as in the case of Luthuli, that he should remain at a certain place and not hold meetings, he immediately gets a great forum thereby. When he opens his mouth there is an obliging Press to disseminate it inside and outside South Africa. It might have been a mistake to restrict him not to hold meetings and to be at only one place. Had we not done so, nobody would have known about Luthuli. But because we restricted Luthuli to a certain place he obtained a forum. But it was a good thing to confine him to one place, for he could not go from place to place to continue his work to the prejudice of the State. If now we were to amend this clause as the hon. member for Wynberg proposes, that you only prohibit the publication when it furthers Communism, if I understood him correctly, for he says that is all that can be prohibited&#x2014;then you will e.g. have an article such as that which Walter Sisulu had in the <i>New Age</i>. As we know, he was the Secretary of the A.N.C. He also is one of those who may not make these speeches. He is one of the people who describe the aims of the African National Congress as &#x201C;a liberation movement&#x201D;&#x2014;something we do not subscribe to, and which I am sure the hon. member for Durban (North) does not subscribe to, namely that the A.N.C. aims at being &#x201C;a liberation movement&#x201D;, as if those people are being oppressed. Now an interview is published which Mr. Carneson or Mr. Bunting probably had with him. The first question was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are trade unions essential in the workers&#x2019; fight for freedom? The very statement of &#x201C;the workers&#x2019; fight for freedom&#x201D; is something I do not endorse and it is something that furthers the aims of the A.N.C. Then comes the reply&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">It is the vital task of the Liberation movement in South Africa to see to it that the workers are organized into the trade union movement. This is not a matter to be left only in the hands of trade union officials. Apart from the economic plight of the oppressed people in the country, which can only be improved by organized labour, the struggle for liberation and against discrimination, largely depends on the organization of the workers into the trade union movement.</block>

<p>The object of this man is to abuse the trade unions to further the communistic tendencies and the unlawful objects of the A.N.C. So I could go through the whole interview. Under not one of the provisos of the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg will we be able to compel Walter Sisulu, or the New Age or any other newspaper for that matter, not to publish this.</p>

<p>But now take Luthuli. Even the hon. member for Houghton does not endorse the slogan of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. The hon. member for Durban (North) does not either, nor the</p>

<p>United Party. They propose a qualified franchise for their new race federation.</p>

<p>The hon. member is now going too far away from the clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Must I not go too far? Mr. Chairman, I put it this way, that when Luthuli makes propaganda for the A.N.C., he has a slogan that is not endorsed by a single person in this Parliament, and when we give him an opportunity to make a Press statement in the <i>New Age</i> or any other paper, we provide him with a forum which is much bigger than he would otherwise have had. When the Transkei undergoes a new reform, he is one of the great saboteurs of that plan, and he as against that, proposes a system that is not endorsed by anybody in this country who takes the development of the Bantu seriously. That you find in the <i>New Age</i> of 1 February. He has a lengthy statement in that regard. It is such a stinking statement that I do not even want to quote it; but he concludes by saying this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To my mind the only solution to the problems facing us, and anything less unacceptable &#x2026;</block>

<p>And what does he want? He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be on a basis of one man one vote.</block>

<p>I do not mind any person propagating any system, but then it must not be of such a nature that he wants to achieve his reforms outside Parliament, as Walter Sisulu as well as Luthuli wish to do, in spite of the so-called peacefulness he claims, and in spite of the fact that he is considered to be a person who is very peace-loving and who does not want violence. If we were to accept that draft of the hon. member for Wynberg, it will mean that this prohibition we now wish to introduce, will be absolutely useless. For every time you will have to prove that it furthers Communism. But that is not the only manner in which a person propagates his point of view. You can add all kinds of things to it that promote the principal object without mentioning the principal object. It causes an impossible burden of proof. That is why I am grateful the hon. the Minister rejects it. I am surprised that it has been seriously proposed&#x2014;that it has been proposed by that hon. member does not surprise me&#x2014;but it does surprise me that it is being supported by the hon. member for Durban (North).</p>

<p>I have difficulty in following the argument of the hon. member who has just sat down in relation to the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). I hope the hon. the Minister will reconsider his attitude to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg because it seems to me to be complying entirely with his own views and also with the <span class="col_6991-6992" refersTo="page_0742"/>views expressed by the hon. member for Stan-derton (Dr. Coertze). The clause as it stands is so wide virtually as to bring that provision into disrepute because it amounts to an absurdity. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg proposes to limit the amplitude of that clause but to make it sufficiently wide to catch people who publish the speeches for the purpose of furthering the aims of Communism or that of an unlawful organization. If the Minister is afraid that it may not be possible in a given set of circumstances to prove that particular object it goes further and brings within its ambit also in circumstances calculated to further the aims and objects of Communism or those of an unlawful organization. So even if the act is done in circumstances where the State cannot prove that particular purpose if, objectively regarded, it is likely to further the aims of Communism or the aims of an unlawful organization, it is still sufficiently wide for that publication to be caught within its net. The very examples which the hon. member for Standerton has quoted will be caught by the proposed amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg. They are good examples of how this amendment, which we seek to have adopted, could be put into effect and would be practically effective. It would be practically effective, Sir, to use this clause as amended to deal with the very examples which the hon. member for Standerton has quoted to us. Not only has it got that advantage but it has this additional advantage that it will get rid of the absurdity which exists at the present time whereby a perfectly innocent bookseller or publisher having in his possession and selling, quite unwittingly, speeches furthering the aims of Communism, can be caught in the net. And one must bear in mind that these are speeches made at any time and anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are dealing here with speeches made by these people anywhere and at any time. So a speech made 20 years ago could be the foundation of an offence under this clause as it stands. A bookseller, for example, could be put in an impossible situation if this clause were to be implemented literally. The hon. the Minister will no doubt get up and is any it is not his intention to embarrass people who sell books. I accept that, Sir, but then why have a piece of legislation which, at first sight, looks absurdly wide, although the Minister has no intention of implementing it in that manner, when by means of a very short amendment that absurdity can be done away with? The decision in this regard does not rest solely in the hands of the hon. the Minister. If any misguided or malicious person were to bring to the notice of the Public Prosecutor an offence perpetrated in terms of this clause he would be obliged to prosecute unless the Attorney General or the Minister himself stepped in. Now that Sir, is undesirable; it creates work, apart from anything else, if every one of these cases has to be scrutinized by a high official in his Department or by the Minister himself. These difficulties can be done away with if the Minister brings in an amendment such as moved by the hon. member for Wynberg. I would ask the hon. the Minister to consider this amendment on its merits and to exclude other consideration which may have influenced his attitude at an earlier stage.</p>

Instead of a total prohibition upon the propaganda of these persons, as the clause seeks to do, I have to judge in every case, from day to day, whether those persons are observing the prohibition or not; and in that way a forum will be created for those people every day, because I have to cross swords with them every day to see whether they are contravening this clause or not. That is exactly what those people want. It is the very thing they want for then they continually remain under the limelight and they receive publicity; they are constantly involved in a dispute with the authorities as a result of the amendment of the member for Wynberg; which I would then have accepted.

<p>It is quite clear from what he has said that personal antagonism and animosity has ruled the hon. the Minister to a great extent in rejecting my amendment. He <span class="col_6993-6994" refersTo="page_0743"/>has said so quite plainly. No matter how strongly he feels against me as a person, he, as a Minister who has been entrusted with vast powers by this Parliament, (against my will, I admit) should restrain himself from exercising personal judgment as capriciously as he has done. For the Minister to isay that an amendment, which has been put forward by an opposition member, will not be accepted because he does not like the face of the person who has introduced it, or because that member has said certain harsh things while introducing it (things that have wounded his vanity), prove to me, and to the House, and to the country that this Minister should not be trusted with these vast delegated powers. I ask the Minister not to think of personalities. However strongly he may feel about me, he should examine this amendment on its merits. The case of a bookseller selling novels has been mentioned. There are various booksellers in this ceountry who do not only deal in novels but sell all kinds of overseas periodicals which stream into this country every week. Must these booksellers and agents peruse them to see whether in some obscure corner of a periodical or a newspaper there is not some statement from someone who has fallen foul of this Minister&#x2019;s opinions? Must they scrutinize all publications to find if any quotation in any article comes from a source that is doubtful, from a person who has been named or banned or who belongs to a subversive organization in South Africa? How will they set about doing it unless the Minister agrees to insert some amendment like this into the clause to guard them? I object to the use of the term &#x201C;in the Minister&#x2019;s opinion&#x201D;, but the Minister knows that he could, if necessary insert &#x201C;which in the Minister&#x2019;s opinion would have the purpose of furthering the aims and objects of Communism or of an unlawful organization&#x201D;. The Minister may complain about his administrative difficulties, but he has to think of the administrative difficulties of thousands of firms in this country, who have to try to keep within the law, but who may innocently fall foul of it because they have no opportunity for checking up what appears in the publications they sell. I say he has every right to reject my amendment on merit, but if he rejects it for personal reasons, he lays himself open to the charge made by the hon. member for Zululand, namely, is he really setting out in this Bill only to combat Communism? Or is he trying to throttle everyone who opposes this Government? His powers are vast, and he indicates that he is not fit to use those powers in an unbiassed way. Here he rejects an amendment just because the hon. member for Wynberg, with whom he quarrels privately and publicly, introduces it. [Interjection.] I hear the Minister of Information interjecting once again. He claims to be an English-speaking representative in the Cabinet. He does not represent us. He represents Nationalists.

On 20 March 1945, the hon. member referred to the judicial and quasi-judicial powers of Ministers and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where, however, this Parliament goes further and grants to one person, to one Minister, and to one head of a Department in addition judicial or quasi-judicial powers, there we have three functions combined in one man.</block>

<p>What I am trying to point out is that although the hon. member is trying to make out that this terrible Minister is now taking powers unto himself, and that this Nazi Government has these powers, he said the same to General Smuts. The hon. member even seconded an amendment moved by Mr. Molteno in regard to judicial powers, and what did General Smuts say about these terrible powers? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I see there is an amendment on the Order <span class="col_6995-6996" refersTo="page_0744"/>Paper by the hon. member for Cape Western (Mr. Molteno) &#x2026;</block>

<p>Which incidentally was seconded by that hon. member for Wynberg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member also wishes to refer to this Select Committee the question of judicial and <i>quari</i>-judicial authority which is given to the Government to be exercised by regulation. I think that that, if I may say so, is a dangerous step to take. Under the cover of some such provision, the responsibility of government may be seriously undermined.</block></speech>

<p>The clause means that the Minister&#x2019;s consent must be obtained for the reproduction of these records, and the hon. member in his amendment wants to circumscribe the Minister in certain directions. He wants to limit the powers of the Minister to make it impossible for the Minister to act under this clause. We know the game, and we know that hon. member.</p>

<p>I do not intend following the Minister of Information. We are really talking about a penal provision here and he is arguing the interesting question of delegated powers. I do not think that is before the House at the moment. I would like the Minister to think carefully of the implications of this clause if he does not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg. I think the Minister is making a fundamental mistake in think that all communists are just political creatures, and that all they do is to propagate Communism and the overthrow of the Government. The Minister knows very well that there are many highly intelligent people amongst the communists. That always amazes me, just as it amazes me to see intelligent people amongst the members of the Government. But the fact is that man is not only a political creature. Many of these communists are also outstanding scientists and lecturers at universities. The Minister is not distinguishing between the political utterances of these people which have the object of propagating Communism, and those utterances of theirs in their other capacities, as scientists, etc. People will be guilty if they quote eminent scientists who happen to be listed communists. Just think of the tremendous burden which will be placed on newspaper editors, whenever they get any article, even if it has nothing to do with politics, because they will have to check and make sure that even if it was a scientific article it was not written by a communist. I do not know whether that is the Minister&#x2019;s intention, but if it is, he is coming very near to saying that there is apartheid between mathematics and communist mathematics. Surely the whole purpose of this amendment is to prohibit only those utterances of a communist that he makes in his political capacity. In any event, the Minister will apparently not accept even this moderate amendment. I understand from the Minister and the hon. member for Standerton that they say it is so difficult to decide whether a particular writing is for the purposes of advancing Communism. That surprises me, because the Minister has again and again assured us that the whole purpose of this Bill is to deal with Communism and sabotage. Surely if that is so, it is easy for him to decide whether a particular writing furthers Communism. In any event, what is the point of putting a complete blanket on utterances and writings of all listed communists, even outside the sphere of politics, unless the Minister comes later with further amending legislation. The writings of a man like Mr. Khrushchev would be able to be quoted freely here because he is not listed, yet Luthuli is prohibited. Even non-political writings of Luthuli will not be able to be published. The result is that the non-political writings of communists here cannot be published, but the political writings of overseas communists could be freely published here. I think the Minister should reconsider the matter, when he will realize the absurdities this will lead to. He will have to come back sooner or later with amending legislation. In view of the fact that the Minister has said repeatedly that there is no need to fear that this Bill will injure anyone except a communist, I cannot understand why he and the hon. member for Standerton are now so afraid to decide when a person is aiming at furthering Communism, because surely if the Minister has no fear that this legislation will touch the innocent, he should not find it so difficult to identify the guilty. His argument is that a heavy administrative burden will be thrown on his shoulders every time to decide whether a writing is reproduced for the purpose of furthering Communism, but as against that he must realize that if this amendment is not accepted, a far greater burden will be thrown on the shoulders of every editor and publisher and distributor of publications. The Minister must surely weigh up the convenience of the public against his own private convenience.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) probably fits in very well with the scheme of the Opposition, so that they may now contend that they proposed that only publications that aim at promoting Communism <span class="col_6997-6998" refersTo="page_0745"/>should be prohibited, and that the Government was not prepared to accept such an amendment. The suggestion has been made several times that the Minister will abuse his powers and that he will also curb the activities of people who are not communists. That is why this amendment suits the book of the Opposition. But what they conveniently lose sight of is that we are not dealing only with Communism as a doctrine, as the doctrine of Marx, but also as a method, and then that is something for which many other organizations and individuals can be used to further Communism. In addition to the examples that have been quoted here to illustrate how absurd&#x2014;to use that word also&#x2014;the provisions of that clause would be, I should like to mention to the hon. member who has just spoken another example, that of Mandela, who is a listed communist and who was charged in the high treason trial, and who was one of the people who last year organized the All-in African Conference in Maritzburg, which was praised by the hon. member for Wynberg in such glowing terms, Mandela, who then issued a statement through the medium of the Press to call a strike for 31 May and thereafter, while the police were looking for him, and who almost daily had a statement in the <i>Daily Mail</i> which he is alleged to have given to the newspaper from a public telephone. I just want to read it, from the statement Mandela originally issued on 13 May 1961 and which appeared in the <i>Caps Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Nelson Mandela &#x2026; issued a statement here yesterday saying that the anti-Republican demonstration at the end of the month would be non-racial and non-violent. His statement said that his council had fixed 29, 30 and 31 May as the dates for demonstrations, &#x201C;to mark our rejection of a Republic imposed by a minority Government&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Now I ask the hon. member, if he were to construe this statement, would he say it is a statement intended to further Communism?</p>

<block name="quote">People in the cities and in the countryside are called on to stay away from work. Businessmen were asked to close their businesses, schoolchildren and students to stay away from classes and not to take part in any republic celebration or accept commemoration medals. &#x201C;These demonstrations are non-racial and non-violent and all sections of the population&#x2014;Coloureds, Indians and Europeans&#x2014;are cordially invited to take part.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This <i>invitation</i> by Mandela was published in the <i>Cape Times</i> and what is more, it was issued under the name of Sapa. Sapa spread Mandela&#x2019;s invitation to a strike, and this newspaper published it and I challenge the hon. member for Jeppes to tell me whether he would regard the publishing of that invitation as a promotion of Communism in terms of the amendment that has been proposed by the hon. member for Wynberg? We all know that the conference convened at Maritzburg by Mandela &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member cannot get out of it so easily. It was he who said it was easy to determine that. Now I am asking him, as a lawyer, whether he will say that it is a communistic statement? That is the point. Everybody knows that that All-in African Conference that was convened was inspired and organized by the communists. Their plan was to ask the Government to convene a national multi-racial convention, which the Government would refuse, and then they would organize a strike to compel the Government to convene a convention. The plan was devised in the classic communist pattern. The hon. member for Wynberg lauded it. He said it was a peaceful request, and why did the Government not consent? Now I say that when something is so closely related to a communistic agitation, it is not necessary to go and determine from the person who published it, whether he had communistic intentions. It is senseless to go and look for it there. You have to look for it in the person who wants to further Communism by making use of the means of publication. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg proposed his amendment for the very reason that has just been mentioned by the hon. member for Innesdale, namely that the Minister in this clause is tying the hands of persons who are opposed to Communism. I want to appeal to the Minister earnestly because I am convinced that if the clause as it stands goes on the Statute Book, it will not serve the purpose the Minister has in mind, but the exact opposite purpose. I am sure the Minister will agree that the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg certainly does not have the meaning given to it by the hon. member for Innesdale. The statement of Mandela, which the hon. member quoted, quite clearly could be used by me, not to further the aims of Communism, but for the opposite purpose of opposing it. The hon. member said that Mandela had said that now is the time to strike. Obviously if one criticizes that, one does not do it for the purpose set out in this amendment. I am sure the Minister realizes this after this discussion, and I appeal to him to consider carefully during the recess the meaning of this clause, because it is clear that as it stands, this provision is unsound, because it provides that without the consent of the Minister such statements cannot be reproduced or recorded.</p>

<p>Those statements of those persons can be used in two ways. They can be used for the purpose of furthering their aims. On many <span class="col_6999-7000" refersTo="page_0746"/>occasions they are the most effective quotations you can make in order to contest the very things those people stand for. The statements of Luthuli were mentioned, which were used in the election against the Progressive Party. I am sure the Minister realizes that if this clause goes through it will have a tremendous effect in preventing the use of material which can be used for the purpose of combating Communism, in the sense that that term is used in this country.</p>

<p>If the Minister does not feel that the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg is a suitable one, I ask him to consider amending this clause in some form, so that he does not prohibit persons from having the right to make use of statements of communists for the purpose of combating Communism. The effect of the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is quite clear. It is to prevent the spread of communist propaganda. In most circumstances I would not object to that, but I do object when in effect it limits freedom of speech in respect of using these statements to preserve the democratic system. I hope that the Minister will give further consideration to this clause, because I am sure that on further consideration he must come to the conclusion that the clause needs amendment. I am not interested in the form of the amendment. I personally believe that the form of the hon. member for Wynberg&#x2019;s amendment is suitable, but if the Minister objects to the form of that amendment, I hope he can find some other way of amending it to deal with the objections we have raised.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>For the second time now the United Party has used as an example the use of Luthuli&#x2019;s speech against the Progressive Party. I must say I had hoped when I heard the hon. member for Wynberg moving his amendment, that he and the party he represents were concerned with preserving the freedom of speech. It now appears from the speech just made by the hon. member for Germiston (District), and the one made earlier by the hon. member for Durban (North), that the main concern of the United Party in trying to get this clause amended is to enable them to go around the country attacking the Progressive Party, and I must say I am thoroughly shocked at this. If the hon. members are fighting for freedom of speech, I think they should stick to general principles and not make laughing stocks of themselves in the eyes of the public by giving such absurd examples.</p>

<p>I want to make one other point, and that is that in this clause the penalty is provided for people guilty of an offence under Sec. 11, which has to be read with Sec. 3 (1) (a) of the Suppression of Communism Act. I want to ask the Minister whether this is another reason for introducing this change, because the minute he loses a case in court he comes to this House to amend the law. Last year a person called Calata was found quilty of an offence under that section because he had a photograph of himself amongst A.N.C. officials hanging on the wall of his house, and under Section 3 no person is allowed to carry or display anything whatsoever indicating that he is or was at any time an office-bearer of any unlawful organization. When that case came to court he was found guilty and given a suspended sentence, but it was an absurd case, anyway, because it was years since this man had anything to do with the A.N.C., judging by the reports of the case. The evidence was that he had had nothing to do with the A.N.C. since the time it was initially established, when it was not a banned organization and when many persons belonged to it without any political slur being cast on them. But after the passing of this Bill there will be a compulsory sentence of one year&#x2019;s imprisonment for this offence, and I bring this to the Minister&#x2019;s notice to show to what absurd lengths he is going.</p>

<p>Then there is another question I want to ask the Minister. Has this amendment he is introducing now anything to do with the recent judgment of Mr. Justice Trollip in the Supreme Court in Pretoria in the case of the 12 persons who were charged under the Suppression of Communism Act?</p>

I submit that the mere fact that the Minister is going to consider how many people are involved, is proof of the justification of my amendment that people who are involved should be warned of the consequences of this Bill. The Minister also said that he did not intend to get at all the people on the list but that he wanted to get at the active communists and the people who are really constituting a threat to the security of the State. I am convinced that the Minister must have the names and the addresses of all the people who are a threat to the security of the State.

<p>I do not want the hon. member for Transkeian Territories to be under any illusions. I am very definitely unable to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg. I am definitely unable to accept it for the simple reason that I have already mentioned repeatedly to the Committee, namely that the whole object of this clause is that if a gathering restriction is imposed on a person, whether by my predecessors or myself, then the whole object of that gathering restriction is that the utterances of that person are regarded as dangerous to the State. For that reason, and that reason alone, a gathering restriction is imposed upon a person. While that is so, if we are sincere in our attitude that the person&#x2019;s utterances are dangerous to the State, surely it will be foolish of us to create other forums for him where those same utterances that he may not make in person, may be made via a third person. That is the whole effect of this clause. If I were to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg, it means that every time that person makes an utterance, I have to join issue with him as to whether it complies with the requirements set by the hon. member for Wynberg or not. That will be exactly what those persons want, for then they would have a better forum than they have ever had before. That is and that remains my point of view. I have considered it very carefully; during the dinner adjournment again, but if I wish to give effect to the object of this clause, I cannot <span class="col_7003-7004" refersTo="page_0748"/>accept that amendment under any circumstances.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have given notice of an amendment to this clause as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;concerned&#x201D; in line 21, to the end of the clause.</block>

<p>I do not think it necessary for me at this stage of the proceedings to explain in any great detail what the meaning is of this amendment because we have had a similar argument on other clauses of the Bill already, namely about the publication in the<i>Gazette</i> only of Ministerial edicts to persons who have been convicted of certain offences, and of the inadequacy of that procedure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member refers to the original section, she will see why it was necessary to include these words, the deletion of which she proposes, in the Bill. Originally no such publication took place, and in sub-section (3) of Section 12 it was provided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall be convicted of an offence under paragraph (g) of Section 11 if he satisfies the court that he had no knowledge of the prohibition of the gathering concerned.</block>

<p>The onus was on him, therefore, to prove that he was not aware of it. Now, however, he cannot raise that defence because it will now be published in the <i>Gazette</i>. The hon. member is aware that all publications in the <i>Gazette</i> are deemed to be the requisite notice to the public and all interested parties. However, if it is not published, there can be no contravention now, whereas formerly there was a contravention unless he could prove that he was not aware of the prohibition.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>There is a great difference between publication of an Act in the <i>Gazette</i> and the publication of a notice to which the hon. the Minister is referring.</p>

<p>On Clause 13,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As I read this clause as it is printed, it means that whereas the Minister may not now restrict a person&#x2019;s movements under the Act until he has considered a factual report upon such person by a committee headed by a senior magistrate, he will in future be exempted from this requirement. This safeguard is therefore now withdrawn and that despite the greatly increased powers which the Minister is taking unto himself under this Bill. I do not believe that that is right. The least the Minister could do is to consider a factual report before he restricts the movements of anybody under this Bill, particularly so because he has greatly increased powers now. I therefore want this clause to be negatived.</p>

<p>As I read this clause, it appears to me that the exemption only applies in respect of the category under paragraph (e) of sub-section (2), i.e. in respect of an organization which carries on, or has been established for the purpose of carrying on, directly or indirectly, any of the activities of the organization referred to. It is in respect of organizations of this type that the Minister need not in terms of this amendment have an inquiry.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I understand the hon. Minister to mean that as the organization&#x2014;of which the organization in question is only a pale copy&#x2014;has already been investigated by an impartial tribunal, a further investigation need not be held. But, Sir, that is no answer, because although <i>prima facie</i> and on the facts available to the Minister, it may appear that the organization which it is sought to ban in terms of sub-section (2), is carrying on the activities formerly carried on by an unlawful organization, upon proper investigation by the magistrate and his two independent assistants, it might well be found that the organization which at first sight might appear objectionable, is not in fact so. There might only be an apparent similarity. In view of this danger, there ought to be a full investigation of the nature which there was before. I fail to see that the arguments which will be advanced by the Minister will have any validity. As one who has practised in the courts, he will know that often after hearing the one side of a case, one has the impression that it is a pretty good and cast-iron case, but when one has heard the other side, one sees a completely different picture and the situation gets quite a different complexion. The hon. the Minister will know that that is particularly so in the case of criminal trials. The Attorney-General is indicting a person because the Attorney-General has, <i>prima facie</i>, come to a certain point of view but after there has been an impartial investigation by the court, an entirely different picture emerges, and the accused is discharged in many cases. This analogy can also be used here. It seems to me that an impartial investigation, such as that referred to in Section 17 of the principal Act, can only have advantages in such a case as I am referring to. And I do not think such an investigation need delay a decision for a couple of months. If properly conducted, it will not go on and on for a lengthy period of time. On the contrary, it will entail only a very slight delay and the effects of such a delay will be outweighed by the advantages to be obtained therefrom in that the Minister can then make sure of the facts upon which he bases his decision in respect of the organization in question. He will, in any event, not do the banning merely on the strength of a <i>prima facie</i> view, but on the strength of the facts found to exist by an impartial body.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I have devoted a lot of attention to this particular clause. I have also given much attention to a proposal that emanated from the Bar Council, namely that a factual report should be obtained after the act&#x2014;in other words, that an organization should first be banned, and that after wards a factual report should be called for. The principle underlying this clause has already been argued before, and so it is not necessary for me to do so again. However, I should like to point out to hon. members that if you want to ban the second organization by way of a factual report while you are satisfied that this organization is exactly the same one, namely with the same officials, office, membership etc., you must first permit the new organization to function for a few months. If not, what is the good of asking for a factual report? That is point number one, namely that such an organization has to be permitted to function for a few months. If you have to call for a <span class="col_7013-7014" refersTo="page_0753"/>factual report thereafter, it means four, five or six months more before you can take a decision on this organization, and that while it is a harmful organization that should have been banned in the first place. How much harm could such an organization not do in the meantime, and that without you being able to move a finger to prevent it.</p>

<p>However, there is a second reason why it is not practicable to call for a factual report. Let us for the sake of argument assume that the A.N.C. is banned. Now this organization pops up again tomorrow with the same officials, the same leaders and the same membership, but under the name of another organization. If action were not taken against it now &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yet it happened in Rhodesia where the Rhodesian People&#x2019;s Party was banned on one day and the next day it popped up again with the same leaders but as the Zimbabwe People&#x2019;s Party. So we have an example of what may happen. The same thing could happen here. But now you will find that the new organization, in spite of it&#x2019;s being the same organization with the same leaders, at first behaves itself very well because it is biding its time to act against you. And when it acts, you are in graver trouble than you were in before. We do have knowledge of the acts of these people, and so it will not only be foolish to permit a banned organization to continue under a different name, but it will be criminal negligence as against the country to whom you owe a duty. The moment you accept that it is a dangerous organization, at that moment you have to act, irrespective of the name under which such an organization appears.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The kindest comment I can make about this clause, is that it is an innovation in legal drafting. This presents a <span class="col_7015-7016" refersTo="page_0754"/>new method of legislating with retrospective effect, because in terms of this clause any proclamation notice, prohibition or list which has been compiled or issued since 1950, is now deemed to have been compiled or issued under the 1950 Act, as amended by this Bill. The effect of this is that Parliament is being asked not only to legislate backwards, but also to legislate blindly. I say this because no one in this House has any information or is aware of any proclamation, notice, prohibition or list of the type we are dealing with here. In legislation of this kind, one could have expected that there would have been some sort of schedule attached in which the proclamations, notices, etc., which we are now validating with retrospective effect, are set out. There should, at least, be some indication from the hon. the Minister, but preferably in the form of a schedule to the Bill, of the type of notice, the type of prohibition, etc., which Parliament is being asked to validate by a process of retrospective legislation. But no such indication is given. Therefore the House is being asked to legislate blindly, and the only realistic way in which we can deal with this matter, is to vote against the clause.</p>

<p>I am afraid I cannot follow the hon. member at all. All this clause contemplates is to provide that all the restrictions that have been imposed upon persons in terms of the Act of 1950, shall remain in force to-day&#x2014;in other words, the restrictions concerned will not lapse when this Bill is passed. That is all this clause is dealing with, and if the hon. member contends that he does not know what it deals with, I should like to remind him that all the steps taken against persons under the Act of 1950, have been Tabled in the House in terms of that Act. That has been done over the past 12 years. If the hon. member now comes along and contends that we are now drafting legislation blindly and backwards, I do not know what he is talking about.</p>

<p>This is the clause which, as it stands, gives the hon. the Minister the most extraordinary powers ever possessed by any Minister in any Western democratic country. The effect of this clause is that if an emergency is declared in one magisterial district, say of Pondoland, the Minister can apply those emergency regulations to every magisterial district throughout the Republic and that without there being any foundation for the existence of such regulations. He could, therefore, by extending the emergency regulations to the whole Republic, regulate that no one shall have access to the courts, that the Police can arrest anyone they like at whatever time they like, etc. I agree that the Government should have powers at a time or emergency. That is obvious. As a matter of fact, it is for this reason that we, on this side of the House, supported the Public Safety Act of 1953 because we considered that if a state of emergency arises, the situation had to be put right and put right quickly. But the position under this clause is that emergency regulations issued in respect of one magisterial district can be made to apply all over the Republic without there being any justification for it.</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end of the proposed paragraph (b): &#x201C;in so far as may be necessary to deal with the emergency so proclaimed&#x201D;</block>

<p>I move this for two reasons: In the first place, we appreciate that there are circumstances outside the area in which there is a state of emergency which have to dealt with with a view to the emergency where it exists being properly controlled. The Minister, when introducing this Bill at the second reading, indicated that he did not want to declare a state of emergency in all the adjacent areas if it could at all be avoided and we appreciate the difficulties which he might have to face up to in this connection, and to meet such difficulties this amendment is proposed. It will enable him to extend the relevant emergency regulations only so far as it may be necessary to cope with the state of emergency where it has been declared. These powers are not to be exercised except in such circumstances. If it is the intention of the hon. the Minister to exercise these powers only under the circumstances which I have outlined, then he ought to accept this amendment and if he does accept it, our objections to the clause will fall away.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is obvious that nobody is keen to have a state of emergency. Nor is it a matter the Government can just proclaim. It arises as a result of the activities of certain persons or organizations. Now I have told hon. members at the second reading, that instead of this being an aggravation of the position, it is an improvement having regard to what we learned <span class="col_7017-7018" refersTo="page_0755"/>during the last emergency. I put it very clearly that last time we had the position that there was a state of emergency here in the Cape Town and Wynberg magisterial districts. It proved to be necessary as a result of the actions of the agitators, that one had to go to the extent of proclaiming Somerset West, Stellenbosch, Malmesbury and even Worcester, emergency areas, where all the emergency regulations applied. You had to do it willy nilly, in spite of the fact that in those areas there actually was no emergency, and only some regulations were required there. All this amendment to the principal Act provides in this Bill is that when you have a state of emergency you may make some of the regulations that are applicable in that area, applicable to another area. If the hon. member now had proposed an amendment reading &#x201C;in so far as he deems it necessary to act in respect of the state of emergency&#x201D; or &#x201C;in so far as he may deem it to be necessary in order to deal with the state of emergency&#x201D;, it would have been quite different, and I could have accepted it. But that is not the effect of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. It now introduces an objective test, and an objective test is the last thing you want in a state of emergency, for then the Minister has to act from hour to hour and from day to day and the moment I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, any person&#x2014;and those persons will be numerous&#x2014;could go and have decisions taken in a state of emergency tested in lengthy court proceedings. That is what the effect of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment would be. Under normal circumstances one would have no objection to it, but if you want to handle a state of emergency, in view of the repercussions it will have not only internally but also externally, you are obliged to end the state of emergency as soon as possible, and then you cannot set in motion the impeding processes contemplated by the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. For that reason I regret I cannot accept it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s reply is most revealing. He stated that the last thing he wants in an emergency is to have applied to his actions an objective test. That amounts to this, that if during an emergency he were to invoke certain extraordinary provisions because of a given factual situation and he were to be basing his actions on a correct analysis and on facts which really existed, he would be perfectly safe in any court of law. No court of law would criticize what he did if he invokes those extraordinary powers by virtue of facts which warrant them. But if he were to assess the situation incorrectly, or if he were to invoke these extraordinary powers which were far in excess of what was required to meet the situation, only then would a court of law be able to intervene and set aside what he has done. Now, for a Minister to object to that situation arising presents a very odd picture indeed. The Minister can only object to that situation if he believes a situation will arise where he will have to evoke extraordinary powers which he does not need to meet the situation. The Minister knows as well as I do that in circumstances such as that a court of law would look at his actions in a benevolent light because he is the Minister charged with the preservation of public safety and he has to take action, and the courts would not be astute to set aside any action or the invoking of any powers unless quite clearly on the facts before the court the Minister had used powers which he did not require. In those circumstances, what possible objection can the Minister have to there being an objective test such as the one formulated in this amendment? I wish to emphasize that a court of law in those circumstances would not be astute to set aside anything that the Minister may have done. It would only be where there was a gross abuse of power that the court would intervene. Furthermore, contrary to what the Minister said, any such court proceedings would not take place there and then. It requires time for these facts to be investigated and for affidavits to be filed, and no doubt the court hearing would take place after the emergency is past. Faced with those facts, I cannot understand the Minister&#x2019;s attitude and I hope he will reconsider the position and will give better reasons for rejecting this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<p>The argument of the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) boils down to this, that if the Minister has a good case, he need not be afraid to go to court. The hon. member and other hon. members opposite just cannot understand that it is a difficult task to govern a state, and that it sometimes is necessary that some bones have to be broken, or at least some window panes. When there is a state of emergency, the first task of the Government is to see to it that peace and order is restored. Nobody objects to that. Now what is the position? Supposing the Minister were to proclaim a state of emergency in the Cape, and issue certain regulations that are made applicable to Stellenbosch and Paarl where there is no state of emergency, and supposing he were to apply those regulations to people who flee from Cape Town to those places, and supposing he were to arrest them there under the regulations, what is the position? Firstly, the Minister will contend that he is detaining these people in the interests of security. The person detained will say that these regulations (if we were to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment) are not necessary, for it is not necessary in so far as it has to combat a state of emergency. Then they obtain an interdict against the Minister. The matter cannot be heard forthwith. The interdict will be in terms that the Minister should not carry on with the measures he has taken in Stellenbosch, or otherwise it will contain a <i>habeas corpus</i> order to liberate such a person, pending the decision in legal proceedings that still have to be instituted. In the meantime the saboteur carries on and may do so much evil in the place where he is that the Minister is obliged to proclaim a state of <span class="col_7019-7020" refersTo="page_0756"/>emergency in that place also. The evil spirit the hon. member for Durban (North) wishes to exercise cannot be exercised in the manner he proposed, for it does not cover both of the two cases where a person is wilful. It may be that the Minister is quite within his powers, but because it has not yet been decided that the Minister is <i>intra vires</i>, the Minister has to discontinue his measures at Stellenbosch. But subsequently it is held that what the Minister has done has been quite in order, and in the meantime that person has still had the opportunity to stir up evil. So the hon. member for Zululand is viewing the matter from one angle only and not from the other angle. What is more, the Minister has already considered the difficulties hon. members have, and they must not think the Minister has not considered them. It is provided in the clause that the Minister, subject to amendments made in the proclamation or in a subsequent proclamation by the State President in the <i>Government Gazette</i>, may do only certain things. In other words, it is not the whole emergency regulation that is applied there, but only so much as the Minister deems necessary. What objection can hon. members have that the Minister should decide how much is required? It is the Minister&#x2019;s duty to preserve the peace, and he is the first to be blamed if he does not carry out his duty. The hon. member for Durban (North) will sing the highest note in that complaint that the Minister has failed in his duty. [Interjections.] The hon. member foresees a possibility, namely that the Minister will abuse his powers. He will just have to accept that; he must take the risk. The Minister will act according to his sense of responsibility. When somebody is obliged to combat a state of emergency, he has to take steps, even if he were to take illegal steps, as has already happened under General Smuts. He introduced the most Indemnity Acts in this Parliament, and why? Because he accepted his responsibilities and did his duty as he saw it. Now we say that if there is a state of emergency, we also wish to apply the regulations to a contiguous district, to prevent a state of emergency from arising there also. We are taking only such powers as we require. But do you know what is going on here, Sir? They over there have an idea that when the Minister is given a discretion, he acts &#x201C;capriciously&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton has tried to support the Minister, but I do not think he has strengthened the Minister&#x2019;s case. I propose dealing with this matter on the rather simple basis which was put by the Minister himself. If one wants to get down to the merits, one can deal with the matter on the basis of what the Minister himself said. It is quite clear that under Section 3 of the Public Safety Act it is possible for the Governor-General to declare a state of emergency and publish emergency regulations affecting the area in which there is an emergency. The Minister now seeks to extend that also to areas outside of such an area. The Minister will be the first to agree that that will permit him to apply the regulations in the area in which the emergency is or throughout the Union. But the Minister quite rightly wishes to limit the emergency and therefore he takes a second power to apply any of these regulations partly outside the said area. The amendment seeks to add to that, that that will apply only in so far as may be necessary to deal with the emergency so proclaimed, and I submit that that is a reasonable limitation.</p>

<p>No, it is our duty to limit these powers to the minimum. The powers the Minister proposes to take in fact put him in the position that he could apply the consequences of the declaration of an emergency throughout the district in which the emergency is, or the province or beyond without declaring an emergency in any other district. If that is necessary because there is an emergency everywhere it should be declared throughout. If this is not necessary, the courts would not uphold the extension of the powers beyond the area of emergency. I hope the Minister will accept that that is the furthest that any Opposition should be prepared to go in extending extraordinary powers of this sort.</p>

<p>We have at least reached the stage now that the hon. member has conceded that what we propose <span class="col_7021-7022" refersTo="page_0757"/>to do with this clause is less than would have been done originally in a state of emergency, if this clause were not accepted. If that is so, I shall be grateful if the hon. member will explain to me why they are not prepared to accept the wording I suggested, namely &#x201C;in so far as he may deem it necessary in order to deal with the state of emergency&#x201D; for I put it to them as a test. I wonder why hon. members insist upon the words of their amendment, while they are conceding that they indeed want court cases to be evoked by their amendment, and hon. members will concede that it is the last thing you want. All of us have knowledge of states of emergency, and it is the last thing you want, to be saddled with prolonged court proceedings; while it is your duty to terminate the state of emergency as soon as possible. But just to show hon. members to what extent they are mistaken, I refer to the case of Krone v. Minister of Defence in 1915 and the case of Du Toit and Trumpel man v. Minister of Justice in 1940. In both cases the court said that there are times when the court simply has to take a back-seat, and the applications of Krone and Du Toit and Trumpel man were dismissed by the court, not on the ground of any regulations, but on grounds of the inherent duty of the court to dismiss such applications, for it was said that the security of the State is worth far more than the right of the individual under those circumstances. And the court adopted the correct attitude; and if the court did so of its own motion, without being required by regulation to adopt that attitude, I cannot appreciate why hon. members now wish to go further than those court decisions to bind the Minister for the very purpose of involving him in court proceedings while a state of emergency exists.</p>

<p>I think it would be quite simple if the Minister is acting reasonably and in accordance with the facts. Then the regulations would be upheld. If, on the other hand, the Minister&#x2019;s suggested wording is adopted, then whatever unreasonable action may be taken by any Minister, the extension of the regulations would stand valid even if in fact they were not necessary.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister wants to know why we do not accept the alternative he suggests. In fact, it does not limit the Minister&#x2019;s powers, even though it looks as if it does, because if the Minister decided that he would promulgate for the rest of the Republic a state of emergency, outside that one small district in which there was a state of emergency, all the emergency regulations which were used on the last occasion, would apply; there would be no limitation on the Minister&#x2019;s powers to do so. The reason for that is that if the Minister does proclaim these regulations elsewhere, he has deemed it to be necessary, or else he would not do it. So all he has to do when he does proclaim it is to say that he considers it necessary, and if it is not necessary in fact there is nothing anyone can do about it. That is the point. [Interjections.] Sir, I do not think hon. members opposite appreciate what this clause means. It means that the Minister can, if he wishes, rule South Africa absolutely and completely by decree. Do hon. members opposite not appreciate that? I think that even if they appreciated it they would not really care.</p>

<p>All we are trying to do is to get some limitation of that power. We are trying to put in language in this Bill what really is the intention of the Minister, and that is that the Minister does not want to apply the regulations in any area where there is no state of emergency, except for the purpose of dealing with the state of emergency which does not apply somewhere. That is what we are trying to do. All that the hon. member for Standerton can say is that the Minister must be entrusted with these powers. That is no way in which to legislate. How can any Parliament be expected to give to the Executive the power to do anything that Parliament can do, in fact, to give to the Minister more than Parliament would dare to do? That is what this clause does, and hon. members opposite are quite happy about it.</p>

<p>If the Minister wishes to have this clause so phrased that it reflects what he means, he should let it stand over until to-morrow, so that we can get language which coincides with his intentions. If he does not want to do that, I think we are entitled to believe that he wants all the powers that this Parliament has, just in case he needs them.</p>
