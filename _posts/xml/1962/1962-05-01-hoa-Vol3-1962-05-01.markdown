<question by="#malan" to="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<num>*I.</num>

<from>Mr. E. G. MALAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Bantu Education:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) What is&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) the nature and</li>

<li>(b) the annual amount of the indirect subsidy which, according to information furnished by the Minister of Information on 17 April 1962 the monthly publication <i>Bona</i> receives from his Department;</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) whether his Department purchases any copies of this periodical to be distributed free of charge or otherwise; if so,

<ol>

<li>(a) how many copies of each edition,</li>

<li>(b) in what languages,</li>

<li>(c) to what groups are they distributed and</li>

<li>(d) under what sub-head of Vote No. 30 or the Bantu Education Account is provision made for these purchases; and</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(3) what are the names of&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) the companies which publish and print the periodical and</li>

<li>(b) the owners and</li>

</ol></li></ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_education" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION:</from>

<ol>

<li><p>(1) and (2) The information furnished in respect of <i>Bona</i> and <i>Utlwang</i> in the reply to the hon. the Minister of Information to a question put by the hon. member on 17 April 1962 was unfortunately based on a misunderstanding that the periodicals mentioned are subsidized indirectly. Actually my Department purchases a certain number of copies of these periodicals and supplies them to schools free of charge as supplementary reading matter in the vernacular. The number of copies which are being purchased is calculated according to the number of schools and classes in the language groups concerned, and the money is being provided out of the amount which is allocated annually for library books under subhead F and subhead K of the Bantu Education Account.</p>

<p>Of <i>Bona</i> which appears in Xhosa, Zulu and Sotho, 20,150 copies of each edition are purchased at the cost of R14.555 per annum and distributed to schools and classes of these three language groups. <i>Utlwang,</i> which appears appears in Tswana, is distributed to Tswana schools.</p></li>

<li>(3)

<ol>

<li>(a) Bona Press Ltd.</li>

<li>(b) and (c) My Department does not <span class="col_4707-4708" refersTo="page_0980"/>have this information at its disposal, and is not interested in it either because the provision of suitable literature in the Bantu languages is the decisive consideration when periodicals of this nature are purchased.</li>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#field">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) The hangar in question is the property of the Department of Defence and the question should therefore be directed to the Minister of Defence.</li>

<li>(2) It is not the policy of the Department of Transport to provide hangar accommodation for the use by private aviation enterprise at State airports. This Department has in the past made available suitable sites on a State airport for the erection by private aviation enterprise of their own hangar accommodation.</li>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports that the number of road accidents in the Republic during the Easter week-end represents the third highest percentage in the world;</li>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#van_den_berg">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No. I would point out, however, that official road traffic accident statistics for the Republic are compiled by the Bureau of Census and Statistics from detailed reports submitted by the South African Police throughout the country. Until these official statistics are available&#x2014;and this will not be for at least another three months&#x2014;it will not be possible to draw any proper comparisons either with the accident figures of other countries or with our own accident figures for previous years.</li>

<li>(2) (a) and (b). These matters do not fall within my purview but within that of the Provincial Administrations and local authorities. The South African Road Safety Council in conjunction with the responsible authorities is constantly giving attention to all practicable legislative and other measures in the interest of road safety.</li>

<li>(3) No. A Task Group of the South African Road Safety Council is at present going into the question of&#x2014;

<li>(a) improving the investigation of blood alcohol tests for persons involved in serious accidents; and</li>

<li>(b) selective traffic law enforcement based on proper accident records which indicates the factors contributing towards accidents at the times and places where they most frequently occur.</li>

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li><p>(a) Yes;</p>

<p>(i) and (ii) the South African Bureau of Standards recommended in 1958 that a steering committee be appointed to advise and guide SAICCOR in regard to research into methods <span class="col_4715-4716" refersTo="page_0984"/>that could be adopted for disposal of the factory&#x2019;s effluent. A number of private persons also made recommendations from time to time, one of whom suggested that the nature of sea currents along the coast be studied with a view to laying a pipeline to discharge the effluent at a fixed distance into the sea;</p></li>

<li>(b) yes;

<ol>

<li>(i) and (ii) on 24 February 1959 the Municipality of Amanzimtoti recommended in a letter to the Department that the distribution of the effluent of the S.A. Titan Products factory in the sea be investigated, that periodic analyses of sea water be made at fixed places, as well as of the effluent itself and of the air, that precautions be taken to ensure that the quantity and concentration of the effluent be kept low for at least 12 months while the investigation is in progress, that the validity of a permit to dispose of effluent be limited to five years, renewable only after the comments of the local authorities concerned have been obtained, that permit conditions be submitted to the local authorities concerned before being finalized and that the results of all tests and analyses be made available to such local authorities.<br/>On 26 June 1959 the Natal Municipal Association resolved that the Government be asked to appoint a committee of inquiry to investigate sea pollution and to recommend control measures. <br/>An inter-departmental committee recommended that a pipeline be laid into the sea for the discharge of the effluent of the S.A. Titan Products;</li></ol></li></ol></li>

<li>(2) some of the recommendations were accepted and carried out;</li>

<li>(3) yes; such steps as may be decided upon, having regard to the recommendations of the S.A. Bureau of Standards and after the Bureau and the Department have received and noted the findings and recommendations of the steering and <i>ad hoc</i> committee concerned. In the case of SAICCOR it was found by the steering committee that one of the components of the effluent, a black liquor, contained the unwanted characteristics and steps were taken to separate this component from the effluent. At present about half of the black liquor is being separated but the factory has ordered a new filter installation at a cost of R200,000 which is expected to be delivered early next year. During the past few weeks the factory has succeeded in reducing the unwanted black liquor to a highly concentrated powder and uses for this powder are being investigated, such as for a road-making material. In the meantime the factory is spending about R20,000 annually to reduce the unpleasant effects of the effluent by using a spray to destroy the foam;</li>

<li>(4) considerable research has already been carried out and more research will have to be undertaken; and</li>

<li>(5) yes; provision is made in departmental votes and this can be supplemented from time to time as required.</li>

<p>(1) and (2) Yes, I have read the report referred to by the hon. member from which I notice that the prevalence of dust at the harbour of Port Elizabeth is the basis of the complaint. It is possible that with the loading of large quantities of ore in recent months the spread of dust has been somewhat aggravated, but it is no worse than what can be expected at any commercial port where passengers and cargo are dealt with side by side, especially in view of the frequency of winds at Port Elizabeth. The hon. member is, however, assured that everything possible is done to ensure that dust is kept to a minimum.</p>

<li>(1) Yes. The arrangement is as per annexure attached below.</li>

<ol>

<li>(a) The editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> Johannesburg.</li>

<li><p>(b) The representations were made in reference to paragraph (f) of the agreement (annexure).</p>

<p>The editor assumes that the withdrawal of Sowden&#x2019;s Press identification card stems from his action at the UN Assembly last November when he interrupted a speech by the hon. Minister, Mr. Eric Louw, and he submits that&#x2014;</p>

<p>Sowden was not in the U.S.A. on assignment by the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> or any other newspaper. He attended the General Assembly Debate purely as a private individual and not as a newspaper representative on duty. Therefore his action at the UN Assembly does not involve considerations of professional conduct as he was not present there in a professional capacity.</p>

<p><i>ANNEXURE</i></p>

<ol>

<li>(a) A Press Identification Card bearing the photograph of the holder superimposed by an embossing stamp and signed by the Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner will entitle such holder to interview the senior commissioned officer in any particular area and/or any officer designated for that purpose by <span class="col_4719-4720" refersTo="page_0986"/>such senior commissioned officer, also to communicate by telephone where necessary to such officer, and to obtain from him any information which can be made public without&#x2014;

</ol></li>

<li>(b) A Press Identification Card shall also entitle the holder to enter and remain for the purpose of his professional work in any area under police control from which the general public is excluded, except if his presence there is embarrassing to the police in their investigations.</li>

<li><p>(c) A Press Identity Card will be issued to any individual journalist selected by the editor and approved by the Commissioner. A newspaper, however, shall not be restricted to the issue of one identification card; where its circumstances require more than one card the Commissioner will meet the reasonable requirements of the editor.</p>

<p>The police must exercise their discretion in connection with the foregoing matters in a manner calculated to promote increased cooperation between the Press and the Department. Moreover, it is understood and agreed that instructions will be given to all commissioned officers in charge of police districts to delegate in case of their absence, authority to a station commander to give such information to the Press as is contemplated in this agreement.</p>

<p>The newspaper shall have the right to appeal to a senior officer from the decision of a local officer to withold any information.</p></li>

<li>(iv) to issue to his staff general routine instructions of a nature to ensure their friendly collaboration with the police in the spirit of these mutual undertakings.</li>

<p>First Order read: House to go into Committee on Moratorium Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister will recall that during the second reading debate I raised the question of what relief would be given to those members of the Citizen Forces who, having completed the nine months&#x2019; period, subsequently are called up for a further period of continuous training. The hon. the Minister will remember that it was only last year that the Defence Act of 1957 was amended where ballotees were brought in in the year of registration, in the year in which they registered, at the age of 17 or 18, and the moratorium that the Minister seeks to apply in terms of this clause is going to apply to a very small percentage of the members called up. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me. The reason is that it can hardly be expected that young boys leaving school, who come from school and go into the Defence Forces as trainees, will have incurred debts of a hire-purchase nature or of any other form to a very large extent. The maximum age of intake will be 18, or at the very most 19 years of age. They are youngsters who have just left school, and it can hardly be expected, as I have already said, that large numbers will be affected. But the difficulty as far as these new trainees in this new Defence Force of ours are concerned, will come after they have completed the period of nine months&#x2019; training Subsequently they are called up for a further period of training. The Act is quite clear. There are these extended new periods of continuous training that a member has to fulfil. The time that the trainee will need this moratorium is when he has incurred financial commitments after he has returned to civil life, when the Minister calls upon him to fulfil a further period of continuous training. As the Minister knows that is fixed at a maximum of three weeks in any one year. It may well be that in his fourth year, when he has already reached the age of 22 or 23, he has entered into financial commitments. Take the case of an artisan, a daily-or an hourly-paid man. In many of these instances, when he is called up to complete the three weeks&#x2019; period of continuous training, he has no income whatsoever other than the 50 cents a day that he gets as a trainee from the Department of Defence. His income is cut off, and it is then that he will look for relief. He has no means to meet his normal commitments. And, as the hon. the Minister well knows, too, there are numbers of unscrupulous traders who, under this hire-purchase system, when these men fail to meet their commitments for one month only, will seize the goods purchased under the hire-purchase system. In a large measure these people are ignorant of their rights. The goods are seized and they lose them. If the hon. the Minister is applying a reasonable approach, a considerate approach towards this new army of ours, I think he will agree with me that there is a good cause to give a moratorium to this class of fellow, who at the behest of the Minister and the Government is called up for further training. It seems to me on the facts and the evidence available that these men will be in more need of the moratorium than the men who are called up for the first nine months&#x2019; training. The argument may be used against this that if commerce has the impression that the granting of a moratorium over a period of three years may create difficulties for the trader, it may result in a restriction of credit. I accept that if a blanket moratorium is given&#x2014;if we were providing here for a blanket moratorium for a period covering the entire time that these men are liable for continuous training, then I would agree with that argument. But surely, if we are prepared to grant nine months to a man who is called up for the first time, before he has entered into financial commitments, then what is wrong in giving a two-month moratorium to a man being called up for a further period of training? That is not going to upset his credit as far as the commercial world is concerned, because traders will know that in the two or three years&#x2019; period that he is still liable for continuous service, at the very most he will get a moratorium of four months. In order to give effect to the argument, I want to move an amendment, and I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment. The Minister said yesterday that if we were to come with a reasonable amendment and a strong case, he would give it favourable consideration. The very fact that the Minister said that he would give that consideration, is really an admission that there is a case to be made out for these men. The Minister realizes that there are going to be difficulties and that many thousands of these men are going to be adversely affected. If the Minister is prepared to give favourable consideration, I will move an amendment which will allow the Minister to extend to those men his sympathy. I therefore wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>In line 34, to omit &#x201C;sub-paragraph (i) of&#x201D;; and to add the following proviso at the end of sub-section (2):</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that for the purposes of paragraph (d), whenever a member of the Citizen Force is required to undergo the training contemplated in sub-paragraph (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 22 of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No. 44 of 1957), the Minister shall apply the provisions of this Act to such a member for a period of two months to be notified by him in the <i>Gazette,</i> such period to be calculated from the date such member commences such training.</block>

<p>These are the same men that the hon. Minister is legislating for. It is quite clear that this is the same Citizen Force for which he is introducing the nine months&#x2019; moratorium. It is the <span class="col_4725-4726" refersTo="page_0989"/>same moratorium that is being given in this amendment. All the Minister is being asked for is that when these men have completed their nine months&#x2019; basic training and they come for a further period of continuous training, the Minister shall at least give them the same amount of relief. I have fixed a period of two months and I hope the hon. the Minister will agree to the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned last night, I was dealing amongst other things with the number of people who might be affected by this change in legislation. I quoted some figures to the House to show that I believe that the picture the Minister painted was not perhaps a true reflection of the exact picture of the total number of people who would be affected by this Bill. In doing that I quoted a figure of 128,000, and said that I believed that would be the total number affected. But I did not read out a part which I think in fairness to the Minister, and in order to get a clear picture, I should read out, and I want to do that now so that the House can have a true picture. It reads like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During 1960 the race of 48,821 persons on the European-Coloured borderline which caused some doubt was determined, in order by so doing to increase the total number of race classifications on this borderline to 57,981.</block>

<p>I am still quoting from the same Hansard report of the Other Place, Col. 3092, 14 April 1961. It was a speech made by the hon. the Minister in discussing his policy motion. It goes on to say that during the same year (1960) 11,758 persons of the Coloured-Bantu borderline were classified, which increased the total for this borderline to 70,605. Up to 31 December, 3,269 objections, of which 511 were from alleged Europeans, were received from persons objecting to their race qualification. That is to say, about 2.5 per cent of the 128,586 race classifications. I am quoting this again so that we get a true picture, without any doubts, without any question. It shows that the number of people concerned, borderline cases, in the space of one year on the European-Coloured borderline (which is the one we are discussing now) was 48,821, in the words of the Minister. In other words, those were the number of cases about which there was doubt, cases which had to be investigated in terms of the Act, and cases which had to be decided. My point is that the number of persons is not 3,000-odd as indicated to the Minister, so that the House may be under a misapprehension. The total in respect of this particular borderline comes to 48,821 and it brings the total for the year to 57,981. I think that clarifies the point that I was trying to make that the number of people affected is a very large number of people. It is the number of people which in one year, according to the Minister, totalled very nearly 58,000. The next point with which I was dealing was the question of the powers of investigation which the hon. the Minister has introduced into this Bill under Clause 4. We have suggested that he gives those people who have already been classified some sort of assurance, not by word of mouth, but written into this Bill, that they will not come up again for consideration.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to quote again from Hansard to show that this is such a complete change of view by the hon. the Minister in the space of one session to the other, that even we who are in close touch with him are confused. Obviously people who are so vitally concerned that their whole life will be affected, must be in such a state that I think it demands from the Minister consideration. I should like to quote from the same Hansard where the hon. the Minister said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Anybody is at liberty to object to his classification or to the classification of another person. In such a case, the objection is investigated by a board. Hon. Senators must note well that no personal interviews are granted any longer unless the person concerned makes that specific request himself. This policy has the result whereby very little dislocation is caused in the life of the person concerned. The decisive test in a race classification is acceptance by the community, which is the best judge&#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the hon. the Minister speaking, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which is the best judge, and accordingly all incorrect classifications or classifications obtained perhaps by fraud will come to light and be rectified by the community itself when the Group Areas are in full operation.</block>

<p><span class="col_4727-4728" refersTo="page_0990"/>Then an hon. Senator interjected&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cannot it also work in the opposite direction? <br/>The Minister of the Interior: Our experience with the board which deals with these matters and which follows this procedure is that hon. Senators themselves can state that none of these difficulties are published in the newspapers any longer. It is dealt with in such a way as to create the least possible dislocation.</block>

<p>In other words, the hon. the Minister in 1961&#x2014;last year&#x2014;was absolutely satisfied that he had the best means possible of sorting these things out by leaving them to the community to decide. And now, the very next session, he comes along with an amending Bill which upsets that entirely; a Bill which introduces a new principle entirely into the law as to the classification of White as compared with Coloured. From last year to to-day, he is going to throw the whole position back into the melting pot without any assurance whatsoever to those people who have believed in all good faith that their cases have been decided upon and finalized. In terms of this amending Bill they must come up for reconsideration unless something is written into this Bill to say that they shall not. That is the point I wish to stress, Sir. The Minister has stood up here and has said that he will not re-classify those people. But, as I have indicated earlier, we have seen&#x2026;</p>

<p>You see the approach to such an important matter as this, Sir. My next point is this: How does a person admit that he is of Coloured descent? I have given this a great deal of thought this morning. I want to put this very clearly to the hon. the Minister: Is he going to set about classifying every nation of the world, because that is what he will have to do if he is going to allow people to admit that they are of Coloured descent? That is what he will have to do. The House has this complex, Sir, that when they are talking about colour, they talk purely and simply about the relationship between the Europeans in South Africa and the Cape Coloureds of the Cape Province. I want to raise another point in this connection, Sir: the nations of the world vary in colour and they vary in physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Sir, nations vary in characteristics and they vary in colour much more than our own Coloured people and our own Europeans in this country do. This Minister knows as well as I do that there are certain chemicals to-day which alter characteristics. The hon. the Minister is laughing. I as a chemist can quote examples. He knows that in one of the non-European journals which his own Government sponsors a preparation is advertised for straightening crinkly hair. He knows this. His Government helps to distribute that journal. The Minister knows that a tablet is being sold in large quantities in this country and throughout the world which changes the pigmentation of the skin so that the person does not suffer from sun-burn. How does this Minister knows that next week a tablet will not come on to the market that will make Coloured people appear White?</p>

<p>It is possible; if you can darken the pigmentation why can&#x2019;t you make it lighter? These things may sound absurd at the moment but these are possibilities which the Minister should take into account. This is the point I am trying to make. What about the Lebanese; what about the Syrians and the like? If you admit descent from one of those races, will you in fact be admitting that you are a Coloured person? I do not know. I am asking the Minister. I do not think he knows either. Where do you draw the line between the various races of the world and our Coloured people in South Africa?</p>

<p>Yes, I think you should take a tablet. Where are we going to draw the line? This Minister has introduced something new, Sir, something which he cannot define and which he cannot confine within limits. You may say nobody else can, Sir. But I do not expect the Minister to bring supernatural powers to bear on this subject. What I do want to say is this: We seem to consider only our relationship between the Cape Coloured people in South Africa and the Europeans. I believe that under this power of investigation the Minister intends to deal with a great many cases that he has never been able to deal with before and I want to quote one or two of these to him.</p>

<from><span class="col_4729-4730" refersTo="page_0991"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! We are not dealing with the intentions of the Minister; we are dealing with the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>May I quote an example to you, Sir, of a further group of people who are going to be affected by this new definition as contained in Clause 1? This group is a group which has caused the Minister and his Department great difficulty in sorting them out in the past. This is a group in respect of which, unless an official makes an arbitrary decision, I cannot see how you are ever going to sort them out. I am dealing with a case in that group at the moment. The group is now coming into the picture because of the Minister&#x2019;s tightening up of the Act. And I believe this Bill is partly designed to deal with this group. I want to refer to the case of a man who is employed by the Government. To me he is obviously a European. He is married to a woman who I do not know whether she is European or non-European. I do not pretend to be in a position to judge. I criticize the Minister for assuming the ability to be able to judge between the two. I do not assume that ability to judge. I am investigating another case in this particular group of people; I am investigating it together with the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). It is very similar to the first one I have mentioned. This is the case of a European man who is undoubtedly and unquestionably of European descent. But he is married to a woman who possibly is not. What are we going to do with these people? This register and the staff concerned with it, have left these people alone in the past. But henceforth they will obviously try to do something about it. Because if we are going to make the population register work they will have to do something about these people. What are we going to do about this particular group of people? How is the Minister going to cope with them under this Act? These people have children. They have bought houses by their thrift in a European area where they are accepted. The wife will not in any circumstances comply with the requirements of this clause, but her husband undeniably will. I want to know what the hon. the Minister intends doing with people like these. Is he going to split the family in half? Is he going to give the husband some of the children and the others to the wife and settle them in separate areas? This is important, Sir, because this Government have stated that the various group areas are going to be developed by means of housing schemes. In other words, there will be housing schemes for the Coloureds, there will be housing schemes for the White and so forth. What is going to happen to these people? Are the husband and wife, together with various members of the family, going to have to live in different areas? Once the hon. the Minister has classified these people under this clause they are handed over to the mercy of certain other Acts which provide where they can live, what amenities they can enjoy and the like. It is no good shaking heads and being critical. We have to face up to these things.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another group of people who I think deserve the consideration of this House. As I have already indicated our main consideration hitherto has been to compare the European and the Coloured as we see them more or less in the Cape Province, where&#x2014;although I do not agree with it&#x2014;the division is either in the White group or into the Coloured group. Those people who are to all intents and purposes Coloured fall into the Coloured group; they are not of a great admixture; they are more or less of an even mixture. In Natal, however, we have a totally different position. There your Coloured group embraces a far greater variety of people. You have in the Coloured classification people ranging from near-White to Black. I think the Minister knows this. If he does not I will give him an example. I will give him the example of a group&#x2014;Zanzibaris. They were classified as Coloureds but they are now classified as Indians because the Minister did not know what to do with them. They might just as well have been classified as anything because they are certainly not Indians. But they have been nevertheless classified as Indians. Those people very nearly fell into the Coloured group. As the Minister knows they are from the east coast of Africa; they are Black people. They do not deny it. Some of them were accepted as Natives and some were accepted as Indians. I quote them to show you the type of person who can fall into the Coloured group in Natal.</p>

<p>I now come to the other group; those people whom I am trying to save from re-classification under this Bill. Those are the people of Mauritian descent, people of St. Helena descent and various other of those races. Those people have helped to build up South Africa. They are people who are prominent in the sugar industry in Natal and many other industries, people who have made their contribution and who have been accepted by the White people of South Africa under the old definition. There has never been any question about it. But under this new definition, if these people are re-classified, this hon. Minister is going to send these people who are a proud people and a very fine people&#x2014;I went to school with many of them; they were accepted in all the schools in spite of what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) said&#x2014;into the Coloured group. Those people and their children have all their lives enjoyed the privilege&#x2014;and it is a privilege in this country&#x2014;of living as Whites amongst the White people of Natal. What is going to happen to these people, Sir? They are going to be sent to live with a mixed group called &#x201C;Coloureds&#x201D; which varies, as I have said, from almost-White to absolutely Black. I think this is a point which the hon. the Minister must take into consideration. It is very easy for us to sit here and to compare the Whites and the Coloureds. Conditions vary. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) even told us how opinions varied. But, Sir, if a man is sent <span class="col_4731-4732" refersTo="page_0992"/>from the Transvaal to investigate these cases in Natal&#x2014;under this Bill the Minister can send anybody to investigate; that person need not be somebody from Natal; somebody who understands the conditions there&#x2014;he may readily say: This person is obviously not a White person. These people are definitely in danger of being classified. I think this Minister must give a definite assurance to all of these people. There are some 40,000 to 50,000 borderline cases and they can all be re-investigated in terms of this Bill and re-classified. He must do something about these people. They deserve a better fate than that, that I can tell the Minister.</p>

<p>The final point I wish to make is that since this hon. the Minister has taken over this portfolio, there has been a definite tightening up in line with this amending Bill in the administration of this Act. And I believe that these are some of the problems with which he is trying to deal. One can understand that even the men who have been appointed on this new regional basis to administer this Act have had great difficulty themselves in putting aside the human approach in dealing with it. I just want to read something which was said by Mr. Justice Snyman in dealing with a case under the new administration as introduced by this hon. Minister. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under the old classification, when an Appeal Board sat in Cape Town, Mr. J. M. Hugo, once a member of the board, could say that there were times when the members of the board &#x201C;felt absolutely sick&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I am quoting from a sub-leader in the <i>Argus</i> of February this year. Now that is a member who sat on the board. The Minister has made the point that these people were not granted personal interviews. He did not come in contact with those people, Sir, he just dealt with the facts that were placed before him and those made him sick. Just think what happens to the officials of the hon. the Minister who have to deal with and investigate these cases. I know what happens to them, Sir. They become sympathetic and they are giving these people the benefit of the doubt. For that I thank them. But now this hon. Minister has to tighten that up. He has got to make sure that the officials who administer the provisions of this Act do not in fact do that, that they rub the sympathetic aspect, the sympathetic approach right out of their considerations. That, Sir, to a large measure is the reason for the introduction of this Bill. Sir, I have no hesitation whatsoever in supporting the amendment of my hon. Leader.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) invites me to say something original, and he says that if I do so he will give me a shilling. I just wanted to say, Sir, that had I said something original you would have stopped me. I want to commence by saying that I do not agree with all the criticism which has been voiced against the Department. Let me at once say this to the hon. the Minister. I suppose I have dealt with as many cases of race classification as any other member in this House. I was a Provincial Councillor for many years for one of the suburbs where there was quite a number of borderline cases. Because some of them knew me many of them got in touch with me. People from other areas also got in touch with me. My experience with the Cape Town branch office of the Department which deals with race classification has been pleasant. I am grateful for the assistance and help which I have received from the Department, it is something which I will not forget easily. My experience has not been that the Cape Town branch office has in any way dealt less humanly with people since this hon. Minister has taken over. [Interjections.] I just want to reply to what that hon. member has said&#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, that I am grateful for that treatment, because in this matter we are not dealing with animals. We are dealing with human beings, and in particular with that group of people who feel hurt because, as a result of legislation, they find themselves in the position where they have to be classified like stud animals. That is not an easy thing. I have dealt with cases which I have taken to that office, where the father, mother and daughter have all three cried at the same time. If the Minister has witnessed the misery which such a classification&#x2014;wrongly in their opinion, but perhaps correctly according to the officials&#x2014;has caused those people, he will realize why we are serious about this matter. Such a classification, even though it is a correct classification, has a stultifying effect on the lives of those people. On the other hand, if the Minister were to see the gratitude of those people when they are classified in the White group, he will realize that, from a human point of view, it is very wrong on the part of anybody to condemn a person in respect of whom there is a slight measure of doubt, and not only that person but his descendants to the third, fourth and future generations for all time&#x2014;to an inferior position in the country of their birth. I think the hon. the Minister is making a fatal mistake in interfering with this legislation. This is not a great problem that we have to deal with. The Minister himself has said that there are only 3,000 cases in respect of which there is any doubt. He went on and gave as one of his reasons the fact that there were 15 cases who wanted to be re-classified. Fifteen out of a population of 15,000,000 is surely no justification for the introduction of legislation into this House. And 3,000 out of a population of 15,000,000 surely does not justify the introduction of legislation into this House. The problems of those 3,000 have been solved by the Minister, and solved, I believe, very justly and reasonably.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>You can correct me, Mr. Speaker, but to my knowledge they have not been replied to as yet. For example, the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) made certain allegations which have not been replied to as yet. Moreover he contradicted the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). The hon. member for Fort Beaufort said that the White people of South Africa had a proud record and that the number of so-called borderline cases which had been caused by White blood was very small. On the other hand the hon. member for Kempton Park said that if we did not pass this legislation to-day, there will be interbreeding on such a scale that within a short space of time we will become a bastard race. The Minister said at this stage that the people best able to judge as to classification were the public. He said if a person walked down Adderley Street the people of South Africa will soon enough tell you to which group that person belonged. The Minister then turns around and contradicts himself by saying that this legislation is necessary in order to determine where that person belongs. He no longer depends on the people in Adderley Street to decide. What are the facts? The facts are these: In the past a strange person was judged to a great extent by his appearance and his appearance alone. How can you judge a person, Sir, other than by appearance if you do not know his background or with whom he associates? The Government is now, however, linking these two together&#x2014;appearance and association. The Minister also goes further and says that the descent of a person, where he admits it, will no longer be an additional factor, but that it will be a deciding factor in determining his classification.</p>

</speech>

<p>My point is this, Mr. Speaker, that if the Minister makes that a deciding factor he will find himself in difficulty without writing anything more into this legislation,. What will be the position if a group of well-to-do but aggrieved Coloureds take, say, a member of Parliament, to court and say that they have evidence in the shape of his birth certificate or whatever it may be, that he has been wrongly classified because his forefathers had coloured blood in their veins? The Minister wishes to get out of the difficulty caused by a certain Mr. Song, but he is creating a million other difficulties. The Minister is plunging people into misery; he is creating more difficulties for himself instead of getting out of those difficulties. When the Minister spoke, Sir, one got the impression that he was only talking on behalf of his supporters and that we have this legislation only because the Government is annoyed with Mr. Song.</p>

<p>How many generations back will the Minister go? If this Government cannot even determine who is Coloured and does not define him, a tremendous number of difficulties will arise. I intend going further into that. However, Mr. Speaker, I hope you will first allow me to reply to some of the allegations which have been made here. You say that those allegations have already been replied to. I do not think the unjustifiable allegations made by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort have been replied to.

<p>If I have to return to the Bill, I should like to know from the Minister&#x2014;if you, Mr. Speaker, rule that it is within the ambit of the Bill&#x2014;what he intends doing with the illegitimate child of a White father and a so-called Coloured mother. I take it that child will be classified as Coloured [Interjections.] Such a child will naturally be classified as Coloured. But what will the position be of a White mother who is classified as White and who has a child by a Coloured? Who does the Minister accept as a White person; does he go by appearance and association alone? Mr. Speaker, I repeat that it is the Minister&#x2019;s duty to make provision for those cases where people break through the colour bar and numbers of them break through and will break through. It is difficult to go too far but I know of a case&#x2014;I can bring those people to the Minister, people in respect of whom some doubt existed&#x2014;where they are as White to-day as anybody else. There are three daughters who are so decent and whose appearance is so good that they have been accepted by the N.G. Church and by a White school. Now that they have returned to their parental home&#x2014;one of them was in a White orphanage&#x2014;they are classified as Coloured and it may be that they will marry Natives, but those blonde girls are not allowed to take their place in society amongst White people. We talk about Christian civilization every day of our lives. You sometimes wonder, Sir, if we are really Christians and what Christ would have done had he to deal with a case like that.</p>

If you think about the Jews and how they have kept 90 per cent of their race pure for years, I think the White race of South Africa can also keep itself pure without this amendment. I and this side of the House have confidence in the character and calibre of the daughter and mother of South Africa, we are confident that they will continue to keep South Africa White and not Black. We do not harbour the fear which the Minister does. My experience has been that this type of legislation only harms South Africa and does not do it any good.</p>

<p>I do not intend in the least to take part in this debate merely for the sake of repeating arguments or of prolonging the debate. But as a person who, during the past few years, has dealt intensively with cases which as a result of the population register have come to the notice of the authorities and had to be re-classified, I feel it is my duty, having gained experience of the human aspects of the matter, to bring it in all sincerity to the notice of the House and particularly to the notice of the Minister, because we are dealing here with an amendment to existing legislation, and when it comes to the application of this legislation the most unpleasant task which has to be performed in respect of that application, rests on the shoulders of the officials. At the outset I wish to say that I have the greatest regard and praise for the officials with whom I have come into contact for the manner in which they do their duty and perform this unpleasant task. But the question arises whether it is necesary to have officials who are placed in the position where they have to perform that task?</p>

<p>Apart from the officials who have to perform the task, you also have those people who are concerned in the matter. The hon. member for Omaruru (Mr. Frank) who is unfortunately not present at the moment, triumphantly pointed out that an appeal could be lodged against any classification made in terms of this legislation. Sir, if you study the legal system of South Africa in theory and you take a case which starts in the magistrate&#x2019;s court and you explain to an outsider what our judicial system entails, he will say: You go to the Magistrate&#x2019;s Court and if you lose your case there you can according to the South Africa system, lodge an appeal in the Supreme Court and from there in the Appeal Court. In theory that sounds easy <span class="col_4737-4738" refersTo="page_0995"/>and practical but anybody who has had anything to do with court cases knows that costs money.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>It sounds democratic and practical, but we know that an appeal from one court to another costs a great deal of money. Apart from that, in the case of a classification where an appeal is lodged, you are not only dealing with the amount of money the person has in order to have his demands met, but you are dealing with a person who is lodging an appeal not merely for the sake of the financial benefit he will derive from it. You are dealing with a person whose whole life and way of life is at stake. The social circumstances in which he lives are concerned in it. His children for whose upbringing he is responsible, are concerned. If you look at it for the human angle, it is not at all as easy as it sounds simply to say you can appeal against the classification. Has the Minister or any hon. member who has used that argument, ever thought what their own position would be and what their own feelings would be and what their own attitude towards the society in which they moved would be if they found themselves in the position in which they had to fight for their rights&#x2014;not their right of existence but their right to exist in accordance with the social plane where they were accepted in the past and which is now in danger&#x2014;by means of affidavits and by pleading here and pleading there. That is what this legislation entails.</p>

<p>Judging by the explanation given by the hon. the Minister, I cannot accept that this amendment is only concerned with the case of one Chinaman, but I will return to that point at a later stage. I want to re-emphasize that when a person&#x2019;s entire existence, the future of his children and his entire way of life and the regard which he enjoys in society, are in danger, and he has to lodge an appeal, after he has looked everywhere for assistance and has asked members of Parliament whom he sometimes does not even know for assistance&#x2014;if we imagine ourselves in that position and we have experienced what those people have, when we have experienced the sorrow and suffering and worry which they have experienced (in some cases they have even committed suicide)&#x2014;only then do you find a basis on which you can regard the consequences of this legislation objectively. The learned hon. member for Fort Beaufort&#x2014;I am not sarcastic when I say that; I have the highest regard for his academic qualifications&#x2014;argued at length to try to prove that only 6 per cent of the Coloured people in South Africa had White blood. He doubted the arguments advanced by other speakers as to the percentage. He also said that their arguments were not based on scientific investigations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>To return to the wording of the amendment as we have it before us, I just wish to say that we have heard such a great deal in this debate about Singh and about Song that I nearly started an Intervasity Sing-Song. In spite of what the Minister said when he introduced this legislation and in spite of what so many other speakers have said it is still not clear to me where the word &#x201C;Chinese&#x201D; appears in this Bill. My submission is, Sir, that no matter how sincere the intention is to prevent the occurrence of Song-cases in South Africa by means of this Bill, looking at it from the point of view of the Minister and the Government who have placed this legislation on the Statute book and who have to apply it, it is clear to me that if such a loophole exists it must be closed. For the sake of argument I accept that, but nowhere in this Bill does the word &#x201C;Chinese&#x201D; or &#x201C;Asiatic&#x201D; appear. I wish to tell you Sir, what I was told in these Houses of Parliament last Friday by a prominent <span class="col_4739-4740" refersTo="page_0996"/>and well-known leader of the Coloureds in South Africa. Having studied the Bill which we are discussing to-day, he said to me: Why does the Government use us Coloureds as the ash-heap of their racial policy? That is exactly what this legislation is doing.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Which clause?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>The whole Bill, more particularly Clause I. As far as the Government&#x2019;s policy of race classification, as circumscribed in this legislation, is concerned, it simply amounts to this that if a person cannot be classified he is simply classified as a Coloured; and on behalf of those people whom I represent in this House, I wish to say that the Coloureds are very upset about that and justifiably so, because whenever the Government does not know what to do with a person because of his racial policy, he is simply classified as a Coloured. That is also clear from what the hon. the Minister has said. He talked about Song and about Singh, but he never said&#x2014;as a mater of fact, he denied it&#x2014;that this Bill was intended to tighten the rope round the necks of those persons who may perhaps be classified as Whites but who have Coloured blood in their veins. The Minister confined himself mainly to Singh and Song It is clear to me that the Minister, as a logical consequence of the application of the Population Registration Act, the Act in which Song has found a loophole, has introduced this amending Bill and it simply amounts to this that if it were applied as it appears here it represents a rope which is tightened round the necks of those persons who are not to be blamed before God or man for what happened three or four generations ago; and to classify them as Coloureds and to make them and their children unhappy.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>If a person is charged before a court in this country, say for murder, and if there are three or four witneses for the Crown the day the case comes up for trial it he pleads guilty, those witnesses are not called. The case is finished and all that remains is the sentence. In other words, if a person pleads guilty, it is accepted that the Crown has proved its case. I want to ask the Minister this: I wish to put this case to him, a case which I have personally experienced. There is a certain family in Cape Town. In 1951 the father in all good faith, completed a confidential document which cannot even be used for income tax purposes, namely a census form. Against the word &#x201C;race&#x201D; in that form he filled in &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;. What he meant by that I do not know. The father died in 1956, but last year&#x2014;and again I wish to express gratitude to the officials who were concerned in this&#x2014;it was my unpleasant task to take two married daughters and an unmarried daughter of 18 years of age, and two children of 14 and 12 to the officials in order to prove that they were White. The father who filled in that document is dead. The children are not responsible for what he wrote or for what happened two or three generations ago, but simply as a result of what appeared in that document those children had to appear before the official as though they were cattle to be judged at an agricultural show, and that official had to perform the unpleasant task of deciding whether or not they were White. My argument is this, Sir. In the event of such person objecting to his classification and he appears before the official concerned&#x2014;and in this respect another danger lurks in this legislation&#x2014;the position will not be the same as it was in the past, when it was unpleasant enough. When the person gets there and is shown a census form in which his race is given as &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;&#x2014;or in his birth certificate&#x2014;and he admits that is correct, then surely the Government&#x2019;s case against him has been proved. In that case he has admitted that he is of Coloured descent. He may be a public servant. He may have lived in a White residential area all his life and may have attended a White school.&#x2026;</p>

<p>I can only say that if it has been raised so often, I hope the Minister will consider it.</p>

<p>I want to go further. I repeat that the only interest I have in this debate is the fact that I know what is happening, because I have experience of it and because I, as a fallible human being, as one who is standing here and talking about the bitterness and humiliation which people have to endure daily, feel that I am not the one to judge and that I have no right to throw stones, and that I cannot commit sacrilege by saying that I have the right to visit the sins of the fathers upon the third generation and even less so the Government.&#x2026;</p>

<p>There is something else. We have Clause 4 which deals with investigations. It is no longer a question of a person whose classification is doubted appearing before the official in order to convince him. It is different now. That official must also indemnify himself and he is given the right to send people to investigate. I wish to say this in conclusion. I hope the hon. the Minister will give serious consideration to this last Clause and the power which is being given to officials and other people. There is no guarantee as to what the qualifications of those people should be, whether they will be psychiatrists or people with experience, and experience is very important in this case. Anybody who was born in the Cape Province and who grew up here, will apply a totally different yardstick if he has to judge whether or not a person is Coloured. There is no guarantee <span class="col_4741-4742" refersTo="page_0997"/>that those people will have such experience. It is absolutely impossible to find a definition for a Coloured or for a White. Every piece of legislation which contains such a definition differs from one another. If people who lack experience or if people who are not all worried about what they write in their report, are to be sent to probe into the lives of people and investigate their descent, great misery and sorrow will be caused. Sir, I have no right to throw stones, less so the Minister and the Government and we do not have the right to visit the sins of the fathers on the children up to the third and fourth generations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>At this stage it might be well to remind the House of how the definition we are seeking to amend reads. The original definition read that &#x201C;a White person is a person who in appearance obviously is or who is generally accepted as a White person, but does not include a person who, although in appearance obviously a White person, is generally accepted as a Coloured person&#x201D;. Sir, the simple meaning of this definition is that if a person is in appearance obviously White and is not generally accepted as a Coloured, he is White. That is the one category. The other category of persons who could meet this test is the person who is generally accepted as a White person. Those were the two categories. Now I submit that test was nothing more than the traditional conventional test we have had all through our history, which each community applied to each individual, because anyone who is honest and not a hypocrite must realize that in the first 150 years of our history in this country there was not strong racial feeling and there was a considerable degree of miscegenation between the races. Even after the beginning of the nineteenth century, when racial attitudes hardened, there was always, in terms of this social convention, the feeling that a person was generally accepted as a White person, even though he might be dark in colour, if through merit he had risen in life or had become educated, and in the feeling that a person was generally accepted by the White community and thus pass over into the White community. I think that is an obviously historical truth and it is well stated by Professor du Toit Malherbe in his book &#x201C;Driehonderd Jaar Nasiebou&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">Niemand in Suid-Afrika hoef hom of haar te bekommer oor &#x2019;n greintjie nie-blanke bloed (meestal van &#x2019;n Oosterse volk met &#x2019;n ou beskawing) ingesypel in die heeleerste begin in sy eie of deur ondertrouery in &#x2019;n verwante familie en wat na soveel eeue deur suiwer bloed van Europese oorsprong uitgespoel en verdring is, sodat die enkele betrokke families juis soms onder the blondste getel word. Die bloedsamestelling van die Afrikanervolk as geheel is vandag suiwerder blank as di&#x00E9; van baie Europese en Amerikaanse volke.</block>

<p>Professor Malherbe wrote this book before this Act was on our Statute Book. It proves conclusively that the existing social conventions were a sufficient guard against miscegenation, but as in all societies there was flexibility for the exceptional Coloured man to be accepted in the White community. I say that the Minister, when this Act was passed, simply legislated according to the existing social conventions. This is very well put by the Minister himself in an earlier phase of his art of racial classification, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">People are not classified on the basis that they belong to a certain race. They are classified on this principle: Which group of the community accepts them? If they are accepted as Whites, it naturally follows that they will be classified as Whites. It is for that reason that the small number of Japanese we have here are classified as White, because the Whites accept them. The reply to the question as to what will become of the Chinese is that it all depends on whether the White group is going to accept them as a White community.</block>

<p>That again was in the tradition of our existing social convention. As Professor Malherbe has pointed out, that did not result in South Africans becoming a Coloured race, but it was a far more humane system that this arbitrary classification of people because what happens? The moment you make a legal definition to decide whether a person is Black or Coloured hands of an official who can to a large extent act arbitrarily. It is true that if he exceeds or White, it immediately places that person&#x2019;s life and his happiness and his future into the certain bounds his decision can be corrected on appeal, but how many ordinary poor people can afford this whole process of going on appeal? The Minister should know that once a decision has been taken, it is not easily upset. It is only where the official has manifestly departed from the definition that the court can upset it. This original definition was unnecessary. It led to a tremendous amount of social misery. I do not want to repeat what other members have said, but <span class="col_4743-4744" refersTo="page_0998"/>they have cited oases again and again, showing what the result was of casting traditional social conventions in legal form. Many of our social conventions, of course, are not acceptable to the civilized Western world to-day, but the moment you cast them in an absolutely rigid legal form so that there is no flexibility, they become completely repugnant to the whole civilized Western world. That was our original objection to this clause. The new definition now goes much further. The new definition is a complete departure from what I have called our traditional social conventions which govern whether a person should be accepted into the White community or not. Let us read the new definition and analyse its meaning. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;White&#x201D; person means a person who in appearance obviously is a White person and is not generally accepted as a Coloured person.</block>

<p>That was part of our traditional social conventions. But then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(b) is generally accepeted as a White person and is not in appearance obviously not a White person.</block>

<p>That departs completely from our accepted practice; it departs from the principle that the Minister himself stated two years ago. The amazing thing is that apparently this fundamental departure is embarked upon just because of one single case to which the Minister has been able to point where this definition does not satisfy him or the policies of this Government. But the new definition has a tail to it; it goes even further and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but does not include any person who admits that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person.</block>

<p>Sir, this is not going to be the last definition, because as this definition reads I can already envisage the amount of litigation that is going to be necessary to determine precisely what this means. One of the consequences will be this apparently that if you are an honest person and you make an admission you will be a Coloured, and if you are a dishonest person and you do not make an admission you will be a White person. That is one of the consequences of this definition. And what does &#x201C;admission&#x201D; mean here? Unless the Minister is going to circumscribe what he means by &#x201C;admission&#x201D;, what if a person says after he has had a few drinks, &#x201C;My ouma was &#x2019;n halfnaaitjie gewees&#x201D;? Can the man to whom me makes that statement run to the Minister&#x2019;s officials and say, &#x201C;That man has made an admission that he is descended from a Coloured person&#x201D;? As the admission reads now, it seems to me that would be one of the results.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>I am just making this new point that this definition will lead to endless litigation. I admit that I have cited instances referred to by other speakers. This definition is going to give rise to many difficulties, because the fact of the matter is that in human affairs of this nature, where the division between White and Coloured is so delicate, no legal provision will ever be satisfactory. The fact of the matter is that the Minister is trying to separate the inseparable. He is trying to separate people who are close together, who have the same religion and who have the same Western civilization. Sir, we are always told that apartheid is necessary to safguard our Western civilization. On what basis does the Minister discriminate here? The original definition and the new definition indicate how difficult it is for him to distinguish between a Coloured and a White man. I would say that this is a clear instance where the Minister is simply discriminating for the sake of discrimination; I say that it has no purpose, that it cannot be justified by any civilized test in the whole world; it cannot be justified by any moral test. You simply cannot try to cut this thing so fine. In this respect I have heard another argument, which has rather surprised me, from people who pretend that they are Christians or who probably think in their heart of hearts that they are Christians. They argue that only one or two thousand borderline cases will be affected by this legislation. Where do they find this new quantitative system of morality whereby if you only do injustice to a small percentage of the people, it does not matter? Surely if you commit an immoral or unjust act against one person, it is just as reprehensible as to commit it against a hundred persons.</p>

<p>The other few matters that I first want to dispose of affect my officials in two cases and me personally in a third case. As far as my officials are concerned I should like first of all to put on record my sincere thanks for what the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) had to say about the fine co-operation that hon. members receive from my officials in these very difficult circumstances. I want to express my appreciation. The same tribute was also paid by a few other hon. members on the other side.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) unfortunately overstepped the mark by making an attack upon my officials in suggesting that they did not agree with my attitude that the decision in the Song case was perfectly correct. But the hon. member repented and wrote a letter to me that I want to read out <span class="col_4747-4748" refersTo="page_1000"/>for record purposes because towards the end of the letter he gives me the right to tender his apologies here. The letter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have now had an opportunity of reading the Hansard copy of the speech made by me on Friday during the second reading debate on the Population Registration Amendment Bill, and I hasten to correct an unfortunate impression which my speech may have created with regard to the officials of your Department. In the heat of debate, at a time when I was confronted with many questions and much cross-talk, I appear to have stated <i>inter alia</i> that your officials said to me, &#x201C;We believe that the Board was wrong&#x201D;. Upon calm reflection I realized that it was wrong for me to have introduced into the debate any discussions which I had with your officials. Furthermore, on reflection and further consideration I feel that I must have completely misinterpreted the officials&#x2019; viewpoint. At any rate I realize now that I should never have dragged the officials of your Department into the debate. My statement must have caused them unnecessary embarrassment. I appreciate now that it may also have done them an injustice. In the circumstances, and in all fairness to them and incidentally to yourself, I felt that I must take the earliest opportunity of remedying the matter. I would accordingly ask you to accept that I misinterpreted my discussions with your officials, and would at the same time tender to them and your good self my sincere apologies for any embarrassment or injustice which my statement may have created.</block>

<p>I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s apology and I do not propose to pursue this matter.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). The House will recall that when he took part in the debate he attacked my Department in the course of his speech because in a certain case a person had been classified as a Coloured while his parents had been classified as Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then they were classified as Whites. He said that there was a typewritten letter lying in his office ready to be despatched to me. If the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) were here now, he might be sorry that he apologized to the hon. member the following morning. The facts in this case are as follows: The person to whom the hon. member for Durban (Point) referred, applied on 22 March of this year for a birth certificate, which was posted to him on 2 April 1962. His birth certificate indicates his race as &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;. This race description was given by the person who registered this man&#x2019;s birth and not by my officials. But the hon. member created the impression here that it was the officials who had caused this person, born of White parents, to be registered as &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>My point is simply that where a person&#x2019;s birth has been registered, whoever may have registered it, and he asks for a copy of his birth certificate and it is recorded on that certificate that he is of mixed race, it is not the fault of the Department of the Interior, and he has the right to apply in the correct way and not across the floor of the House through a politician for his race description to be changed.</p>

<p>The next matter is one which I find very unpleasant. I have tried the whole day to keep myself in check so that I would not use unbridled language in describing what the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) did in this House yesterday evening. The hon. member for Turffontein quoted here yesterday evening what I had allegedly said in 1960, which of course is not correct; I made the speech in question on 16 May 1961. The hon. member was good enough this morning to give me permission to get a copy of the Hansard report of his speech. What he quoted was an entirely mutilated quotation, as I propose to prove in a moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>As usual.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I have here the full text of what I said. The hon. member simply stated that he was quoting from Hansard, Volume 108, without indicating the column number and he did not tell us that he was quoting a piece here and then omitting the next piece. I hope to expose the hon. member here and to show what his approach is and how he makes use of his rights and privileges as a member of this House. I am first going to read out the full text of my speech to the House; thereafter I am going to read out what the hon. member quoted, and then I am going to leave it to this House to judge whether what he read out here yesterday is a correct reflection of what I said, because he said yesterday <span class="col_4749-4750" refersTo="page_1001"/>that it was time the whole country knew what sort of Minister I was. The hon. member quoted from the English Hansard and I shall do the same therefore. Let me quote what I said (col. 6505)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member for Durban (Umlazi) (Mr. H. Lewis) dealt with the position of stateless Indians and the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) talked about the Chinese. The principle on which the whole of the Population Register is based is the principle of acceptance. People are not classified into different nationalities, and it has been proved that, where a person has claimed that he is White and he has not been classified as White (just to mention an example), that person has the right to appeal to various bodies, and even to the highest court in the land, if he is not satisfied with his classification. As far as the application of this classification is concerned, there certainly was cause for serious complaint in the past. There were certain problems. My predecessor recognized these problems, and I want to say to-day that I am grateful for the fact that we have not had any criticism from any side of the House that the matter is not being dealt with in a humane way, and that human feelings are not taken into consideration. We want to hurt people as little as possible and, as far as the Population Register is concerned, we are making progress and all the cases that we have had to deal with will probably be disposed of in the near future.</block>

<block name="quote">The hon. member for South Coast also mentioned the case of a mixed marriage that may exist and the children born of that marriage, and the possibility that there may then be a re-classification. We must realize that in this complex society of ours we will often come across exceptional cases, but I want to repeat what I said a moment ago: People are not classified on the basis that they belong to a certain race; they are classified on this principle: Which group of the community accepts them? If they are accepted as Whites, then it naturally follows that they will be classified as Whites. It is for that reason that the small number of Japanese we have here are classified as Whites, because the Whites accept them. And the reply to the question as to what will become of the Chinese is that it all depends on whether the White group is going to accept them as a White community.</block>

<p>Mr. Miller then said by way of interjection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They have been doing so for years. <br/>The Minister of the Interior: That is not true. There is a section that is accepted as White, and there is an arrangement with that racial group that in those cases where they are accepted as Whites, travelling facilities, hotel accommodation, etc., will be given to them as though they are Whites. But the whole of the Chinese group has not been accepted as White. If it should appear later on that the acceptance of the Japanese or any other group is not subscribed to by the Whites, they will not be accepted as such. I think that is the right principle. What difference is it going to make to us as Whites if we accept these people?</block>

<p>I used some unfortunate expressions, but I am not going into that now. But what did the hon. member do? He had the whole story in front of him but this was how he presented it; this is what he quoted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member for Turffontein talked about the Chinese. The principle on which the whole Population Register is based is the principle of acceptance. People are not classified into different nationalities,&#x2026;</block>

<p>There appears a comma there, but the hon. member stops there; he skips the whole of the next piece and links up that sentence with a sentence which comes after a semicolon further down&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What difference is it going to make to us as Whites if we accept these people?</block>

<p>There he was referring to the Chinese. I do not know whether I have the right, but if I had the right I would have asked for a proper inquiry because this is a case of misuse (mishandeling), together with omissions, of what I actually said in an attempt to create the erroneous impression that what I had said was that these Chinese were acceptable as Whites whereas I had stated in just the previous sentence that they were not acceptable to the Whites. The hon. member quotes it in such a way that it creates the impression that I said that they were acceptable. And what does he go on to say? He says that he can no longer believe a Minister and particularly this Minister because the Minister has not carried out his promise.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the debate as briefly as possible because I have had the valuable assistance of hon. members on this side who have actually replied fully to most of the arguments, and if I were to go into those arguments in detail I would perhaps be guilty of repetition. I do not want to mention the names of hon. members who have helped to reply to this debate, but I just want to say that hon. members on this side have shown that they know what they are talking about; they have replied to the various points in a calm, moderate and convincing way and have come forward with facts. I really cannot understand why it was necessary to drag out this unsavoury debate so long to make out a case, particularly after the replies given from this side. It is a pity that so much time has had to be taken up. I just want to say that I think the United Party has made very little impression on the public outside, because in acutal fact the public Press and public opinion have not been aroused at all by what has been happening in this House in the past few days. It is perfectly clear to me that the public has the fullest confidence in the way in which the Government has administered this Act in the past twelve years and that nobody has been impressed by the scaremongering that we have had here.</p>

<p>I should like to start with the stories which have been concocted about the so-called &#x201C;hard-luck cases&#x201D;. Hon. members on the other side really enjoyed themselves in mentioning all these cases. We had to listen to one story after another, to one difficulty after another. I just want to say in advance that it is not this Act that created these cases of hardship; it was not the Act of 1950, nor will the amendments of 1962 create these borderline cases and these cases of hardhsip. They will always be there, whether there is an Act or not, but the first question is how they should be dealt with under the Act and in the Act. I should like to know from hon. members who had so much to say about these cases what cases they can produce. Let them mention a single case of hardship, a single hard-luck case, which has not been justly dealt with in the past twelve years. Let them mention one genuine case where a person has had to suffer because of the misdeeds of the parents or has had to pay for sins for which he or she has not been responsible and where we have acted unfairly. There are no such cases. The hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) shakes his head. The cases that he dealt with have been settled, just as all other cases have been resolved. These cases which have been mentioned here are apparitions without flesh&#x2014;rattling skeletons. That is what they are. The public no longer allows itself to be scared by these spectres. No evidence has been produced and no evidence can be produced that these difficult cases are not dealt with compassionately. That has always been done. I challenge any reasonable person to produce any evidence that under this Bill it will be more difficult in the future in difficult, borderline cases for a single person to obtain his legitimate classification. All sorts of allegations have been made in an attempt to substantiate that statement, but hon. members have not succeeded in doing so in this debate. All that is necessary for me to do therefore is once again to give the whole country the assurance that these amendments, if they are inserted in the principle Act, will be applied with the same degree of compassion as before. This is an assurance which I propose to link up presently with our legal system, with the judgments of our courts, and on which I stake the good name and honour of this Government. Even the proposal of the United Party, which does not want the test of acceptance only, will not eliminate the borderline cases. They say that we should have no law but that we should accept people as they were always accepted before the passing of this measure. But that would still not eliminate the borderline cases or reduce their numbers. Everything depends on how these cases are dealt with, on the degree of compassion that they are dealt with, and the Government is not ashamed to refer to its record over the past twelve years in this connection. Hon. members opposite think that they have a monopoly as far as sympathy for these people is concerned. They are making a very big mistake. We show just as much or perhaps more compassion, and I propose to prove in a moment that with these amendments particularly we are showing greater compassion than hon. members opposite who, unconsciously perhaps, are not showing the same degree of compassion. Is there any person who has the quality of Christian compassion who is not sorry for a person who finds himself in difficulties through no fault of his own and who has to pay the penalty for the misdeeds of his forefathers? I say therefore that it has always been accepted by this Government that these people must be treated with circumspection.</p>

<p>I come now to the substantive arguments, aspects, and the first is this question of reclassification. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition who introduced this debate on behalf of the Opposition made a great issue of this. I just want to say in parenthesis that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a good speech from his point of view. If the Opposition had left the matter at his speech, they would have fared much better, and we could then have devoted all our time to his arguments. I want to quote what I said in my second reading speech about reclassification&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The amended provision in connection with the determination of race will not affect the position of persons who have already been classified.</block>

<p>Those were my specific words. The hon. the <span class="col_4757-4758" refersTo="page_1005"/>Leader of the Opposition says, &#x201C;That is not worth much; that is only your assurance as Minister; the Act provides differently The hon. members for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) and Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) have even gone so far as to put forward an amendment to the effect that no re-classification should take place. Others have alleged that this is going to lead to a witch-hunt, and the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) has said that&#x201D; all borderline cases can now be re-classified&#x201D;. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) was also very perturbed and worried. The question is this: Have we asked ourselves how a re-classification can take place? There are two methods whereby people can be re-classified. The first is that in terms of Section 11 of the principal Act anybody can object to the classification of another person but only within 30 days after having become aware of such a classification. In terms of the amendment contained in Clause 3, an objection cannot be lodged after the expiry of this period, unless the Minister extends the period, which may then not exceed one year. If a person lodges an objection, he is required in terms of the regulations to deposit R20 and he even runs the risk of having to pay all the costs connected with such a re-classification&#x2014;legal expenses, etc. What has happened with the implementation of Section 11 over the past 12 years? Not a single objection has come in from a single member of the public over the past 12 years. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) has come along here with a touching story as to how a person can go and complain that his neighbour is not a White person if the neighbour looks a little dark to him, when in fact he has been sun-tanning perhaps. The hon. member says that he can do that if he wants to get rid of his neighbour. He almost shed tears in telling this touching story. But over the past 12 years not a single person has complained under the old definition against the classification of his neighbour or any other person. What is this terrible danger; where does the danger lie? If we are not in the habit of going out on a witch-hunt, if we are not in the habit of checking these borderline cases continually to see whether we cannot upset the classification of people, why should our citizens now suddenly undergo a change and go out on a witch-hunt? Will they do so as the result of the amendments made here? Will these amendments inspire them to do so, when they are not in the habit of doing so to-day? No, Mr. Speaker, hon. members are revealing a lack of knowledge here, even a lack of imagination; the cases mentioned by them as examples do not even show sufficient imagination. The hon. member for Hospital went so far as to mention an actress to put little life into his own stillborn case.</p>

<p>What is the second method of re-classification? The second method is that in terms of Section 5 (3) of the principal Act, the Secretary has the power to amend an incorrect classification at any time. In this connection I have given the assurance, and I do it on behalf of the Government&#x2014;what more can I do&#x2014;that it is by no means our intention that a re-classification campaign should be set in motion by my officials or anybody else as the result of these amendments.</p>

However, hon. members apparently do not regard this as sufficient assurance. What does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition really want? He says he does not regard it as sufficient for me to give assurances. If that is the case why does he not give notice of an amendment? Why did he not ask me that when I reply to the debate I should give the assurance by way of a legal enactment that I will not instruct my officials to conduct that witch-hunt and to re-classify all those persons who have been classified on a certain basis? What does the United Party want? Don&#x2019;t they want any re-classification, as the hon. member for Pinelands has said? Don&#x2019;t they ever want re-classification?</p>

<p>Yes, that is all very well, but what does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition want? He cannot come here and shuffle from one foot to the other and not tell us what he wants. I want to say this: I will not be the Minister to say that this right should be taken away from the public and from the Secretary of the Department. Nor will I say that it should be limited. I have very strong reasons for saying that. The first reason is that it is surely necessary in the case of persons who themselves want to have their race re-classified? Or do you not want that poor chap who is registered as &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;, to whom the hon. member for Durban (Point) has referred, that person with White parents, to be re-classified? If it is really a genuine case do you not want him to come of his own accord and say: &#x201C;When I applied for my birth certificate I discovered for the first time that I belonged to a mixed race&#x201D;? Do you not want any person, like these 15 Coloureds, who have really also been held up to ridicule, but who are perturbed as a result of the wrong classification, to have the opportunity of having that classification changed? The hon. member for Durban (Point) said that they were probably all cases where love was involved. He was sure of that. He challenged me. I do not know where he traced those 15 cases. Those are his own ideas, but he preaches that as the Gospel. Let me say this that if we did not allow re-classification the United Party will be <span class="col_4759-4760" refersTo="page_1006"/>the ones to champion these &#x201C;hard-luck&#x201D; cases; they will tell us these &#x201C;hard-luck&#x201D; stories. It will always happen, for generations it will still have to happen that the case of the person who comes forward voluntarily and says: &#x201C;I am not satisfied with my classification&#x201D; will have to be dealt with. According to the Leader of the Opposition he should not have the right to have himself re-classified.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has argued himself into a knot, he has talked himself into a corner, together with his two lieutenants who support him and who even went a little further than he did.</p>

<p>I go further: A limitation of this right to re-classify is the very thing which will give rise to the dangers and the problems which the Opposition envisage, namely, it will create additional colour barriers, with additional cases on both sides of the barrier, cases where objections are lodged. If the Opposition does not realize that I just wish to give them this assurance that I think it is extremely dangerous to give examples, and I do not wish to do so, but I do wish to say that if that person to whom the hon. member for Durban (Point) has referred should not have the opportunity of being re-classified, he will be branded for the rest of his life as belonging to a mixed race; and he will remain that and his descendants will all have to be registered as mixed. Yet hon. members opposite are the very people who plead that we should be more flexible. They are very concerned about those people who will not be classified as Whites and who will remain Coloureds. It now appears that the sympathy comes from another quarter. We are the people who are concerned about those &#x201C;hard-luck&#x201D; cases, about those borderline cases, about those people who experience difficulty and we have included the principle of acceptance.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question? Does the hon. the Minister not admit that there is a difference between re-classification by the State, where the Government takes the initiative, and re-classification on appeal by a person who objects to the classification of the State?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>What applies to the one applies to the other. If the Department of the Interior has to deal with a real problem case which it cannot reclassify because it has made a mistake, what then? If hon. members only knew how many clerical errors slip in in such cases! How must they classify a person on the information they have before them? After a person has been notified of his classification, he does not immediately run to the Appeal Board and lodge an appeal if a mistake was made in his case. The first thing he does is to write to the Department and to say to them: &#x201C;A mistake has been made; you have classified me as being of this colour or that colour and I am not of that colour.&#x201D;In that case the Department goes through the documents and they may find that a mistake was made and then they re-classify that person. Does the hon. member for Houghton want the position to be that the person must first go to the Appeal Board and ask them? My Department is not &#x201C;snooping around&#x201D;. The officials do not go snooping around in order to see where they can remove somebody. That is not what is happening. As far as Clause 4 is concerned, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made the following charge: He said we were introducing an amendment empowering the Secretary of the Interior to authorize somebody to investigate certain cases. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was very concerned about this and said, &#x201C;This is snooping about in other people&#x2019;s private affairs&#x201D;. The hon. member for Pine-lands even asked whether I would not perhaps appoint private detectives to obtain the information for me in regard to these cases, so that they may be investigated. How can this thing be so exaggerated in the face of the existing facts! With what object is it done, if one reads Section 12 of the present Act together with what is being added now? If one does so, it is simply inconceivable that people can say anything like that. The present Section 12 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Director may require any person in respect of whom any particulars required for recording in the register have been furnished in any form or return received <span class="col_4761-4762" refersTo="page_1007"/>under the Census Act 1910, or in any form prescribed under Section 9, to furnish to him evidence as to the correctness of any such particulars.</block>

<p>He can do that now. But now the difficulty is, and that was the difficulty also in the Song case, and that is why I said unhesitatingly that the Appeal Board could give no other decision, because when he came along with all his proof of acceptance, all his sworn statements, the Secretary for the Interior did not have the right to make any further investigation. As I have said, that was the difficulty. The Secretary just could not do so; he was bound. All we are doing now is to insert the provision that the Secretary can do so. Now I want to put this question: If now already there is all this suspicion, then I am quite prepared for the Opposition&#x2014;and I shall also do so myself&#x2014;to move in the Committee Stage that the people who may be employed by the Secretary for the Interior should only be officials of the Department. I am quite prepared to do that, to allay the suspicion of the Opposition. Because it is not the intention here to institute a witch-hunt. The object is to give the true facts to the body which has to decide, because to-day the Secretary for the Interior does not have the right to obtain the true facts. Why also look for hidden motives unless one has something to hide? Why all this suspicion, and why not accept a record of 12 years during which people were decently treated, and people did not go about all day poking their noses into things? Now it will be said that there were cases where these people had to appear before officials in order that the officials could see what they looked like. I think it was the hon. member for Durban (North) who mentioned the pathetic case here of people who had to put in an appearance merely in order that the officials could see what they looked like. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with it, because the principle of acceptance is based primarily on what the man looks like. How does an hon. member accept someone to whom he gives a sworn statement? Does he accept it because the man says he is White, or does he accept it after having seen him? In any case it is no use arguing in this way with adults. I am now prepared to do what I said, namely to insert that provision in Clause 4. But I am not prepared to do anything else to take away this power granted to the Department, because I say unequivocally that it is not being inserted with the object of having a witchhunt, or to persecute these people. It is not the intention now to make investigations in regard to people who have already been classified in order to see whether we cannot re-classify these people under the new Act. Re-classification will remain based on those two principles of Section 11 and Section 5 of the Act, viz. that the person himself asks for it, and that the Department itself can make a reclassification in case it becomes necessary to do so because a <i>bona fide</i> mistake was made.</p>

<p>This reclassification must be linked to the provision in regard to descent in Clause 2. I again start with the end of that clause. This provision is intended to prevent a person, from ignorance or for other reasons, admitting that he is a Native or a Coloured, thereby causing distress to innocent persons and relatives, from pure selfishness. As the amendments read, that is the only case where the Department will investigate descent. Then I come to hon. members like the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), who spoke about the question of descent. The second object is to grant this power to investigate in order to prove the correctness or otherwise of evidence of acceptance. Surely one can only do that after having investigated the matter. At present, because there is no power to institute such investigations, one is unable to obtain counterproof that people have not spoken the truth. It was as the result of these defects that we landed in difficulties.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I come to the very important point around which all the Opposition arguments turned right throughout the debate, viz. that borderline cases, on the borderline between White and Coloured, may be deleteriously affected by the proposed amendment. I immediately say that is not so. If this proposed amendment has any effect at all on these borderline cases, it will rather be to improve their chances of being classified as White. I am going to prove that. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition should not shake his head. The words &#x201C;but not also someone who admits that by descent he is a Native or a Coloured person, unless it is proved that the admission is based on facts&#x201D; (that is the portion I am going to insert) cannot if the court decision of the past is taken into consideration, be interpreted other than as follows. The element of descent which is being introduced does not mean that persons who have a slight admixture of Coloured blood in their veins are non-Whites.</p>

<p>Where does the Act say that?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Just wait a moment. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is a lawyer, and he allowed all his advocates to talk, and they all quoted to us from books. Although I am only a stupid fellow, I can also read these books. The peculiar thing is that they quote cases decided before this particular one, and again cases decided later, but they do not quote the correct one. I have here &#x201C;Decisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa, 1950 (4), Oct.-Dec. South African Law Reports&#x201D;. I refer to the case of Rex v. Gill. The Judge who presided in this case was none other than Judge Fagan as he then was. But the case of Rex v. Gill was not quoted by hon. members opposite. In his judgment on page 205 Judge Fagan, <i>inter alia,</i> said the following. I may <span class="col_4763-4764" refersTo="page_1008"/>just say that Judges Newton-Thompson and Searle sat on the Bench with him. In his judgment the Judge said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While the test of &#x201C;preponderance of blood&#x201D; (which is the popular figurative expression for preponderance of descent, though it is an unscientific phrase, for we know that biologically the blood carries no racial characteristics) has thus been applied even in cases where, on the wording of the statute involved, descent was held to be the conclusive criterion, it has been pointed out that the criteria may differ in different statutes.</block>

<p>The report then continues on page 206&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Ex parte Kinnear the question submitted to the Judge under the Electoral law was: &#x201C;Whether a person light brown in colour, whose mother was of pure European descent, but whose father was the son of a man of pure European descent and of a woman of mixed race, stated to have been the child of a French father and a Eurasian mother, is entitled to be described as a European in the voters&#x2019; list.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Now Judge Fagan continues and says the following in his judgment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the case before us the magistrate has held that despite Doreen&#x2019;s appearance being European, &#x201C;the contrary&#x201D; has been proved &#x201C;by virtue of her father not being a European&#x201D; and that the appellant knew this. I have already referred at some length to the evidence, on which I cannot find that the appellant knew anything more than that, in his own words &#x201C;there was a slight mixture of blood on father&#x2019;s side&#x201D;. I need not, for the purpose of our present decision, attempt to indicate what percentage of mixture would be sufficient to prove &#x201C;the contrary&#x201D; in the case of a person who is in appearance a European. Suffice it to say that neither on the authorities I referred to, nor in the ordinary acceptation of the terms in South Africa, would &#x201C;a slight mixture&#x201D; make a non-European of one who is European in appearance. In addition we have here the evidence of association; although as a child Doreen went to a Mission School which she speaks of as a &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; school&#x2026; The evidence is all one way that at present she consorts as a European with Europeans.</block>

<p>Hon. members opposite wanted to know from me what percentage of blood is allowed&#x2014;one-eighth, one-quarter, one-sixteenth, or onethirty-second&#x2014;when is someone a Coloured? We have repeatedly stated that two very important yardsticks are used. The first is appearance&#x2014;and they cannot be separated&#x2014;what does the person look like? What is your first impression? Surely one will not judge a person if one does not immediately gain the impression that this one is White and that one looks like a Coloured and another looks like an Indian. After having looked to see what he looks like, the second test one applies is: In what circles does the man move; who are his friends, in what society does he move, where does he attend church, where does he live and where do his children attend school? Then one perhaps accepts him and says: This man looks like a White man and he is accepted by the Whites. That is precisely what this judgment says. We are not out on a witch-hunt here to ascertain what percentage of strange blood flows in anybody&#x2019;s veins. We are not out on a witchhunt to ensure that a person with a certain percentage of Coloured blood in his veins will never be classified as a White person. We are dealing here with what a person looks like, something which this judgment of Judge Fagan states very clearly, and how he is accepted. For this statement hon. members need not accept my word alone, they need not accept the word of the Government alone, but they have the administration of justice in the courts of the Republic as an unassailable guarantee.</p>

That has been exploited here. We have had a clumsy and unscientific approach here, and in regard to this matter attempts have been made to bring this Bill and the original Act into disfavour with the public once more. Strenuous attempts were made to do so and to sow uncertainty and confusion. The addition of these words which I will insert in the Committee Stage, &#x201C;unless the contrary is proved&#x201D;, are in fact a further guarantee which will ensure, Sir, that anyone&#x2014;I hope the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is listening now&#x2014;who has a slight admixture of Coloured blood, or no such blood, will not be able to harm himself and others by making such an admission.</p>

<p>Supposing a man knows that there is a little Coloured blood in his veins derived from his <span class="col_4765-4766" refersTo="page_1009"/>antecedents three or four generations ago. Now he is faced with the question of an admission. Somebody asked now he must make the admission. Supposing it is extracted from him by one of the so-called unwise officials. The question is put to him: But is there no Coloured blood in your family? Now he makes an admission. Or somebody else, his neighbour&#x2014;that neighbour of whom the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) is so afraid&#x2014;comes to discuss the matter with him and he admits that in the third or fourth generation before him there was a little Coloured blood, that his great-grandmother was a half-breed, as somebody put it here. Supposing he admits it. Now we want to prove the contrary because by this admission of his this man may perhaps cause great misery. He makes the admission through ignorance, perhaps, or for selfish reasons. That is what this Mrs. Singh may perhaps try to do. She may say that she admits that she is an Indian&#x2014;for selfish reasons&#x2014;without considering what she is doing to her brothers and sisters and the rest of her family. Then we ask that we should be able to prove the contrary and prove that these people are telling lies. What is wrong with that? We are not going to ask these people to make an admission. The man voluntarily makes the admission and says: I am a Coloured person or a Native, for whatever reason; perhaps for reasons of his own, or because at the back of his mind he is afraid, because he knows that there is a little dark blood in his veins. He will not say that he is pure White. The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) says we all have a little foreign blood in our veins. He is going very far. He is very sceptical about any of us having pure blood. I cannot understand why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition cannot grasp the position. I cannot understand his failing to realize that in fact this affords protection for the very people whom he wants to protect. But he wants to protect them without this protective measure. I cannot say more than this. What is meant by a slight admixture of blood is also clear from the decisions quoted, and it is determined by the factors I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to come to this important Clause 2 and briefly state my standpoint. This was the most contentious clause. It was alleged that this Act was introduced in 1950 with the clear understanding that acceptance would be the decisive determining factor. I definitely want to deny that. My colleague, the Minister of Finance, introduced the original Act. I do not know how many hon. members opposite have read General Smuts&#x2019; speech, and also the speeches he made in the Committee Stage. I am not going to take up the time of the House by quoting from his speeches, but if hon. members read them they will see very clearly that he repeatedly said that appearance and acceptance have equal weight and that one cannot apply the one without the other. One cannot accept a person if he does not look White. That is a very important factor. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) especially referred to it. Appearance takes such an important place in this legislation that Section 19 (1) provides that a person who in appearance is obviously White will, when this Act is applied, be presumed to be White until the contrary is proved. Here appearance is accentuated, but hon. members opposite aver that it did not count; only acceptance counted! Because the new definition now also refers to appearance, we have this furore. If someone alleges that he is White, but he associates with Coloureds and passes for a Coloured, they will look to see whether he is a White person, and even though he looks like a White he will still not be classified as such. What hon. members have missed in this whole amending Bill is this: What happens in fact is that the emphasis has gradually in these 12 years been shifted to acceptance. That has happened; I admit it. Appearance has become a less important factor in determing race classification. But not a single one of us objects to the principle of acceptance. But divorced from appearance, we land in the maze, as we had in the Song case. Now we do not divorce it, oh no. In terms of the new definition, the judgment of society is not thrown overboard. That has not been proved in any of the speeches we have heard. I listened attentively to find proof that we are abandoning the judgment of society. But the Song case has proved that the judgment of society is not always interpreted correctly, because the tendency has been to attach less weight to appearance than to acceptance. This approach works quite smoothly in the majority of cases, but from the Song case it became clear that appearance and acceptance must be taken together because appearance is the primary basis on which society puts a person&#x2019;s acceptance. One first sees what a person looks like before one accepts him. That is quite a human, natural and psychological action. Surely one will not accept a person on the face of it and say his case appears quite in order. But in addition, this new definition will prevent unscrupulous groups of persons giving an artificial judgment for their own purposes, a judgment which is not supported by society. That is important. That has become more necessary if one notes the views of the Opposition in regard to the classification of a Chinese as a White person. They ridiculed it. They said it was just one single case. They asked whether we were passing an Act for one Chinese; there are other ways of dealing with it. However, it showed conclusively that the loophole in the existing legislation had to be closed and that it was absolutely essential to consider both appearance and acceptance when classifying Whites as well as Coloured persons.</p>

<p>Summarizing everything, Sir, I want to say that the object of this definition is to determine the exact judgment of society and to interpret it, and to prevent the judgment of <span class="col_4767-4768" refersTo="page_1010"/>society being contravened by small groups or individuals for their own purposes. For those reasons this amending measure has become necessary.</p>

<p>The Opposition has tried its best to show that these borderline cases are not treated justly. Twelve years ago they also shed tears about all these innocent people and the children who would suffer. For years they were responsible for the indescribable misery and sorrow of those people. They were responsible for that. They allowed the thing to continue. They allowed mixed marriages to continue. They allowed these mixed races to continue. They allowed the fear to increase in the mind of the fair-skinned child born from those people. That child became afraid and thought: What about my future? I look like a White person, but I associate with Coloureds; what must I do and what is going to happen to me?</p>

<p>A very important matter referred to here and in regard to which I was challenged was the question of the Japanese, the Chinese, and the other people of dark complexion. I was asked what would happen to them. In this debate the Opposition could not resist the temptation to follow in the footsteps of the anti-Government Press which ridiculed the Government for having allegedly declared the Japanese White. The hon. members for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), Zululand (Mr. Cadman), Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) rejoiced in ridiculing and almost jeering at the Government for having done this. In spite of the clearest statements already made by the Government in regard to these misrepresentations, they continued to do so. Conclusions in respect of the Chinese, Coloureds and other non-Whites and other dark-skinned people from Southern Europe, Cuba, and other parts of South America were dragged into this debate and the question was asked as to what we were going to do about them. The object was to put all those groups up in arms against the Government&#x2014;that was the clear object, and even to strengthen the Opposition to us overseas. The Opposition was not in the least concerned with the consequences of their actions. On the one hand they get up here and piously preach that we should tie bonds of friendship with the non-White states of Africa and Asia, but in the same breath they destroy the positive action of the Government in negotiating trade relations with Japan. They do so deliberately. On the one hand they plead that we should have good relations, and if there are good trade relations which are of advantage even to them, they ridicule the Japanese and say, &#x201C;It is pig-iron and not pigment&#x201D; which counts, and they do not care if those trade relations are disrupted. Then they continuously emphasize the discrimination in favour of the Japanese, in an attempt to make all the other non-Whites feel hurt, particularly the Chinese, with the object of destroying good relations. Once again I want to condemn in the strongest words possible these tactics of the Opposition of arousing enmity towards South Africa. Just in order to come into power they do not mind what they do and what harm they do to South Africa. This method of attack is only intended to undermine our traditional policy of separation. The Opposition no longer sees a chance of obtaining the support of the electorate by means of a policy of integration, and now they resort to this subtle propaganda in order gradually to condition the public to accepting integration in all kinds of spheres as being nothing extraordinary; it is just a bit of &#x201C;small apartheid&#x201D; which we might as well abandon. It is one of these pin-pricks, these little things which we need not do. All the prophets of doom have again got up here and spoken about the harm it will do us overseas because we have introduced this amending Bill. Now the Opposition Press in recent times has particularly concentrated on this form of integration and it deals with these minor matters, in the sphere of entertainment and sport. It all seems so insignificant and innocent, and it seems so unsporting of this Minister not to be a little conciliatory. They refer to the Olympic Games and then again to a stage artiste, and we must be conciliatory and allow these people to enter, because it cannot do much harm. The Opposition Press concentrates on this sort of thing. Here the Opposition has an opportunity, and they have used this debate to do so, and it will continue, under the guise of a flexible application of apartheid, to try to attain what they could not attain by means of exerting pressure in the economic sphere. As examples of how they want to enforce integration, we have what they say about stage performers having to play to mixed audiences, and mixed sport.</p>

<p>I now want to put the position beyond all doubt on behalf of the Government and with your leave, Mr. Speaker, because it quite fits in with this debate in which the Japanese were mentioned, and I want to make a statement in regard to the matter so that the whole country will now once and for all know what the attitude of the Government is in regard to this race classification, and in order that this statement may in future be referred to without unnecessarily wasting the time of the House. The statement reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is as part of this attempt to condition the public of South Africa to a multi-racial society that the abovementioned arrangements in regard to Japanese visitors to South Africa have been grasped at. On the one hand, the object was to create the impression that it proves that the Government is beginning to yield to integration under the pressure of trade interests, and to serve as encouragement to continue exerting pressure in other spheres in which many members of the public are interested. On the other hand, the object is to enforce similar concessions in respect of other population groups, one after another. The <span class="col_4769-4770" refersTo="page_1011"/>Chinese would first be concentrated on, and if the principles of apartheid were abandoned in that respect, then the Indians and Asians would be concentrated on, and then the Coloureds, and thereafter the urban Bantu. The Government naturally did not yield to these tactics of the progressive undermining of its policy of apartheid. It was all the more unnecessary, and it would also have been illogical to do so, because the criticism and the ridicule in regard to the action taken in respect of the Japanese were based on misrepresentation and also did not take into account the most fundamental principle on which the policy of apartheid is based.</block>

<block name="quote">This principle is that every racial group has a right to continue existing and to preserve what it has achieved for itself during the course of history, and to the opportunities for development which it can in future enjoy fully within its own group. The question of superiority and inferiority is therefore not relevant at all and the object is not to humiliate any group or race. Consequently it is not necessary to make more comprehensive than is necessary for this purpose the measures in respect of each group which must ensure the rightful and unmixed continued existence of the various racial groups in South Africa. The Japanese in South Africa are not a permanent or a numerous group. On the contrary, the number of those who are temporarily resident here, including visitors, is very small, and they are spread all over the country, and whatever form the measures affecting them might take, it would result in no danger to the abovementioned separate existence. From this it follows that it is not necessary to declare them to be Whites, or to classify them as Whites, or to grant them the status of Whites, as various people have alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> in order not to humiliate them. All nations are entitled to their own existence and South Africa honours equally on that basis all nations and states with which it in fact has regular international contact. I regret that some persons in newspapers supporting the Government have also been misled involuntarily into sometimes using such terminology. No Japanese has therefore been declared White, and no Japanese has been humiliated by our not doing so. Just as little has the dignity of any Chinese been hurt by not declaring him White or by considering other measures necessary for the basic object described above, because of other circumstances affecting his group. The same applies to other racial groups. Everyone can and must be honoured, whatever nation he belongs to, and may protect himself against any racial group which would be able to threaten his continued existence in his own country. If Japan or China had to protect themselves against an influx of Whites, no White nation or State could justifiably blame them or regard it as humiliating to its race.</block>

<block name="quote">All that has therefore happened is the following. The Group Areas Act No. 77 of 1955 <i>inter alia</i> provides that the State President may by proclamation define any ethnic, language, cultural or other group of persons who are members of <i>inter alia,</i> the coloured group, and declare them to be such a group for the purposes of the Act. There are at the moment 50 Japanese in the country, of whom the majority are not permanent residents. They live as families spread over some of the big cities, and they are therefore not a settled community in the Republic. In addition, the majority of them are strangers and eminent persons who are here temporarily, attending to the interests of businesses in Japan. For this reason it was not considered practical or necessary to declare them to be a separate group under the Group Areas Act. In other words, in 1961 it was decided, for purposes of the Group Areas Act, to treat them in the same way as Whites, but that does not justify any ridicule to the effect they have now been declared White. In fact, it only confirmed the practice which had existed for many years, also under previous governments, in terms of which they have always been allowed access to various places together with Whites. It is so generally known that it is perhaps hardly necessary to add that eminent visitors who come here to attend to business or political or other important matters, are treated in this way, whether they come from Asian or from African states, because their temporary sojoura here does not constitute a threat to the basic object either, and it is not the intention to derogate from the honourable status or human dignity of any state or person.</block>

<block name="quote">In the case of Indians and Chinese, the position is quite different from that of the Japanese. The Chinese, who constitute a very peace-loving community of high standing, nevertheless consist of more than 6,000 persons who are mainly located in a few centres as settled communities. They cannot, and do not want to, be assimilated, and when taking any action in regard to them the precedent it may set in regard to larger settled communities must be borne in mind in connection with the aforementioned basic object. In terms of the aforementioned Act, they have therefore been declared a separate group for the purposes of that Act. That does not derogate from the fact that it has for many years been considered administratively practicable to treat members of this group differently from Whites in various respects. Their relatively small numbers and consistently high standard of living has made that possible.</block>

<block name="quote">The Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu groups are of course all large settled groups and have therefore been defined as such. The basis of this is <span class="col_4771-4772" refersTo="page_1012"/>the principle that the interests of every community should be recognized and protected in their own areas, <i>inter alia,</i> in towns and cities.</block>

<block name="quote">In regard to the Population Registration Act 1950, the position is that this Act provides for the classification of the inhabitants of the Republic into various racial groups, namely the White group, the Bantu group and the coloured group. The coloured group consists of persons who do not belong to the White or the Bantu groups. Here also the State President, as in the case of the Group Areas Act, can prescribe and define the ethnic or other groups in which the coloureds and the Bantu are to be classified. So, for example, the Malay group, the Indian group, the Chinese group and the group of other Asians have been defined. For the same reason as in the case of the Group Areas Act, namely that there is only a small number of Japanese in the country, mostly temporarily, it was not considered practical or necessary to establish a separate Japanese group. They of course do not fall under the White group but under the group &#x201C;other Asiatics&#x201D;, as contrasted with the Indians and Chinese who are settled inhabitants of the Republic in large enough numbers to be defined as separate groups.</block>

<block name="quote">In the light of all this, it should now be clear how unreasonable and unnecessary, and indeed even ridiculous, were the attacks on the Government that for materialistic reasons it declared one Asian nation to be White.</block>

<p>I just wanted to make this statement, and with reference to the debate which has taken place here, in regard to all the other nationalities and groups, the Government will, when the opportunity offers, and if it should become necessary, and if it considers it to be in the best interests of South Africa, judge every case. The means are available to us. The possibilities are there, and I now really want to make an appeal that we should stop saying all the ridiculous things we have heard here.</p>

<heading>STATEMENT BY MR. SPEAKER</heading>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to make a short statement in consequence of what took place in the House yesterday during the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Population Registration Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>In the past the words &#x201C;distort&#x201D; or &#x201C;twist&#x201D;, &#x201C;distorting&#x201D; or &#x201C;twisting&#x201D; and &#x201C;distorter&#x201D; or &#x201C;twister&#x201D; have always been regarded as unparliamentary, and members using such expressions have been ordered to withdraw them.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of the Interior referred yesterday to a quotation by the hon. member for Turffontein from a previous speech of the hon. the Minister, and stated that he made it &#x201C;in a&#x2026; distorted form to create a different impression.&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>After consideration, I have decided that the expression &#x201C;distorted form&#x201D; or &#x201C;twisted form&#x201D; will also be regarded as unparliamentary in future.</p>

<p>In the course of the speech of the hon. the Minister of the Interior, the hon. member for Turffontein was challenged to ask for the appointment of a select committee to determine whether or not he had misrepresented a previous speech of the hon. the Minister by the quotations which he made in the House. I wish to point out that all the facts in connection with this matter are known to the House and are on record and, therefore, any hon. member can satisfy himself as to what the actual position is. As a matter of fact, hon. members have frequently contended in the past that their speeches have been quoted out of context by other hon. members, but no further steps were taken. Under the circumstances I cannot see what purpose will be served by the appointment of a select committee to inquire into this matter, but it is, of course, for the House itself to decide what action should be taken.</p>

</speech>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in view of your statement and your ruling that the words &#x201C;in a distorted form&#x201D; will in future be regarded as unparliamentary, which words were withdrawn by the hon. the Minister, and because the House is in possession of all the relevant facts, I do not propose to take the action which I contemplated taking.</p>

<p>Second Order read:</p>

<p>House to resume in Committee on Unemployment Insurance Amendment Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>[Progress reported on 25 April, when Clause 3 was under consideration.]</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned, we were discussing Clause 3 and, at this stage, I wish to move an amendment to Clause 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the proposed new paragraph (m) inserted by paragraph (b): <br/>Provided that for the purposes of this paragraph the period of unemployment referred to shall not include any period of training which a member of the Citizen Force is required to undergo in terms of Section 22 of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No. 44 of 1957).</block>

<p>The reason for moving this amendment I think will be quite clear to those who made a study of the Act and of the amendment proposed by the hon. the Minister. In the first place, I do not think that it was intended that a period of nine months&#x2019; continuous training, or even, for that matter, the secondary period of three weeks&#x2019; each, were intended to act as a disqualification in respect of contributors to the Unemployment Insurance Fund if they subsequently, at the completion of such training, found themselves unemployed. I do not think that was the intention. If that was the intention, it would be most unfortunate, but in terms of this amendment any period of service in the Defence Force will be disregarded for the purpose of claims in terms of the Act. Now it may sound a little complicated, but I think an example will show exactly what can happen if the clause is not amended at all. It can happen that a person who has turned 17 this year and registers in terms of the Act and who is balloted for, in terms of the relevant provisions may not be called upon to take part in the training until the latter part of next year. In other words, a period of one year and nine months from the date of registration he will not be called up, but during that period of one year and nine months the person concerned may be in employment, and he would have built up credits in terms of the Unemployment Insurance Act. But then immediately preceding the period, before going on the training schedule, he may become unemployed, and then, having completed the nine months in this Citizen Force, he returns to civilian life and is not immediately placed in employment. As the Act is now, that person could apply for benefits, but in terms of this amending Bill, because he was not in employment for the full 13 weeks during that period of one year, he will be disqualified when applying for benefits. If the Minister were to accept my amendment that could not happen. That period of time, the nine months or the subsequent period, will be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether or not the applicant had 13 weeks&#x2019; employment during the period of 12 months prior to the application. <span class="col_4775-4776" refersTo="page_1014"/>I think it is one of the provisions in respect of which this amendment seeks to lessen the effect of the Minister&#x2019;s Bill, and I am hoping that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>We find Clause 3, as it is, objectionable practically in every particular, and I want to deal with a point that I made in passing when we debated this question before, viz. the effect that particularly sub-paragraph (m) will have in respect of workers who have been in employment for a considerable number of years. I would say that, over a period of ten years, a contributor would be able to build up quite considerable credits, and over that period not being unemployed at all. Then, due to facts outside of his control (the unemployment position being as it is to-day as an illustration), that person becomes unemployed and does qualify and does receive benefits for the maximum of 26 weeks. For the next six months the Department of Labour is unable to obtain employment for him and, in terms of subparagraph (m), he then will not be able to get a subsequent period of benefits because he has not been in employment for 13 weeks during the preceding 12 months. It is true that the hon. the Minister has the power to review such a case, but it is a limited power. He can only exercise that power if, in the opinion of the Minister, there is considerable unemployment, and I think that if this new sub-clause (m) becomes a permanent part of the Act it may lead to the following situation: The degree of unemployment can be considerably reduced to a point where the hon. the Minister will not be able to claim that he is operating in respect of a particular applicant, because there is considerable unemployment in that particular trade or industry. Therefore I say to the hon. the Minister that it is quite possible, in terms of this amending Bill, for a person to have the necessary credits which entitles him, as the present Act reads, to more than one period of six months&#x2019; benefits, but because of the limitations placed in the Act by this amending Bill, he will not have the necessary qualifying period of 13 weeks in that particular second year. I say to the hon. the Minister: Is it reasonable for a contributor who has the necessary credits, who is unable to obtain employment, and where the Department has failed to get employment for him, is it fair that he should now be deprived of the credits which he has built up over a long period of years? This particular contributor may not be a sick person at all&#x2014;the other clauses deal with the sick benefits; this is in respect of a person who is willing and able to work but cannot find employment, and because of that we find now that under the provisions which the hon. the Minister is introducing in this Bill, he will deprive him of a second period of unemployment benefits, even though he has the necessary credits. I think that this is a provision which cannot be supported. It surprises me that there are hon. members on the other side of the House who are prepared to support this provision knowing the hardships and the unfairness it imposes upon those contributors who have got the necessary credits, and who are unable to get employment. When we discussed this at an earlier stage, the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) said that I was misinterpreting the position, because I had mentioned a case of this sort in respect of an earlier clause. I did so deliberately to illustrate to the Committee exactly what the Committee is doing by way of this amending Bill, and I think that an opportunity now presents itself to the supporters of this Bill to get up and defend this provision. It is no use claiming as a defence that the Unemployment Insurance Board, by a majority decision, has supported this measure. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) was good enough to hand me a copy of this amendment this morning and I have had time to study it. I appreciate the reasons which the hon. member has advanced for this amendment, but I don&#x2019;t think that this amendment will achieve what he has in mind. I should like to point out to the hon. member that a period of unemployment is only deemed to have commenced when the contributor applies for benefits under the Act. If this contributor to whom the hon. member refers applies for benefits after his return from military service, his unemployment commences then, when he makes his application, and it is quite purposeless, I think, to provide in the Act that he shall not be regarded as having been unemployed during the period in which, as the Act now stands, he is not regarded as being unemployed. In other words, the period of his military service of nine months is simply a suspension of his employment, it is not regarded as being a period of unemployment. As I say, I assume that what the hon. member is seeking to ensure is that this person will not be penalized, and that this contributor who is compelled to undergo military service for the period of nine months, under the Defence Act, will not be penalized by the fact that he does not contribute during that period of nine months to the Fund. The hon. member fears that if it is possible that he may fail to qualify for benefits on completion of his military service by reason of this new subparagraph (m).</p>

<p>As I have said, the case which the hon. member has made seems to me to be <i>prima facie</i> reasonable, but I think hon. members will realize that I will have to consult the authorities on the effect of such an amendment, and also whether such an amendment is indeed necessary as the Act now stands. I am prepared to consult the authorities. As a matter of fact, I have already done so. I have this morning put in train a request to the Unemployment Insurance Board to go into this question because I do regard it as important, and if it should be necessary to insert an amendment in respect of paragraph (m), I will undertake to do so in the Other Place. But it is a highly technical matter, and I want <span class="col_4777-4778" refersTo="page_1015"/>to be quite certain that an amendment is necessary.</p>

<p>The hon. member has returned now to the effect of the new paragraph (m) of Clause 3 (b). Mr. Chairman, may I point out to the Committee that under Section 39 (3) of the Act, the right to a benefit may be extended, and the effect therefore is that a genuine workseeker who remains unemployed can draw benefits for a continuous period of 12 months provided he has the necessary credits. I think hon. members will agree with me that he can hardly be regarded as being temporarily unemployed (that is after the period of 12 months), and to continue paying benefits would transform the Fund into a charitable institution. When a man has been continuously unemployed for 12 months, the presumption, I think, arises that he is no longer in the labour market, and in order to qualify for benefits in terms of this amendment, he must work in some capacity or other, not necessarily as a contributor, for a total of 13 weeks. I think that is quite reasonable. This period that he has to work need not be continuous. I submit that this is a reasonable requirement. I should like to give hon. members some examples of countries where a much more drastic provision applies, and I am referring to certain Western countries where similar legislation has been passed. I have taken these examples from a United States government publication called &#x201C;Social Security Programmes Throughout the World&#x201D;. It is dated 1961, and in each case the reference is to the qualifications before any unemployment benefits can be drawn. In Austria there must be 20 weeks&#x2019; coverage for the last 12 months. In Belgium 150 days for the last ten months; in Canada 30 weeks for the last two years; Denmark 26 weeks&#x2019; employment for the last 18 months: France 150 days&#x2019; paid employment for the last year; Greece 125 days&#x2019; insured employment for the last 12 months; Italy one year&#x2019;s contributions for the last two years; Japan six months&#x2019; insurance for the last 12 months; the Netherlands, 78 days&#x2019; employment for the last 12 months; Norway, 30 weeks&#x2019; insurance for the last year, or 45 weeks&#x2019; insurance for the last three years; Sweden, 20 weeks&#x2019; employment for the last 12 months; Switzerland, 150 days&#x2019; employment for the last 365 days.</p>

<p>May I put a question? In all these countries quoted by the hon. the Minister, do they have a system of building up credits?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the same system of building up credits.</p>

<p>I think I also ought to deal with the question raised by the hon. member in regard to the building up of credits. The case he makes is that a person should not be penalized if he has built up certain credits and is entitled to use those credits. I think it necessary to remind the Committee that during a period of only six months&#x2019; unemployment a worker may draw many times the amount of his contributions. I think the hon. member will concede that. The Fund therefore is not indebted to him. On the contrary, he benefits from contributions made by his fellow-workers and the employers and the State. I can see nothing wrong myself with the principle that there should be a minimum drain on the Fund. I would also like to give the Committee an example of amounts drawn by workers in all groups if they are continuously unemployed for six months and the equivalent period during which contributions would have to be paid to equal that amount. I exclude the contributions of employers and the State. I think these examples are quite illuminating. I am taking the Groups I to XI. In Group I a contributor&#x2019;s six months&#x2019; benefits amount to R63.70 and the time which would be required to equal the worker&#x2019;s contributions to that amount would be 122 years.</p>

<p>Yes, but I am giving these examples to show what time it will take him to build up the credits which actually he receives if he is six months unemployed. In Group I, unemployed for six months, it would take him 122 years to build up that amount he receives in benefits, viz. R63.70. In Group II: Six months&#x2019; benefits amounts to R91 and it would take a contributor 87 years to build up that amount of credit; Group III: R118; 76 years. I am showing this to meet the argument that if a man pays into the Fund, he is entitled to receive out of the Fund what he has paid into the Fund. In other words, it is not an insurance fund, but a benefit fund, according to that argument.</p>

<p>Group IV: R145; it would take him 70 years; Group V: R172; 66 years. It is not necessary to go through the whole list. In the last Group XII, the benefits in six months would be R364 and it would take him 58 years. It will therefore be seen that workers will have to contribute for a lifetime and in some cases longer before they can claim to have contributed more than the benefits to which they would become entitled during only six months&#x2019; unemployment. These are the figures which I think <span class="col_4779-4780" refersTo="page_1016"/>amply illustrate the case against the contention that this is a charitable fund, a benefit fund. It is in fact an insurance fund to which all workers contribute. If a man has contributed for a long period and he has not been in a position to draw benefits, his fellow-workers have been able to draw benefits. That is the whole principle of the Fund.</p>

<p>I am simply saying what the principle of the Fund is.

<speech by="#durrant">

<p>I cannot understand the approach of the hon. the Minister in regard to this Bill. The hon. the Minister concluded his speech by saying that this is an insurance fund for the workers. So it is. But the Minister preceded that by saying that it is unreasonable that a man should get the benefits on the basis of his contributions because, if, for instance, in Group I he were to get benefits for six months, he would have to work 123 years to build up sufficient credits, etc. The hon. the Minister, by the same logic, wishing to argue now, can say that, because we oppose this clause, we must automatically support what the hon. the Minister says, viz. that workers should contribute to the fund at the same rate at which they are going to draw benefits from the fund. I don&#x2019;t appreciate the hon. Minister&#x2019;s logic at all. I cannot see what points he makes. If it is an insurance fund, the hon. the Minister can hardly argue that the 768,000 contributors to the fund must, if they wish to draw these benefits, contribute at the same rate a which they are going to get benefits.</p>

Since when? Surely the Minister knows that, in terms of the Act, workers are only entitled to 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits, and if they want the additional six months&#x2019; they have to apply to the Unemployment Insurance Board and, under certain conditions only, can an extension be granted.</p>

<p>The Minister did not say that. Otherwise I would not raise the point. I now come to the other argument of the hon. the Minister. He quoted a long list of countries, ending with Canada, I think, and gave us the number of weeks which workers have to contribute in those countries before they can draw any unemployment insurance benefits from their respective funds. Does the Minister contend that, because of the advanced industrial legislation which has been operating in this country over so many years, legislation which benefits the workers, we must now curtail the benefits which the workers of this country have been receiving? That is a logical conclusion to come to. That is the justification for this legislation which the hon. the Minister offers. I submit to the hon. the Minister that, in spite of his argument as to what workers have to contribute in other countries before they are entitled to benefits, does not do away with the fact that what is being done here is to deprive workers of their own insurance to which they have contributed over a great many years. Nothing can argue that fact away. The Minister is breaking faith with 768,000 contributors to the fund by introducing this provision.</p>

Is the hon. member going to return to Krugersdorp and tell the workers that, because the Government has been unable to find employment for some 32,000 to 33,000 workers, and because that fact is now draining the fund, and because of the short-sighted policies of the Government in the past in respect of this fund, that their benefits are to be reduced so as to prevent the fund from becoming weaker?</p>

<p>The Minister has said that he hopes to effect a saving of some R2,000,000 in this regard. I hope that if the Minister is adamant on this issue, the workers of South Africa will appreciate the manner in which faith has been broken with them in respect of the contributions which they have made to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton). I appreciate the attitude which the hon. the Minister has taken up in regard to this matter and that he is prepared to give it further thought. But I do want to point this out that, had it not been for paragraph (m), the amendment moved by my hon. friend would not have been necessary. I want to put it to the Minister that in the first instance it is not only a question of the nine months&#x2019; training, but the effect is going to be this: that it will affect those men when they are in full employment, when they have fully entered civil life. When they are then called upon to do their further periods of continuous training, they will be the men who are likely to be most affected. If the hon. the Minister will follow me in this argument, I think he will appreciate its significance. The Minister says that a contributor must be in employment for 13 weeks in the 52 weeks preceding the date on which he can draw benefits. Let us take a date to work from. Let us take 1 January 1962. Say the man is in employment for two and a half months, till, say, the middle of March. He is called upon to do a period of continuous training for three months or for three weeks, depending upon the hon. the Minister of Defence. When he returns from that period of service he is told by his former employer that there is no work for him and that he cannot be taken on again. He becomes unemployed. He seeks for work but for the whole of this current year he is out of work. In terms of this amendment that worker will be unable to draw any benefits from the fund to which he may have been contributing formerly for a few years.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not wrong, because that is how it will work in practice. As a result of his military service he may perhaps not be able to work the 13 qualifying weeks within the 52 weeks during which he is out of work. That is the whole point. That is why the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has moved his amendment. The Minister has given no indication that he will take this matter further other than that he will refer it to the authorities. And I hope that when the Unemployment Insurance Board has weighed up this matter they will indicate to the Minister that before this Bill passes its final passage in the Other Place, he should introduce amendments to take care of that situation if he cannot accept the one which has been moved to-day.</p>

<p>In regard to paragraph (c) of this clause, we come up against another diminution of workers&#x2019; rights. The position formerly has been that if a worker in the Groups I to II is offered employment in occupations other than the occupations on which he was originally employed and possibly at a lower rate of pay, he must accept the employment which is offered to him by the Labour Bureau. He has no alternative, otherwise he will not qualify for any benefits. Let me add this, Mr. Chairman, the groups were not raised higher than Group IV because it was intended that artisans should not suffer under the same penalty. They have to get benefits for 13 weeks before the claims officer or the Department can offer them work of an alternative nature at possibly a lower rate of pay than they received before. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I can agree with the hon. the Minister on one point in this particular clause and that is that this is the most important clause in this Bill. One of the reasons why we on this side of the House are opposed to this clause is because it deprives the workers of their rights in regard to the benefits which they have hitherto enjoyed under this Act. The hon. the Minister gave us the number of years that it would take to build up the Fund to meet the amount that is paid out in the form of benefits. I think the hon. the Minister is trying to create an entirely wrong impression in debating this clause. As any person who carries insurance knows, his insurance cover is not based on the amount of premium which he pays, but on the contract which is arrived at. In terms of this Bill a contributor builds up his credits in terms of the Act, namely, one week for every four weeks&#x2019; contributions. It will be one week for every six weeks&#x2019; contributions in future. The worker quite rightly, therefore, expects to be covered in terms of that unemployment insurance. Paragraph (m) which provides that contributor must now be a contributor for another period of 13 weeks or otherwise employed, means that he can only receive those initial 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits provided he has sufficient credit to his name in the Fund. The one point which we have to bear in mind in considering this proviso is that the genuine workseeker is also going to suffer considerably. Perhaps there have been certain abuses in the past <span class="col_4783-4784" refersTo="page_1018"/>and that some steps must be taken to curb that expenditure due to those abuses. We on this side of the House have never condoned any abuses which have taken place under this Act. However, Sir, the danger is that the genuine work-seeker is going to suffer by the implementation of this provision. For instance, Sir, there are men who are genuinely endeavouring to obtain employment, men who have reached their late 40s, men who have substantial commitments to their families, but who are just unable to find employment. These people who have contributed to the Fund over a number of years will now find that at the end of 26 weeks they are unable to qualify for any other benefits until such time as they have contributed for a further period of 13 weeks. It is one of the most difficult predicaments for a man to find himself in, if at the end of that 26 weeks he still has not found employment. A large number of welfare organizations find this to be a very grave problem indeed. Even in terms of the existing Act a number of welfare organizations have found that they had to give assistance to those people during that period of unemployment. The provision which is made for poor relief by the Department of Social Welfare does not meet the demand which is made upon welfare societies and organizations to alleviate the hardships which are suffered by those families whose breadwinner is unemployed. In the last annual report of the Durban Child Welfare Society the question of unemployment and the question of alleviating the hardships which those people suffer, is dealt with. They say that is one of the main causes of concern in the activities of their society. This deals with people who have been drawing unemployment benefits. In some instances they do not qualify for poor relief if they are drawing benefits. The benefits are only sufficient for them to meet their commitments in regard to rent but are not sufficient to meet the demands for food and clothing. It is becoming an unbearable burden on the welfare societies to assist these people. The position will now be further aggravated by the fact that these people will not draw any benefits whatsoever if they do not manage to obtain some other form of employment and so contribute towards the Fund. The Minister&#x2019;s answer to this matter is that they can be referred to the Board and that period can be extended up to 12 months. I will be grateful if the Minister will tell us where that is provided for in the principal Act. The Minister has referred to Section 39 (3) but no mention is made there as to the period of time. It merely states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board may at its discretion authorize the payment of further benefits to a contributor at either full or at such reduced rates for such period as it may deem fit.</block>

<p>During the course of the discussion on this clause we have heard that it is for a period of 12 months. I will be grateful if the hon. the Minister could give us some indication as to what authority the Board has to extend it to 12 months. I feel that the worker is being deprived of those rights which he himself has believed he could enjoy in the event of his becoming unemployed. I think that such a far-reaching provision as that contained in paragraph (m) requires the earnest consideration of this Committee.</p>

<p>The other point is this. I should like the hon. the Minister to give this Committee some clarification on that section of the clause which says &#x201C;unless he has been employed as a contributor or otherwise in employment&#x201D;. I think some clarification is required on the words &#x201C;or otherwise in employment&#x201D;. A person may take some temporary employment where he is not contributing to the Fund at all. If a person is so employed for a period 13 weeks for the 52 weeks immediately preceding any other term of unemployment, will he qualify for a further period of benefits if he has sufficient credits standing to his name? That is one point which I think requires some clarification from the Minister.</p>

<p>We want to receive some safeguard and guarantee from the hon. the Minister in respect of the genuine workseeker who is unable to find employment. To discriminate against all persons as this clause does, means that the genuine workseeker will be at a distinct disadvantage.</p>

<p>Another point in respect of which I should like to have some clarification from the Minister is in connection with the older person, a person who due to his age is unable to find employment and who at the same time could qualify for the old-age pension or for some other social benefit. In terms of this provision such a person can draw benefits for 26 weeks and then apply for an old-age pension. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can give us the assurance that his Department will see to it that such a person who is over the age of 60 in the case of women and over the age of 65 in the case of men, is advised timeously. In other words, at least two months before their 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits have expired so that they can make application to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and so that there will not be a gap between the period when they received benefits and the period when they receive other social benefits. In the time, due to that time gap, which was perhaps unavoidable due to departmental difficulties, those people have experienced a great deal of hardship because there was a period when they had no income whatsoever. I do ask the hon. the Minister to give some consideration to these people. In fact some aged people believe that the contributions which are due to them and which stand to their credit, should continue until such time as that credit has been exhausted. I realize, Sir, that the hon. the Minister will not allow such a set of circumstances to arise but I do hope that he will be able to satisfy us that those people will be timeously advised so that they can apply for other benefits. The provisions as contained in <span class="col_4785-4786" refersTo="page_1019"/>paragraph (m) of this clause mean that the person who is a genuine workseeker is at a disadvantage and I believe that this particular clause is one which should not receive the support of the Committee.</p>

<p>Oh, they are still coming to it. But they have already come to it. They have already made a hullabaloo about it and I want to say this that I really cannot understand why they made such a hullabaloo about this question of short-time. I do not know why they make such a fuss about the question which is raised in Clause 3 (b). They allege that this clause abolishes the scheme in respect of short-time which this Government introduced in 1959, and they object violently to that. If it is true that the entire scheme is being abolished, the hon. Opposition should not object to it. If that were the case they ought to thank the Minister. They ought to raise their hats high to the Minister of Labour because I think this is a concession as far as their standpoint is concerned. The truth of the matter is that they have never been in favour of this scheme in regard to short-time which the National Party Government introduced in 1959. On the contrary, they opposed it violently. They were bitterly opposed to it. They indicated that they wanted nothing to do with it although they are suddenly in favour of it to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. Opposition now tell us that they are going to vote against this clause because it does away with the principle in regard to short-time which was accepted in 1959. I ask you, Sir! Do these people forget what they said on this question of short-time in 1959? If their interpretation of the clause is correct, namely, that it means the abolition of the scheme in regard to short-time and that it means the employers and the employees were subsidized, then the hon. the Minister of Labour is now giving them what they asked for in 1959, namely, that the employers and the employees should not be subsidized from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. That was what they asked for. I want to put this pertinent question to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton): Does he not think he is morally bound to vote for this clause in regard to short-time? I am also going to put this question to the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw): Does he not think he is morally bound to vote for this clause in regard to short-time? I am putting it to them pertinently that they are morally bound to vote for this clause. The words which they themselves uttered in 1959 compel them to vote for it. In the first place I want to quote what the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said, as recorded in Hansard, Vol. 102, col. 8016&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We cannot allow, by way of an amendment of this sort, all of those workers who are in employment and who may become unemployed in the future, to discover in the years that go by that their fund is getting smaller and smaller because of schemes that have been introduced to combat unemployment itself.

<p>I will read further to the hon. member from col. 8019&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The total number of hours may be the same but the payment for those hours will be shared between the fund and the employer. But the profit on those hours will go entirely to the employer. You cannot work it out any other way. And we object to this fund being used to subsidize employers in that way.</block>

<p>In other words, Mr. Chairman, he objected to employers being subsidized and now he is also objecting to employees being subsidized. I now wish to deal with the hon. member for Durban (Point). I also wish to refresh his memory by reading to him what he said in 1959 on that occasion as recorded in Hansard, Vol. 102, col. 8039&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eighty people for whom there is a job will now work only 80 per cent of the time, but they will be paid for full-time. So you are subsidizing people out of the Unemployment Fund, to work short-time for their full wages. You are giving them a holiday at the cost of the Unemployment Fund.</block>

<p>He went on to say the following in col. 8041&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am against subsidizing people to loaf at the cost of the workers of South Africa, and that is what this amounts to. I am against the workers of South Africa having to subsidize people to draw pay for work they are not doing.</block>

<p>That was what they said in 1959. That was how they carried on on this question of short-time.<span class="col_4787-4788" refersTo="page_1020"/>To-day, however, they are objecting to this clause because, according to them, the scheme is being abolished. I say they ought to be grateful. We do not admit, however, Mr. Speaker, that the principle involved in this matter, is being abandoned. The principle is not being abandoned. It will only be applied differently. It follows automatically that if an employer decides to put his employees on short-time or to close his factory, the Unemployment Insurance Fund can be utilized to put them on a basis as though they were working full-time by implementing their wages from the Fund. That does not change the principle, it is only being applied differently. But the Minister must first decide whether circumstances justify that, that is to say whether a real emergency exists which makes it necessary to utilize the Unemployment Insurance Fund for that purpose. The Minister now has this discretionary power and that ought to satisfy the hon. member for Durban (Point) as well, because on a previous occasion he asked the Minister to assume responsibility for these schemes. I want to quote from the same Hansard, col. 8046, where the hon. member for Point said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister wants to put up a scheme like this he should have the courage to say: I am the dictator over every other aspect of labour, and I will take the final decision in this regard, too. Why shift the responsibility? The Minister is not scared of accepting responsibility when he wants power.</block>

<p>You see, Mr. Chairman, the Minister is already assuming responsibility here and they are again objecting to it. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot be taken to task by the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) about what I said in 1959&#x2014;for the simple reason that I was not here in 1959! So I hope that I start with a clean sheet. I want to say to the hon. the Minister in regard to Clause 3 (b) (m) that, if taken in conjunction with 3 (c), it will undoubtedly impose a great deal of hardship, perhaps contrary to the intention of the hon. the Minister. I think we should examine the consequences of this unfortunate combination of sub-sections in this Bill before the impact becomes apparent to those who are affected by it. To argue that a man must take the work which is offered to him, whatever it may be and whenever it is offered to him, is not exactly a reasonable thing to expect the other man to have to do, any more than it is for oneself. There are many cases where a white-collar worker, for example, has made a career of a paricular type of work. It does not follow that only artisans, mechanics or professional men like engineers or lawyers make a career of a particular type of employment. There are people who fall between those categories, people who make a career of the particular work which they have either selected or into which they may have fallen quite accidentally, and from which they have managed to make a reasonable living for some years. I want to refer the Minister to a particular case, because it has been brought to my notice with the request that I should advise the individual concerned as to what the best course will be for him to follow. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will give me some advice which I can take back to the party concerned.</p>

<p>You are hopeful.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am very hopeful. It is the case of a man who, after leaving school, took up employment with a very large firm of furniture distributors. He spent 17 years in the employment of that firm, having started at the very bottom, as it were, and worked his way up until he became one of the senior salesman. It was a very big firm which sold goods throughout the country on hire-purchase. This person attained a position in which he earned a substantial salary; he had a house, a motor-car, and a reasonable holiday period every year, and he was able to maintain a good standard of living. In the course of that employment. Sir, he was able to get married and he had a family, at the time when his difficulty arose, of three children. He came to me last year and said that because he had accepted an offer at a higher salary from a competitive firm, he had left his former employer&#x2014;but after six months with the new firm, having got itself into certain financial difficulties (which in spite of all the prosperity around us, as far as this Chamber is concerned at any rate, still happens to many reputable companies), had to reduce its staff, and it worked out on the customary principle of &#x201C;last in, first out&#x201D;. To come to the point, Sir, this man was discharged. This man was discharged and found himself unemployed, and naturally he went back to his old firm and asked whether he could have back his old job, but they were in much the same position as their competitors, and could not take him on. So he started by joining the queue at the Labour Department Offices in Bree Street, every day. After four months, the only employment that this man could possibly have considered taking, which was offered to him, was the position of superintendent or caretaker of a block of flats, for which he was offered a salary of R60 a month and a free bachelor flat consisting of one room and an entrance hall for himself, his wife and three children. Of course, in the nature of things, he said that this was not the sort of job he could take, and he went back day after day&#x2014;and still did not find employment. Now this has nothing to do with the case theoretically, but his wife has since died and he has many difficulties in regard to the upbringing of his children and the medical expenses arising out of his wife&#x2019;s illness. After seven months, this man has still not been offered the sort of employment that he could reasonably be expected to take, by the Labour Department. I say it is not reasonable for the Minister to say that this man must take any work he is offered. The moment a <span class="col_4789-4790" refersTo="page_1021"/>man takes any sort of employment to keep body and soul together, he is well aware of the fact that he will not be able to work his way up again, and he is not likely to get the employment that he understands. We have heard it said over and over that a man spends the greater part of his life working, and therefore he should do something he enjoys doing and understands. Therefore, to say to a man who has specialized by virtue of his training over many years&#x2014;the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) is vastly amused by all this, and I am sad that he is, because when the shoe pinches the other fellow it can be vastly amusing to see how he struggles along. Here is the case of a man who cannot reasonably be expected to take up any employment offered, particularly if it is something of which he has no experience or which does not suit his earning capacity. To say that in the case of such a person, unless he has been employed as a contributor or otherwise for at least 13 weeks, he cannot draw benefits, is to exclude him immediately even from the benefit of being able to hang on for dear life, with the assistance of charitable organizations which make loans and present gifts and food parcels; while he hangs on in the hope that to-morrow or the day after there will be an opening for him where he can take up employment under conditions which are reasonable in regard to emolument, etc., at least in his opinion. This excludes, regardless of the argument about the Unemployment Insurance Fund having being set up for certain purposes, such a man; and with regard to the argument of the hon. member for Boksburg, whose opinion I respect, it does not meet the argument advanced by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) in moving his amendment. I think there is room here for a further consideration of the matter. This case of hardship. I assure the Minister, is not unique in Johannesburg. I can bring him dozens and scores of such cases, and I believe that the same position would probably be found in the larger urban centres. So, I can only say that I hope the Minister will give due consideration to the arguments advanced up to now and accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, which I support.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It was rather amusing to hear the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) quoting members on this side to try to justify the removal of these privileges of contributors from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Of course, where he went wrong was that he never understood the debate which took place in 1959, otherwise he would not have tried to make capital out of it, or he might have done it much more effectively, but he would not have quoted what we said in 1959 in support of the action now being taken in this clause. What we argued in 1959 was that where there are special circumstances the Consolidated Revenue Fund and not the Unemployment Insurance Fund should be responsible for looking after the interests of workers on short time. We did not argue against the protection of workers. We argued clearly and specifically that the Consolidated Revenue Fund should take care of people in the position dealt with at the time. That was turned down. The Government refused that, and so the Unemployment Insurance Fund became the only refuge for those people. Now the Minister wishes to take away that one source of insurance, but to put nothing in its place. If that hon. member would stand up now and plead that the Consolidated Revenue Fund should take care of that situation, we will back him, but his own Minister will not support him. All the hon. member for Boksburg was doing was to try to make a little cheap political capital. If he was really interested, why did he not point out the hardships which the rest of the clause will cause? But not a word of that. He only dealt with (m). Why did he not deal with the restriction of 13 weeks&#x2019; employment?</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<p>Because you ran away from it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, we are not running away from anything. There is case after case. I had one recently where a man was in hospital for seven months. For six months he drew benefits from the Fund. It took him another two or three months before he was able to get employment. If it had taken him another year to get employment, after being hospitalized, which made it more difficult for him, under this amendment he would have been precluded from any further benefits from the Fund until he again became employed for 13 weeks. In this case he managed to get employment because there were people who helped him, but there are hundreds who do not get employment. What I want to ask the Minister is this. He stated earlier this afternoon that if a person is unemployed for a year you can no longer consider that person as temporarily unemployed. Does he then repudiate the responsibility of his Department to provide employment for a person genuinely seeking but unable to find work? If a person is a genuine work-seeker and reports to the office regularly, and at the same time seeks work on his own behalf, and neither he himself&#x2014;or more often, she herself&#x2014;nor the Department can find work, the Minister says that person is no longer a temporarily unemployed person. If that is the definition, what are the Minister and the Government going to do for that class of person, and I say it is more often a woman than a man, because it is often the woman who has been widowed, who has been left to bring up children and who reaches the age of 45 or 50 and finds herself in competition with younger people who cannot find a job. These people are as unemployed as anyone else. The hon. the Minister washes his hands of them. He says he is not worried about them because they are not temporarily unemployed. What is the Minister going to do for those people in view of their exclusion from the benefits of the <span class="col_4791-4792" refersTo="page_1022"/>Fund to which they contributed? They contributed. That is another point the hon. member for Boksburg forgot about, that the people who are now being cut out from short time as well have come to accept that as part of their benefits, and something once given cannot be taken away again. &#x201C;Iets gegeven en dan genomen is erger as een dief gestolen.&#x201D; Once you have given a benefit and you take it away, you are doing harm to a person&#x2019;s rights. Not to give him a benefit is a different matter, but once he has got a privilege, to take it away is an intrusion on his rights. The Minister is taking away existing privileges and he has not told the House nor the workers what he is putting in their place. What action is he, as the person responsible for employment in South Africa, taking to ensure that the people he is now excluding from benefits will not be thrown on to the streets and become dependent on charity? What steps is he taking, if he throws them on to charity, to see that there is some help for them? It is all very well to take away privileges and say it is necessary, but this Government has a responsibility to the contributors to this Fund, a responsibility which extends beyond academic argument. It has a responsibility to see to the welfare of those people, and I ask the Minister to tell the House what he is going to do about that class of person. He has not replied yet to our question: &#x201C;What will he do for that class of person who will become helpless because they have reached an age where they cannot easily find work, but who have not yet reached the age where they can get their old age pension, that group from 50 to 65?&#x201D;&#x2014;not unemployable, not &#x201C;won&#x2019;t-works&#x201D;, but people who want to work and who can work, but for whom work cannot be found. The Minister is excluding them by this amendment, after the initial 26 weeks, or in exceptional cases an extended time, and he is making no other provision for them.</p>

<p>A matter which is evidently not fully appreciated by the Opposition in regard to this limitation is the fact that although a limitation is being introduced here, as provided in (m). a person who is so deleteriously affected as was put by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), will in fact have the right in terms of Section 39 (3) to appeal to the Unemployment Insurance Board. If it appears that a person has used up his benefits, and he falls in this class where he no longer qualifies in terms of this clause, he can make representations firstly to his local Unemployment Committee, on which his trade union representative is represented, and in terms of Section 39 (3) that Committee can then submit a report to the Unemployment Insurance Board and the Board can then grant extended benefits to the person who is now affected by this new provision. But not only that.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I quite concede that. These are not normal cases. Surely the hon. member did not mention normal cases; he mentioned extreme cases. We are not trying to apologize for not fighting for these people, because the benefits granted here were introduced by this Government and not by the United Party. Therefore, we have nothing to apologize about. It is because we, who introduced these benefits, now experience that there are abuses that restrictions are being imposed, and now we say that if these restrictions affect individuals as much as hon. members opposite say, then those persons have the right to be considered by the Insurance Board, and then their benefits can be extended. That is the reply to various pleas made here. But I want to emphasize that the workers&#x2019; organizations to a large extent support this restriction. I stated the other day, and I do not want to repeat it, that these are the original recommendations of the Unemployment Insurance Board. But what is important is that after all the fuss that was made, as the result of the agitation of hon. members opposite and the T.U.C., the Minister referred the whole matter back to the Unemployment Board, and at that meeting, when they again had to consider the whole matter, eight of the representatives voted for this clause, which they had originally approved of. Two members, the T.U.C. members, voted against it, because they said beforehand that they had now received a mandate from the T.U.C. to vote against every amendment. Now, what value can this Government attach to such arguments? But my point is that after this furore&#x2014;and it was a big one, because restrictions are not popular and therefore it is easy for the Opposition to kick up a row, but if they take pleasure in it they must do so. But the true fact is that the workers&#x2019; representatives on the Board again soberly considered the matter, in the light of the agitation of the United Party and the T.U.C., and decided by eight votes to two that the restrictions as they are now are sound and essential.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not listen attentively. I said that what was significant was that when the matter was put to them again, with the exception of the two T.U.C. members who had a mandate to vote against everything, however good it might be, because it came from this Government, the trade union representatives voted in favour. Therefore there were eight votes in favour of this clause and only the two T.U.C. members voted against it. Therefore the Government is not afraid of going to the workers with this matter, because here we are doing something which was considered by them in the first place, and which was <span class="col_4793-4794" refersTo="page_1023"/>reconsidered by them in the light of all the agitation, and which they nevertheless regarded as essential. Therefore the Government feels that what it is doing here may perhaps be unpopular in certain circles, and it may afford the Opposition an opportunity to make a furore, but we are taking a responsible step for the protection of the fund, and therefore it is also in the interest of the <i>bona fide</i> workers.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), I want the Minister, when he considers this amendment, for the protection of the rights of the trainees who are called up for military service, to consider those who have to apply for unemployment insurance benefits while undergoing training. The hon. the Minister mentioned that unemployment would only count from the time when the applications are made, and therefore people who are undergoing the three months&#x2019; training will only virtually become unemployed at the end of that three months. Now it is possible, especially in the case of the young married trainee who is called up during his period of unemployment, that he may have to call upon the fund for assistance during his period of training, and therefore it will virtually make him an unemployed person from the time he makes his first application for help. That naturally would diminish the period that he would have to put to his credit. I would like the Minister to consider that point very carefully before he comes to a final decision about how best to help the military trainee.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister explained to us in great detail, and gave examples, how other countries protect their funds, and he ended up by saying that this was not a benefit fund. Sir, this is an unemployment insurance fund. It is a collective effort by the workers, and when the worker contributes towards a fund he is not only contributing for his own sake but knows quite well that the fund will be used to help those unfortunate people who are out of work; and when people are out of work it is not measured immediately by the days or weeks they are out of work. How is one to determine beforehand how long a person will be out of work? How will this Minister determine this? Any of us here to-day may fall out of work and not find work again for the next two or three years. I think the Minister should be the last person to condemn those people who are out of work for a period longer than is here specified and to consider them as chronic unemployables.</p>

<p>The position for young people is bad enough, but for those over 40 and going on to their 50s it becomes more difficult to find work, and they want to find work. These people whom we have heard so much about from the opposite side who abuse the fund are not so many, and it is quite a simple matter for the Labour Bureau to find out who those are who do not want to work. It is for those people that there should be special boards to investigate their cases, and not for the <i>bona fide</i> workers. He should not have to go before a board and testify to the fact that he is unemployed. The boot is on the other foot. It is the man who is suspected of abusing the fund who should be called to book and should be investigated, and the the <i>bona fide</i> workseeker. We all know that the <i>bona fide</i> workseeker is a man who goes to look for work on his own, and also goes to the Labour office to look for work, so there is no doubt about him. But the Minister by this clause is penalizing that <i>bona fide</i> worker and I say that it is unjust for us to put that man in the same position as the one who does not want to work.</p>

<p>We come to the position of those people who will be offered work after a period of unemployment and cannot take the work, even though they would like to. It is difficult for a person not used to doing manual work to do manual labour when he is in his 50s or 60s. What about the liftman who may be partially incapacitated and falls out of work and goes regularly to the unemployment office to look for work? He may be told that there is a job which entails manual labour. He may not be able to do it. Will he be penalized for it, or what provision has the Minister made to exclude him from the penalties that go with this amending clause? There is nothing to save these people. All that will happen is that the man will try to do the work, which he may or may not be able to do, and if he fails to do it he will have to become unemployed again, and this goes on until the impression is given to the Labour Bureau that he is a man who does not want to work, that he is a &#x201C;won&#x2019;t-work&#x201D;. But he is not a &#x201C;won&#x2019;t-work&#x2019;; he cannot work. It is a slur on these people when hon. members opposite refer to these people, even jokingly, as &#x201C;hoboes&#x201D;. These people will require every bit of assistance that it is possible to give, and I can tell the Minister that the Unemployment Fund is not sufficient to keep these people going; to keep a family. Far from it. These people still have to find ways and means of augmenting their income. The wives go out to work. They do part-time work. I know of cases where the wives do night-work as waitresses to earn a few shillings. They become caretakers of cloakrooms. They do all kinds of work just to get in a few more shillings every day to implement the money that comes from the fund. It is not a great gift that we give them, although these people are all grateful for what they do get. So I say to the Minister that whatever he does he should not penalize the people who are entitled to get money from the fund, but if he is going to penalize anyone, penalize those who are abusing the fund. Find out who they are. Find out who the &#x201C;won&#x2019;t-works&#x201D; are and who the swindlers are and penalize them and bring them to book, and let them be interrogated by the Labour Department, but not the genuine work-seeker.</p>

<from><span class="col_4795-4796" refersTo="page_1024"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>In view of what the Minister has said about the amendment I moved earlier on, I think it would perhaps be unwise for me to leave the amendment before the Committee. I will withdraw the amendment and accept the assurance given by the Minister that he will get legal opinion and also advice from the Board, to investigate the real difficulty that this clause possesses in respect of those undergoing military service.</p>

<p>First of all, I want to reply to the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) and refer him to that same Hansard from which he quoted, and he will discover that the whole of our objections to the utilization of this fund for the purpose of combating unemployment was that we said that the fund to be used for that purpose should not be the Unemployment Insurance Fund, but rather the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That was the basis of our whole attack on the principle of introducing schemes to combat unemployment. The Deputy Minister has entered this debate and tried to justify sub-paragraph (m) by quoting Section 39 (3). It is as well that we should know what we are talking about. Section 39 (3) says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No benefits shall be paid to a contributor for more than 26 weeks in any financial year or in any period of 52 consecutive weeks.</block>

<p>That means that the application that has been made is in respect of an applicant who has already had benefits for 26 weeks and he wants an extension of the 26 weeks in that year. That is not what we are dealing with. I think the Deputy Minister will appreciate that is not the problem that (m) presents to this Committee. We are dealing with the problem of the man who wants to get benefits in a second period after he has had the first six months in one year; there is a delay of six months and then he applies for the second period of six months. We are not dealing with the case that the Minister has quoted here. That is entirely erroneous and misleading to this Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But do you not appreciate the possibility of the extension?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>The possibility of an extension on an application for additional benefits over and above 26 weeks in one year is not the issue here. We are not interfering with that. We are dealing with the question of an application for a second period of six months&#x2019; benefits with a six months&#x2019; break in between. That is the case that we are dealing with, and that application does not fall within the terms of sub-section (3), because in terms of the present Act the applicant has not got to go to the board; he is entitled to that second period; he has not got to get the Board&#x2019;s consent or anybody else&#x2019;s consent; he is entitled to it, and it is because he is entitled to it that we are objecting to sub-paragraph (m), which takes away that right. Now we come to the other question, and this is important too. Section 39 (2)<i>bis</i> says that the benefits which may be paid to a contributor shall not exceed one week&#x2019;s benefits for each completed four weeks of employment as a contributor. Here we have the case where there is a limitation placed upon the benefits which a contributor may get; he cannot get benefits if he has not got credits; therefore we say to the Minister that the importance of (m) does not lie in the fact that the applicant is applying for something to which he is not entitled. He is applying for benefits in view of the fact that he has the necessary credits to entitle him to consideration in terms of Section 39 (2)<i>bis.</i></p>

<p>I next want to take the point that the Minister has raised in connection with the benefits received in comparison with the contributions paid. Let us take the extreme example to see how dangerous it is to import a provision of this sort into the Bill. The Minister has said that it is possible for a person to gain considerably more in benefits which he will receive in six months than he has paid into the Fund. This amendment is not going to stop that. Let me take an extreme case, the case of a contributor who has the necessary credits, and I must emphasize that all along the line&#x2014;a contributor who has the necessary credits. If in any one year he worked for 13 weeks in terms of this amendment he will be entitled to six months&#x2019; benefits. If he only worked for 12 weeks in the year he will not be entitled to those benefits. You will see how ridiculous the position becomes. A man who works for 13 weeks over a period of years will get six months&#x2019; benefits provided as long as he has those credits, but the individual who only works for 12 weeks will get precisely nothing, even although he has the credits. I say that once you depart from the principle that as long as a person has credits he should get benefits, you run into these ridiculous anomalies, and I say to the Minister that we are now departing from a reasonable proposition and adopting one which is most unreasonable. The reasonable proposition is that as long as a man has credits he should be entitled to benefits. But it is unreasonable when you say to one man, &#x201C;You can have six months&#x2019; benefits because you worked for 13 weeks in that particular year,&#x201D; while saying to the other man, &#x201C;You cannot have benefits because you have only worked 12 weeks,&#x201D; when they both have the necessary credits. In opposing (m) we do so because it is depriving contributors, who have the necessary credits, of benefits. That is the basis of our argument, and for the Deputy Minister to talk about the provisions of Section 39 (3) is misleading.</p>

<p>When his credit is exhausted an extension of benefits can be granted only with the approval of the Board and the Minister. But it takes a comparatively long time to exhaust the credit, and if a person has exhausted all his credit and has still not obtained work then hon. members should not come and tell me that the Fund must just continue granting him benefits indefinitely.

<p>In other words, the benefits then remain limited. When his credits are exhausted, you cannot expect the Fund to provide for him further. But the point I want to emphasize is that when the man has exhausted his credits and during that time he has not been able to find employment, there is some or other serious reason for it. There can be many reasons for it. The reason may perhaps be that this man has become physically incapacitated, because even though he is 50 or 60 years old, if he could still do a day&#x2019;s work when he was last dismissed, in other words, if his employer had nothing against him, he would again find work. But if that person happens to be one of those who because of age or physical incapacity, or for some other reason, can no longer find work, it is obvious that the Fund cannot continue for an unlimited period paying benefits to him. Then it is no longer the function of the Fund to care for that man and his family. Then he must be cared for by other bodies; it then becomes the function of the Department of Labour to find sheltered employment for him. But one cannot expect that person under those circumstances continuously to receive benefits from the Fund. But supposing, Mr. Chairman, one accedes to the request of those hon. members, surely one would be playing into the hands of a type of person who perhaps does not exist to-day, the type who will simply remain unemployed as long as he can, as long as he is allowed to remain unemployed.</p>

I repeat that whilst it is such a small number, and whilst that number will increase if one grants the protection now asked for by hon. members opposite, one will find that there will be a number of people who will always just be on the <i>que vive</i> to exploit the Fund in a dishonest manner.

<p>I would just like to reply to one or two points made by the hon. members for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) and Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), in regard to the interpretation of Section 39 (3). The hon. member for Umbilo raised the question that the proviso does not specify the period of the extension which can be granted. That is correct. There is no period specified, but it is a period, of course, which is completely in the discretion of the Board, and in practice the period has been and still is from three to six months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>That is on application.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana makes the point, in interpreting this proviso, that sub-paragraph (m) takes away any benefit that might accrue to a contributor, to which he may have been entitled by virtue of this proviso. As I read the proviso, I would say that it applies to any application for any benefit; in other words, it is wide enough to include any application that a contributor may make by virtue of subparagraph (m). May I just read it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No benefit shall be paid to a contributor for more than 26 weeks in any financial year or in any period of 52 consecutive weeks, provided that any application for benefits rejected by the claims officer in terms of this sub-section shall, together with his report on the surrounding circumstances, be referred to the committee concerned, which shall refer it to the board, and the board may in its discretion authorize the payment of further benefit to that contributor at either full or such reduced rates and for such period as it may deem fit.</block>

<p>In other words, my interpretation of this proviso is that there is a complete and full discretion vested in the board. It seems to me that there is this full discretion vested in the board. When applications for an extension of benefits are made to the claims officers and they are not granted, then this appeal goes to the board and the board has a complete and absolute discretion to grant an extension and to grant further benefits which, as I have stated, will be for a period from three to six months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Irrespective of credits?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>That is my interpretation of the proviso. I do not think the hon. member need be afraid of the restrictive provisions, as he sees it, in this proviso.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo also raised a question which I think I should answer in regard to the meaning in sub-paragraph (m) of the words, &#x201C;or otherwise in employment&#x201D;. Sub-paragraph (m) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless he has been employed as a contributor or otherwise in employment&#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member raises the question as to what the sub-paragraph means by &#x201C;or otherwise in employment These words were added to cover the case where a contributor takes employment in an area which is exempted from the Act, or where he takes employment with a firm which has a pension fund which is also exempted. That is the reason for those words.</p>

<p><span class="col_4801-4802" refersTo="page_1027"/>Then the hon. member for Umbilo also asked what provision exists for the old-age pensioner who has built up credits. My reply there is that provided the old-age pensioners are capable of and available for work, as required by the Act, they must register for employment and apply for benefits. As the hon. member knows there is no means test and subject to the above requirements they will be entitled to benefits. The Act itself does not at present prescribe any age limit, and any person who has contributed to the Fund and who is capable of and available for work of any nature may receive benefits, even though on account of his age he can hardly be recognized as being in the labour market. He himself may not seriously be contemplating taking employment. As the result of this the Fund is called upon to pay benefits to old-age pensioners and others who are unlikely ever to work again. That is the reason why this provision has been inserted.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) and Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) raised the question of the suitability of employment which is offered to a person who is unemployed. I think the hon. member for Rosettenville quoted a case of a liftman who becomes unemployed and who makes application and is offered some work of a physical kind which he obviously cannot perform. I would like to point out to these hon. members that a contributor is entitled to refuse an offer of employment if it is not suitable work as defined. If the hon. member will look at the Act, he will see that suitable work is defined. If suitable work is not offered to him he is entitled to refuse it. In the case of the contributor in Groups I to III inclusive, suitable work is any work which the contributor is physically capable of performing and which will not cause undue hardship and for which the wage payable is not less than the benefits. In the case of the other groups it reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the first 13 weeks of unemployment, work of a similar class and in the same group as the contributor ordinarily undertakes, and thereafter as in the case of Groups I, II and IV.</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The intention of this section is to protect the artisans. It has, however, been found that a large number of factory workers fall outside the first three groups, and there is the tendency for many of them to take advantage of the provision and to refuse offers of reasonable alternative work, and in order to combat this mischief, it is proposed to amend the existing section by reducing the period from 13 to six weeks in the case of contributors in Groups IV and V. In the case of Groups VI to XII, employees often have good reason for not changing from one industry to another because of the various privileges they enjoy such as sick benefits, holidays and provident funds. The hon. member will see therefore that the question of suitable work is clearly defined in the Act, and obviously if a person is not capable of performing the work which is offered, due to some physical or other defect, he is not forced to accept that work. I think that meets the case made by the hon. members for Hospital and Rosettenville.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I wish that I was in a position to agree with the Minister&#x2019;s interpretation of Section 39 (3). Because it is so important, I think we should get complete clarity on this issue. Section 39 (3) refers to an application in respect of which the applicant has asked for benefits in excess of the 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits which he has just enjoyed. It clearly states that no benefit shall be paid to a contributor for more than 26 weeks in any financial year or in any period of 52 consecutive weeks, and then follows the proviso. The proviso says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any application for benefits rejected by the claims officer in terms of this subsection.&#x2026;</block>

<p>It is the words &#x201C;in terms of this sub-section&#x201D; which present the difficulty, because, in terms of this sub-section, the applicant is restricted in his claim in the way that, if he puts in a claim for something outside of this sub-section, which would be the case if he submitted a claim because of the restrictive effects of the new sub-paragraph (m), the claims officer would rule him out; he would say: &#x201C;No, you cannot put in a claim in respect of the new (m); the claim is restricted by the wording of Section 39 (3), which says that no benefit shall be paid to a contributor for more than 26 weeks in any financial year, or in any period of 52 consecutive weeks&#x201D;. I think the Minister will agree that the words &#x201C;this sub-section&#x201D; refer to the portion of the clause which I have just read out; it cannot have any other meaning, and, that being the case, I think that the Minister is not right in saying that an application for extended benefits, as the result of the prohibition of this new sub-paragraph (m), will succeed. I think it must fail, because that particular application asks for benefits not in respect of one year, but in respect of a second year. That is the point, and that is our whole argument. But I will go further in support of my argument and refer the Minister to Section 39 (3)<i>bis.</i> I will agree with the hon. the Minister that the case that he has made out will apply if the conditions as set out in 39<i>bis</i> (a) apply. Here it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever the Minister is of the opinion that in any area the extent of unemployment in any business is such that a state of emergency exists, he may, after consultation with the Board and by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> suspend for such period and on such conditions, exceptions and exclusions as may be specified in the notice, either wholly or in part the operation of the provisions of subsection (2)<i>bis</i> or (3).</block>

<p><span class="col_4803-4804" refersTo="page_1028"/>Now the Minister claims that there can be a consideration by the Board in respect of applications in terms of (m). That would be right if he were to give such instructions in terms of 39<i>bis,</i> when it can be claimed that there is excessive unemployment in a particular industry. Only in that case it could apply. Our case to the Minister is that, because he is changing the emphasis from &#x201C;credits&#x201D; to a qualifying period of 13 weeks in a year, he is destroying the basis of the provision. That is our case to the Minister.</p>

<p>I would say that the correct fact is that a majority of members of the Board were in favour, but the point I want to make is that, immediately when the Minister introduced this Bill, the responsibility of the Board disappeared, and it then became a Bill introduced by this Government, and the Minister must accept full responsibility for it. They cannot hide behind the Board. The Government are now putting forward amendments to the Act which destroy the basis on which benefits were paid in terms of the present Act. Benefits were paid provided an applicant had credits, and now the emphasis is on &#x201C;provided the applicant has had 13 weeks&#x2019; employment in a particular year&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Because it is an insurance fund.</p>

<p>Because it is an insurance fund under which the beneficiaries were led to expect that, providing they had the credits, they would get certain benefits. Now the Minister comes along and says: &#x201C;No, even if you have certain credits, that is not enough, you must have been in employment for 13 weeks in the year preceding the period of unemployment.&#x201D; That is our disagreement with the Minister. We say that this is an abuse, because the original Act, the Act as it is now, laid emphasis on the question of having credits. Section 39 (2)<i>bis</i> makes that abundantly clear where it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The benefits which may be paid to a contributor shall not exceed one week&#x2019;s benefits for each completed four weeks&#x2019; employment as a contributor.</block>

<p>That is the basis. As long as they have got those credits, and they are built up over the years, they are entitled in terms of the present Act to certain benefits, and the benefits they are entitled to are 26 weeks of unemployment benefits in a year.

<p>He cannot get it if the application is based on 39 (3). He has already had 26 weeks, and now he applies for a further period, and the Board can consider that. But we are referring to the man who has had 26 weeks. He has been unemployed for a further 26 weeks, and he now applies for an extended period, and that cannot be referred to the Board now, because it is not in terms of this particular sub-section (3), because sub-section (3) says: &#x201C;An extension of the period of 26 weeks in a year.&#x201D; That year has passed. He has had the benefits for that year, and if he applies for further benefits in that year, the Board can deal with that. But we are dealing with the case where the person has had 26 weeks in the year. He does not apply for extra benefits in addition to the 26 weeks in that particular year, but he wishes to apply in respect of a subsequent year, where, during the interval, he has not got the qualifying 13 weeks of employment. There is no provision for the Board to deal with that case. Only the Minister can deal with it if in a particular industry, in terms of 39<i>bis,</i> there is exceptional unemployment.

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) said this afternoon that he wants me to get up to defend-this matter that we are now paying benefits to the workers only in any year in which the worker has worked for 13 weeks. I say that this provision is drastic, but I am quite prepared to say that I am convinced that the Department and its officials will apply this provision, as they did in the past, with the necessary cautiousness and good spirit towards the workers. Hon. members cannot prove the contrary here. We know that the officials of the Department in the past applied this Act with the greatest care and goodwill towards <span class="col_4805-4806" refersTo="page_1029"/>the workers. In other words, if one takes into consideration that this provision which is now being inserted will affect only exceptional cases, then one gets the right perspective. I accept that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement is correct in regard to Section 39 (3), viz that the Unemployment Insurance Board on the recommendation of the local committee can extend the period, even when it comes to the second period and the applicant has not obtained work yet, and I accept that in such cases the Board can grant it, so that benefits may be paid for further periods.</p>

<p>Of course, as long as there is credit. One cannot pay benefits to a contributor who has no credits. That was so under the old Act also. Therefore I must say that I feel that hon. members opposite are simply dragging in the exceptional cases as the basis for their objection to this clause. I am convinced that this party and the Government and the Minister, as they did in the past, will apply this Act with the greatest care. The members opposite regard themselves as the alternative Government and they are evidently afraid of what will happen when they come into power and have their own Minister of Labour. Of course, they will never get into power, but evidently they are afraid of themselves. I am convinced that the other provisions of the Act will also be applied with the greatest sympathy. We know how sympathetic the Government was during the recent period of unemployment and how it tried to cope with those problems in various ways, and I do not think the objections of those hon. members are valid. They are thinking only of exceptional cases. Only when there is large-scale unemployment will it happen that people will be unemployed for longer than a year if they are actually <i>bona fide</i> work-seekers and are still available to the labour market. Otherwise an emergency may arise, and for that the Act makes provision. I am quite satisfied in my mind in regard to this matter. The same care and goodwill will be applied as in the past in regard to this Act, and then the workers cannot suffer hardship. I am convinced that the workers are sufficiently protected by the Insurance Board on which they themselves are represented. I simply cannot believe that the Unemployment Insurance Board will not act carefully when applying this provision. Of course, as the hon. the Minister has said, the people who are chronically ill or who are no longer in the labour market, and who therefore are not <i>bona fide</i> workers, cannot expect benefits from this fund.</p>

<p>I have been trying to understand the hon. Minister&#x2019;s interpretation that this provision includes a discretionary right as far as the 13 weeks&#x2019; employment is concerned. Does not this new sub-section cut out the discretionary right if the worker has not been in employment for his 13 weeks?</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is what I am trying to find out. It seems to me that we can perhaps come to some happy mean of agreement about this question. I can quite understand the difficulties as far as the utilization of the Unemployment Fund for purposes other than for which it was originally intended are concerned. I realize the difficulty of using this Fund as a sort of additional old age pension fund and as additional assistance for people who are incapacitated. Obviously the Fund could not exist very long if it were used for these purposes. But at the same time it is no good the hon. the Minister saying that something else must be done for these people, &#x201C;by Social Welfare, I suppose,&#x201D; and particularly is it no good the hon. the Minister using such expressions when up to now the workers have been contributing towards this fund on the definite understanding that they will be able to get certain benefits from it. I think that a very relevant point has been made by he hon. member for Umhlatuzana to the effect that people paid into the Fund under certain conditions and that they are surely entitled to benefits under those conditions. I want to read to the hon. the Minister a letter that I have received from a woman, and I cannot believe in any way that she is an exceptional case; I think she must represent quite a substantial proportion of workers who are reaching retirement age, but who are not old in terms of old-age pensions, and who are certainly not people who are unemployable, as the hon. member there called it, because these are people who have been in employment for many years and whose main object is to continue to maintain themselves at a decent standard of living. She writes to me as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am writing to beg you to do something about opposing the New Unemployment Insurance Bill. Several women in our office are widows and due to retire in the near future. We now find that the new Bill will adversely affect us. We have paid into the Fund since its inception, I believe in 1947, and until now have been able to get a fair amount of unemployment money after being retired, provided of course that the Unemployment Board was unable to find reemployment for us. That apparently has now all gone by the Board; we are going to be very badly hit by this as we have relied on it in view of the fact that it has been in operation for many years. After being retired on a very small pension, but large enough to prevent any old-age pension being granted, we will get the merest pittance for being unemployed, and the chances of re-employment are very much worse than in previous years.</block>

<p>I want to stop here for a moment, because the <span class="col_4807-4808" refersTo="page_1030"/>hon. member who has just sat down mentioned that such cases of people being unemployed for a year or more are very exceptional, and that could only happen in an emergency, or where the person concerned is no longer capable of being re-employed. But that is not so in these cases. There may be a recession, which would not be an emergency, and people who are quite able to be re-employed, will find themselves in difficulty, particularly if they have reached the retirement age which as far as women are concerned, is certainly not a very great age. So these are not unusual cases and they will not only occur in times of emergency. The writer of this letter goes on to say that she understands that the amending Bill is being designed to give relief in respect of temporary unemployment only, but she asks &#x201C;What about the people too old to get jobs?&#x201D; She says that she does not mean the people falling in the old-age pension category, but people simply too old to find employment because of the competition of younger people who come into the labour market, people with small pensions and nothing else. These people are the ones who have paid into the Funds since its inception, and as she says <i>&#x201C;</i>have never asked for any benefits&#x201D;. That is a very important phrase. These are not people who are relying on the community to see to their welfare. These are not people who sit down and demand that the community looks after them. These are people who have paid into the Fund since its inception and have never demanded any benefits. They are going to be the ones to suffer most by the amendments.</p>

<p>She continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It amounts to this that having paid into the Fund since 1947, one will get no more out of the Fund than others who have only contributed for the shortest qualifying time. Also the older workers who have done all the paying-in are the least likely to find other jobs.</block>

<p>These are the people whom I think deserve special consideration from the hon. the Minister. I appreciate the difficulties and I realize that the Unemployment Insurance Fund is not an old-age pension fund, that it is not a social welfare fund. But nevertheless these people who have been paying into the Funds under certain conditions, and who have always expected to derive certain benefits from the Fund and who have never until they are compulsorily retired asked for benefits, should receive consideration. They are going to suffer most. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has interpreted this clause to mean that the Board has a discretionary right to waive the 13 weeks of employment in the preceding 52 weeks. If that is so, then I can only say that I hope that the Board will use its discretionary right to the greatest possible advantage for these people who have paid into the Fund since its inception, who have never drawn any benefits and who now find themselves cut off from the benefits at a time that they are most in need of such benefits. Some sort of happy mean certainly could be reached by this Committee, either by extending the discretionary right, or perhaps even by setting some age limit, but some other way than ruling out all these people who have contributed for all these years and now find themselves in this difficulty on compulsory retirement.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we know that when you come with specific cases, as the hon. member for Houghton (Mr. Suzman) has done, there is a variety of specific cases which you can mention. I think I should also mention a specific case just to show how misleading it can be if you allow your judgment to be influenced by such cases. One of the cases which appeared before the Unemployment Board was that of an exteacher who had taught, and then retired and received a pension. He then accepted a temporary position as a teacher on the Rand and taught there for a few years and contributed to the Unemployment Fund. When he reached the age of 66 a few years later he no longer wished to remain on the Rand; he resigned and went to Parys on the Vaal River. He arrived there and immediately said that he wanted benefits under the Unemployment Fund because he had contributed to it. He was told to prove in the first instance that he had registered and that he was available for work and that no suitable employment could be found for him. He registered and a month later he wrote to the former Minister of Labour and told him that he was at Parys, that he had registered for work, that he could not obtain employment there in his particular class of occupation, namely, that of a teacher, and he asked the Minister please to forward him his money; he would like to have the full amount immediately as he did not want to keep on going to the office. Against the case mentioned by the hon. member numbers of cases can be mentioned similar to the one I have just mentioned, and unfortunately the Unemployment Board has to deal with many such cases. That is the problem, therefore, that in spite of the sympathy which you have for these unfortunate cases, for these hard cases, it is our duty as Trustees to administer this Fund in such a way that it will continue to exist. If we have to continue on the basis that it is a welfare fund which the United Party wants us to do, in order to make political capital out of it, in what position will we find ourselves? Had they had a sense of responsibility they would never have asked us to do that. We have to decide to-day whether we want to continue to administer the Fund on the basis that it is a welfare fund but if we do continue on that basis the contributions paid by the workers and the employers will have to be increased. We have been told that the workers do not mind paying more. But that is not correct. Their representatives on this very Unemployment Board <span class="col_4809-4810" refersTo="page_1031"/>have said that they were against an increase in the contributions. They asked why the contributions of the <i>bona fide</i> workers should be increased in order to turn this fund into a welfare fund, seeing that it was meant to be an insurance fund? If we were to accede to the pleas and requests to introduce welfare services, either the contributions of the workers and of the employers will have to be increased, something which they do not want at all, or we will have to abolish the maternity grants, the sick benefits and the death benefits which have so far amounted to R32,000,000. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) looks very surprised. I will specify the amounts to him. Since we have been paying maternity grants, an amount of R15,000,000 has already been paid out in that respect, and an amount of R15,000,000 has been paid out in death benefits and since death benefits for dependants have been introduced, an amount of R2,000,000 has been paid out. A total of R32,000,000 has, therefore, been paid out under the measures, call them welfare services if you want to, which the present Government has introduced. If we have to continue with these services on the same basis, with all the abuses which have taken place, we will either have to increase the contributions, or if we do not wish to do that and do not wish to eliminate the abuses either, we will have to do something which is the last thing this Government wishes to do and that is we will have to abolish maternity grants, death benefits and sick benefits. In that case I think we shall be committing a social disservice. If you have to choose between these three, let us call them uncomfortable ways, the soundest way to follow is rather to curtail those abuses. I wish to repeat what the workers have said on their own board. I know the Opposition does not like me to remind them of this so often because they only look to the T.U.C. and whatever the T.U.C. says is Gospel to them and more than that they apparently cannot assimilate. However, I wish to remind them again what the Board as a whole said when it considered this entire question of abuses.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the hon. member does not want to know the facts. He prefers moving about in the darkness and in the dust. I am giving the facts and I hope the rest of his party will appreciate that. When the Unemployment Board considered this aspect they pointed out that there were people, old-age pensioners, who were to-day drawing benefits, as in the case of the ex-teacher which I have mentioned, the man who wrote and said that he was in the pensioners&#x2019; paradise and the Minister must forward the full amount due to him. The Unemployment Board considered that case and said that the class of person who no longer &#x201C;seriously contemplated employment&#x201D; was drawing benefits under the Fund. They considered the matter and came to the following conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board considers that a qualifying period of employment each year in addition to credit should be required.</block>

<p>This was what the Board itself said, what the workers themselves said and in this respect the Government will rather listen to the responsible opinion of the workers and their representatives than to the political agents sitting in the benches opposite.</p>

<p>When we discussed this matter in the course of this whole debate on this clause the hon. the Deputy Minister continually referred to reports and minutes of the Unemployment Insurance Board. All his arguments in support of this Bill are based on the report of the Unemployment Insurance Board. I think it is greatly unfair of the hon. the Minister to quote here to the House a summary of the findings of the Unemployment Insurance Board when the Act requires that report must be tabled in this House for the benefit of all members, so that when we discuss matters of this nature all the relevant information is before us. But the only report that we have of the Unemployment Insurance Board is the report of the Board for 1960 and the observations made by the Secretary for Labour in respect of the discussions of the Unemployment Insurance Board in the Report of 1961.</p>

<p>I can naturally appreciate that the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) is present during this debate and was absent during a former debate. However, we leave the matter there. One naturally appreciates his attempt to participate in this debate and his naural hesitancy about other <span class="col_4811-4812" refersTo="page_1032"/>matters. I come back to this point, Sir. The Minister interjects and says they are the minutes, or a summary of the minutes. In the past the reports of the Board have always contained a summary of their findings and their conclusions. Those were made available to us. We have been able to discuss these matters objectively because we have had those reports. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) admitted today that this would have a drastic effect on the benefits which are payable to workers. The Minister gets up and says it is not really so drastic because the workers&#x2019; representatives have accepted this. What the Minister does not tell us is that the workers&#x2019; representatives were compelled to accept these provisions by a compromise. They were compelled to accept these provisions in preference to the possibility of an increase in the contributions. Why doesn&#x2019;t the Minister tell the House and the country that? We have had previous experience of this sort of thing in the past, Sir, where the Government introduced provisions of this nature and where the Government forced the workers&#x2019; representatives to come to a compromise in order that the workers may get a little. There will now be a diminution of the privileges which they can enjoy as beneficiaries under the Fund and the workers&#x2019; representatives have had to compromise in order that a further load will not be placed on the workers. Why doesn&#x2019;t the Minister tell the House and the country that? Why does the Minister riot come openly and say that? He shields behind the fact that all the workers&#x2019; representatives have accepted this. Why does the Minister not give the facts to the House? The facts are that at the one meeting where this compromise was reached at the workers&#x2019; representatives accepted the Government&#x2019;s proposals but at the second meeting, after the second-reading debate, when the Minister referred these matters to them, the workers&#x2019; representatives objected to them.</p>

<p>It is no good the hon. the Deputy Minister getting uncomfortable and interjecting. The Minister has had ample opportunity of taking part in this debate. When we come to the fundamental privileges which any one of the 768,000 contributors will derive from the Fund, it is no good the Minister referring time and time again&#x2014;I think he has done so on six occasions&#x2014;to the report of the Unemployment Insurance Board. He has never given us the whole story in respect of that matter. There is another aspect in regard to Section 39 (3). The hon. the Minister says that this is really not a hardship which is being inflicted upon the workers because the board will always have the power, irrespective of the period laid down of 13 weeks, to extend the period over which benefits will be paid and dispense with the qualification that a contributor must work for 13 weeks in 52. I have studied this section very well. The only discretionary power which I can find here is in the proviso to Section 39. It is clear that the Board has one discretionary power only and that is that it may extend the period during which benefits are paid to a contributor or it can extend the period where the contributor will receive half the benefits which he would normally have received in other circumstances. In terms of this section the discretionary power is clearly only in one respect and that is in respect of the amount of benefits that may be paid to the employee. The Act is clear in respect of the qualifications which a contributor must have attained before he can receive benefits from the Fund. If we have now reached the position where we say that irrespective of the credits a contributor may have, the Board has the discretionary power as to how to apply this measure, we are making an utter farce of the whole Act. When we think of it that during the last year 94,000 contributors to the Fund received benefits, and that in future, on the Minister&#x2019;s argument, the Board will have the discretionary right and will have to deal with every application on its merits, the administration of the Fund will become utterly impossible. I think the hon. Deputy Minister recognizes that.</p>

<p>When the clock twisted the neck of my first turn to speak, as the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) put it, I was pointing out that the attitude which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) and the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) adopted in 1959 differed from the attitude which they are adopting to-day in connection with short-time benefits. They tried to run away from it, Mr. Chairman, by saying that they were not against short-time benefits in 1959. They were only against those benefits being paid out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. They said they had asked that those benefits should be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in other words, they had to be paid out of the funds of the taxpayers. Mr. <span class="col_4813-4814" refersTo="page_1033"/>Chairman, I say they are trying to run away from this matter, but I will not allow them to get away from it as easily as that. Because that was not really what they ment. They were not sympathetically disposed towards the workers&#x2014;the hon. member for Durban (Point) in any case was not very sympathetically disposed towards the workers, because listen to what he said. I want to repeat what I said in the course of my first speech. The hon. member for Durban (Point) said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So you are subsidizing people out of the Unemployment Fund, to work short-time for their full wages&#x2026; You are subsidizing people to loaf.</block>

<p>Apparently he now wants the Consolidated Revenue Fund to subsidize people to loaf. He went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You are giving them a holiday at the cost of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</block>

<p>He now wants them to take this holiday at the cost of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the State. You see, Mr. Chairman, it is very clear from this sort of thing that if he saw fit to talk about those people the way he did it did not enter his mind to pay short-time benefits to these people. I want to quote what he said further. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am against subsidizing people to loaf at the cost of the workers of South Africa, and that is what this amounts to. I am against the workers of South Africa having to subsidize people to draw pay for work they are not doing.</block>

That was what they suggested how the Fund should be exploited. I say their opposition is artificial. They do not care how the Fund is spent. They want to give it away, as I have said; the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) wanted to give it away. They also wanted to give it away as a welfare fund; they also wanted to give it away as another old age pension fund; they wanted to give it away as a charity fund; they wanted to give it away as anything. I will tell you, Mr. Chairman, why they want to be so reckless with this Fund. Their whole motive is clear. They want this Fund to become completely drained so that when abnormal times arrive, when the workers really need the Fund, there will not be any money in the Fund, so that they can tell the workers that it was the National Government who is responsible for it that there is no money in the Fund. That is all they want and that is why I do not take their objections seriously. If you weigh their words of 1959 against the attitude which they are adopting in this House to-day, you find all the proof you need, Sir, that you should not take them seriously.</p>

<p>Sir, we do not seem to be getting any further with our arguments as far as the Government members are concerned and particularly as far as the Minister is concerned. I feel that in view of what the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister have said in respect of 39 (3), we would be much more satisfied if the Minister would indicate quite clearly now that in respect of paragraph (m) he is prepared to introduce an amendment in the Other Place to Clause 2&#x2014;unfortunately we cannot go back to Clause 2 where such an amendment could be introduced&#x2014;to make quite sure that the qualification of 13 weeks will not bar an applicant from appealing for further benefits. If the Minister is prepared to introduce an amendment to that effect we will be able to report some progress in this particular debate. But if he is not, then we are in difficulty not only in respect of this clause but in Clause 5 as well. I do not intend going on to Clause 5 at this stage, Sir. I think it is unsatisfactory that there should be this uncertainty in respect of this most important interpretation which the Minister and the Deputy Minister have put on Section 39 (3). I think it is vital and important that there be no uncertainty at all in the law. For that reason I appeal to the Minister to indicate that if his interpretation of 39 (3) is correct, he will not do anything as far as this amendment is concerned, but if he is satisfied after further consultation with his legal advisers that his interpretation is not correct, he will introduce an amendment in the Other Place to give effect to what he believes is the position to-day.</p>

I am trying to deal with this Bill on the basis of what I read. If I can be corrected, well and good. But in terms of Section 39 (3) it is quite clear that 3 (m) is excluded. And if 3 (m) is excluded then the proviso to Clause 5 is also in doubt. Why has the proviso to Clause 5 been put in if the Minister&#x2019;s interpretation is correct? I do not know. That is why I say, Mr. Chairman, that we must be absolutely sure as to what the position is here before we depart from this clause.

The Minister says that in any specific case the Board can waive those 13 weeks so that if a contributor has, let us say, a further 26 weeks&#x2019; credit he can enjoy that credit on an exemption granted by the Board, even though he may not have worked 13 weeks in the 52 weeks preceding the date of his application for benefits.

<p>That is the Minister&#x2019;s interpretation. When we on this side of the House read Section 39 (3) we do not get that impression; that is not our interpretation. The Minister tells us that he has had sound legal advice on this point. But this point which we are discussing has only just arisen and I think that the Minister has only now given this point specific consideration. My hon. friend, the member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) has only just drawn his attention to it. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister agree with the Minister?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>If what the hon. the Minister says is correct the position will be this: Let us get down to the basic facts. A man who had been a contributor for 10 years, in terms of the Act as it stands to-day, had credits for 130 weeks. That is correct. He is entitled to enjoy those credits at 26 week inter-he can go back to the Board on 1 January and draw benefits for 26 weeks if he becomes unemployed. If he fails to get employment after the lapse of a further period of 26 weeks, he can go back to the board on 1 January again and obtain benefits for a further period of 26 weeks. But the Minister says in this sub-section that he will not be able to do that unless he has worked for 13 weeks in the 52 weeks preceding it. The Minister is now trying to exonerate the situation by saying that in terms of Section 39 (3) the Board will have a discretionary right, not only to extend the period of benefits, but to do away with the qualifying period of 13 weeks. If the applicant has only worked for two weeks then the Board can say he can obtain benefits for a further period of 26 weeks. That, Sir, is not our interpretation. But if it is a correct interpretation I can only say that it will be utterly impossible to apply. Because if you think about it that 94,000 applications were made last year for benefits under this Fund alone and that of those 94,000 a large percentage must have enjoyed benefits for a longer period than 26 weeks, how on earth will it be possible for the Board to cope with the situation. It will be an impossibility, Mr. Chairman. In terms of the Act every application has to be considered on its merits. There must be proof that the applicant has looked for employment and other things have to be proved before he receives his benefits. The Board has to satisfy itself on many aspects in respect of every one of those applications. I say, Sir, that an impossible situation will arise. We on this side of the House are not at all satisfied that the Minister&#x2019;s interpretation is correct. I am going to ask the Minister a straightforward question across the floor of the House: If he finds that his interpretation of Section 39 (3) is incorrect, if he is advised by his law advisers that he has a misunderstanding of the situation&#x2014;which is a possibility&#x2014;will the Minister tell us now that he is prepared to come with an amending Bill during this Session to set the position as he has stated?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, my reply is this. As regards paragraph (m) as it stands, that must be included in the Bill. I am not prepared to amend paragraph (m) in any way whatsoever.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from><span class="col_4817-4818" refersTo="page_1035"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>May I just say this, Sir. What the Minister wishes to obtain by paragraph 3 (m) as it stands, is a limiting effect on applications for benefits in excess of 26 weeks, in the period of a second year. The Minister&#x2019;s interpretation is that if any applicant finds that he does not qualify in terms of paragraph 3 (m) because he has not worked for 13 weeks in 52 weeks, he can go to the Board and the Board can grant him additional benefits at its discretion. That is the interpretation the Minister places of Section 39 (3). All we ask is that if that is the legal position we will be very happy, it will be a tremendous advantage, but if it is not we ask the Minister to undertake to introduce an amendment in the Other Place to give effect to what he believes can be done by the Board. That is all we ask. I think that is reasonable.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I must make the position quite clear. Even assuming that my interpretation is not correct I am still insisting on paragraph (m), because the intention obviously, right through the second readinug and now in this Committee Stage, has been and is that (m) is essential to protect the Fund from claims which we say are not reasonable claims. So assuming that my interpretation is not correct, as I have said, I am still not prepared to accept any amendment to sub-paragraph (m) either here or in the Other Place. I want that to be clearly understood.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would just like to take the hon. the Minister one stage further. I want to point out to the Minister that the justification for the proposed amendment has been the argument that the Board has this discretion to waive the qualifying period. That was the argument advanced by the Deputy Minister. And that has been the argument advanced by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt), by the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) and by the hon. the Minister himself. Now the Minister tells us that he is going to insist on (m) whether his interpretation is right or wrong. I want to ask the Minister this: If he finds that his interpretation is wrong is he prepared in the Other Place to give effect to the amendment so that his interpretation will be as he has stated and that the Board will have that discretionary right to waive this 13 week period?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the proviso to the proposed new Section 57<i>bis.</i></block>

<p>The proviso makes it impossible for any contributors to the Fund to get benefits in excess of 26 weeks in any one year. The arguments which were used in respect of the previous clause apply also in respect of this proviso and there is no point in repeating those arguments. But the Minister will appreciate the undertaking which he gave in respect of the interpretation of Section 39 (3), will apply here as well, because the proviso will have no effect if the Board has the right to extend benefits in excess of 26 weeks, whether it is in respect of one year or in respect of a subsequent year. The Board will override this proviso. That is why we attach so much importance to the Minister&#x2019;s interpretation of what the Board could or could not do in respect of (3) (m). Therefore, in deleting the proviso we are being logical and consequent to our opposition to (3) (m) and what we believe to be the restricting effect of (3) (m), and our belief that the Board has no power to disregard the qualifying period of 13 weeks. We say that if the Minister is right in his interpretation, the proviso is hardly necessary and I move the deletion of the proviso and leave it to the Minister to explain why he feels the proviso should be retained.</p>

<p>I understood the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) to say that the same arguments used on the previous clause were also relevant to this proviso. If I might just repeat very briefly the object of this proviso, it is this. It is to prevent, as I stated on a number of occasions, a number of contributors who are in receipt of benefits at the time the amending Act comes into operation&#x2014;that is the main clause before we come to the proviso&#x2014;from being suddenly and adversely affected by the restrictive provisions of the Bill. There is no argument about that. According to the proviso, the contributor shall be entitled to benefits for a maximum period of 26 weeks, but if for any reason he ceases to be entitled to benefits after the amending Act comes into operation, his future applications will be subject to the restrictions which are contained in the proviso. But that does not imply that he will in future necessarily be limited to 26 weeks&#x2019; benefit in terms of Section 39 (3), as upon application the Unemployment Insurance Board can waive the restrictions and grant benefits for as long as it likes, depending on the circumstances of each case. That is the effect of the proviso. But I agree with the hon. member that if the question of the discretion of the Board does not apply to the previous sub-paragraph (m), then consideration will have to be given to the effect of this proviso. I think the two matters are interdependent, but it is a matter which I said I will consider.</p>

<p>Amendment put and negatived.</p>

<p>On Clause 6,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the clause: <br/>Provided that this Act shall not remain in operation for a longer period than one calendar year from the date of such proclamation.</block>

<p>I think the Minister will appreciate the reasons for this amendment. The Committee may not be aware of further provisions in the principal Act, and I think that to make the reasons for moving the amendment quite clear I should quote the provisions of Section 42 (2), which says that if the Secretary of the Board at any time after consultation with the Board and the actuary is of opinion that the assets of the Fund are insufficient or are not increasing to the extent deemed sufficient to meet applications for benefits which may reasonably be expected in a period of severe unemployment, he shall report to the Minister accordingly and thereupon the Governor-General may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> prescribe an increase in the rate of contributions, provided that no such proclamation shall prescribe a reduction of the rates of benefit below the rate prescribed by Section 39, and no proclamation shall be issued unless both Houses of Parliament have by resolution approved thereof. That means that if the reasons for the introduction of this Bill as given by the Minister are correct, the Secretary should have asked him to introduce a resolution to increase the contributions. I do not know if the Secretary has, but the point is that the Minister can by resolution passed by both Houses increase the contributions to the Fund, and if that happens, and secondly, if the Minister is able to reduce the high figure of unemployment in the country appreciably during the next year, and thirdly, that the decisions taken in terms of this Bill are <span class="col_4821-4822" refersTo="page_1037"/>applied, the collective effect of all these matters may be that the Fund will no longer be in deficit. Now if all these things were to happen, surely the need for this Bill will disappear, and the purpose of the amendment is that if all these things do happen, if there is a reduction in unemployment and a decrease in benefits and if the restrictive provisions of this Bill all bring about the desired effect, the Minister will be bound, unless this amendment is accepted, by the provisions of this Bill for quite a long time to come; and we say that if this amendment is accepted, within a year of the Bill being proclaimed the Minister will be in a position to reconsider the position. I do not think this is an unreasonable request to put to the Minister. We are in effect saying to the Minister: Have confidence in the ability of the Government and everyone else to reduce unemployment; consider the requests made to you by the trade unions to increase contributions so that the present benefits can be restored. In view of these facts it appears to me that the Minister has to make out a case for the retention of these restricting clauses for all time, because if our amendment is not accepted that is what it means, and I hope that in the light of the information I have given the Committee, the Committee will support my amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>During the second reading the whole House, I felt, was under the impression that the only reasons for introducing this Bill was, firstly, because of the rise in unemployment, and secondly the abuse by certain people of the fund, and thirdly by the Government and the employers not contributing on the same level as they did before. I think I made it quite clear and that the whole House agreed that we here were not pessimistic enough to feel that the unemployment position would not be relieved within the next year or so. It was the feeling that the present number of 30,000 unemployed was the high-level mark, and that we hoped that from now onwards that figure would fall. If the Minister feels that unemployment will still increase, he must tell the House, but if he feels it will decrease, or even stay at the same level, then he cannot for all time bind the workers to these restrictions he is imposing by this Bill. Secondly, I think that we are all agreed that the abuses which were mentioned have been exaggerated. I for one do not believe that the people who have abused this fund have done it in such a manner and in such large numbers that it has been the cause of the reduction in the total amount in the fund at the moment. Thirdly, I said in the second reading that the contributions were three-fold, by the State, the employers and the employees, and that it was unfair to expect only the employee to be the sufferer when the fund is in trouble. It is for the State immediately to take steps, and I understood the Minister to say that he would, as soon as possible, contribute towards the fund as he did previously. If he does this the employers must play their part as well. If all three members of this partnership play their part, I do not think it is necessary for us to bind ourselves for all time by the restrictions of this Bill. I repeat that firstly the abuses have been exaggerated and do not play any great part in the reduction of the Fund; secondly, that unemployment will in all probability fall and not rise, and thirdly, that all three partners to the fund will contribute as they did before. If that happens, these restrictions should automatically fall away. I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment, and I hope that the Minister will see it as we do, as a temporary measure only and one that can from time to time be reintroduced if necessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to support the amendment, because I feel that it can be termed a test of the stewardship of the Government in regard to this fund. In the second reading the Minister gave us as his main reason for the introduction of these amendments that it was a measure which curtailed the outflow from the Fund because of the financial position in which it finds itself at present, and he gave us the figures for the last few years to show how it had diminished. The Minister has indicated that these various amendments are steps taken to reduce the outflow. He has also stated that he anticipates that next year there may be an increase in the contributions to the Fund. Now, if you look at the position of the unemployment figures at present, the increase which has taken place over the last three months, it is clear that the Fund will still decrease. I therefore put it to the Minister that it can hardly be expected that year after year he must come with further restrictions to stop the outflow. He could hardly subscribe to such a principle. Therefore, I think it is only fair to accept this amendment where we ask that the Act will apply for one year so that the position can be reviewed in 12 months&#x2019; time, and if the Minister finds that the position has improved he need not proceed with the restrictions and the workers can continue to enjoy the benefits they now enjoy. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment. The provisions of the Bill are not only intended as purely financial measures, but they are also intended to be permanent in preventing abuses, so that the steps I envisage in this Bill to prevent malpractices and abuses are intended to be permanent. It is quite true that during the second reading I stated that the Government has deferred the question of increased contributions this year and that one of the reasons was that we wanted to see what the effect would be on the fund after the new provisions come into operation. I think hon. members must be raeasonable, and it should be obvious that you cannot decide within 12 months whether these provisions have the effect which we think <span class="col_4823-4824" refersTo="page_1038"/>they may have. I should say that it will take at least two years or more for the effect of these provisions to be clearly seen by the Government and all the other contributors to the Fund. It seems to me that it is quite wrong, when any legislation is passed, to say that legislation must only be for a certain time.</p>

The Government will at some future date have to consider the question of increased contributions. That will be time enough, when that legislation comes before the House, to consider whether in view of the position of the Fund at that date it is possible to relax some of these restrictions.

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>When the hon. the Minister introduced this Bill, my hon. Leader asked him a question, and the question was whether or not those persons who had already been classified under the principal Act would be re-classified in terms of the new definition, and the Minister said: &#x201C;No.&#x201D; In other words, he has given us the assurance that persons already classified will not be re-classified in terms of the new definition involving descent, involving their ancestry. Sir, while I accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance so far as he is concerned, we appreciate that the hon. the Minister will not always be the Minister of the Interior; but there will be other Ministers whose assurances we do not have, and we feel that there must be protection for those persons who are already classified, those thousands of borderline cases who at last have certainty so far as their classification is concerned, and for that reason I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>To add the following proviso at the end of the clause:</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that no person who at the commencement of the Population Registration Amendment Act, 1962, had been classified in terms of this Act shall be reclassified in terms of this definition except upon the written request of such person.</block>

<p>I am sure that the hon. the Minister will see fit to accept this in view of the assurance which he has given to this House. This amendment meets the difficulty which the hon. the Minister seemed to have with the old Act when he spoke on the Bill at the second reading, namely that there are certain people who want to be re-classified, and in terms of the amendment which I have moved they can be re-classified if they so wish, but only if they wish to be re-classified. But there is another very good reason why this amendment, I submit, should be accepted by the hon. the Minister, and that is that if it is not accepted, the tragedy which will be visited upon families who are already classified under the old definition will be such as I think no civilized community, no Christian community, would ever permit. I say that because if this amendment is not put into this clause, it will affect those persons who are already married. It will affect already existing family units. Sir, I think that is very important, because under the Mixed Marriages Act the test is very much the same as the test under this Act, and under the new definition it would be possible, were this amendment not accepted, for persons already married to be re-classified according to a different test. To have one member of the family, the husband or the wife, re-classified so that one would be European and one would be nonEuropean. I am sure that the hon. the Minister would not like that to happen. I am sure he would not like to see already existing homes broken up because of the application of this definition. Although the hon. the Minister will not do it, he will be followed by other Ministers, and the effect of this power if exercised upon those persons already classified would be horrible. In view of the Minister&#x2019;s assurance I hope that he will accept this amendment and at this stage I do not propose to say anymore.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) is a very good amendment in so far as it will set at rest the fears of those persons who were borderline cases and who were classified in one population group under the Population <span class="col_4829-4830" refersTo="page_1041"/>Registration Act, and who fear that because of the activities of informers, not necessarily a witch-hunt on behalf of the Department, but informers who have some evil intentions towards them, and who might request the director to re-classify them in terms of some specified knowledge that they have of the descent of these people. I would therefore support that amendment. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not reconsider the amendment he himself is moving, that is to say, the proviso which reads,&#x201D; unless it is proved that the admission is not based on facts I ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider it because of the reason that he gave us in the second reading debate for the introduction of this proviso. He told us that this was specifically aimed at Mrs. Singh who he thought would be seeking to be re-classified as an Indian in order that she might live with her Indian husband. I think that this proviso puts us in a very bad light indeed. There are very few women who would voluntarily have themselves classified out of the European group, not because it is a disgrace to be a member of the Coloured group or the Indian group or the African group, but simply because of the legal disabilities that classification as a member of those groups carries with it in South Africa. It is not a case of being ashamed of one&#x2019;s origin or attempting to get away from one&#x2019;s racial grouping, but in this country being classified as anything other than European carries with it very decided legal disabilities, disabilities as regards the franchise, disabilities as regards earning one&#x2019;s living, living in selective areas and so on, and I would say that it would require someone of almost heroic proportions voluntarily to submit to reclassification. The fact is that we believe that one woman is attempting to have herself so reclassified. I put it to the hon. the Minister in all humanity that this is something with which we should not interfere, that it is a most unusual case, and that it reflects no credit whatsoever on South Africa, on the Government or on the Minister himself to attempt to stop this woman from living with her husband to whom she is lawfully married, and from coming back to live in South Africa, which is the country of their choice. I ask the Minister in all humanity to re-consider his decision and to withdraw this proviso.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>There is one aspect of this Bill which has been worrying me for some time and which I would like to put to the hon. the Minister, and I would like him, if possible to give me the picture and tell me if I am right or if I am wrong. This is in regard to Clause 1 and the classification of families. We have here this last proviso &#x201C;but does not include any person who admits that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person&#x201D;, to which the hon. the Minister has moved an amendment to say &#x201C;unless it is proved that his admission is not based on facts&#x201D;. Now, in terms of the principal Act, people under 16 years of age can be classified. In other words, &#x201C;families&#x201D; can be classified. The point that worries me is a point which has regard to the classification of families, together with the children of under 16 years of age. Under this new definition, and this last portion of the clause in particular, it would appear to me that where a man and wife have to take their children to be classified, especially under the extra Clause 4 (but I am not particularly concerned about that) they have to be classified and those children can be of very tender years, and yet they can be taken along and when they have no knowledge of what is happening, can be classified by an admission, possibly of their parents, and classified in for instance the Coloured group. What I want to know is this: The hon. the Minister has admitted, and stated quite clearly in his second reading speech, that once they are classified by admission under that section, it is going to be almost impossible to be reclassified. What is going to happen to these children when at the age of 16 or at some stage of their life they decide that they have not been classified in the group in which perhaps they are then moving? They may have been accepted as White, as has been indicated in the remarks of an eminent Judge in regard to a case of classifying a family, with which he was dealing, where one of the Board members themselves said that the features and characteristics of race and colour don&#x2019;t seem to crystallize until round about the age of 14. So you see, Sir, that these children can have by an admission of their parents been classified as Coloured under this section, but when they reach the age of 14, they may come to the conclusion that they should not be in that group at all. The Board itself, or one of its members has said that at that age their facial characteristics, etc., settle down and are formed. If they then decide that they should not be in that group at all, then it would seem to me from what the Minister has said and from the reading of this clause, that those children are going to be debarred for all time from having their classification reviewed. I think this is a very serious matter because if ever the angle of humanity comes into it, I think this is the case where it really does. I would like the hon. the Minister please to tell me as soon as possible in this debate exactly what the position is going to be and how this clause is going to affect those children. I am not appealing so much for people who can go and argue their own cause, but I appeal for people who do not understand, and I have seen those people (I am talking with some knowledge) at the office of the Population Register in my own city, together with their children, in many cases a number of children, who obviously don&#x2019;t know what is happening to them. Under this clause as I read it, all of those children without any knowledge to themselves of what is happening, can be classified into a group which in later years they might feel they don&#x2019;t belong to, and I cannot see how <span class="col_4831-4832" refersTo="page_1042"/>they can possibly ask for a reclassification or a reconsideration of their case.</p>

I would like the hon. the Minister please as soon as he can to clarify the position because that may alter my attitude to this clause considerably.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban-North (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). He gave as principal reasons for moving that amendment the fact that this hon. Minister may be replaced by another person holding that office, and while one accepts the assurance that he has given that he will not initiate any reclassification as a result of the definition having been amended, somebody else may occupy that office. There is the additional reason given by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) who made the point that for some malicious or improper motive a third party may wish a reclassification to take place. But Section 5 (3) of the Act is capable of the interpretation that there is a duty on the official concerned, the official holding the office of Secretary. Should facts come to his notice, not by reason of any malicious motive, but merely by accident or some <i>bona fide</i> report being submitted, he must take knowledge of the fact that a certain person may no longer be properly classified, and there will be a duty on him to make a reclassification. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that is an added reason why the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban-North should be accepted.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I should like to move a further amendment to Clause 1, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the Clause: <br/>Provided further that no person who at the commencement of the Population Registration Amendment Act, 1962, had applied to be classified in terms of this Act shall be classified in terms of this definition except upon the written request of such person.</block>

<p>The effect of that amendment is this: There are two categories of persons we are here dealing with, the category dealt with by the hon. member for Durban-North, viz, those who have already been classified, and then there is the additional category of those persons who have sent in their applications for reclassification some months before this Bill was introduced, but who have not yet been classified. Those people made their application for classification at a time when the previous definition was the law, and it is only fair and right, I suggest, that those people be classified in terms of the provisions of the law as it stood at the time that they made their application. It is no fault of theirs that these classifications were not made prior to this amendment coming in. I do not know how large the number concerned is, but my information is that it is quite a large number and many of these applications have for months been in the hands of the department but have not been classified during that time. This further amendment to Clause 1 is designed to safeguard the rights of those people so that they will be classified in accordance with the law as it stood and as they understood it at the time when their applications were made.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North). It seems to me that on this amendment both sides of the House are in complete agreement. We have heard the assurance by the hon. the Minister that no persons will be reclassified except on their own request. I accept completely the assurance of the hon. the Minister that this will be done. I perhaps differ from some of my colleagues on this side of the House by going so far as to say that I accept that this assurance will be carried out by the hon. Minister&#x2019;s successor, if there should be a successor, because I cannot believe that in a responsible government the change of a Minister would mean that such an assurance would disappear. But, Mr. Chairman, I think it goes far deeper than the question of an assurance. This is the highest legislative body of the Republic of South Africa. Our task is to legislate and surely legislation means that the desire of the House should be placed on the Statute Book, and that you cannot have half the desire of the House placed on the Statute Book and the rest of the desire of the House given as an assurance by the Minister. It seems to me quite wrong in principle and in practice that the wishes of the House should be dealt with in any other way than by findding its place on the Statute Book. If that is the case, we destroy to a large extent, in my submission, the purpose of Parliament. We know very well that the courts find difficulty enough in interpreting what we place on the Statute Book, but what is going to be the position if they have got to interpret an inintention which is partly on the Statute Book and partly consists of an assurance?</p>

Mr. Chairman, another situation might arise if this amendment is not placed on the Statute Book. You may have a situation when certain <span class="col_4833-4834" refersTo="page_1043"/>other actions are taken when the assurances of the hon. the Minister cannot be led as evidence; because legally they don&#x2019;t exist.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Two amendments have been moved. The first amendment came from the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). In my second reading speech, as well as in my reply to the second reading debate, I pointed out very definitely that reclassification should stand unhampered. The reason for that is very, very clear, and I am not going to reiterate what I have already said. I cannot accept this amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) for the reason that it is contrary to the basic principle of classification, namely that of general acceptance in that it excludes the right, the existing right on the part of the public to object to a classification. It excludes the right of any person to come forward and object to a classification. I said very clearly that in the past 12 years we have not had a single case of that sort, but still it remains a right of the public to object whenever they see fit to do so.</p>

<p>The second amendment moved by the hon. member for Zululand consists of a further proviso which I unluckily cannot accept either. My reason again is very clear, namely that it has the effect to create a variable basis of classification as between persons whose applications have been received at the commencement of the amending Act and future applicants. Once the new definition is accepted, classification of outstanding cases on the previous basis cannot be justified. I think that is very clear. I must point out that even in my second reading speech I gave the warning that no further classification would be made until such time as this Bill becomes law. Mr. Chairman, it is also very important that when this new Bill becomes law, the old definition falls away, and then there will be no old definition according to which anybody could be classified. I think that is very simple reasoning, and for those reasons the amendment is unacceptable.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) put a question about children under 16 years of age. All children are classified according to acceptance and appearance, and all that the parents do is to act for the children up to the age of 21 years. If at any time their parents may prove their acceptance as Whites, they can claim a White classification, or as in the instance mentioned by the hon. member, they can aim classification as Coloureds. Children are therefore classified on the evidence given by their parents. After the age of 21, the child can himself ask at any time for a reclassification.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but one of the Minister&#x2019;s strongest arguments was that in fact nobody had ever objected during the past 12 years. Let me put it this way: Although members of the public may not have objected during the first 12 years, the Minister is now making it much easier for them to object from now on, because the whole definition is changed, and whereas it might be very difficult for members of the public to come along and say &#x201C;This person has been accepted as White because he is generally accepted as a White person,&#x201D; now anybody can come along and say &#x201C;This person has been accepted as White, but I find now that in his descent there is a Coloured forebear&#x201D;. That makes it of course very much easier for the public to come along and object. The hon. Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot on the one hand say that the public do not object, and then on the other hand say that he must maintain the possibility for the public to object, and at the same time make it easier for the public to do so. I think that is very unsound reasoning. The second reason the hon. the Minister gave for not accepting the amendment moved by the hon. member for Zululand, was also very unsound. He said that if he accepted that amendment, it would mean differentiation between the people who have already applied up to now and those people who are to apply in future to be classified. But surely the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is making a vast difference between the people who have already been classified up to now and all future classifications. There is already that big differentiation. Anybody who was classified before the change in definition falls into one group and all the people who are to be classified in future fall into another group.</p>

<p>I want to come back to another important point, and that is the whole question of people who might have applied before this Bill will actually be promulgated as an Act. Sir, I have again to return to this unfortunate Song family, which has been the whole basis for this amending legislation, and I want to read to <span class="col_4835-4836" refersTo="page_1044"/>the House a statement from Mr. Song. He thought that in terms of his application that he had also applied for his family to be classified as White, and I hope this letter will convince the hon. the Minister and other members on the Government side that this was not an organized undermining of South Africa&#x2019;s traditional way of life. Mr. Song is an individual who applied to be reclassified, not as a result of some dark political plot to undermine the whole of the established way of life, but simply as an individual who had felt that he had always lived as a White person, had always been accepted as a White person and wished therefore to have himself and his family so classified. And this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my original application to be declared as a member of the White group, I applied for myself and the above-mentioned members of my family to be similarly classified.</block>

<p>I want to interject here that in fact he made a mistake. The application went in his name only, but he thought it had gone in the name of himself and his family. He then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I was declared a member of the White group, I was under the impression that this declaration also applied to the above-mentioned members of my family.</block>

<p>He has incidentally two daughters and two sons, a wife and a daughter-in-law. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However to my surprise and consternation, I find that this is not so. I am now in a dilemma as to the immediate future of my family. My family, my brothers, were born at the property I own in Point Road and have always occupied these premises which are in a predominantly European area. The property is bounded by a European hotel and European business houses. I have been the owner of this property since 1939. Prior to this my late father occupied business premises owned by Europeans. These premises are situated a few doors away from my present premises. My father arrived in Durban in 1898. He was a grocer and provision dealer in Point Road, serving the European residents of the area. My wife, children, brothers and I have always been and still are accepted as Whites by our friends and neighbours who are all Europeans. My children grew up with European children; they have joined social and other clubs which cater for Whites only. Members of my family have always patronized European theatres and had never been refused admission. We have frequently been invited to parties and other social gatherings by our European friends and neighbours and our invitations to them have been accepted. During our holidays we always book at European hotels, and have had no difficulty whatsoever in finding hotel accommodation. For instance we stayed at the Kings View Hotel in Margate, the leading hotel in the resort. We participated in all the social activities at the hotel and in Margate.</block>

<block name="quote">With the above-mentioned facts before you, I beg you to view the position of my family with compassion. If my wife and the rest of my family are not classified as members of the White group as I am now classified, the difficulties and hardships that will ensue will be disastrous. In terms of the Group Areas Act and other legislation, I shall fall foul of the law merely by living with my own family. It would also mean that my family could not occupy my property in Point Road. But where are they to go? They are dependent on me for their livelihood. In the near future I shall have to seek new business and residential premises for my family as my present premises, business and residential, will not be able to support all my family. I am prepared to purchase another property for my son who is married and wants to live on his own. However, in the present circumstances it would be impossible for my son to trade in a European area, as he is accustomed to, thus causing great hardships. I and my family know of no other home, except the Republic of South Africa, and being law-abiding citizens, we humbly pray and request that the position of my family be reviewed and reclassified as members of the White group.</block>

I hope the hon. the Minister will use his compassion and allow the position of this man to be reviewed in the light of the facts which I have revealed. Sir, there is no undermining plot involved, I assure the hon. the Minister.

<p>The hon. the Minister intimated that his only objection to the amendment which I moved was that it would prohibit the right of other persons to object, a right contained in the principal Act, against the classification of persons already classified.

<p>If the hon. the Minister will accept that it would meet the objection which he raises to my amendment, and it would then entrench the position of these people and would make it certain for these persons who are already classified as to what their future status and the status of their families is going to be. I hope the hon. the Minister will indicate to us immediately what his attitude towards this further amendment will be, because it now meets the objection that he has raised and I am certain that the hon. the Minister can have no further objection. The Bill will then contain the positive statutory expression of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s intentions so far as the administration of this Act is concerned.

<p>Will you give me a copy of your amendment?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move an amendment to Clause 1 in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 14, to omit &#x201C;admits&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;for the purposes of classification under this Act, freely and voluntarily admits under oath to a magistrate&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The last portion of Clause 1 will then read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A &#x201C;White person&#x201D; does not include any person who for the purposes of classification under this Act, freely and voluntarily admits under oath to a magistrate that he is by descent a Native or a Coloured person&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The difficulty which I see is likely to arise under this clause, this definition clause, will not be met by the amendment which the hon. the Minister himself moved, and my amendment therefore must be considered as part from that portion which the hon. the Minister has moved to amend. Looking at the practical application of this new definition, it does become important to have clarity as to the procedure which is to be followed by those who are responsible for the administration of the Act. As I said during the second reading, a new rule of procedure has been introduced by which evidence of some admission by a person whose race classification is at issue can be used as evidence and can become conclusive evidence as to that person&#x2019;s membership of a particular racial group. I submit that my amendment will bring that desirable measure of clarity as to the procedure to be followed in terms of this definition of Clause 1 of the Bill. It will do so in two ways, first by qualifying the word &#x201C;admits&#x201D; and secondly, by specifying the form in which the evidence is to be recorded. The hon. the Minister will remember that those are two of the aspects which I stressed during the second reading debate, and specifically asked that he should give consideration to. There should be some qualification of the word &#x201C;admits&#x201D; and a specification as to the form in which this evidence of admission should be recorded. The safeguards I include in this amendment are essential and that for two reasons. The first of these is that the staff is entitled to be guided in regard to the manner in which these provisions of the law are to be invoked. Without words having the effect of those I have proposed, the officials, who will be administering the Act, are going to find it extremely difficult to know precisely in what way the relevant provisions should be applied. The second reason for these safeguards is that it will leave the individual whose race classification is under consideration under no doubt of the way in which he should set about making an admission. There is a third aspect which my amendment is designed to cover and that is to make it quite clear that any admission made will then be only for the purpose of the classification under this Act. Coming to the amendment which the hon. the Minister himself has moved, I must say that I find difficulty in ascertaining how it is going to be applied in practice. The wording is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless it is proved that the admission is not based on fact.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is what I am asking, namely to the satisfaction of whom? Because if the facts are known then why call upon the person to make an admission? If the facts are known, these should determine what his classification should be. There is no necessity for it to be preceded by an admission. If, on the other hand, the facts are unknown, the question which arises is why start new investigations because of the admission? There seems to be an illogical basis to a procedure of having an admission first and thereafter either establishing that it is not true, or setting out to establish that it is true. These two consequences <span class="col_4839-4840" refersTo="page_1046"/>seem to me to be quite illogical and I, therefore, feel that the hon. the Minister should reconsider his amendment in this regard. I further want to point out that when the hon. the Minister during his reply to the Second Reading Debate indicated that he was going to move an amendment of this kind.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I indicated that not only in the course of my reply, but also in the course of my Second Reading speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am referring only to the statement made in the course of the reply to the debate. I found his statement to be rather alarming because he said that it might arise that some over-zealous official might ask a person &#x201C;Are you not of Coloured descent?&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister also agreed that there might be one or other unscrupulous neighbour who might come along and give this information. The possibility of that arising is, therefore, in the Minister&#x2019;s mind. On the other hand, if my amendment is accepted, such a possibility will be eliminated completely and it will be quite impossible then for an overzealous official to extract an admission from a person, or for some unscrupulous neighbour to come forward with an allegation of that nature. The admission, in terms of my amendment, will be in a clear and suitable form, namely in the form of a affidavit sworn to before a responsible judicial officer. On these grounds I appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment. It will not in any way detract from the legislation which he has to administer and will bring certainty into the procedure. At the same time it will clarify the way in which his own staff should act in the application of this new rule.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to point out to members that it is much easier for me to deal with any amendments if they are submitted to me beforehand and, accordingly, I want to thank the hon. member for Umlazi for having furnished me with four amendments earlier to-day. That also applies to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth-South in regard to the amendments he has just moved. In connection with this particular amendment, I should like to say that I am not prepared to accept it in the form in which the hon. member has proposed it. I have consulted my law advisers in this connection. I am, however, prepared to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 14, after &#x201C;who&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;for the purposes of his classification under this Act, freely and voluntarily&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I am prepared to accept his amendment in this form. My reasons for couching his amendment in this form are, firstly, that I feel that if a person makes an admission, then surely it is not necessary for him to do so under oath because it is a free and voluntary admission. This is not in the form of an admission in a criminal case. Secondly, why must such an admission be made before a magistrate? Magistrates have nothing to do with the classification of persons under the Population Registration Act. It is the duty of the Secretary for the Interior, or of persons in his Department acting on his authority and guidance. If the hon. member for Port Elizabeth-South feels that he is prepared to accept the amendment in this form, I shall be only too pleased if he would take it over and move it. Otherwise I should like to move it now. In so far as the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) is concerned, I should like to have more time to consider it.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has seen it fit to accept my amendment to a very considerable extent. I wonder, however, whether he would not agree to include the words &#x201C;under oath&#x201D;. You see, Sir, we are concerned here with a very serious matter and the hon. the Minister, during the course of this debate, also said that this was, in fact, a serious matter and he indicated with what care officials of his Department dealt with cases falling under this Act. I feel, therefore, that an admission of such an important nature should be treated in a somewhat more serious way that it would be in terms of the amendment now moved by the hon. the Minister. I will not, however, insist that the admission should be made before a magistrate. I merely thought of a magistrate because he is a judicial officer and would give an added degree of sanctity and force to an admission of that nature. I should like the hon. the Minister, however, to reconsider the matter with a view to adding the words &#x201C;under oath&#x201D;, because of the nature of the admission and of the importance it has, not only in the life of the individual concerned alone, but also in the lives of members of his family or those yet to follow.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the suggestion now made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South), I think we should bear in mind that an admission is normally made either in a document which is submitted to the Director of Census, or in the course of an investigation into a complaint. In this connection I want to point out that, firstly, a document submitted in connection with registration is not, normally, made under oath, and, secondly, the procedure to be followed for an investigation conducted by the Appeal Board is not circumscribed by the Act. There is, in other words, no statutory provision which obliges that Board to take evidence under oath only. The normal manner in which an admission could, therefore, be made, would be a manner which would preclude it being made under oath. If the amendment is extended so as to make it possible to take sworn admissions, it will entail a specific procedure which will be outside the scope of the Act as it stands. If the hon. member accepts the amendment which has been moved by the hon. the Minister, I <span class="col_4841-4842" refersTo="page_1047"/>think he would have attained his point. I now should like to come to the amendment moved earlier on by the hon. member for Durban (North), viz. to Clause 1 of this Bill. In connection with this amendment I should like, however, to raise the query&#x2014;without making an issue out of it&#x2014;whether we will be competent to amend this clause by introducing certain qualifications in respect of the objections which can be raised. In the principal Act this matter is dealt with in Section 11 laying down that an objection by any one may be raised within 30 days after the classification concerned has become known to the objector, or within 30 days after the commencement of the Act. Now an attempt is made to provide that no objection can be brought in against a classification of a person. In this Bill there is no amendment of Section 11 of the principal Act relating to the competence of an objector to object against a classification. In regard to the merits of the amendment, I should like to say that at the moment it is competent for any person to raise an objection against a particular classification within 30 days after he became aware of such classification. The point now is that this Bill introduces two possible new grounds for objections, namely the appearance of a person and his own admission The right to object will, however, subsist only for 30 days after the passage of this Bill. It is accepted law that everybody should be aware of the contents of an Act which has been published in the Gazette. At any rate, the right to object on the new grounds now being created in this Bill, will subsist only for 30 days after the publication of this Act. In view of this short period, is it necessary to curtail the rights of potential objectors for that period of 30 days? It is hardly conceivable that any objection would be raised within this period of 30 days for reasons of spite or for any other unworthy motive. An objection could only be raised in an outstanding case where the principles of the new Clause 1 had not been applied in the determination of race under the existing section. Therefore I feel that, in any event, an amendment to Clause 1 has no practical importance at all. Neither could it justifiably be inserted because that would create the impression that we are guarding against a possible abuse which does not, however, present a praticable possibility.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) has been accepted by the hon. the Minister, in spirit at least, because he realizes that this deals with a very important matter. The declaration by a person is of great importance in his classification. Now, this amendment applies to Clause 1(b) only and not to (a) and, accordingly, it is applicable strictly to borderline cases. For the man concerned it is a solemn occasion and not an occasion on which he fills in a census form, or anything formal of that kind. It was suggested in the course of the Second Reading debate that a man might make such a declaration in a light-hearted manner while he was slightly inebriated and that could then count against him. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) has, therefore, framed an amendment which concentrates on the solemnity of the occasion on which he is making a statement which is irrevocable&#x2014;because having made it, he will be classified accordingly. For this reason, it would be appreciated if the hon. the Minister would accept the words &#x201C;under path&#x201D;. It would not be absolutely necessary to call in a magistrate for the purpose of having the declaration made under oath, because there are many officials in the Department of the hon. the Minister who themselves are commissioners of oaths. Any statement which has to be made could, therefore, simply be made before them in their office, or, if the person concerned does not wish to do that, he could go to his own attorney. I again appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept this further amendment, especially in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister himself realizes the importance of the matter.</p>

<p>I really cannot understand the hon. member for Kensington. The hon. the Minister to a large extent accepted the amendment he moved. In fact, he accepts the whole idea behind the amendment, except for the provision in regard to the sworn statement. Now the hon. member for Kensington is afraid that unless a person can state under oath that he is this or that, he can simply be classified on the basis of common gossip. Does he really imply that the Board concerned will take any notice of gossip? Surely they will get into touch with the person concerned and inform him that objection has been raised to his classification, and await his reaction. Thereafter such a person will certainly make his statement in a responsible manner, or even appear before the Board before the Board takes a decision. Therefore I do not believe it is necessary for that hon. member to see ghosts here. In fact, I think he ought to be grateful to the Minister for having accepted his amendment to the extent he did.</p>

<p>However, on this occasion I more particularly want to refer to what was said by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). This hon. member to-day made two heartstirring pleas on behalf of a Mrs. Singh and a Mr. Song. I am convinced that these pleas are only a political sing-song, because anyone who followed the story in the press in regard to Mrs. Singh&#x2019;s marriage realized that it was only politics which was behind it all. Take, e.g., the statement read out here by the hon. member made by Mr. Song and his family. According to that statement, his father has been in this country since 1898, and he himself has a daughter of 32 years of age. In other words, they have been in the country for 64 years. During this time, it is stated, they have always associated with Whites. But he nevertheless married a Chinese! Where then did he find her if he associated only with Whites, as he alleges? The same applies to his daughter who is now married to a Chinese. Why did she <span class="col_4843-4844" refersTo="page_1048"/>marry a Chinese if she has always associated with Whites? These are matters which the hon. member for Houghton should explain to the House before we can take that statement seriously. No, Sir, this is a case which, as we all know, was worked up by Mr. Ray Swart. Mr. Ray Swart was the attorney in this case, and if he could have his way, not only would one Chinese family be classified as White, but a few hundred.</p>

<p>I repeat that this case was worked up by him, although not necessarily in a political sense. The case was taken to the Classification Board by him. But if one looks at the history of the Song case, I cannot see how it can be alleged that they have always associated with Whites, particularly when members of this family have married Chinese. Surely that is illogical. If one moves in a certain circle, surely one will not seek a spouse in another circle. The hon. member told us a few weeks ago that she does not believe in the intermingling of blood, but here she is now advocating miscegenation because she approves of persons classified as Whites marrying Chinese. If the hon. member wants to suggest a solution for this matter, she must advise Mr. Song to apply to be reclassified as a Chinese.</p>

The hon. member must bear in mind, however, that period is being extended to one year under Clause 3.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the fact remains that it can be extended up to a period of one year. Consequently, I consider that this is a matter of more than passing importance.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to some aspects of the clause we are dealing with, as a whole. Because, while it seems from the speeches made by the hon. the Minister during the second reading debate, that he appreciates the effect the Bill will have, he does not perhaps fully appreciate all the circumstances which can give rise to real hardships. The hon. the Minister indicated that there was an appeal against a classification and that no harm could be done to a person who has so appealed, because he gets the right classification. We all agree that the clause we are discussing limits the number of people who can be classified as Whites. We are all agreed on that. That being the case, you create uneasiness with quite a large number of people on account of their reduced prospects of passing through the net. That is the case long before there is actually a classification or an appeal. Then also you get those cases where an investigation is made into their circumstances, and cases where persons who have been passing as Whites, are classified as Coloureds. That might be the correct classification&#x2014;or it may be accepted that it might be so, on account of the Minister&#x2019;s assurances that no injustices would be done. Nevertheless, that person will be suffering under tremendously changed circumstances&#x2014;having been able to go to theatres, cinemas, and to have sources of income which are no longer open to him. I suggest that these things can cause very real hardships, especially as one would not be able to give any justifiable explanation for the sudden change in his circumstances. I suggest, therefore, that although the classification of the person concerned may be quite correct and fully in terms of the new definition, the attendant hardships have made themselves felt long before that, or may, indeed, be precipitated by the very correctness of the decision.</p>

<p>It is useless giving explanations again, because that has been done so often already. It is quite clear that we on this side will never accept the standpoint of hon. members opposite in regard to Clause 2. Take, for example, the second amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). Does the hon. member realize that where a <i>bona fide</i> mistake has crept in in the classification of a person, in terms of the provisions of that amendment such a <i>bona fide</i> mistake cannot be remedied unless there is an objection by the public to such classification? The person himself will, however, not be able to have the mistake remedied. In addition, the objection by a member of the public will be valid only if submitted within 30 days after the classification has been made. The result of this amendment will therefore be that if there is no objection by the public, the person concerned will have to suffer from this wrong classification for the rest of his life. I have had this matter carefully investigated by my law advisers, and that is the conclusion to which they came. This is not a political matter; the lives of people are at stake. Can one imagine an hon. member moving such an ill-considered amendment, without analysing it properly? That is my objection to this amendment, and it is for hon. members to persuade me to adopt a different standpoint. I simply cannot accept an amendment just to please someone. I rely on my law advisers. Let me repeat what the position will be in this regard. My information that it is possible that a <i>bona fide</i> mistake may slip in when a person is classified. If the amendment of the hon. member is accepted, it will be impossible for the person concerned himself to remedy that <i>bona fide</i> mistake. He has to await for a member of the public to object to his classification, and that has to be done within 30 days after <span class="col_4845-4846" refersTo="page_1049"/>he becomes aware of such a classification. If that does not happen, the person concerned will be saddled for the rest of his life with a wrong classification. So much for the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North).</p>

<p>Now I come to the request of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) that provision must be made for a statement to be made under oath. Surely the hon. member is aware of that the Board of Appeal is a quasi judicial body. When the Appeal Board considers it desirable that the voluntary admission should be made under oath, it can instruct the man to take an oath. When the matter goes to the Supreme Court, the man can make the statement under oath verbally or in writing. Why then introduce this aspect? Surely the person who makes the admission is not one who would like to be classified as White. It is only a person who admits that he is Coloured or a Native. That is what he admits, that he is a Coloured person or a Native. If he makes that voluntary admission, that person is not classified as White. In the first place, why should the man take an oath, and secondly, my further amendment to Clause 1 provides that if there is any doubt as to the truth of the staement this man makes, here is the right to prove the contrary, and then I suppose the Appeal Board will place him under oath. They will tell him that there is certain evidence against him, and then he can controvert it under oath. But my law-adviser&#x2014;and that is the Chief Law Adviser&#x2014;says that this is absolutely unnecessary, and I had to plead hard with him to consent to these words which I proposed to be inserted, because he says that it unnecessary also. By implication the position is as I stated it in my second reading speech. But I said be inserted, because he says that is unnecessary words than too few words, and therefore these unnecessary words are there, and I hope the hon. member will withdraw his amendment in favour of this one, because I am not going to discuss this matter any further. I have firmly made up mind on the matter, and I have made a great concession which the Committee should appreciate.</p>

<p>On a point of order&#x2014;forgive me for not doing so earlier, but with so many amendments which one had not had the opportunity to study one&#x2019;s brain does not work so fast. I would like to direct your attention to the fact that in this Act, in Sec. 11 there is provision for a re-classification. We are dealing now with an amendment to Clause 1, and all the amendments moved here, except the one moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) envisaged only one thing, viz. a limitation on the right of classification. If I understood the Opposition correctly it means they want to add a proviso to it, viz. with this proviso that persons already classified will not be reclassified except at their own request. That amounts to a limitation of the right of classification in terms of Sec. 11. That affects the power to classify. On that basis these amendments, with respect, should not be allowed, because they add additional matter to the definition which has nothing to do with the definition. This really constitutes an extension of the provisions of Sec. 11, which is not under discussion now, and which was not approved of in the second reading either.</p>

<p>May I address you on the same point, Sir? The position here is perfectly simple. The new definition is proposed in the amendment before you. There are certain amendments moved by this side of the House to limit the application of that definition. My submission to you, Sir, is that it is always possible to move amendments limiting the application of a new Bill or a new proposal before the House, but not amendments to extend it.</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>May I just say something on the same point of order, Sir. As I see the position this point of order is based on the principle that no new ideas can be brought into the discussion during the Committee Stage, that no new principles can be introduced during the Committee Stage. I should like to refer you, Sir, to the book &#x201C;Parliamentary Procedure in South Africa&#x201D; by Kilpin, the third edition, where he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus this fundamental rule and in accordance with the large number of decisions from the Chair governing instructions from the House, there are two types of amendments which have to be specially watched. The first type consists of amendments which may only be moved on an instruction from the House, for instance amendments which although relevant to the subject matter introduce new and important principles.</block>

<p>I submit that in view of the fact the principle of re-classification exists, an amendment which limits re-classification is a totally new principle according to the definition. This definition was accepted in principle during the second reading and this definition is now being used to introduce a new principle, a principle which is dealt with in Section 11, namely that of reclassification and an attempt is now being made to curtail that principle of re-classification. In my opinion this is a completely new principle which is not permissible in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, may I address you on the same point. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) says this is a new principle, but in my submission it is not a new principle at all. The principle is a new definition of a White person and a new means of classification which brings in descent. Normally an Act only applies in any event in respect of the operation of that Act to future incidents after the passing of that Act. The hon. member for Ceres in his argument suggested that a new principle was being introduced in the amendment <span class="col_4847-4848" refersTo="page_1050"/>before the House. In my submission it merely seeks to ascertain and to make certain that the Bill will not operate retrospectively, which is the normal thing. In any event, the intention of this Bill, I believe, was clearly expressed by the hon. the Minister at the second reading, when he explained it to the House, and it is that explanation given in the second reading which this Committee is now considering, and the Minister said then that it was the intention not to apply this Act so as to re-classify persons who have already been classified.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I have not had the privilege of seeing the precise wording of the amendment but I wish to put this to you, Sir, that I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has given us only one facet of the truth, and that is that where a new principle is accepted in the second reading we can in the Committee Stage limit the scope of the application of that principle. I think for instance that an amendment which will have the effect that no person objecting after a certain date can rely on the provisions of this amendment, in other words, this amended Section 1 cannot retrospectively form the basis of an objection, would probably be a good amendment. But having listened hurriedly to the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North) I fully agree with the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) that amendment places a restriction on the right to object, which is dealt with in Section 11, and which has absolutely nothing to do with the definition and in my opinion that amendment is out of order, but I say that with reservation because I do not have it in front of me.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The last speaker said it was permissible to introduce an amendment at this stage which limits the application of a certain principle. The amendment presently before you does just that, in the sense that as it stands at present, as the amended definition stands at present, it will apply to two categories of persons, those who are still to be classified and those who have already been classified, and whose classification will perhaps be changed because of the new classification or the amendment of that classification. This amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) merely seeks to limit the application of it to one of those groups; it merely narrows the scope of it. It is not introducing anything new in so far as Section 5 or Section 11 is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As the Minister himself has stated, this new definition replaces the old one, and therefore the law is changed from that moment. Now the amendments that have been moved do not vary the principle and do not try to introduce a new principle. They simply seek clarity as to what extent this new definition will apply. It is the application of a new definition which both amendments are concerned with, and I would therefore urge that your ruling, Sir, should be that no new principle is being introduced.</p>

I personally have had much to do with classification cases and I think we should get down to bedrock and see what happens. These poor unfortunate people, when they do not have identity cards, either write to Pretoria or out of the blue they get a letter and I want hon. members to listen to the letter they receive.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I will come back to that. The position is to-day that there is a great danger in the admission, and in the amendment moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) we are trying to safeguard these people&#x2014;I will not say from their own folly, but it is quite simple for people to make admissions without any substance. <span class="col_4849-4850" refersTo="page_1051"/> When these people are called into the Registration Office and interrogated they make admissions which affect their lives. I am talking now about the people who have lived as Whites and are accepted as Whites, and who to all intents and purposes are White. We have such unfortunate people here, and this particular clause can affect these people, and I would like to ask the Minister to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South).</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened very carefully to all the arguments the Minister has advanced in reply to all the amendments I have moved, and to the amendment which I moved to my amendment to meet the objection of the Minister to the first amendment, and I must say that I am rather reminded if the verse from &#x201C;My Fair Lady&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oozing charm from every pore <br/>He oiled his way across the floor.</block>

<p>It is very obvious that the Minister is attempting to find some reason for not accepting the amendments moved. Surely if the Minister really wanted to meet the situation which he claims to exist, namely that it is the policy of this Government not to reclassify people already classified, he would have found some way of helping us to put it into the Bill, but he has not been very helpful and the hon. members behind him have aided and abetted him in rejecting this without putting up something in its place. I hope the Minister will show us that he has a little more feeling than he is displaying at this stage. If the Minister does not intend to classify people already classified, in terms of the new definition, and does not intend to have a witch-hunt, then why will he not accept this amendment to provide in the Bill positively once and for all that the rights of everyone presently classified will not in future be affected by this unless they themselves desire it or unless, to meet the objection of the Minister, in terms of Section 11, someone else has the right to object. In fact, I have not yet moved formally, although I have given the Minister a copy of it&#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end &#x201C;or upon the objection of any other person in terms of Section 11 of this Act and then only in terms of the definition existing before the passing of the Population Registration Amendment Act 1962&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In other words, the Minister&#x2019;s first objection to the amendment, that it would prevent people in terms of Section 11, that is other people, from objecting to the classification, is now met by this amendment, because it says &#x201C;in terms of Section 11&#x201D;. An objection by anyone else can still be made, but it must only be made in terms of the old definition in the Act, and not the definition contained in this clause. That will meet the Minister&#x2019;s only objection, by putting in this Bill the provision that there shall be no reclassification of persons already classified, an amendment put up on the word of the Minister given in the second reading, an undertaking by him. But when that is met, he now comes with another objection and says that this will now prevent <i>bona fide</i> mistakes being rectified. Clearly it is not going to do that. Clearly there is another provision of the Act which provides for that. Nowhere is that affected by this. It is a classification, and if the classification was made in error this is not a <i>bona fide</i> or proper classification. If what the Minister said in the second reading is what he really meant, namely that he is not going to reclassify anyone, then it seems to me that the Minister must either himself move an amendment acceptable to him or he must ask that this clause stand over so that he can get his legal advisers to go into the matter. If he did that he could meet the point raised by him. Therefore, I move this further amendment.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>After the diversion of the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), we reached the stage where we were really arguing on a petty legal basis. The Minister knows exactly the situation which this side of the House wishes to protect against. We have moved a number of amendments and have explained to the Minister what situation we wish to guard against. One is the reclassification under the new definition of persons already classified, and the other is the classification of those who have already applied but have not yet been classified under the previous definition. If the Minister will concede that he wishes to meet that situation, then one or other of the lawyers on this side will get together with the legal advisers and in five minutes an agreed draft amendment can be produced. No situation is incapable of being put down in words. Would the Minister be good enough to indicate whether he is prepared to accept any sort of definition which will cover the situation dealt with by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell)? If he is against meeting that situation, no matter what amendment is moved, a great deal of time can be saved and we need not bother about preparing anything to meet the needs of the Minister. If that is his standpoint, perhaps he will be good enough to say so, because so far his objection to the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North) is purely on the basis of draughtsmanship, and that can be overcome in five minutes. So if the Minister will give us a reply on that, a great deal of time can be saved. As far as my amendment is concerned, which is to meet those who have already applied but have not yet been classified, there again if the Minister would be good enough to indicate whether he would be prepared to accept any amendment a <span class="col_4851-4852" refersTo="page_1052"/>great deal of time can be saved, because the objection to my amendment is also on a purely legal basis, draughtsmanship, and it is quite easy to re-draft it to meet the Minister&#x2019;s objection that the old definition will have gone and consequently there are no standards whereby you can classify them. One could meet that objection quite easily by re-drafting it, but one does not want to go on putting amendments to meet objections purely based on draughtsmanship if we know that the Minister is opposed to meeting the case we are putting up under any circumstances. If the Minister takes the view that this amending Bill was introduced to meet the people who are not yet classified and he is accordingly prepared to classify those people only under the new definition, we know where we stand and we know it is not merely a question of legalistics that he objects to, but that he wants to use this Bill so that he can classify those people according to the new definition. If the Minister would be good enough to indicate where he stands on these two points, it would save a lot of time.</p>

<p>I find it very strange that hon. members opposite want to know from me what my attitude is in respect of the amendments. Surely that is not the way in which to move or consider amendments. In my second reading speech and in my reply&#x2014;and it appears fully in to-night&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i>&#x2014;I emphasized that no matter what happened, re-classification must remain as it is. I said unequivocally and without any reservation that the machinery for re-classification had to remain as provided for in Section 5 (3) and Section 11 of the principal Act&#x2014;we only have the addition to Section 11 of the amendment contained in Clause 3. Hon. members now make a sincere attempt, and I accept everything <i>bona fides,</i> to have all the assurances which I have given enshrined in the Act. It appears&#x2014;and this is a fact&#x2014;that if they close the one loophole another loophole appears somewhere else because what hon. members have been trying to do ever since this Bill has been published, has been considered for months by myself, the legal advisers, the Cabinet and everyone else who worked on it, in order to produce the best. I can tell hon. members that many changes were made in order to formulate it correctly because I tested it against every possible case that might arise. Hon. members have made it their business to mention many cases and to try to prove that a certain case will be hard hit under this definition, and I simply do not accept it. I maintain that under this Bill classification will be dealt with on a more fair basis to the satisfaction of everybody concerned, and the loopholes which threaten to burst open will be closed without anybody suffering an injustice. That is why I say that with the best will in the world I cannot accept one of those amendments which have been moved, with the exception of the amended one of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). If hon. members were perhaps to come with other amendments they will have to be considered. But those which have been moved so far are unacceptable to me. Surely it is wrong to hold that against me. The hon. member for Zululand says I must say whether I will accept any amendments. How can I say that I will not accept any amendment? Hon. members wish to have the weapon of being able to say that I only gave a number of assurances, but when the time came for me to enshrine those assurances in the Act, I refused&#x2014;in other words, I am a dishonest man who only uses words and tomorrow or the day after, having the Act at my disposal, I do something else. That is not fair. I say that is how it can be interpreted. I am not saying that is what hon. members have in mind. Hon. members cannot expect me to say, however, that I will not accept any amendments. I say that any amendment which is moved I will consider, and it is my duty to do so, and if I give my reasons why I cannot accept it, we can differ on that, but I cannot allow myself to be bullied into doing something which I do not want to do. That is why I am asking hon. members that if they have other amendments, to come forward with them. If we do not have the time to-night to discuss them, I am prepared to let Clause 1 stand over, but the amendments which I have had up to the present are unacceptable and consequently it is not necessary for me to move that the clause stand over.</p>

To which race do you belong?&#x201D; He replies: &#x201C;I am European.&#x201D; That is the point I wish the Minister to answer and that is the point which has worried many of us. The official has certain information in his possession that this man has a Coloured father or Coloured mother. The man is asked to what he admits and he says: &#x201C;I admit to be a European&#x201D;. The official who has information in his possession from the 1951 census, or by virtue of any other <span class="col_4853-4854" refersTo="page_1053"/>information, says to him: &#x201C;Do you admit that in 1951 your father wrote in the census form that you were Coloured?&#x201D; [Interjections.] I want it on record; if the Minister says that any admission extracted from the applicant in those circumstances will not be regarded as free and voluntary admission, I am prepared to accept the Minister&#x2019;s amendment.

<p>I want to ask the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) to do one thing and that is to take the Bill and to read it. Somebody is a White person who is so and so but not somebody who admits that he is a Coloured or a Native. I ask the hon. member with tears in my eyes what person who claims that he should be classified as a White person, will be so stupid as to admit that he is a Coloured or a Native? We are dealing with race classification. Will a person who tells you that he wants to be classified as a White person, be so stupid as to admit that he has Coloured blood in his veins? If I knew that my grandmother or grandfather had a little coloured blood in <span class="col_4855-4856" refersTo="page_1054"/>them, do you think for one moment, Mr. Chairman, that I will say to the officials: Look, I want to become White but I admit my grandmother had a little Coloured blood in her. I will not do that nor does the law compel me to admit it. If I do do it I do so voluntarily without any coercion. What are the people afraid of?

<p>There is no point to miss. If I have missed the hon. member&#x2019;s point I am glad that I have missed it, Mr. Chairman. In the judgment in the case of Rex vs. Gill it is stated clearly that we have nothing to do with that &#x201C;preponderance of blood&#x201D;in our race classification. We consider appearance and acceptance. I cannot understand why the hon. member for Boland does not want to accept that and how he can still say that somebody can be coerced or forced to make an admission. If he cannot understand that, there is nothing more that I can do make him understand it.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of Clause 1 in regard to which I do not feel completely happy. It was touched upon during the second reading debate but none of the amendments which has been moved so far has changed the position. I want to make this statement that if the assurances which the hon. the Minister has just given and which he gave when he introduced this Bill, were accepted, it will amount to this that the fear which hon. members say they harbour, is groundless and that the examples which other hon. members and the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) gave a moment ago have no bearing on what is intended here. The Minister stated clearly that what was intended here was to close the loopholes through which a certain person of the Chinese race had crawled and was classified as a White person. Why this situation in which we find ourselves? All these objections, this entire debate, all the difficulties which have been mentioned by members opposite and all the explanations would not have been necessary. Was it not possible to state specifically in Clause 1 what the intention was? Mr. Chairman, I think I have a strong argument and I wish to carry it further. Why does the Minister not want to specify what the intention is? I said during the second reading debate that the Coloureds were perturbed about the fact that they were being used as the ash-heap when it came to race classification. If there is a person whose descent is of such a nature that he does not fall into a specific group, he gets classified as a Coloured. (Kleurling).</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am speaking on Clause 1 specifically, more in particular the last two lines. Reference is made to &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; (gekleurde) which creates the impression that when a person cannot be classified, he is simply classified under that group. The reproach has been levelled at us that what is said in this House is used against South Africa in the world outside. The reason why South Africa is being besmirched is really to be found in the manner in which this Bill has been drafted. It says &#x201C;or anybody who admits that he is a native of a coloured (gekleurde)&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the words &#x201C;coloured person&#x201D; is used in the English text. In South Africa we understand &#x201C;a coloured person&#x201D;to be a Coloured. Had those words not appeared here, this discussion would not have been necessary. I object to the wording of this Clause. It specifically says &#x201C;coloured because had it referred to &#x201C;Chinese&#x201D; or &#x201C;Asiatic&#x201D; it would have harmed the name of South Africa. I accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurances. I will avail myself of them, of course, if ever I have to deal with such a case. I accept that the Minister will honour his assurances and his undertakings. The danger always exists, of course, that this hon. Minister will not always be administering this legislation. Another person may take over in the near future. That is very possible. He is not the only Minister of the Interior who has administered this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman I wish to confine myself to paragraph (b) of Clause 1 where reference is made to a &#x201C;coloured&#x201D; person. This whole debate would not have been necessary had it been the specific intention of the Minister to close the loopholes to which he referred and had he mentioned the racial groups which he wanted classified as coloured. I think that is an argument which cannot be cast aside. A great deal of time would have been saved had we known precisely where we stood. The Minister has repeatedly given us assurance as to the procedure which will be followed under the new definition and that he will not re-classify persons who have already been classified, and that evidence, which was to the detriment of the person, will not be used. We are grateful for these concessions. But cannot it be specifically stated in Clause 1 which racial groups, Chinese or Asiatic or whatever it may be, the Minister does not want classified as White? Had that been done there would not have been this misunderstanding and all this arguing would have been unnecessary and this entire discussion would have been unnecessary.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot agree with the Minister&#x2019;s argument when he replied to the amendment which I moved and he said that the evidence in the form of an admission will only come from those people who claim to be a Coloured person or a Native. This condition is contained in the definition of a &#x201C;White&#x201D; person. It is quite clear to me that this admission will come from the person who has been classified as White and who is to be re-classified. I have indicated my appreciation of the change in the wording which the Minister has moved in his second amendment to meet some of the difficulties I have referred to. Of course, the hon. gentleman will also know that I understand his difficulty in getting concessions in legal drafting to the extent to which he has gone. I would have preferred to have seen the words &#x201C;under oath&#x201D; included in the law itself. But knowing something about the difficulties which confront the staff in administering this Act and knowing also something about the competence, sincerity, and calibre of the senior members of the staff who deal with this Act I have not the slightest doubt that in practice they will adopt the procedure in cases as important as these of taking the information in the form of an affidavit. Although the law does not say so, I am sure the hon. the Minister will find that in practice that is what will happen. The time might well come when he will then see that it would have been quite appropriate to have put into the law, in the interests of the applicant concerned, these words &#x201C;under oath&#x201D;. I concede that the Minister&#x2019;s amendment goes a long way in removing some of the practical difficulties which I foresaw before this amendment was moved. At the appropriate time, therefore, Sir, I will withdraw my amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>May I refer the hon. the Minister to the statement he made in reply to the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) which asks for consideration to be given to those people who have already applied for their classification and whose applications are already in possession of the Department, that it should not be necessary for them to re-submit applications in terms of the new definition. The hon. the Minister will remember that he told us that he had a very simple answer to that. In fact it is so simple that I do not think we can really accept it. The simple answer was that, with the passing of this Bill the old definition will disappear and be replaced by this new definition. Those applicants will therefore really have no old definition for their applications to be judged upon. But whilst we are discussing this Bill the old definition still stands. This Bill is not law as yet. However, that is not the point I want to argue. I want to raise this point with the hon. the Minister: The hon. the Minister has been faced to-night with a number of legal questions on the definition. I want to put a human one to him. Those 30,000 people to whom the Minister has referred have in many cases gone through several months of extreme mental anguish in preparing the answers to the questions put to them by the Department, in getting the affidavits ready, in going to their friends and all the rest required of them. As far as it was possible for them to do so they have tried to comply with the legal conditions which existed at the time their race classification was questioned. In terms of those conditions they have submitted their applications to the Department. It may well be that having to deal with a large number of cases the Department itself has not been able to come to finality on a number of those applications, through no fault of the applicant at all. I know from experience how difficult it is to rake up sufficient evidence to justify your giving the affidavit which a Member of Parliament is called upon to give. That in itself takes quite a time. I want the Minister to reconsider the position. The hon. the Minister has told us that the old definition will disappear and that the new definition will apply and that they will now have to be classified in terms of the new definition. I want to put this to the hon. the Minister. Surely he is not going to subject those 30,000 people to another two or three months of intense mental anguish, anguish which they have already passed through in meeting the law as it stood. Now that the law has been changed they will have to go through the whole harrowing experience again. To me it seems a perfectly fair proposition which we have put in the amendment and one in respect of which you can give any number of sound precedents. Whenever a law is changed and a new law is brought into operation, a proviso is usually inserted that the new law will not apply to people who were dealt with by the law before it was changed. I want to ask the Minister whether he will not reconsider the position in the case of these outstanding applications, where they were in the hands of the Department prior to the date on which this Bill was introduced, or prior to the date from which the hon. the Minister himself said he froze the issue of any further classifications, whether he will not allow them to be judged according to the conditions and definition which existed at the time they were called upon to submit their evidence and at the time they made these statements. To me it is a perfectly fair proposition. It is one which deals from the human angle with cases in which, as the hon. the Minister himself has admitted, intense human feelings are concerned and in which the people themselves have to be protected from any anguish and hardship which they are bound to suffer as a result of this legislation. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister, quite apart from the legal aspect, to accept a proviso of that sort and when the new definition comes into force, if and when this Bill is passed, to start the classification off with those people who fall under the new definition and not to include those who have already complied with the law as it existed before this amending Bill became law.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It has taken us something over two hours to lift the veil of sweet reasonableness by which we were in danger of being beguiled over what the Government&#x2019;s real intentions are insofar as Clause 1 of this Bill is concerned. This much we now know at last: The Government is not under any circumstances prepared to allow people who have presently applied for classification, to be classified under the old definition. It is quite clear, Sir, at last that this Bill has been brought in <span class="col_4861-4862" refersTo="page_1057"/>specifically to deal with persons whose applications are presently lying on the desks of the officials of the Department. Secondly, it is clear that the hon. the Minister is not prepared under any circumstances to enshrine in legislation the assurances which he has given to this House on a number of occasions. The House can draw its own conclusions why he refuses to do that. It is an unhappy position for anyone to have to draw those conclusions. We might have come to this conclusion earlier had we paid less attention to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s honeyed words and more attention to the reasons he gave for refusing the amendments which have been brought forward by this side of the House. I should like to deal with one of those reasons, Sir. The Minister said that he could not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) because it did away with the public&#x2019;s right to object, a right which they had had for 12 years. It is touching, Sir, to find solicitude in certain circles for the rights of the public. It is nice to hear that said occasionally, particularly from certain quarters. But what argument is that for refusing an amendment when in the next breath the hon. the Minister says that the right was not exercised by one single member of the public in 12 to 14 years. That was the principal reason he gave for refusing the amendment. We have at last got down to brass tacks. We know exactly where we stand in regard to this Clause and at last we know the reasons why it has been introduced. They are not pretty, Sir, but it is a pity that we had to waste something over two hours before we got any clarity on that point at all. That being the position we at least know that there is no point in moving any further amendments in this regard and we at least know that the honeyed persuaveness which we have had up to the present time has not been put forward in order to expose the Minister&#x2019;s thoughts to this House but to disguise them.</p>
