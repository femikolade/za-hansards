<heading>SPECIAL REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS BILL</heading>

<p>Dr. JONKER, as Chairman, brought up a Special Report of the Select Committee on the subject of the Undesirable Publications Bill, as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Your Committee has given careful consideration to the South African Press Union&#x2019;s published self-disciplinary code for newspapers which are members of this Union and is of the opinion that if the proposed disciplinary board should succeed in persuading all its members to abide by the suggested code of conduct the code will eliminate the evils which the legislation, the subject of which has been referred to your Committee, seeks to combat. Under the circumstances your Committee considers that the South African Press Union should be given the opportunity to apply its proposed scheme in practice and to prove that this code can be effectively applied. Your Committee has therefore decided not to make any legislation which it may submit to the House, applicable to newspapers which are members of the Press Union.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>In connection with the acceptance of this proposal, I should like to make it perfectly clear that the Government has had the opportunity to note this proposal which the Select Committee submits for the consideration of this House, namely that any legislation which it may submit to the House in its final report will not be made applicable to the newspapers which are members of the Press Union. The Government would like to endorse the Select Committee&#x2019;s decision with regard to this matter and give the assurance in advance that if the Select Committee excludes from this proposed legislation the aforementioned category of newspapers, namely those which are members of the Press Union, the Government will approve of it and accept it.</p>

<p>The Government welcomes the self-disciplinary code drawn up by the Press Union and believes that the code of conduct as published in the Press offers a means of combating the evils which the proposed legislation sought to combat. At this stage, therefore, it would probably be wrong on the part of the Government to duplicate steps which are taken to combat the same evils. It goes without saying that in taking this step the Press Union is taking very much greater responsibility on its shoulders, and this in turn brings with it greater obligations towards its readers and its supporters and towards the interests of the country and the nation, but the <i>bona fides</i> of the Press Union are accepted, and I should like to make use of this opportunity to wish its members every success with the application of the code of conduct which the Press Union itself has drawn up and accepted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>On behalf of this side of the House I wish to say that it is satisfactory to know that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Select Committee as set forth in this report. Speaking for myself, I am sure that the Press Union is a responsible body. I think the Government has been wise in accepting the offer made to allow a body of that nature to apply a disciplinary code such as the one they have published. Acceptance by the Government of this report means that it will ease the burden originally placed upon the committee of this House and will now enable the committee to continue its inquiry into the further aspects of the scope of the Bill which has been referred to it.</p>

<p><span class="col_1433-1434" refersTo="page_733"/>This being an agreed measure and the rest of the business of the committee being in effect <i>sub judice,</i> it seems to me that this would be an appropriate time to move&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Before calling upon the hon. the Minister of Transport to move the motion, I wish to remind hon. members that on the motion for the House to go into Committee on the Estimates of Additional Expenditure, as well as at later stages, the debate must be confined to the subjects contained in the Estimates and the reasons for the increase in expenditure. Discussion should not re-open the question of policy involved in the original grant.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee on the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure to be defrayed from Railways and Harbours Revenue Funds during the year ending 31 March 1962, and on the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works to be defrayed during the same period.</block>

<p>As hon. members will note from the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure from revenue funds, which I have already tabled, provision is being made for additional expenditure amounting to R4,333,552 which will have to be incurred during the current financial year. However, appreciable savings have been effected, so that the additional funds now being asked for will not increase the amount already voted in the Main Estimates and the First Additional Estimates for the present financial year.</p>

<p>The original Estimates provided for an amount of R419,396,200, the First Additional Estimates for R56,421,942, and these Additional Estimates for R4,333,552; i.e. a total amount of R480,151,694. It will be noted from the latest Estimates tabled that savings are estimated at R49,583,494, so that the total revised Estimates now amount to R430,568,200.</p>

<p>I want to inform the House that the salaries of Railway Commissioners have been increased from R6.000 to R6,800 per annum as from 1 April 1961. It will be noted that in the present Estimates under the head Miscellaneous Costs, against which their salaries are debited, additional funds are not being asked for because of savings which are expected to be made under this head as a whole. I intend, however, when the Finance Bill is introduced later this Session, including a paragraph which will make provision for the necessary approval to be granted by Parliament in this regard.</p>

<p>Hon. members will therefore be able to debate this matter during the Main Budget debate, if they so desire.</p>

<p>I briefly want to explain the factors which are responsible for the additional funds being asked for.</p>

<p>The most important item under Railways is the one under Head No. 2&#x2014;Maintenance of Permanent Way and Works&#x2014;which is due to increased Sunday time and overtime payments, the consolidation of cost-of-living allowances, salary concessions to clerical and related personnel, and also increased expenditure due to washaways and maintenance of the permanent way.</p>

<p>There is an increase of R761,984 under Head No. 4&#x2014;Running Expenses&#x2014;chiefly caused by increased Sunday time and overtime payments to trained staff and higher expenditure on coal and electrical power due to an increase in traffic and the increased price of coal.</p>

<p>I feel, Mr. Speaker, that I must come back for a moment to the amount I mentioned as being savings, because I am afraid that perhaps there may be a misconception. It is the amount of R49,583,494 which I mentioned. This may perhaps be understood to be a saving on the general running costs of the Railways. But this is mainly the savings effected on the payment of cost-of-living allowances as the result of consolidation. Originally in the Estimates provision was made for the payment of this amount as cost-of-living allowances; when consolidation took place the payment of cost-of-living allowances of course fell away. I would not like the country to be under a misapprehension that such a considerable amount was saved in other ways.</p>

<p>The increase of R697,042 under Head No. 5&#x2014;Traffic Expenses&#x2014;is also due to the improved salary scales of clerical and related personnel, additional Sunday time and overtime payments, consolidation of cost-of-living allowances, and also an increase in the cost of supplies and equipment, due to the increase in traffic.</p>

<p>The provision of R487,360 under Head No. 12&#x2014;Subsidiary Services&#x2014;is mainly due to increased repairs to road motor vehicles which have been in service for an appreciable time already.</p>

<p>The increase of R53,884 under Interest on Superannuation and other funds&#x2014;Head No. 15&#x2014;arises as the result of the increase in the Insurance Fund balance and the Elimination of Railway Crossings Fund.</p>

<p>The amount under Head No. 17&#x2014;Miscellaneous Expenditure&#x2014;represents a large number of smaller items arising from unforeseen circumstances. The first amount of R95,000 under this head is required to strengthen the <span class="col_1435-1436" refersTo="page_734"/>Benevolent Fund in order to cover the payment of special allowances to the increased number of pensioners and the recipients of widows&#x2019; pensions.</p>

<p>Certain investments have been realized during the financial year and re-investment at appreciably higher rates of interest. It is true that the cost connected to this amounts to R177,548, but the transactions will in the long run be of considerable financial advantage to the Administration.</p>

<p>The amount of R30,248 under Bad Debts and Sundry Items represents a number of relatively minor items consisting mainly of under-charges in regard to railage.</p>

<p>In the Main Estimates provision has been made for a nominal amount of R12,000 in respect of the repayment of amounts retained as penalties for liquidated damages due to delayed deliveries by contractors, but the actual amount required for this is R90,000 more.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 24&#x2014;Interest on Capital: Harbours&#x2014;an amount of R76,201 is being asked for because the actual interest-bearing expenditure has amounted to a larger sum than was provided for in the original Estimates.</p>

<p>The increase of R208,826 under Head No. 28&#x2014;Airways: Exploitation and Maintenance&#x2014; was due to an increase in services with accompanying higher expenditure&#x2014;mainly fuel.</p>

<p>An additional amount of R 100,424 is required for interest on capital, particularly as the result of increased working capital in respect of spare parts for Boeing aircraft.</p>

<p>The amount of R1,250 under Head No. 30 &#x2014; Miscellaneous Expenditure &#x2014; represents a number of smaller items, whilst the amount of R34,500 is required in respect of the S.A. Airways&#x2019; share of compensation which in terms of a pool agreement is paid by B.O.A.C. to Central African Airways for losses on regional traffic.</p>

<p>In regard to the Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works, I just want to say the following. In the Second Additional Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works provision is made for an amount of R2,517,000 which has to be voted to cover expenditure under various heads. It will, however, not be necessary to obtain additional loan funds to defray this expenditure, seeing that sufficient savings are available for that purpose.</p>

<p>Of the additional amount of R2,031,000 under Head No. 2&#x2014;New Works on Open Lines&#x2014;almost half is required to cover delayed debits of more than R2,000 for each work in respect of works which were expected to have been completed by the end of the previous financial years. That is in accordance with Resolution No. 6 in the Second Report of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours, 1949.</p>

<p>I shall deal briefly with the most important items in the Estimates.</p>

<p>During the building of the railway line Ogies/Van Dyksdrif&#x2014;as authorized by Construction Act No. 38 of 1946&#x2014;an agreement was entered into with the mining company Transvaal Consolidated Land and Exploration Company Ltd., in terms of which the Railway Administration must compensate the company for loss of profits in respect of coal which cannot be developed as the result of the building of the railway line. Payment in terms of the agreement was to take place when the coal, during the normal working of the mine, would have been developed. This stage has already been reached and a claim for the amount of R650,000 must now be paid. A special power of attorney for payment of this amount has already been obtained from the State President.</p>

<p>As the result of the terrain conversion schemes necessary to provide for the quadrupling of the Natal main line between Durban and Booth, the terrain at Congella is being abandoned, and the activities shifted to the marshalling yard at Bayhead. It has, therefore, become necessary, in order to ensure the smooth flow of traffic, to provide staging roads at Churchill Road which will serve as receiving and despatch depots. This work is being carried out simultaneously with the doubling and electrification of the railway line between Alice Street and Duff&#x2019;s Road. It is expected that the amount of R177,900 will be required for this purpose during the current financial year. A special power of attorney has already been received from the State President for this amount.</p>

<p>Further, an amount of R350.000 is required to defray betterment expenditure in respect of various relaying projects.</p>

<p>Of the additional amount of R182,300 provided for under Head No. 3&#x2014;Rolling Stock&#x2014; R109,600 is intended for the replacement of bell buffers on locomotives and coal trucks by automatic couplers. This is a safety measure, it speeds up shunting and to a large extent eliminates the high maintenance costs of the old type of couplings. The balance of R72,700 is required for delayed debits.</p>

<p>The additional amount of R110,200 under Heads Nos. 5 and 7 represent delayed debits in respect of works not included in the Estimates of the current year, in view of the fact that it was expected that they would be completed before 31 March 1961.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 8&#x2014;Working Capital (Recoverable Advances)&#x2014;provision is made for an amount of R150,000 advanced to the Sick Fund of the S.A.R. &amp; H. There are indications that the working results of the Sick Fund for the current financial year will show an appreciable deficit, which is mainly due to the increased expenditure on Sick Fund services, viz. the services of doctors and specialists, hospitalization, drugs and medicine. This increase in expenditure is firstly due to the abolition of free hospitalization in the Cape Province and the Transvaal, the increased hospital tariffs and the fact that more patients <span class="col_1437-1438" refersTo="page_735"/>were admitted; secondly, the increased expenditure on drugs and medicine is due to the fact that new and more expensive preparations were used; thirdly, the increased utilization of auxiliary services and the services of specialists; and, fourthly, because it was found necessary to increase the salaries of Railway doctors and specialists in order to keep pace with the latest developments in this sphere. A special power of attorney has been obtained from the State President for this amount.</p>

<p>The balance of R43,500 under Head No. 8 is required to finance the building of a private branch line for Messrs. Ingeni Quarries (Pty.) Ltd., to whom the contract for the supply of ballast to the Railways on the north coast line has been awarded. The company is not able itself to finance the work connected with the building of the branch line and the Railway Administration is advancing the necessary funds on condition that the whole amount be repaid during the term of the contract which expires in September 1964. The conditions attaching to the agreement entered into afford sufficient protection of the interests of the Administration.</p>

<p>When the First Additional Estimates for the year 1961-2 were passed, it was the intention that the works for which provision was made in it would be financed from loan funds and the Betterment Fund, as set out in the Third Schedule to Act No. 63 of 1961. Sufficient savings, however, have now been effected under other heads to finance those works, as also those contained in these second additional Estimates. Therefore, there is no necessity to obtain additional loan funds, and a special paragraph in that regard has been included in the Additional Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill.</p>

<p>I intend introducing my Budget for the financial year 1962-3 on 7 March 1962, and in the circumstances I trust that these Additional Estimates will not take up too much of the time of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the almost minute detail in which he has dealt with the main items of these additional expenditures. I am thankful that he was able to pass me a copy of his speech just as he started to make it; but he will realize that even with that advantage it is difficult to follow all the reasons that he has given to justify these additional demands. As is usual we will leave the detailed examination of some of the items to those members on this side who feel they would like to raise them at a later stage in Committee.</p>

<p>From the copy of the speech which I have here. Sir, it seems that we have before us for consideration Estimates of Additional Expenditure for some R4.3 million to be defrayed from Railway and Harbour Revenue Funds for this financial year and the sum of some R2.5 million on capital and betterment works, bringing the revised total, in that respect, to some R106.3 million. If I might go back just temporarily, Sir, to the additional expenditure from Revenue Funds, it now adds up to a total of estimated expenditure of R480 million. There are so-called savings of R49&#x00BD; million and the total revised figure now is some R430.5 million. I said &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; savings, because very often what is given off as savings is really the result brought about by optimistic over-estimation and not really actual savings at all. It is, in fact, overprovision. We have always asked the Minister to watch those tendencies carefully. We hope he will be more careful in future than he has been on all of these previous occasions. On capital and betterment works so-called savings that are not available to meet excess expenditure, amount to some R28.5 million, leaving a total of revised estimates there of some R77.7 million. I notice in the Minister&#x2019;s explanation that in the matter of the increase in the salaries of Railway Commissioners, he will regularize the increase of R800 later in the Finance Bill. We are grateful for his explanation in that regard. I notice that he did not give any explanation in respect of the gratuitous payment to one of the members of the Commission. He was significantly silent and that item will be closely examined when we go into Committee.</p>

<p>I may say, Sir, that it is not easy for us, as &#x201C;shareholders&#x201D; in the Railways (as we have been described by the Minister), to have more than a vague idea of what the financial position of the Railways is, as of now. One of our functions, and a function which we are trying with difficulty to fulfil in this debate, is to exercise a financial check on the Government and on the Railway Administration. We find it extremely difficult to do so when the latest figures that we have available are those for October. And these are published in the <i>South African Railway News</i> for December which in turn was only made available to us on 6 February. It makes it extremely difficult, Sir. I did address a question to the hon. the Minister earlier this Session asking him to give us more up-to-date figures. He replied and said that he would make more recent figures known in the main Budget on 7 March. I had, of course, no alternative but to accept that unsatisfactory state of affairs, As I say, the Minister must be aware&#x2014; and I hope his action is not deliberate&#x2014;that this makes it exceedingly difficult for us to criticize his financial expenditure in a way that we would like to do. At on time, as the hon. the Minister knows, we used to get weekly statements of revenue earnings for all services but those have been discontinued. They are now published in the <i>Gazette</i> but the <i>Gazette</i> appears rather late for our purposes. The Minister discontinued this service to us because, as he claimed, they only gave one side of the picture and therefore gave a false and erroneous impression. Yet the Minister himself must get weekly figures. He must get a profit and loss account every week. So I beg of him to try to see if he cannot supply us with up-to-date information so that we can discuss the financial position of the Railways and criticize Additional Appropriations more intelligently than is now possible.</p>

<p>I see that these expenditures contain, amongst other things, as the Minister has pointed out, a sum of some R45 million in &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; savings. I think the Minister said&#x2014;I hope I heard him clearly&#x2014;that this really was in relation to the non-payment of cost-of-living allowances &#x2026;</p>

<p>I thought so, but as I said, we too should be allowed a little bit of latitude in this matter. I am glad that the Minister has confirmed my thoughts.</p>

<p>We also have an item here which shows that on Loan Vote Capital Expenditure R20,000,000 was not called upon. I should like to ask the Minister if he realizes the possible serious consequences of that practice of over-provision for this country. When the Railways ask for these loan facilities and do not use them, it must of necessity crowd out the loan requirements of other Departments and it might in that way retard our economic progress.</p>

<p>This is Gilbertian. It seems that this gentleman was prematurely retired at his own wish, but did not really want to retire. His services were so valuable that he was retained by the Administration in another responsible capacity. I realize that the Minister is not always his own master in his own house. In this case he had to obey another, bigger boss. I suggest that his explanation is rather superficial; that the real reason is something entirely different from what he tells us. I suggest further that it is a bad principle for railway commissioners to be drawn from the ranks of politicians. We have had Dr. van Abo as a railway commissioner for some time. He represented engineering interests and he knew his job thoroughly. He is now taken away from his semi-technical job to make way for yet another politician on the Railway Board. Using the Railways for political purposes is not correct. The Minister knows that the 1909 Act says that the railway commissioners should be nonpolitical. I am afraid all parties have erred in the past by making political appointments. But it is high time this practice ceased. I think the Minister should stop it. The Railways and Harbours Board was originally intended to protect the Railways and Harbours from political influences. It was intended to see that the administration of the Railways did not come under undue interference from the Government. This Minister has departed from that policy entirely. I am sure that in the interests of the Railways, the Minister should not allow this process to proceed any further. If Dr. van Abo had been replaced by an engineer I would have had nothing against it. But he merely had to make way as the result of a political manoeuvre. Dr. van Abo had to go to make way for Mr. de Villiers so that Mr. Waring could take his Vasco seat. That is not the right way to run a business, and the Railways should be run on business lines. I am sure the Minister in his heart of hearts disapproves as strongly as I do of this political manoeuvring to get a so-called English-speaking member into this House. It should not take place. I would like to know whether the Minister really approves of this whole sordid transaction?</p>

<p>I do not quite agree with the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). He correctly stated that this was the practice of all previous Governments. I know that when we took over Mr. Louis Esselen was the General Secretary of the United Party, but he was a member of the Railway Board, and also Mr. Teichman. This was the usual practice in the past. But I think it is valuable to have politicians, or at least ex-politicians, on the Railway Board. It is necessary, particularly when you deal with staff matters, that you should have a man there who has concentrated on staff matters during his political career and who has come into contact with the staff and knows their requirements. So I certainly do not agree that there should be no politicians on the Railway Board. I think they serve a very useful purpose indeed.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What has Queenstown got to do with it? The hon. member does not know what he is talking about. He is probably still regretting Queenstown. I might say also that the gentleman who was appointed, Mr. de Villiers, is a man whom I find fully competent to do the work and I think he is a valuable acquisition to the Railway Board. The Railway Board occupies quite a different position to-day from what it did just after 1910, as the hon. member knows. To-day, to a large extent, the Railway Board is merely an advisory body. It has no executive function, except that it is the final court of appeal in regard to appeals lodged by the staff. Apart from that, it of course has certain functions in regard to finances. I personally think that the Railway Board should be balanced. The chairman of the Board is an economist who has the respect of everybody who knows him. and the other two members, Mr. du Plessis and Mr. de Villiers, are known to hon. members of this House. Both of them were chairmen of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours. I think the knowledge they have of railway matters in general and of staff matters in particular is very valuable to any member of the Railway Board. This has nothing to do with politics. It is quite incidental that a vacancy was created for Mr. de Villiers and as the result of his appointment Minister Waring was nominated in his seat, <span class="col_1443-1444" refersTo="page_738"/>but although it was incidental I think it is a very good thing that it did happen.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Minister should be more frank and less warying about this situation. The hon. the Minister quoted Section 136 of the South Africa Act to justify the item which appears on the Estimates. Sir, Section 125 of the South Africa Act says that the salaries of the commissioners shall be fixed by Parliament and shall not be reduced during their term of office. Therefore, when Mr. van Abo was appointed, Parliament, in one way or another, fixed his terms of remuneration, and this is not within the provisions of Section 136 at all. It is something over and above what was fixed upon in terms of Section 136, and it is not a salary because that is what Section 136 says shall be fixed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<p>You mean Section 126.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, I am quoting from Section 126, which says that the salary shall be fixed by Parliament, and presumably that was done in some way. There is, therefore, no justification for what the Minister originally explained, because this is a gratuity, and I think the Committee is entitled to fuller details as to why this gratuity is being granted, on what basis it is calculated and for what purpose it is being granted. Therefore, I think the Minister should be a little more frank.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>May I just explain to the hon. member that Section 126 provides for the fixing of salaries, but this gratuity scheme was formulated in 1956. It is not a special gratuity scheme merely for the retiring commissioner, Dr. van Abo. As a matter of fact, the widow of Hr. Haywood, who died last year&#x2014;Parliament agreed to it and she received a gratuity in terms of that scheme. So this is not a new thing. It was actually introduced in 1956. Similar gratuity schemes were introduced for members of different boards some years ago, and the Railway Commissioners were brought into line with the members of certain boards.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to raise two matters with the hon. the Minister under (d) and (e). The Minister explained that the increase under (d), bad debts and sundry items including <i>ex gratia</i> refunds, was due to a large number of small items having been added. Sir, the increase here is in the nature of a 75 per cent increase and I think the Committee is entitled to a more explicit explanation as to why such a large increase has come about, because this certainly is not a case where a nominal amount was put on the original Estimates. The amount provided in the original Estimates was R40,000, whereas it has now been increased by 75 per cent.</p>

<p>Then I would also like the Minister to deal with (e), where the increase is from R12,000 to R90,000. There the Minister did explain that the R12,000 was merely a nominal provision. Will the Minister tell us what was the expenditure under this head the previous year, so that there may be some sort of comparison? R90,000 is being provided for the year 1961-2, but there is nothing to indicate what the comparative figure was in 1960-1. Will the Minister please give us that information?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to Item (d), bad debts and sundry items including <i>ex gratia</i> refunds, the figure is as follows. The increase is due to provision being made for an anticipated net increase&#x2014;an amount of R18,245 owing to the Administration by Messrs. Union Steel Corporation of South Africa Ltd. in respect of railage undercharged on traffic hauled locally between private sidings is being written off as a charge against bad debts and sundry items, the undercharge having arisen through the Administration&#x2019;s error and unfortunately having become prescribed; and R20,446 represents portion of under-charges due to the wrong rate being charged on consignments of ammunition consigned during the period June 1956 to February 1958 by the British Admiralty from Jan Kemp Dorp to Simonstown. The amount is being written off as even on legal grounds it is doubtful whether the recovery could be made. The <i>ex gratia</i> refund of R518 was made to Clerk P. A. van Straten, being portion of the cost of repairs and renovations recovered from him on a property re-allocated under the house ownership scheme on his transfer for departmental reasons. The property was reallocated in error as it was defective and should have been disposed of. That accounts for the total amount R30,248.</p>

<p>With regard to Item (e), that is increased <span class="col_1445-1446" refersTo="page_739"/>provision required in respect of refunds in justifiable circumstances of amounts claimed by contractors as damages for late deliveries. The hon. member knows that there is a penalty clause in all the contracts and a certain amount is retained for late deliveries, but when the contractor makes out a good case for a refund of the whole amount, or part of it, it is considered by the Administration and a refund is made.</p>

There is an existing water supply and certain repairs had to be done. A float chamber, a float and a valve had to be fitted to the pump.

That was estimated by both the mining company and by the Railway Administration, and I think they also called in the assistance of the Department of Mines.

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<p>In line 6, to omit &#x201C;an act or omission in conflict with a&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a breach of&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The amendment is a very simple one and it logically follows on the contention advanced on this side of the House during the second reading debate. The intention of the Bill is to restore the Roman Dutch law principle dealing with penalties and liquidated damages. That being so I think it would be wise to adhere as closely as possible to the language which is used by the courts and their interpretation of the original principle in giving effect to it. I know that it might be argued that the words &#x201C;an act or omission in conflict with a contractual obligation&#x201D; is in fact a breach. If that argument is to be used, then all I can say is that it seems to me to be an argument in favour of the adoption of the simpler term &#x201C;a breach of&#x201D;, because that is the language which is well known in the judicial world, and significantly enough, it would then also bring the section into line with the marginal note. The marginal note to this clause says, &#x201C;stipulations for penalties in case of breach of contract to be enforceable&#x201D;, and since the marginal note uses what I consider the correct terminology I cannot see any justification for leaving it out of the clause itself. We have no conflict with the hon. the Minister in regard to the provisions of the Bill, and the purpose of my amendment is rather to avoid confusion and not to add an additional difficulty in the interpretation of a principle which is now going to be set out by statute instead of being part of our common law. I hope the hon. the Minister will give consideration to this suggestion because I do not think it does anything to harm the provision which is contained in the clause, but I do think it makes its interpretation simpler.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I had the opportunity of discussing the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment with the law advisers, and my information in this connection is that the Law Revision Committee considered this matter very thoroughly and that the text of this Bill is the responsibility of this Committee generally. It is just possible&#x2014;at this stage I do not want to say that is so&#x2014;that if we accept the words proposed by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) we shall be accepting something with a narrower meaning than the words actually contained in this clause. I have already said that the Law Revision Committee as a whole accepted responsibility for the drafting of this Bill as far back as 1950. The then chairman of the Law Revision Committee is a person who is not unknown to my hon. friends on the other side. I refer to His Honour Mr. H. A. Fagan. Who am I to quarrel with his words in a Bill of this kind? These words were chosen with great circumspection, and since the dispute here is not on a matter of principle but purely a matter of wording and since my information from the law advisers is that this correctly sets out what the entire Law Revision Committee decided, I do not think we should split hairs about words &#x2014;we should rather leave the wording as it stands here. I do not say that because I do not want to meet the hon. member; I say it because I want to guard myself against the possibility that a different interpretation may then be placed upon this text. In those circumstances I am sorry that I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

It is a well-known term. When they go and see their lawyers they can advise them what that means, and it just may mean something different, and if it does mean something different then I think some explanation other than that the Law Revision Committee wants it to remain should be given.

<p>Well, then, someone along the line, presumably the law adviser, has seen the advisability of choosing what I believe and what my hon. friends over here and what I believe the Minister believes is the correct term and that is &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;. I think it is a pity that we should not deal with the matter as I believe we ought to deal with it. I think we should use the language that we are all agreed upon. I do not think that we should use different language merely for the reason that a different body, not the legislative body, has chosen different words. I have little doubt, knowing the stature and the ability of the men in question, that if the argument had been put to them, they might well have said, &#x201C;yes, we believe that is the best language to use&#x201D;. It is quite evident that the law advisers regard the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; as the better term because that is the term that they have introduced into the marginal note. I agree with the hon. the Minister that there is no principle involved here, except the principle that legislation passed by this House should be couched in the best form in which we can put it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. FOUCH&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to make it clear at the very outset, for the sake of the record, that the hon. the Minister mentioned the name of a prominent jurist here simply to show the House and hon. members on the other side that the members of the Law Revision Committe, who asked for this Bill and for the wording in this clause, are enlightened and well-read people. They are people with legal experience, and I resent the fact that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) sought to attribute to the Minister an attitude which the Minister did not adopt. Then I want to say that I agree with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) that as far as possible we should try to draft our legislation in the correct words. I would also say to the hon. member that as I see this matter I would say that the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; as proposed by him would be the most convenient term to use in this clause. But the point is that the Law Revision Committee asked for this Bill, and the people who serve on that Law Revision Committee are people who have to do with the practical working of this measure from day to day. They are the people who asked for this wording. The hon. the Minister has told us that these are the words for which they asked. I want to appeal to hon. members not to come along and say that the hon. the Minister is shielding behind the Law Revision Committee. The point is that the Law Commission asked for these words. Let me say, as the hon. the Minister also stated, that we can see no objection to the words proposed by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) but the Law Revision Committee asked for these words with a specific purpose and. as the hon. the Minister has said, it is possible that having accepted this amendment and having amended the Bill as proposed by the hon. member, we may then find that the words accepted by us do not have the same scope as the words for which the Law Revision Committee specifically asked. If anything then goes wrong the responsibility would be on the shoulders of the hon. the Minister and on the shoulders of this whole House. I would therefore appeal to hon. members to accept this wording.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield has now repeated what the hon. the Minister said, namely, that the Revision Commission has asked for this clause to be passed and that the Revision Commission drafted the Bill which they presented to us. We on this side of the House, as also the hon. member for Smithfield, agree that the words &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; are preferable. It is a term which we all understand. But the Minister says, and so does the hon. member for Smithfield, that we must accept the wording as drafted by the Revision Commission because the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; may not cover what they intended. Now I submit that if that is so, we should rather find out from the Revision Commission what the objection is against the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; because if they intended these words that they use &#x201C;act or omission&#x201D; to mean something else than a breach of contract, we should know, Sir. We are passing the law. The Revision Commission is not passing the law and if those words mean something else than &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;, we in this House should know exactly what they do mean. On the other hand, if they do mean nothing else but &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; then we appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept the accepted phrase, the words we have all become accustomed to using. We know exactly what &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; means. If there is a chance of these words &#x201C;act or omission&#x201D; meaning something more than &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;, as the hon. the Minister himself said, then we have no right to pass this Bill. We must know exactly what it means. My difficulty is this: Some of the members of the Law Revision Committee may sit in judgment on this Act, and the ordinary interpretation by the laymen and by the lawyers may be one thing, but when the matter is taken before a court on which may be sitting some of the members of the Law Revision Committee, they will interpret it as they intended it to be. It may not be what the Legislature intended it to be. The Legislature, as far as I can make out from what the hon. member for Smithfield said and what the Minister said, intends that it should merely cover a breach of contract. If that is our intention, we should say so, and we should not then use words which may have some other meaning, as was submitted by the Minister himself.</p>

I don&#x2019;t know that there is no difference between these two terms &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; and &#x201C;act or omission in conflict The one that we know should remain if there is no difference.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister may say that we know them both. That is correct. We know both expressions, but this is intended to apply in the event of a breach of contract. Now if they are the same thing, then why is a different expression used from the one which is known to all lawyers, to all laymen, to all businessmen, to all the Judges? If they are in fact synonymous it is very odd that different expressions are being used, and it makes one think that in fact the meaning of &#x201C;an act or omission in conflict&#x201D; is something different. <i>Prima facie</i> it is something different. You can have an act or omission which is in conflict with a contractual obligation but is not necessarily a breach of that contractual duty. I mention that here because it is something that occurs to one by just looking at it. The words don&#x2019;t mean the same thing, and I must remind the hon. the Minister that when provision was made in the Act of 1935, when this matter came up the last time in this House, provision was made for precisely the same principle as is involved in this Bill and that Bill also went to the Law Revision Committee, and the members of that Law Revision Committee were also very distinguished people, possibly even more distinguished people, and the expression which they used in the 1935 Act was &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;. Now here is an expression used which our law does not know, and I am surprised at the hon. member for Smithfield adopting the attitude he has adopted. He knows that this expression is not to be found in the Roman-Dutch Law, let alone in our case law. I appeal again to the hon. the Minister to accept the amendment in the interest of the ordinary business people who will be called upon to make contracts.</p>

On that point we were entirely <i>ad idem.</i> I have told hon. members that the reason why I do not want to accept the words proposed by them is that there is a possibility that the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; may be capable of a narrower interpretation than the words &#x201C;act or omission in conflict with a contractual obligation&#x201D;.

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Here is another instance where I certainly am not happy about the phraseology which is being used in the clause, and significantly again, it is the marginal note which I think gives correct expression to the <span class="col_1459-1460" refersTo="page_746"/>law as we always have understood it. Here again there has been introduced into this legislation the words &#x201C;out of proportion to the prejudice suffered&#x201D;. Sir, the legal textbooks that one has reference to and also the decided cases used the word &#x201C;excessive&#x201D;. Here again when the law adviser came into the matter apparently, he used what I believe is the correct term &#x201C;excessive penalty&#x201D;, something which has been interpreted in our courts. I do not want to repeat the arguments we used in regard to the previous clause and I move no amendment, but I would like to have this assurance from the hon. the Minister that the phrasing that is being used will place the onus upon the party seeking to avoid payment to establish these words &#x201C;out of proportion to the prejudice suffered&#x201D;. I want to have the assurance from the hon. the Minister that the law advisers are convinced that is the position. Then I would also like to know whether the adoption of this new phraseology is going to put a different onus on either party to litigation than what exists under the Common Law as it has always been applied? It seems to me that we are possibly putting a heavier onus on one or other of the litigants than would otherwise have been the case had we simply used the straightforward language &#x201C;that the penalty was excessive&#x201D;. During the second reading debate, I quoted to the hon. the Minister the terms of the judgment in the case of the Pearl Assurance Company in 1933, where it was, I thought, very clearly put that where a fixed amount has been stipulated to be paid by one party to a contract, in the event of a breach, such an amount is <i>prima facie</i> recoverable and the onus is on the party seeking to avoid payment of the penalty to prove that the penalty is excessive. That seems to me very straightforward and simple language, and I would like to have an explanation of the hon. the Minister on these two points.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised this matter in the course of the second reading debate. There are two issues to bear in mind in this connection. In the one case you have to deal with a default judgment and in the other case you have a contested claim. In the case of a contested claim, naturally, the onus will be on the applicant or the plaintiff&#x2014;in any case the man who avers must prove his case. That is the general law. So there we will have no difficulty. The only case where we can have a difficulty at all is on the question of a default judgment. There the general rule would be that where the other party is in default, the court will automatically give judgment in favour of the party asking for it and the fact that the other party is in default will bring about that the court will not query the statements in the pleadings of the plaintiff. But as in every default judgment, the court has the right to refuse default judgment under certain circumstances, and so in this matter, in the case of a default judgment if on the fact of it the amount asked, is absurd to such an extent that it is out of all proportion to the damage suffered, the court will have the right to go into the matter and to ask further proof.</p>

<p>As I understood him, the hon. the Minister said that in the case of a default judgment, being a case where the &#x201C;guilty party&#x201D; does not come to court to contest the matter, the matter will not be raised by the court of its own motion. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister there bears in mind that certainly under the Cape rules of court, and I think also under the Transvaal rules, where it is a question of damages on a default judgment, it is necessary for the applicant for such judgment to prove his damages. And as the hon. the Minister will know, it is essential for the applicants to file pleadings setting out the damages and so forth, and it is necessary for those damages to be proved in the ordinary course.</p>

<p>With respect, where the claim made is for damages, and there is no appearance entered, it is still essential for a declaration to be filed, (which is not so in the case of the ordinary liquidated claim) and for the plaintiff or applicant, as the case may be, to prove his damages. And the hon. the Minister will know in default judgments you do in fact get the applicant or the plaintiff leading evidence where in fact damages are being claimed, and I am wondering what the position will be under this particular provision.</p>

<p>It may be a penalty, but it is a penalty in the nature of damages, and I wonder therefore whether in fact the Minister&#x2019;s interjection is a reply to it. If it is not, certain consequential points may follow. As <span class="col_1461-1462" refersTo="page_747"/>the hon. the Minister will know, with the Hire-Purchase Act, you have a similar sort of situation. There it is left to the courts of their own motion to consider whether the damages are excessive. As the hon. the Minister will know, in that case it is the practice of applicants seeking default judgment to file an affidavit setting out what in fact they have suffered by way of damages, and a court will not grant judgment in the absence of such an affidavit. They insist upon such an affidavit, and I am wondering whether that will be the position here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>As far as this matter is concerned we have nothing to do at all with damages which have to be proved, because there is nothing to prove in view of the fact that it has already been stipulated in the contract that in the case of an act or omission you will be bound by what is contained in the contract. When it comes to an application for judgment by default therefore, you do not have to prove anything. You would proceed in precisely the same way that you would have proceeded if, for example, you had claimed the delivery of a motor-car. The question of proof plays no role at all there. After all, the basic difference between the English legal principle and the Roman Dutch legal principle, which we are restoring here, is that I am no longer called upon to come to court to prove that the amount specified in the contract is the predetermined damage I suffered, but that is the amount on which we agreed. That is the only question with which the court is concerned. In other words, where judgment is given by default the court does not want to know whether that is the amount of damage I suffered or whether it is not the amount of damage that I suffered. The court is only concerned with the fact that it is stipulated in my contract that I undertake to pay this or to do that. That is the only issue with which the court is concerned at that stage and consequently there is no question of proving any other item except the fact that is what the contract stipulated. I cannot therefore share the hon. member&#x2019;s objection.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This is a small Bill to amend the principal Act of 1928 and is being introduced at the request of the Pharmacy Board. The Bill consists of only four clauses of any real significance: Clause 2 amends Section 22 of the principal Act; Clause 3 amends Section 32 of the principal Act; Clause 7 amends Section 65<i>bis</i> of the principal Act and Clause 8 amends Section 82 of the principal Act. All the others are mainly consequently amendments.</p>

<p>The first section that is being amended is Section 22 of the principal Act which deals with registration and reciprocity between countries. According to the existing Section 22 the State President has the right to prescribe what degrees, whether they have been obtained in South Africa or overseas, a doctor or a dentist or a chemist should have in order to practise in South Africa. The law provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that three requirements should be complied with before a degree obtained overseas can be recognized in South Africa. In the first place, the person who holds such an overseas degree must be entitled to practise in that country. In other words, a person holding a degree of another country must also be able to practise in that country. The second requirements is that a South African should also be able to practise in that country. Thirdly, the overseas degree should not be of a lower standard than the equivalent South African degree entitling a doctor or a dentist or a chemist to practise in South Africa.</p>

<p>The principal Act provides for the State President to make certain exceptions in the case of doctors and dentists but there is no provision entitling the State President to make exceptions in the case of chemists and the Pharmacy Board have now asked for this amendment so that the State President will be entitled <span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_748"/>to make exception in their case as well, in other words, to allow chemists from overseas to practise their profession here in South Africa, but only if they practise that profession at university institutions or at scientific research institutions.</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the amending Bill amends Section 32 of the principal Act. In other words, the provisions in connection with auxiliary services. The S.A. Medical Council has the right to register health personnel, medical auxiliary personnel, such as, for example, masseurs, physiotherapists, speechtherapists, dieticians etc., to let them write examinations and to lay down rules to control them. The chemists now want the same kind of right in connection with auxiliary services as far as their profession is concerned, namely, in the case of pharmaceutical technicians, that is to say technicians who make up pills and capsules etc. and also in the case of unqualified assistants. An unqualified assistant is a person who has already served his apprenticeship as a chemist but who has not as yet written his final examination. The chemists now want the same rights in respect of these people as the Medical Council have in respect to their auxiliary services.</p>

<p>Clause 7 amends Section 65<i>bis</i> of the principal Act and deals with medicines that may be harmful. In 1954 the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Council realized that certain abuses may result from the handling of certain types of medicines.</p>

<p>The hon. member is being frivolous. I shall just repeat what the position is as far as this clause is concerned and I shall try to be as clear as possible so that hon. members may follow the position even though the Bill is not before them. I return to Section 65<i>bis</i> and Clause 7 which amends that section. It refers to medicines which may possibly be harmful. The Medical Council and the Pharmacy Board approached the Government in 1954 because they were concerned about the position that was developing in the country. They were worried that certain abuses might develop in respect of certain classes of medicine; antibiotics. sedatives and the use of hormones, for example. That was why they came to the Government and asked that the law be changed according to amendments which they themselves suggested and which they themselves thought would be good. The principle that they suggested should apply was that not one of these possible harmful drugs should be sold, unless they were sold on a doctor&#x2019;s prescription. In other words, a chemist should not sell these medicines unless a doctor has prescribed them. And they suggested that in order to prevent any abuse the prescription should comply with certain requirements. This was a provision which the Pharmacy Board themselves asked for. They asked that the following should appear on a prescription, and if you look at the existing Act, Sir, you will see that these requirements are stipulated there: On the prescription must appear, in the doctor&#x2019;s own handwriting, the date, the name of the patient, the address of the patient, the name of the medicine, the quantity of the medicine, how often it should be taken, how often the chemist may renew it, the doctor&#x2019;s address, the doctor&#x2019;s qualifications and the doctor&#x2019;s signature. Those were the requirements which had to appear on a prescription in terms of the law. The reason was that the chemists realized that in the best of professions there were always people who contravened the law, and that it should be possible to determine when such contraventions had taken place and to confront the guilty persons with such contravention. That was the reason why they said these requirements were essential. As time went on, however, Mr. Speaker, it was found that certain of those requirements were unnecessary. As a result of that various chemists have made representation to us to amend this section in the Act somewhat. I discussed the matter with members of the Pharmacy Board and after detailed dicussion it was decided that most of those requirements should remain on the prescription but that concession could nonetheless be made.</p>

<p><span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_749"/>That is why the following amendments are suggested in the Bill. In the first place it is still necessary to show the patient&#x2019;s address. It is essential to know who the patient is for whom the prescription was given so as to determine whether the prescription is genuine. But whereas the original Act provides that the doctor himself should fill in the patient&#x2019;s address, that will no longer be necessary. The patient&#x2019;s address may be typed in by the doctor&#x2019;s typiste, or the chemist may even fill it in, but the patient&#x2019;s address must at some time or other be filled in on the prescription. In the second place, it provides that if the doctor does not indicate on the prescription how often the chemist may renew the prescription for the patient, he may only make it up once. In other words, it makes the position of the chemist easier. He knows that if it does not state on the prescription how often, he may only make it up once. In the third place, it has been decided that it will no longer be necessary for the doctor to fill in his address and professional qualifications in his own handwriting on the prescription. That was necessary under the original Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are the amendments which are being effected to the principal Act as far as prescriptions are concerned. It is unfortunately not possible to make further concessions because if you were to make further concessions it would not be possible to protect the public against the abuse of these various medicines.</p>

<p>The hon. member is now trying to make the House look ridiculous. Clause 8 amends Section 82 of the principal Act. It is a very small amendment. Section 82 of the principal Act provides that when methylated spirits is sold in small quantities&#x2014;that is quantities of less than 30 ounces&#x2014;it may only be sold in bottles marked &#x201C;poison&#x201D; and in bottles with a rough surface. As against that the Liquor Act provides that methylated spirits may only be sold in clear-coloured bottles. In other words, the position is that there are two conflicting laws, and in order to do away with this conflict we are effecting this amendment which lays down that in future methylated spirits may also be sold in small quantities in ordinary coloured bottles.</p>

<p>These, Mr. Speaker, are actually the only material amendments which are contained in this small Bill and I hope the House will approve of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we wish to record our objection to the adjournment of the House. We feel that this is no way in which to conduct the business of Parliament. We saw what took place a short while ago when we were expected to discuss a Bill which was not before us. Mr. Speaker, I want to make it quite clear to the Leader of the House that as far as it has been possible he has met us when we have gone to him from time to <span class="col_1467-1468" refersTo="page_750"/>time and asked him to give us some time. In respect of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Amendment Bill the Leader of the House agreed that the hon. the Minister would give his second reading speech and that the debate would then be adjourned. But it was generally understood that the Bill would be available first thing this morning. The position is this, Sir, that to-day is the 24th sitting day of this Session. In 1960 we had had eight evening sittings at this stage; in 1961 we had ten evenings sittings at this stage. And here in 1962, at this stage of the session, we have only had two evening sittings. During this Session so far 32 Bills have been released of which 11 have been passed, 10 have been referred to Select Committees and there are four private Bills. The remainder of the Bills are on the Order Paper and have been disposed of as far as possible this afternoon. In terms of Rule 25 of our Standing Rules and Orders evening sittings should commence after the sixth sitting day. As the Leader of the House indicated earlier during this Session, under the old Rules evening sittings started after the 11th sitting day and he quite rightly suggested that we should revert to the old Rule. But even then, as I have shown already, we have only had two evening sittings at this the 24th day stage of the session. We have never yet had that experience. As I have said, the Leader of the House has accommodated us as far as possible. I suggest, Sir, that Parliament is not functioning properly. Either the number of law advisers must be increased or it will become necessary to publish proposed legislation during the recess so that Parliament will have the legislation introduced at an earlier stage. The Leader of the House has given me a long list of legislation that will come before us this Session and as far as possible the workings between the Whips and the Leader of the House have gone off very smoothly this Session.</p>

<p>We have no complaint as far as the notification of the proposed legislation is concerned. But notification is not enough, Mr. Speaker. What is essential is that the House should see that legislation. The Prime Minister indicated certain Bills that would be introduced in the Senate and even all of those have not been introduced in the Senate. The danger exists that there will be a cluttering up of the Order Paper, particularly as the session advances, when the House will not have adequate time to consider that legislation and where outside interests will not have adequate time to consider it. We have an example of the Group Areas Amendment Bill which the Leader of the House has agreed should be considered next Tuesday. The Leader of the House has given us time before that Bill comes under discussion. But there will be no opportunity for that Bill to be considered at length by people outside who are interested. Local authorities and other people all over the country are interested in the legislation that we pass here and I suggest that the duty of this Parliament is to pass legislation after mature and careful consideration. We have seen the effect of rushed legislation time after time. I think the Leader of the House who has probably had more experience than anybody else in the House of the arrangement of the Order Paper, will be the first to agree with me when I say that there has never before been such a shambles when it came to arranging the Order Paper. It may be due to lack of staff or to a variety of other reasons, but I think it is essential that at this stage we should place our objections on record. This is no way to treat people who come from all parts of the Republic to Parliament. Parliament should sit for its full time and dispose of its business as soon as possible. Officials are brought down from various parts of the country; members of Parliament travel great distances; the country pays for that expense but it does not pay for people to remain idle. We do want evening sittings to discharge our business, to discharge the work of Parliament as speedily as possible in the interests of the country. We also want adequate time to consider the legislation which is being introduced into this House in the interests of the country. We cannot conduct Parliament in this way Mr. Speaker. Legislation is dealt with in a rushed manner and later on in the session we shall have a cluttered-up Order Paper, with Ministers running to and fro between this Chamber and the Other Place; Ministers arriving breathless from duties in the Other Place as happened this afternoon to the Minister of Justice. He rushed in post-haste from the Other Place to attend to business here. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this is the right and proper time to record our protest in the interests of Parliament and in the interests of the country</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am giving you the reasons why the Opposition cannot speak. Had we had their assistance because they were doing their duty, as we feel they ought to do their duty, namely, to study the legislation and to voice their opinion, the legislation which was before Parliament would have been quite enough. We would have had too much legislation as a matter of fact. I think the fact that we cannot sit the whole afternoon or in the evenings, is largely due, I am tempted to say, to their disinterest in the legislation which has been before Parliament. I remember, for example, the Additional Estimates of the Railways which were passed this afternoon. When we were in opposition, we did not allow that to go through within 1&#x00BD; hours, and we must remember that at that time many millions of rand less were involved than to-day. If we have to reproach one another, we can equally reproach them. I want to add that I can introduce the Bill on the Group Areas Act to-morrow. But they asked me in heaven&#x2019;s name to wait with that till Tuesday. That is an important matter and I hope they will have something to say about it. I wanted to place it on the Order Paper to-day, but it was to accommodate them that we have not got it before us to-day. They should, therefore, not complain so much.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is needless for the hon. the Minister to say that we could have gone on with that Bill this afternoon or tomorrow. It is just trifling with this House to talk like that, apart from the fact that tomorrow is private members&#x2019; day. I think the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) has raised a perfectly valid point and I am sorry the Minister of Lands has not dealt with it on its merits. He is just being facetious about it. We are not burning to sit here at night, just for the sake of sitting at night. But we do believe this, that unless we do some night sittings we shall never finish this Session, or else we shall have, as my hon. friend has said, a cluttered-up Order Paper with everyone in a state of distress and unable to do the work properly. The hon. the Minister complains that we have not talked enough this Session, and he boasts about the quite irresponsible and obstructive way in which he behaved when he was a member of the Opposition. We do not take that view. It just happens that most of the Bills that have been introduced this Session &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I do not think the hon. member is entitled to call it obstructive.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I was really referring to the hon. member&#x2019;s disreputable past. [Laughter.] But the fact remains that it is no argument for the Government to say that the Order Paper is as it is at present because the Opposition has not talked enough. If the Opposition exercises its discretion in a responsible manner, when a Bill is introduced in this House, it is judged on its merits, and if it is a good Bill or is desirable, we support it, as the hon. member knows very well. So that is no argument at all. The fact remains that if legislation can be prepared in good time I would not be surprised if it was possible to get through the Session without sitting in the evenings. In fact, it might be a good thing; if Bills were prepared in good time and the House was given adequate notice of those Bills, members might very well sit at home at night and study those Bills to facilitate their passing through the House. But sitting at night itself is not in issue; what is in issue is the working of this House, and I think the hon. the Minister of Lands very tactfully, as well as my colleague here, put his finger on the spot, and that is that there are not sufficient legal draughtsmen available to enable these Bills to be drafted. I do think that if the hon. the Minister of Lands would take our protest in the spirit in which it is uttered, it is not in any way aimed at him or his Whips. The co-operation has been very good this Session, and last session too. If he takes it in the spirit in which it is intended, which is to facilitate the work of the House so that it will work smoothly right throughout the Session, without having the appalling mess-up we often do have towards the end of the session, and if he agrees that the real difficulty lies in getting Bills drafted in order to publish them and introduce them in the House in good time&#x2014;if he takes steps to see that is remedied I think the work of the House will be facilitated and there will be no need for the Opposition to protest now or in the future.</p>

<heading>JURY SYSTEM</heading>

<speech by="#pelser">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in moving this motion which stands in my name and which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that the jury system has no further useful function to fulfil in our administration of justice,</block>

<p>I want to point out immediately that this motion does not deny that the jury system possibly at some stage in the past in fact fulfilled a useful function. In fact, the wording of the motion implies that. There is therefore no difference of opinion on that particular point, and I mention it because I should like to see hon. members confining themselves to the allegation contained in this motion, namely that in present circumstances in this country the jury system has no further useful function to perform in our administration of justice.</p>

<p>When discussing a motion of this nature, I believe it will be useful in the first instance to investigate the origin and history of the jury system; secondly, to point out how the system has gradually been broken down, particularly in this country during the past 50 years; and then to ask ourselves the question: What really are the aims and objects in regard to this system, and to what extent does the system in the present circumstances still comply with those aims and objects? Then finally I want to quote what certain competent persons have said from time to time about this system.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the origin of the jury system there are certainly few subjects of research which have given research workers so many headaches and caused them so much confusion. In fact, there are researchers who have despaired and exclaimed that the jury system is so steeped in antiquity that it confounds all research. Others again believe that the jury system originated in Normandy, which in turn adopted it from the Scandinavian countries. Others again believed that the jury system is typical of and belongs exclusively to the Anglo-Saxons and that it is Anglo-Saxon by nature and in origin. Others believe that the jury system was derived from the courts which the Crusaders established in Jerusalem during the latter part of the eleventh century. Still others believe that the jury system derives from the Roman system where the Praetor, assisted by his Judices, heard trials. Under this system it is the practice that the Judices who assisted the Praetor were each supplied with three plates. On one plate there was only the letter &#x201C;A&#x201D;. It stood for the word &#x201C;Absolvo&#x201D;, or in other words, &#x201C;Absolve&#x201D; or &#x201C;Absolved On the second plate there was a &#x201C;C&#x201D;. That stood for &#x201C;Condemno&#x201D;&#x2014;condemn. On the third one there were the letters &#x201C;NL&#x201D;, which stood for &#x201C;Non Liquet&#x201D;, which meant that the matter was not clear; in other words, the case was not properly proved. After the trial each of the Judices, according to his judgment, put one of these plates into a container. The Praetor then withdrew them and gave his judgment according to which plates were in the majority. Now it is readily admitted that there is great similarity between the Roman system and the jury system, but in spite of that it has been proved conclusively that it is not true that the jury system was derived from the Roman system.</p>

<p>The most generally accepted theory in regard to the origin of the jury system is that it was introduced for the first time and in its most primitive form in England and was used by the Norman conquerers, and we must note that when it was introduced the intention was not to use it for the administration of justice, but to use it for administrative purposes. The Norman conquerors conceived the bright idea that one could use a purely religious institution like the oath also for administrative purposes. If they wanted to arrive at the truth for administrative purposes they considered that the best way of doing so was to put a man under oath&#x2014;and at that time the oath had tremendous power&#x2014;and that if he was under oath he would tell the truth. So it is alleged that this system was, e.g., used in the compilation of the well-known Domesday Book. People in the vicinity were placed under oath to give evidence as to the particular circumstances pertaining to that area. In other words, the first jurors, the first people who were so placed under oath for this particular purpose, were nothing else but witnesses. It was only in the eleventh century, after the old system of trial by ordeal was abolished, that the jury system developed further. You know that trial by ordeal was, for example, that a man had to carry a piece of hot iron for a certain distance, and if he managed to do so he was considered innocent; or there was trial by water, where he had to put his hand into a pot of boiling water and remove an iron ball, <span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_756"/>and if he succeeded in doing so his innocence was proved. The third system was what they called the &#x201C;accursed morsel&#x201D;. The idea was to give a man a piece of dry bread which he had to try to swallow. There was an accompanying prayer to the effect that if he was guilty he should choke. Well, this system had the advantage that the sentence was immediately applied to the so-called guilty person.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I say it is only after this system of trial by ordeal was abandoned in the second half of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth century that the jury system, or the system of jurors, as the Norman conquerors called it, was applied to the administration of justice. From the nature of the matter, this system was originally used for the giving of evidence. People under oath gave evidence and they were known as jurors. Later it happened that those put under oath also became the prosecutors. The jurors became the prosecutors as well. At a certain stage they were both prosecutors and witnesses. It was only later, towards the end of the twelfth century, that the jury system in England was used more or less in the form as we know it to-day, although of course quite in its initial stages. In the thirteenth century this system became properly established, so much so that when the Magna Charta was drafted and King John had to sign it in 1215, the system was established to such a degree that Chapter 29 of the Charta specially provided that, translated very freely, no free man shall be injured either in his person or in his property without the legal judgment of his peers and the law of the land. That is the idea behind the system. We can accept that during the thirteenth century the system had already been established in England, and therefore, Sir, when we discuss this system in the House to-day we must clearly realize that we are discussing a system which is more than 700 years old and which has a tremendous tradition behind it. From the thirteenth century to the second half of the nineteenth century the development of this system took place. Various rules were made and refined. There is the rule as to who may not be jurors, that a juror may not be a relative, that he should have no interest in the case, etc. etc. The other rules developed that the jury should be segregated and that nobody should come into contact with them. You will remember that it was this rule which was recently contravened in the well-known Moodie case, where somebody had been in the presence of the jury.</p>

<p>The rule of unanimity was developed. The jury had to be unanimous. In England all 12 members of the jury had to be unanimous, and there are many interesting tales about how they were forced to arrive at unanimity. They were readily deprived of food and water until they became unanimous. They were carted from one Assize to another until eventually they returned a unanimous verdict. Rules were developed as to how the Judge had to sum up to the jury and regarding what he had to tell them, and the rule developed in regard to what the Judge had to decide and what the jury had to decide&#x2014;the Judge on legal points and the jury on the facts. All kinds of developments took place, but what is of interest to us is that from the early thirteenth century to the second half of the nineteenth century very little was done to derogate from the jury system, except perhaps for the establishment of the Courts of Equity in England. In 1854, in England, for the first time we find something being done to break down the jury system. The system in England right throughout until to-day has been that the jury sits in both civil and criminal cases, but in 1854 it was decided that where the parties to a civil case agreed, a Judge could be asked for and the jury could be eliminated. In 1873 there was further legislation derogating from the jury system, and again in 1883 and, lastly, again in 1933. To-day the position in England, where the system has been in operation for so many years, is that in criminal cases only 5 per cent of cases is tried by a jury. For the rest a Judge is preferred. Approximately between 5,000 and 6,000 cases are tried by a jury, whilst the average number of cases in the higher courts is between 110,000 and 130,000 per annum. In civil cases in England at the moment a jury is used in only between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of cases. In other words, in England itself the system has been broken down to such an extent after 750 years that it is practically only just by way of exception that a jury is used.</p>

<p>This country learnt to know the jury system for the first time shortly after the second British occupation of the Cape in 1806. De Mist instituted investigation into the administration of justice in the Cape Colony and submitted his report, and in 1827 the Royal Charter of Justice was promulgated, and Section 34 of this Royal Charter provided that criminal trials in the Supreme Court would be heard by a Judge assisted by nine jurors, a deviation from what the practice was in England, where the jury consisted of 12 members. Section 43 of the Charter specifically excluded civil cases, and what struck me while reading the Charter was that another section specifically provided that the fact that a person had no knowledge or comprehension of English would not preclude him from serving on the jury in the Cape Colony; he was compelled to serve despite the fact that he did not know English. In terms of this Charter, the Supreme Court was established in 1831 and provision was made for jury lists. Only in 1854 in the Cape Colony was this system also extended to civil cases. In 1852 the system was introduced in Natal for both civil and criminal cases. It also provided for a jury of nine men, but it deviated from the existing practice to the extent that instead of having unanimity a majority of seven would be sufficient to give a competent verdict.</p>

<p>The jury system was extended to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State Republics in the early 1850s, and it was incorporated in both constitutions, but it was limited to criminal <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_757"/>cases. That is significant, and I think the explanation for it is that when the Trekkers left the Cape Colony in 1836 the only system they knew was the jury system in criminal cases, because it was only in 1854 that it was made applicable to civil cases in the Cape Colony, and so they took the existing law with them and applied it only in criminal cases.</p>

<p>In 1910, at the time of Union, the position was that in the Cape Colony and Natal the jury system was used in both civil and criminal cases, whilst in the Transvaal and the Free State it was used only in criminal cases, and it is to be noted that at that stage it was still a requirement that the jury should be unanimous in its verdict. All nine men had to arrive at the same verdict. The first breaking down of the jury system took place in 1914. In 1914 this Parliament passed an Act establishing special courts. The Act provided that if the Attorney-General was of opinion that the administration of justice would suffer, he could report to the Minister of Justice to that effect, and then the Governor-General was empowered to establish a special court where the jury was excluded and which consisted of a Bench of two or three Judges, and it was made applicable in cases of high treason, public violence and riots. In those three cases the jury system was not used and provision was made for them to be heard by special courts. In 1917 there was a consolidation of the criminal procedure laws of the various provinces. Act 31 of 1917 consolidated the criminal procedure and in the first place it reaffirmed the establishment of special courts in cases of high treason, public violence and riots. But, interestingly enough, two other categories were added. The one was any crime in connection with the possession or sale of precious metals or minerals and the other any case concerning the provision of intoxicating liquor to Natives and Coloureds. Originally these cases had, of course, been excluded, and the only reason one can advance for the fact that they were now included here was the realization, even then, that the jury system did not operate properly in cases concerning the provision of liquor or the illegal trading or possession of precious metals and minerals. I hope to say something more about this later. In any case, the special courts were reinstituted.</p>

<p>However, they went a step further and whereas in the past in three of the provinces the verdict of the jury had to be unanimous, they now took over the Natal system and it was provided that a unanimous verdict by seven members of the jury would be competent. That is one of the good things which came from Natal. But the most important of all the provisions in the 1917 Act was that for the first time it provided that the accused could have a choice between trial by jury or by a court consisting of a Judge and assessors. This was a particular deviation and one we should take cognizance of. Up to that stage there had been no exception, except in the case of the special courts, but for the rest all criminal cases had to be tried by a jury. In 1917 for the first time we find that there is a change and that the accused now has the right to choose between trial by a jury or by a Judge and assessors.</p>

<p>In 1927 the jury system in regard to civil matters was abolished in the Cape Province and Natal. It is alleged that what gave rise to it was the train disaster which occurred at Salt River at that time. It was feared that heavy claims would be instituted and it was a well-known fact, in England as well as here, that when claims were instituted and the jury was given the opportunity to lay their hands on a public institution, whether it was the State or a municipality or an insurance company, they went out of their way to award as much compensation as possible. Consequently the Act was passed in 1927 abolishing the jury system in civil cases.</p>

<p>In 1935 the jury system was broken down even much more. In 1935 it was provided that in certain cases the Minister of Justice could order a trial to take place not by a Judge and jury but by a Judge and assessors. Then there is a long list of cases given where the Minister has that power. At that stage the cases in connection with the supply of liquor and the possession of minerals and gold were taken away from the special courts. From time to time further cases were added. In 1948 were added cases where a knowledge of minerology or bookkeeping was required. Then the Minister could also give instructions that the case should be tried in that way. Another matter which was added was contraventions of the Atomic Act, and in 1956 still another case was added. At the present moment these cases comprise the following, and it is worth while paying attention to it because it covers such a wide field. Under the present circumstances, as the law stands at the moment, the Minister of Justice has the right at any time, if the Attorney-General reports to him that he considers it is not in the best interests of the administration of justice for a trial to be heard by a jury, to give instructions that in the following cases the trial will take place before a Judge and assessors: murder and arson and attempts to commit those crimes; prosecutions in terms of Chapter I of the Riotous Assemblies Act and the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act of 1940; prosecutions in terms of Section 33 of the Atomic Act; prosecutions in regard to illicit trading or illegal possession of precious metals and precious stones; prosecutions in regard to the supply of intoxicating liquor to Natives or Coloureds; prosecutions in regard to insolvency; prosecutions in regard to which the facts concerning prescribed material in Section 1 of the Atomic Act will possibly be considered; prosecutions in regard to which facts will probably have to be considered for the proper understanding of which and expert knowledge of bookkeeping, accountancy, geology, minerology or metallurgy may be necessary; prosecutions in connection with a non-White if the accused is a White person, or in connection with a White person if the accused is a non-White; prosecutions in terms <span class="col_1483-1484" refersTo="page_758"/>of paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 11 of the Suppression of Communism Act. If one looks at this list one realizes what a tremendously wide field it covers and in how many cases the Minister of Justice can take away the right of an accused person to be tried by his fellow citizens, and without giving reasons can say that it is not in the interest of the administration of justice and, therefore, he orders that the trial shall take place before a Judge and assessors.</p>

<p>In regard to this particular section I have just referred to, I want to point out in passing in what an invidious position it places any Minister of Justice, particularly in regard to cases where a White man has committed an offence against a non-White, or vice versa. Unfortunately it is a fact that in this country the jury is either too sympathetic or else is prejudiced in such cases. The facts have proved this. Now I can imagine that when a case like this occurs in a particular magisterial district, where it is a White man who is the accused and a non-White who is the complainant, representations will be made to the Minister of Justice to allow the case to be tried by a jury and that he should not make use of his right to have the trial heard by a Judge and assessors. Just imagine in what an invidious position any Minister of Justice is then placed. He is now in the position that if he agrees to a jury trial it is practically certain that the administration of justice will suffer. If he does not agree to a jury trial, it is taken amiss. I want to say frankly that while this particular section is in operation I pity any Minister of Justice who has to take that decision. I feel that if this is the case and when we know for a fact that unfortunately these things do happen, the obvious thing surely is to do away with this section so as to obviate the Minister of Justice being put into this invidious position every time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have already mentioned the special courts of 1914 and 1917 and the exceptions which were made in 1935, but in 1954 we really find the <i>coup de gr&#x00E2;ce</i> being given to the jury system. Whereas formerly it was the rule for a man to be tried by a jury unless he specially asked for a Judge, the position now was just the opposite. In 1954 this Parliament provided that the normal procedure in this country in regard to criminal trials would in future be trial by a Judge with or without assessors, and that the exceptional case would be trial by a jury. Then a jury would have to be specially applied for. This is of course a tremendous blow to the jury system, and to-day we can really no longer say that the jury system is our system. Our normal system is trial by a Judge, without a jury.</p>

<p>But the jury system was also broken down from a different angle. We should remember that in this country we have magistrates&#x2019; courts which are sometimes given increased jurisdiction, and that we even have regional courts. If we realize that our magistrates can try any crime except three, viz. murder, high treason and rape, and if we think of the tremendous number of crimes tried in the magistrates&#x2019; courts with or without increased jurisdiction, as well as in the regional courts, then only do we realize to what extent the jury system has already disappeared. The ordinary magistrate&#x2019;s court has a jurisdiction of six months or R200, and with increased jurisdiction it is one year or R400, and the regional court has a jurisdiction of three years or R600. Only very serious crimes do not fall into this category of three years&#x2019; imprisonment and/or R600 fines. The hon. the Minister said in the Other Place the other day that only 2 per cent of trials are still being heard by a jury, but I think that if we remember that in the magistrates&#x2019; courts, with ordinary or increased jurisdiction, and in the regional courts so many cases are already disposed of which would normally have been tried in the Supreme Court, I wonder whether the Minister&#x2019;s figure should not be halved. My honest opinion is that if we were to make a survey of the criminal cases which were normally heard by the Supreme Court in the past, we would now find it to be less than one per cent.</p>

<p>Now we must ask ourselves: To what extent does the jury system still comply with those cases? As hon. members know, the jury system means that an accused person in certain cases is tried by a court consisting of a Judge and nine jurors, actually laymen, and the underlying idea of the system is not that these nine laymen are more competent to judge than the Judge himself. The idea is not that nine heads are better than one, although it sometimes has that advantage, but the underlying advantage is that the nine jurors will be the peers of the accused. They come from that vicinity and are his peers, as it is called in England. Because they come from that area and know the people and conditions there and are better able to appreciate how people of that class will react in certain circumstances and what goes on in their hearts and minds, the idea is that in this way justice will be better served. That is the underlying idea. It is also said that the system has various advantages. It is said, <i>inter alia,</i> that one advantage is that by making use of this system one can get rid of unpopular legislation, that the jury is in fact a small Parliament established to get rid of such legislation. Secondly, they say, it tempers justice with mercy. Then it is said that a particularly great advantage is that it brings the ordinary man, the man in the street, into contact with the administration of justice. Another advantage they mention is that it relieves the Judge of his tremendous responsibility. I just want to say in passing that this may be so to some extent, but if we remember that the average jury in the final result is guided by the Judge when he sums up to them, I do not think it relieves the Judge of his responsibility if the jury thereafter arrives at their verdict. Everybody knows that when the jury give their verdict it is only a reflection of what the Judge has told them. Let us take the other example they mention, that it tempers justice with mercy. It sounds very <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_759"/>nice, this idea of humaneness at a trial, but then we have to be very careful that it does not become a travesty of the law, and I fear that is what often happens. Instead of tempering justice with mercy, the jury in many instances makes a travesty of justice. I can mention a few examples. I just want to quote what Forsyth says in his book. It is an old book but a particularly good one on this subject&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But can it with equal truth be asserted that juries never acquit in ordinary cases when they ought to condemn? I fear not. This is no doubt the vulnerable point of the system, that feelings of compassion for the prisoner, or of repugnance to the punishment which the law awards, are sometimes allowed to overpower their sense of duty. They usurp in such cases the prerogative of mercy, forgetting that they have sworn to give a true verdict according to the evidence.</block>

<p>And that is unfortunately what happens only too often. Mercy belongs to the executive authority. We should be careful that we do not make a mockery of the law in trying to introduce some human kindness when accused persons are tried. I want to read to you, Sir, what Judge Dowling said in a very well-known case in the Northern Transvaal when a White man and his son were charged with the murder of a non-White whom they had apparently attacked viciously. The evidence was overwhelming. The jury left the courtroom, came back and, instead of giving a verdict of guilty of murder, which very clearly should have been the verdict according to the evidence, they gave a verdict of guilty of common assault. Judge Dowling then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my opinion the accused is a very lucky man; the verdict came as a surprise to me.</block>

<p>If the verdict of a jury is regarded as a surprise by a Judge, I feel that in that case the law has not been watered down by mercy; I feel that a mockery has been made of the law and we should guard against that.</p>

<p>But I want to confine myself particularly to this approach namely that the accused should be tried by his &#x201C;peers&#x201D; as they are called in English. In a country such as England where the jury system originated and where it still operates, you have a homogeneous population, although there are social classes, and I honestly believe that in such a country the jury system, in spite of its weaknesses, operates better than in South Africa. In England, if the accused belongs to the nobility, the jury does not consist of the ordinary man; the jury consists of his &#x201C;peers&#x201D;, twelve &#x201C;lords&#x201D;. If an ecclesiatic is charged, the jury does not consist of the ordinary man, but Bishops form the jury. If the ordinary man is charged, then &#x201C;lords&#x201D; do not serve as members of the jury, but it is the ordinary man who has to listen to the evidence and come to a decision. I do not think anybody in this country can rightly contend that people in this country are tried by their peers. In this country the administration of justice is in the hands of the Whites; the members of the jury are White. The majority of the people in this country are Bantu; a large number are Coloureds, a smaller but nevertheless large section are Asiatic. If we want to be true to this system that a person should be tried by his peers, we should in all fairness see to it that when a Black man is charged, he should be tried by a jury consisting of nine Black persons, because they are the people who know what goes on in his heart and in his mind; they are the people who know what the circumstances are; they are the people who know how he will probably react. How can we contend that a White jury knows the circumstances and the reaction of the Bantu? In that respect we have departed completely from the original idea of what a jury system should be. I am not pleading that we should have Black juries; I am not pleading that we should have Coloured or Asiatic juries. All I am doing is to point out that we cannot on the one hand adhere to this idea of a jury system, the idea that a person should be tried by his peers and on the other hand not allow people to have a jury consisting of their peers. When we do that we make a mockery of our jury system. But take even the case of the White people in this country. Can it be said of all cases that when a jury is empanelled the accused is being tried by his peers? I hope, when I point out at a later stage who may not serve on a jury, that I will convince hon. members that it is extremely doubtful whether an accused is always tried by his peers in the case of Europeans. I want to add that we should remember that in the majority of our criminal cases the accused are usually Black, Coloured or Asiatic. The cases where the accused is White are in the minority. We cannot, on the one hand, adhere to the tradition and the wonderful idea of &#x201C;being tried by your peers&#x201D; and on the other hand allow these things to happen. I feel, therefore, that we should get away from this jury system and that is the reason why I have introduced this motion.</p>

<p>When you read the literature on this subject, Sir, you find that everyone returns to the much-lauded advantage of the jury system, namely that it gives the ordinary man a share in the administration of justice that is supposed to be the particular big advantage of the jury system. The ordinary man is given an opportunity of playing his part in the administration of justice. When you analyse the facts, however, Sir, you find that we are also making a mockery of this. Take South Africa for example. The 10,000,000 Black people are eliminated; they do not have the privilege of sharing in the administration of justice, a privilege which they should have, if we want to follow this system strictly. The Coloureds do not have that privilege, and the Asiatics do not have it. But take the White people. How many White people have it? In the first place the entire female sex is excluded. Hon. members are aware of the fact that although women <span class="col_1487-1488" refersTo="page_760"/>may serve on a jury, they can only do so when the accused is a woman or when the accused is a person under the age of 18 years, and in addition the entire jury must consist of women. You must have a panel of nine members and what happens in this country in actual fact? In this country&#x2014;I speak subject to correction but I am almost 100 per cent sure&#x2014;you will not be able to appoint a single jury consisting of women only. We have controlled that in Cape Town. You simply cannot get a jury consisting of women together for the simple reason that there is not a jury list in respect of women and for the simple reason that they do not apply to serve on a jury. In other words, the entire female population is excluded and do not enjoy this wonderful privilege of sharing in the administration of justice. What is more, they have not been excluded against their will. They want to be excluded; that is why they do not come forward and that is why in the whole of Cape Town you cannot get a jury of nine women. I believe the position is the same in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Durban. I speak subject to correction but I believe that is the position. I am not even speaking about outside districts. In other words, the female sex do not enjoy the so-called wonderful privilege of sharing in the administration of justice.</p>

<p>I now want to show you, Sir, who else are excluded. All male persons under the age of 25 years and over the age of 65 are excluded. A male of 24 years 11 months dare not enjoy the privilege of sharing in the administration of justice and when he is one day over the age of 65 he is also excluded. But those are not the only people who are excluded. Every hon. Minister of ours is excluded and members of the Executive Committee. Not one of them may share in this wonderful privilege. All Judges of the Supreme Court are excluded; members of either House of Parliament are excluded; I believe there is probably good reason for that! Members of the Provincial Council and members of the Executive Committee are excluded; any officer of Parliament or of a provincial council; all ministers of religion are excluded. They may not share in this privilege. Advocates and attorneys duly admitted and actually practising, articled or managing clerks to attorneys, and enrolled agents in the magistrates&#x2019; courts, may not share in this privilege; all medical practitioners, dentists, chemists and druggists are excluded; persons who are serving or actually undergoing training in any land, sea or air force under the laws relating to the defence of the Union and members of any police force; members of the Public Service are excluded; deputy sheriffs and sheriffs&#x2019; officers; college professors and lecturers, school inspectors and school teachers are excluded; masters of vessels and pilots are excluded; persons continuously employed in any public railway are excluded; in other words, railway workers are excluded; people employed in tramway, electrical works, waterworks or sewerage works in connection with a hospital are all excluded; persons actually engaged as editors or reporters for newspapers; persons accredited to the Union as consuls are also excluded. Persons in the service of Her Majesty the Queen in any of her Governments are excluded; persons incapacitated by deafness, blindness or other permanent infirmity are excluded. Well, this is a very wise provision and I do believe that they should not serve on a jury. You cannot, therefore, hold it against the law-giver for having deprived these people of the right of sharing in the administration of justice. Others who have been excluded are secretaries of divisional councils, municipal councillors, heads and sub-heads of municipal departments, traffic police in the employ of local authorities. Mr. Speaker, who is left after all these people have been excluded? I have made a calculation and I took it that women comprised a little over half the population and that 30 out of 70 persons were under 25 or over 65 years. My estimate as far as these people are concerned was very conservative and I came to this conclusion that in the whole country, with a total population of 15,000,000, there were hardly 400,000 persons who could serve on a jury. That is not even 2 per cent. Only 2 per cent of your entire population have the wonderful privilege of sharing in the administration of justice.</p>

<p>When we realize what the position is, I think the time has arrived that we get away from the jury system. We must get away from the idea that you should be tried by your peers. Let us return to the actual facts and realize that hardly 2 per cent of the people of this country can serve on a jury.</p>

<p>I have shown the House how the system has been whittled down; I have shown that there are special courts to-day; I have shown in respect of what a great field the hon. the Minister of Justice could simply eliminate the jury system. I have shown you, Sir, that at the moment the jury system is the exception and that the normal system is a judge with two assessors. I have pointed out what a tremendous number of criminal cases were heard in magistrates&#x2019; courts and regional courts, and I have pointed out that these alleged advantages of jury system simply do not exist once you analyse the position and examine it closely.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to read a few extracts to show what people have already said in this country about the jury system. The first extract I wish to read is from the <i>Cape Law Journal.</i> This is what the editor says pursuant to a remark made by Sir Henry de Villiers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We would ask with Sir Henry de Villiers if the system is a good one, why limit it to one court? If bad, why not abolish it?</block>

<p>If the system is good we should extend it and if it is bad we should abolish it. The editor goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When a jury is required nine men are drawn by ballot by the Registrar of the court. These may comprise farmers, mercantile men, mechanics. Some of them have <span class="col_1489-1490" refersTo="page_761"/>probably never served on a jury before. Under ordinary circumstances none of them have previously heard anything of the cases upon which they are called to decide. They can have but little idea of sifting evidence. Such a body of persons can scarcely be considered the best tribunal to give due weight to the evidence in an intricate case of embezzlement, or to piece together the links in a long chain of circumstantial evidence, upon which a charge of murder may depend. No doubt they are in most cases guided by the presiding Judge; but we are strongly tempted to ask whether any harm would result if the whole case, verdict and all, were left to the Judge.</block>

<p>That is pursuant to a remark made by the Chief Judge of the Cape Province in 1885. I wish to refer to another article by the editor of the <i>South African Law Journal,</i> 1906&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Jurymen are selected without any reference to their fitness. They may have to decide a complicated engineering problem or a question of copyright, or some abstruse point of shipping customs, or they may be called on to distinguish between culpable and fraudulent insolvency. &#x201C;One of the gravest defects of trial by jury is that justice is administered without a proper sense of responsibility. Only for the moment does a juryman fill the judicial office; he is in the courts to-day and resumes his obscure place in the general mass to-morrow. Unlike the Judge, who sits on the bench day after day, he has no reputation for judicial wisdom to establish or maintain. No condemnation can follow him for his share in a wrong verdict. The jury&#x2019;s very number is destructive of a true sense of responsibility; a responsibility that is divisible into ninths is necessarily weak. But this is not the full extent of the defect. In the great majority of cases the verdict of the jury, as has been said, is merely a reflection of the opinion of the Judge. It is inevitably so when, as sometimes happens, the Judge shows that he has not wholly lost his original powers of advocacy.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I now want to read another extract from the <i>South African Law Journal</i> of 1916&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Trial by jury must indeed be regarded as one of the most remarkable of popular delusions. It supposes that men taken from the workshop, the counter, the desk, the farm, are more competent to sift and weigh evidence than the Judge who is a trained lawyer, who has had many years&#x2019; experience, both at the Bar and on the Bench, and whose whole life has been given to the study of law. Surely jurymen would be more useful to their country and would be doing much better work in their stores, offices, and workshops than they are able to do in the jury-box, where, if they merely follow the Judge&#x2019;s directions, they are a superfluity, and if they disagree with the Judge, are sure nearly always to perpetrate injustice.</block>

<p>I want to read what Mr. Morice, Q.C., had to say about the jury system. I think at one stage or other he was also a Judge in some British territory outside the Union. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am no supporter of the jury system in South Africa. When one considers that the Native population is more than five times as large as the White population, and probably the proportion of Natives that come before the courts is very much greater, while a considerable number of the crimes are committed by members of the one race against those of other, the jury in its present form appears a grotesque anomaly. It is not, however, enough to give an accused person the right to be tried without a jury.</block>

<p>That was written shortly after 1917&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That would be to perpetuate the most crying evil of the jury system in this country. Trial by jury should be abolished altogether. The last shred of justification for it seems to be taken away when it is enacted, as it does in Section 215 of the Act, that the Government may provide that persons charged with treason, sedition, public violence and certain other offences, shall be tried without a jury by a special criminal court of two or more Judges. It was just in political cases that the jury was considered a bulwark of British liberties.</block>

<p>Finally I want to read what Sir Patric Devlin wrote. He is one of Her Majesty&#x2019;s Judges in the High Court of Justice. He is a fervent advocate of the jury system but this is what he has to say about the system&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The English jury is not what it is because some law-giver so decreed but because that is the way it has grown up. Indeed, its invention by a law-giver is inconceivable. We are used to it and know that it works; if we were not, we should say that it embodies a ridiculous and impracticable idea. Consider what the idea is. Twelve (why 12?) men and women are to be selected at random; they have never before had any experience of weighing evidence and perhaps not of applying their minds judicially to any problem; they are often, as the Common Law Commissioners of 1853 tactfully put it, &#x201C;unaccustomed to severe intellectual exercise or to protracted thought &#x201D;. The case may be an intricate one, lasting some weeks and counsel may have in front of them piles of documents, of which the jury are given a few to look at. They may listen to days of oral evidence without taking notes&#x2014;at least, no one expects them to take notes and no facility is provided for it in the jury-box, not even elbow room. Yet they are said to be the sole judges of all the facts. At the end of the case they are expected within an hour or two to arrive at the same conclusion. Without their unanimous verdict no man can be punished for any of the greater <span class="col_1491-1492" refersTo="page_762"/>offences. Theoretically it ought not to be possible to successfully enforce the criminal law by such means.</block>

<p>This is one of the greatest advocates of the jury system who points out the weaknesses of the system.</p>

<p>Various Judges have at various times expressed themselves on the jury system. I just want to quote what Judge Sutton said. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my view the time has gone by for jury trials in a mixed racial community. They are an anachronism in modern times.</block>

<p>I agree that even in the few remaining cases where the jury system still applies it simply does not fit into the circumstances prevailing in this country, and for that reason I believe it is our duty and our task as law-givers to face up to the facts and to get away from the idea that this system has a long tradition when we are convinced that it does not work in South Africa. There is practically nothing left of it; it simply does not work and for that reason I have no hesitation in suggesting to this House that the jury system has served its purpose and that it can serve no further useful purpose in our administration of justice.</p>

<p>I regard it as a privilege to second this motion moved by the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser). I take pleasure in doing so, and I do it for the same reason that he does, namely that the jury system has become obsolete as a concept and as a system. It is, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has said, a very old institution which deserves a certain amount of veneration because of its age. But the fact that it has reached a great age still does not compel us to adhere to it. It is true that when the jury system was evolved it resulted in a new system of law, and that may probably be one of the reasons why it has endured for so long. Possibly we all know what a new system of law the jury system brought about in England when it was introduced there, but there may be some of us who are perhaps not aware of what a good thing the jury system was when it was first evolved and applied. If we just have regard to the system as it existed in England before the jury system came into being, we can realize in what high esteem this system was later held. The hon. member for Klerksdorp has indicated how the jury system may have had several origins. I will not weary the House with that. I am one of those who believe that it was evolved from the Anglo-Saxon countries, but at the time when the jury system was evolved the legal process in England was a very remarkable one. It was a process of people&#x2019;s courts, a process in which the population played a role, and it operated more or less in the following way. If, for example, A alleged that B had done him an injustice, the Judge decided beforehand which of the two would lose the case, and if the person was not satisfied with that decision, long before the evidence was given, he had to come there and state that he was not concerned in the injustice. He had to swear on oath that he had not done an injustice to A&#x2014; assuming B was the accused&#x2014;and if he swore that he did not do an injustice to A, that was the end of the case. But it was not always so easy, because A swore that B had in fact done it, and then a conflict ensued. Then both of them had to find people, not to come and swear, in respect of the injustice, whether it was committed or not, but they had to swear that A or B, whichever one they came to assist, was a good man, and the oath so sworn simply meant that B&#x2014;let us assume that B was the defendant and that the Judge had decided that he was the person who would have to lose the case&#x2014;then these oath-helpers only came to swear that B was a good and decent man and that he would not make a false oath. It is interesting to note that they swore that this oath was pure and not perjury. That was all they had to say. The type of oath sworn depended on the nature of the case and on the defendant or on the accused person himself. It is possible that the Judge decided. or that the people&#x2019;s court decided, that he should not come with only one oath-helper. Sometimes he had to bring as many as 48, which was the maximum, but he could also bring fewer, although the minimum was 12. And then there was, moreover, a whole system to evaluate the worth of a man&#x2019;s oath. The oath of a baron was worth more than that of an ordinary baronet, that of a baronet was worth more than that of a squire, and that of a squire again was worth more than the oath of an ordinary man. There was a whole schedule, and then they only added up the oaths to determine who had won and who had lost.</p>

<p>But even that was not enough. One of the litigants who felt that an injustice had been done to him by the number of oaths which had been built up against him could always say: They are all perjured, and then there really was trouble. Then they could proceed to the Judgment of God, to which the hon. member for Klerksdorp referred, but the hon. member touched on it only lightly, and to give hon. members an idea of how good the jury system was after that, I think I must give the House an idea of how good the Judgment of God was. There was the judgment by means of the hot iron. A hot iron was put into a person&#x2019;s hand and when he dropped it after nine yards his hand was bound and opened up after three days, and if there was a blister on his hand it meant that person had committed perjury. Or it was the trial by hot water. The accused either had to put his hand or his whole arm into hot water, as ordered by the people&#x2019;s court and according to the crime committed and the charge which was laid. and if when the man withdrew his hand or his arm. and it was unscalded, he had not committed perjury; then his oath was pure and not perjury. Or it was trial by cold water. <span class="col_1493-1494" refersTo="page_763"/>They threw a man into the water, and if he sank he was guilty but if he floated he was innocent.</p>

<p>Then he floated. In any case, the question never arose of guilt or innocence, but the point at issue was whether the person who took the oath had committed perjury or not. And certainly the most picturesque of these Judgments of God was the judgment of &#x201C;the accursed morsel&#x201D;, to which the hon. member for Klerksdorp referred. An ounce of cheese or an ounce of bread was given to a person who was charged with perjury. If he choked it meant that he had committed perjury, but if he swallowed it then he had not. And this, Mr. Speaker, was the ordinary court procedure, and peculiarly enough, it worked very well, because when the court was dealing with a criminal he could get no oath-helpers because nobody would commit perjury on behalf of someone whom they knew to be guilty.</p>

<p>But it did not work well in every respect because there were people who considered this to be a primitive procedure. In the course of time the jury system developed. This is an old Anglo-Saxon institution which developed in England. When the Norman kings came there, a new process was evolved alongside this old process, quite independently, and that was the procedure of the inquisition. The king, when he laid a charge against his subjects that they had trespassed on his land or that they had not paid enough in taxation, or for any other reason, saw no chance of looking for oath-helpers or of proceeding to apply the Judgment of God, because he had to govern the State and often an end had to be put to the litigation. He therefore took a short cut to the truth. He sent out an official with instructions to assemble a number of neighbours and put them under oath and then to question them, mainly in regard to some or other matter with which the king was concerned, and generally this was in regard to matters of taxation.</p>

<p>You know, taxation was not always a duty; it was a privilege, and it was regarded as a donation to the State, and then they agreed in the general council of the king that they would give the king a gift, say, the 40th penny (that was customary) and then everybody paid the 40th penny&#x2014;at least they were supposed to but they did not always do so, and with the approval of the council the king then sent out an official with the high-sounding name of an inquisitor, i.e. one who was curious, and he held a session which was called an inquisition.</p>

<p>This session took place in the area where he had assembled the people and had taken an oath from them, and then they said whether a person had actually paid the 40th penny, or if he had paid, whether it was in fact the 40th penny he had paid. In that way he arrived at the truth. This process, as one can understand, was appreciably more popular than the process of the swearing of oaths by oath-helpers and the Judgment of God, and gradually we reached the stage where the two processes really merged into one another and became intermingled with each other, so that the inquisition with its system of oaths and the people who were placed on oath tried to establish the truth, and the oath-helpers&#x2019; system again assisted the inquisition. That was a popular method of ascertaining the truth. The people who appeared before such an official at an inquisition were no more than witnesses, but they were also oath-helpers as well, in the sense that they helped each other to get at the truth. However, they no longer swore that the plaintiff or the defendant was a lover of the truth; they came and told on oath what they knew about the matter, and in that way they were at the same time witnesses and also judges of the facts.</p>

<p>The next step was that any person could obtain from the king a warrant to hold an inquisition on payment of the prescribed fee, and that is probably also the reason why this system became popular, because it provided an income for the king when he sold these warrants. All one had to do was to ask the chancellor or the king to institute such an inquisition, and then that was a short cut to the truth, and the inquisitor went to the area and assembled the people, put them on oath and found out whether there was any substance in the allegation that A had done an injustice to B.</p>

<p>The next step was that everybody was compelled to subject themselves to the inquisition if they could. At first they gave an accused a choice as to whether he would subject himself to the inquisition or not. If he refused, they proceeded to apply the system of the Judgments of God. The two systems remained in existence next to each other. England is a remarkable country. The English never abolish anything; they just store it away on the loft. Until to-day these Judgments of God have not been abolished; they have just fallen into desuetude. What happened now was that someone who felt aggrieved, or someone against whom a charge had been laid, stated: I subject myself to my neighbours for better or for worse. Gradually it became a duty, and if he subjected himself to it the other party was also compelled to do so. In this way the jury was established as a compulsory element at every trial under the English system. But still the members of the jury were witnesses on the one hand, whilst on the other hand, they were the people who had to hear the evidence. Therefore on the one hand they were judges, and on the other hand they were witnesses.</p>

<p>That brings me to the first weak point in the jury system. I will be forgiven for having spoken at length on this aspect of the development of the jury, but as is the case with all historical products, it carries in itself, when one gets such an admixture, the germ of self-destruction. As I have said, in this process of development, the jury system also carried within itself the germ of its own destruction. <span class="col_1495-1496" refersTo="page_764"/>Herein lies the weakest as well as the strongest point of the jury system. If a member of the jury can himself give evidence in regard to the matter, he may already be prejudiced. In such a case he is unfitted to attend the trial. If he had to hear evidence and knew nothing about the matter he had to be able to sift the lies from the truth, and if he could not do so he was also unfitted for his task. The objections I have against the jury system to-day revolve round these two points, particularly the last one. One is surprised that this institution was in operation for so long because the jury, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has said, is leally unfitted for the work it has to do.</p>

<p>They remind me of Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s horse. It will be remembered that when he saw a circus horse walking on its hind legs he was asked whether he did not find it peculiar that this could happen, and he said, &#x201C;Well, I do not find it peculiar that the horse can walk so well on its hind legs, but what I do find peculiar is that the horse can manage to walk on its hind legs at all.&#x201D; I find it peculiar that this system has lasted so long, but when I recollect what there was before we had the jury system I can appreciate that there was a certain fear in the minds of people of reverting to what they had had before, and therefore why the jury system lasted as long as it did. I want to repeat: On the one hand the juror is disqualified if he has knowledge of the matter he has to decide; on the other hand he is disqualified because he must perform a task in regard to which he has very little experience, namely to determine what the truth is, when he is really unable to do so by virtue of his mental equipment and past experience. It remains a double disqualification. Mostly he has not the capacity to judge, particularly not when he has been subjected to arguments for a few days by two or three advocates from either side.</p>

<p>When the ordinary juror comes to court, he finds himself in a milieu which is quite strange to him. That increases the possibility of his being influenced by all kinds of factors which have nothing to do with the case, but which still influence his judgment and which probably also do not assist in the administration of justice. When we analyse the average juror we find that his judgment is very probably conditioned by his preconceived ideas in regard to the case. It is conditioned by the psychological influence of minor incidents in court; it can also be influence by what he has read in the Press when the newspapers have published reports of the preparatory examination. And, last but not least, the juror is very often influenced by the striking impression created by a clever advocate in court. You know, a broad scab on a wound on the bare stomach of a person makes a much greater impression on a jury than the detailed evidence of a doctor in regard to the shallowness of a wound.</p>

<p>If we look at the average juror we can sum it up by saying that a juror&#x2019;s judgment is the result of his pet prejudices, his religious intolerances, his political antipathies and his own view of life. In saying that, I am saying a mouthful, and if I had to give examples of it I would detain the House perhaps until to-morrow. But I just want to say one thing, and that is that in our country we did not make all the exceptions referred to by the hon. member for Klerksdorp without good reason. We know, for example, that there are areas of our country where one simply cannot get a jury to convict in an illicit diamond buying case. I am not saying anything against the people who live in that area. I am simply saying that one gets a verdict which is conditioned by their own view of life, and they simply do not realize that it is wrong to deal illicitly in diamonds. I mention that as an example, but there are other examples I could mention.</p>

<p>These defects in the jury system are also manifested in other ways. It has a very broad influence on our law of evidence. The jury consists of inexperienced people who do not know much about litigation and who are not able to sift the truth from the chaff, and in order to assist the jury we have an extensive system of rules whereby certain facts are admissible at a trial and others are inadmissible. We have a whole series of rules in regard to the inadmissibility of evidence, which often confuse even the expert. The Judges, people who deal with the administration of justice every day, have learnt by experience how to sift the evidence and they realize that certain facts have great evidential value whilst others have not. But one cannot entrust the jury with those functions, and for that reason certain evidence must be withheld from the jury completely. Then one finds at a trial a dispute as to the admissibility of evidence where the Judge and the advocates on either side have to decide whether a certain bit of evidence is admissible or not. The one advocate addresses the Judge; the other also addresses the Judge, the Judge speaks to both advocates, whilst on one side of the court the jurors sit wondering when they will get to the point as to who committed the crime, or who stole the sheep. It is a state of affairs which is really farcical. But the greatest comedy is really provided by ourselves, our lawyers and the society which tolerate this system. I want to put it to hon. members this way: The conclusion at which we arrive in regard to this matter is that it is a comedy in our modern times. To begin with, we appoint a court which is unnecessarily large, consisting of nine or 12 jurors and a Judge. We man it with people who are not sufficiently equipped for the task entrusted to them&#x2014;with the exception, of course, of the Judge. Then, because there is a lack of experience on the part of a section of the court, we have rules of evidence to exclude evidence from the jury, from the people who sit there to judge whether a person is guilty or not, and often we exclude the very facts which the members of the jury use as evidence every day in their ordinary <span class="col_1497-1498" refersTo="page_765"/>lives in order to regulate their own lives. It is a comedy and a farce!</p>

<p>And the system also has its effects in other spheres. Because we are landed with this mediaeval institution we cannot succeed in letting the law of evidence develop as it should. It is simply not possible. If we look at the Continent of Europe, where there is no jury system, we see that they take all kinds of short cuts to arrive at the truth, just as the king in the year 1200 used the inquisition as a short cut to get at the truth. On the Continent, the people have for a century or more been taking short cuts to get at the truth. There is, e.g., in Holland and in Germany a system of preliminary investigation. According to that system, the accused appears before the Judge&#x2014;it is not a third degree, it is not really a police inquiry, although it is similar to it&#x2014;and the Judge puts certain questions to the accused to which he has to reply. The inquiry takes place in the presence of the accused, his advocate and the advocate of the complainant, and in the presence of the complainant. That is an example of where the police investigation and the administration of justice are really merging into one another, much in the same way as we have seen how the oath-helper system and the inquisition system merged into each other. If we have that system, and I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister should investigate it, he will be able to carry on with half the number of Judges of the Supreme Court; he will have fewer cases, and he will need fewer people than are needed under the system we have now. Because to-day we take up much time in court in proving something which everybody knows exists, or we are greatly inconvenienced by not compelling the accused to make certain admissions which are peculiarly within his knowledge. Not that we want to commit an injustice or have to commit an injustice. I am only saying that we should devote attention to a development which has proved of great benefit to other countries, without harming the administration of justice. If we had not been landed with the jury system we would also have succeeded in looking to other parts of the world and in learning from them in regard to the law of evidence, and how it can be improved. As it is, jurors are the subject of their own prejudices. And when I say that, it is not theoretical. We have had it here in Cape Town. There is a very famous case of a woman who alighted from a tram. She was evidently negligent and a municipal lorry driver ran into her and injured her leg. That was before 1927, before the abolition of the jury system in civil cases. This lorry driver employed by the municipality was brought to court and was found not guilty by the magistrate, but that did not prevent the keen advocates and attorneys and the plaintiff from bringing a civil case against the municipality. The complainant&#x2019;s case was tried by a jury. Her advocate started off by showing the large injury on the woman&#x2019;s leg to every one of the jurors. After having inspected the leg, there was no longer any problem in regard to proving the case.</p>

<p>That is a shocking indictment!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>But it happened. Those are the facts. The magistrate had acquitted the driver, but the jury found that there was in fact negligence. When I read it I was reminded of the Irish adage that an Irish jury &#x201C;will never find against a fair lady, but always against the Railway&#x201D;. That is so, and it is also clear that our authorities took note of that particular verdict by a Cape Town jury. Mindful of what could happen if the State was the defendant in such a case, this Parliament abolished the practice of using jurors in civil cases in 1927. They abolished it as the result of the extravagant claims made by people injured in the railway disaster at Salt River in 1926. These claims were so extravagant that the Government decided at least to abolish the jury system, in civil cases. The significant thing is that thereafter plaintiffs in such cases thought twice, and the number as well as the scope of the claims were appreciably reduced. They did not dare to abolish trial by jury in criminal cases. The time was not yet ripe for it. But the considerations which were valid then in civil cases are still valid to-day in respect of criminal trials. I am not saying anything against the jury system. The jurors acted to the best of their ability. I am not saying they did their work badly. I am not saying they were prejudiced, but I do say that they bring their whole personality to court with them and then they have to do work for which they are not equipped and which we cannot reasonably expect from them because the world has developed and become much more complicated.</p>

<p>When we have to judge of the merits of the jury system, there are a few arguments which are advanced, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has said. I do not wish to repeat those arguments, but I would like to return to them. The supposed merit of the jury system is that the jury brings the law into line with ordinary life. If I have to go into that, I must ask myself: Who brings the law more into line with life, the jury or the Judge? I must ask myself whether the Judge in his exalted position really becomes so far removed from actualities that he is longer in touch with ordinary life. I should say that a Judge who comes into contact with all the offenders every day in court has a much better and a much greater understanding of life than a jury, which perhaps comes into contact with such things only once in a lifetime. The Judge is much more aware of all the tensions of life and in court than a jury which happens to come there once in a lifetime. And I do not think a single juror of the past or of the future will quarrel with me when I say that the juror is not exactly the best medium for telling us what public opinion is in regard to any particular matter. I do not think it is within the power of one person, or even of seven or nine or 12 persons, to tell us what <span class="col_1499-1500" refersTo="page_766"/>public opinion is on a particular point. Nor do I think it is relevant.</p>

<p>A second argument advanced is that the jury system gives the public the opportunity to take part in the administration of justice. The hon. member for Klerksdorp has estimated that this public barely numbers 400,000. But there is still a further reply to that. The contribution of the jury to the making of law is precisely nil. When they still had to decide what customs existed in a particular hamlet, when they still had to expound what the law was in respect of a certain incident, then they made a contribution; when they still had to correlate the facts and had themselves to give evidence as to what the law was, they still made a contribution. But thereafter the only people who contributed towards giving shape to the law were the Judges themselves and the advocates, and still later, Parliament. To-day Parliament and the various legislative bodies like the Provincial Councils and the municipalities form the law, and of course also public opinion. But we need not have a medium like the jury to tell us what public opinion is.</p>

<p>The third merit the jury system is supposed to have is that it relieves the Judge of an unpleasant duty. I quite believe that the Judges will perhaps hesitate before voting immediately for the jury system to be abolished, because it makes matters easier for them when they need not decide on the facts. The law is already complicated enough and the Judge must devote his attention to that. But, Mr. Speaker, that is the responsibility of the Judge. That is what he is appointed for, that is what he has experience of, and that is why we choose our Judges from the best advocates available, men with long and ripe experience. They have experience not only in respect of the law, but also in respect of the behaviour of people when they are in the witness box and are supposed to be telling the truth. The Judge cannot evade that responsibility. What is more, he does not evade it either; nor does he intend evading it, because he gives a summing up to the jury which must convince the jury that they have to decide this way or the other. In his own mind he has already come to a decision in regard to the facts, but he keeps it to himself because it is not his duty to impart that to the jury. In any case, he must shoulder the responsibility connected to his position. And I believe that our Judges are prepared to do so.</p>

<p>There is one advantage of the jury system which I cannot argue away, but it is an advantage which we will also have with the system of assessors, if we only stick to it. That advantage is this, that the Judge gives an oral judgment in which he reviews the facts as they have been ascertained in the particular trial. It is a very important matter and a very great advantage that a person should loudly record his own convictions, or do so in such a way that all interested parties, or those who need to do so, can record it themselves. Now, we need not have a jury in order to retain this advantage. The Judges do so to-day. When they sit with assessors, the Judge gives a summing up. Perhaps he does not give such a detailed summing up because he is dealing with more skilled people. But we can retain that system. This is the only advantage I can still see in the jury system, namely that the Judge gives an oral summing up.</p>

<p>In seconding this motion moved by the hon. member, I say I do so because, even though it is old, it is obsolete. I do so because it hampers development. I do so because the Judges, through their experience, are better equipped to do the work which we entrust to a college of inexperienced people who should not really have to do that work. For those reasons I take pleasure in supporting this motion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) on the very lucid and very clear exposition which he gave this House on the history of the jury system, especially its beginnings in England. The hon. member has obviously gone to great pains to present the picture and the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) also presented some of the history of the jury system. Both these hon. members spoke as observers, if I may say, from the outside. I should like to speak on this debate as an observer from the inside, as a person who has had experience of juries, the workings of our system, not only appearing for the accused but appearing also for the Crown, for the State.</p>

<p>What we are concerned with here to-day, Sir, is justice, justice in our criminal courts. Justice in a court takes the form of seeking after truth, a very difficult and engaging pursuit to which people have devoted their lives, to which societies have devoted their everything. Over the centuries in our own courts and throughout England there has been built up an edifice, a machinery, for the purpose of finding truth. A very elusive task and a very difficult task, a task in which everyone accepts one cannot be perfect. And the jury system is part of that edifice. It is part of that machinery which has been developed over the centuries whose purpose and function it is to seek out the truth. It is part of a great system of justice in South Africa of which we in this country can be justly proud. Because I believe, Sir, that there is no system of justice in the world which is the peer of the South African system of justice. And it is in the light of this that I wish. Mr. Speaker, to discuss this motion.</p>

<p>What one must bear in mind right from the beginning is that the jury system only operates in respect of criminal charges&#x2014;they do not operate in civil courts&#x2014;and secondly that they are not forced on to anyone at all. That is a right which an accused person has in certain circumstances. They are not bodies which are foisted upon any accused. So far <span class="col_1501-1502" refersTo="page_767"/>as those who practise the law are concerned, I would like to remind the House that the General Council of the Bar of South Africa, which is a sort of federated body on which all members of the Bar all over the country are represented, recently unanimously decided that it was against any further inroads being made in the jury system. In other words, they favour the retention of the jury system. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister, who is here, when he replies to the debate, to indicate to us whether there are any Judges, and if so how many, who have complained about the jury system. I do not believe, Sir, that there are.</p>

<p>One of the arguments which the hon. member for Klerksdorp advanced was, as I understood him, that less than 5 per cent of all the criminal cases before the Supreme Court were heard by jury. Or only in less than 5 per cent did the accused ask for trial by jury. One must have regard to the very factors he mentioned when one assesses this figure. The Criminal Procedure Act has been so amended over the years&#x2014;we had an example last year &#x2014;that the instances in which the accused can have a trial by jury get less and less.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>One attributes the various causes to the various instances. One of them is the Riotous Assemblies Act. One can appreciate that to choose a jury from the area where the riotous assembly has taken place, in as much as the matter could also assume the form of <i>crimen laesae majestitis,</i> would be something inadvisable; it would be inadvisable to have a jury in that case. That is the point, Sir, that in all the instances that there are it is considered not advisable to have a jury. The point is not that a jury could not give a proper verdict or that the jury is incompetent to give a verdict. The question is whether in these cases the jury should be called upon to give a decision. Under the Atomic Energy Act the hon. the Minister has the power to withhold trial by jury, and probably quite rightly so, because of the very technical nature of the subject matter. One could press this argument further and say that even a Judge or even a magistrate would have difficulty in understanding the technicality of the subject matter of offences under the Atomic Energy Act. And if one pressed it even further one could make a case for a special jury of experts to consider and decide upon the facts which are in issue.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in practice that is where the assessors would come in. One of the points which arise in relation to assessors is that as the Act stands to-day Judges need not any more have assessors in any criminal cases. I must say, Sir, that it is to be regretted that the law was changed in this regard. While it is true that the Appellate Division has said that it is advisable that Judges should take assessors when they sit in cases and while it is true that Judges generally do take assessors when they sit in these cases, the fact remains that they can try them alone. The fact is that the Judges and the Appellate Division have decided in their wisdom that one man should not have the responsibility of trying a man, especially when he is being tried for his life. It is very interesting that in regard to the matter which the hon. the Minister has raised, the Judges themselves, learned as they are and experienced as they are, still feel that one man should not be called upon to decide the facts in these cases. There is a point to which I shall later allude which I believe strengthens the argument for juries being the finders of fact. The other example is the illicit possession of precious metals or stones: The hon. member for Standerton said that no jury called from the district in which the offence took place will probably find the accused guilty. I do not think that since the days of the great advocate Upington there have been any of these cases. I believe it was after his successes with the jury in relation to these diamond cases, that this Act was amended. I know of no case in which a jury trial has taken place in this regard. Another example is that of supplying intoxicating liquor to Natives. Another example is that of insolvency. All these matters are really of a technical nature.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important restriction on trial by jury, and one which I personally approve of, is where the &#x201C;offence is towards or in connection with a non-European, if the accused or any of them is a European or towards or in connection with a European, if the accused or any of them is a non-European&#x201D;. In this regard the hon. the Minister has a discretion. I cannot think of a case where the choice has been for trial by jury in one of these Black on White or White on Black cases. In those cases the decision has already been made before the Minister&#x2019;s warrant arrives saying that the trial was not to be by jury. It is this sort of case that is pointed to by those who advocate the removal of the jury system. There is a story which is true, I understand, because the same characters appear in it every time. Mr. Justice Greenberg went on circuit in the Transvaal. One of the cases which came before the circuit court was that of a local farmer who had beaten one of his boys and the boy had died. The accused was charged with murder. It was apparently a cut and dried case of murder. The accused obtained the services of the great advocate Harry Morris, who went up to defend him, and he found that he had nothing to say at all. He said that the only thing he could think of was temporary insanity. He duly put this defence up. The Judge summed up very strongly for a verdict of guilty of murder and the jury returned a verdict of &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D;. It is alleged that Judge Greenberg then said <span class="col_1503-1504" refersTo="page_768"/>to the foreman: &#x201C;It is not within my scope really to ask you, but I am very interested, what was the ground of your decision?&#x201D; The foreman replied: &#x201C;My Lord, temporary insanity.&#x201D; The Judge looked down at him and said: &#x201C;What, all nine of you?&#x201D; It is that sort of incident, and the sort of incident that the hon. member for Standerton mentioned about the girl who showed her leg and was more favourably received by the jury than she would otherwise have been, that strengthens the case of those who are against the jury system. But, of course, it is a very moot point as to whether a magistrate might not have been equally moved by such an exhibition. We believe that they also are human, Sir.</p>

<p>Last year the right to be tried by jury was further invaded in the General Law Amendment Act. It is now provided that even in cases of murder and arson the hon. the Minister may exercise his discretion and refuse the accused the right to be tried by jury. It is not clear in what circumstances that is going to be done. The jury system as it is to-day exists in any event in a very restricted form by reason of all these restrictions that I have mentioned, and they are mostly restrictions in respect of technical matters. One of the arguments which were used by the mover of this motion&#x2014;and he called a lot of evidence to support him in the form of extracts from law journals&#x2014;was that these jurymen were not really in a position to decide in any case because they were not trained to sift evidence; they were not trained in the law in any way at all. Mr. Speaker, in my opinion that is precisely why a jury is a better judge of fact than a man trained in the law. When one considers what a jury is required to do, it becomes apparent that the function of a jury is far better discharged by persons who apply their minds only to the facts. A jury is required only to give a decision on the facts. It is required to decide whether a witness is telling the truth; it is required to decide whether something is probable in their experience as men of the world. I believe that they bring a fresher mind to bear upon the case. They have no experience of other cases. It is desirable indeed, Sir, that they have no experience of other cases. The facts in every case are different. Anyone who is connected with the law knows the sort of attitude one adopts towards cases. You take the average <i>pro deo</i> murder. You go into court, you have heard it all before and it is described by people who practise, as a variation of the same theme. You have the feeling that you have seen it all before. Indeed, when you consider how hard-worked magistrates are, they spend their whole day seeing the same thing, one case after the other. It must develop in them&#x2014;I am prepared to say it does develop in them&#x2014;a sense of &#x201C;this is nothing new; I have seen all this before; I have seen this policeman before; he has always told the truth as far as I know; I do not have to decide whether he is telling the truth or not; my mind is conditioned to his telling the truth &#x201D;. That is the sort of thing that happens. And I do not say this to the detriment of any of our judicial officers. It is the sort of thing that happens to any human being. Because he is human.</p>

<p>What do they have to decide? The jury has to decide the facts. It has to decide whether there is a reasonable doubt as to the accused guilt or innocence. According to Gardiner and Lansdown &#x201C;reasonable doubt&#x201D; is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The doubt must not be light or capricious, such as timidity or passion prompts, and weakness or corruption readily adopts. It must be such a doubt as, upon a calm view of the whole evidence, a rational understanding will suggest to an honest heart; the conscientious hesitation of minds that are not influenced by party, preoccupied by prejudice or subdued by fear.</block>

<p>When you consider &#x201C;not influenced by party, preoccupied by prejudice or subdued by fear&#x201D; I think you cannot find any individual better suited to discharge these functions, having regard to this, than the ordinary man in the street. The ordinary man in the street has nothing to fear, nothing to lose, nothing to gain by giving his decision. He has no experience which guides his decision as to what the facts in that case are. I do not have to remind the House that the facts in every single case are different. No two cases are alike.</p>

<p>The other thing they have to decide as to guilt is whether the evidence given by an accused person might reasonably be true having regard to their experience of life. They do not sit there like people up in the clouds, not like some academic lawyer who is going to write a book, not like a Judge whose experience of the lower social orders is necessarily restricted. The test is not whether such a person thinks it might reasonably have happened, but whether a person who is the same sort of person as the accused thinks that something might reasonably have happened. That is the test, Sir, that is applied. The ordinary man who lives in the same society as the accused, is able to judge whether what the accused says may or may not be true. He is the man that the centuries have decided should judge the facts and the actions of his fellow-man. I go so far as to say that in that regard he is better qualified, much better qualified, than a Judge of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>No, Sir. In saying that the hon. the Minister of Defence does not take account of the fact that the Judge is there to see that the facts which filter through to the jury are admissible facts. He is there to protect the accused as well. He is there to apply the law; to tell them what the law is. But he has nothing whatsoever to do with the facts. I do not know one Judge who has not expressed the opinion that a jury is just as <span class="col_1505-1506" refersTo="page_769"/>qualified to decide upon the facts of a case as he is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp spoke about the number of people who were excluded from the jury. It is true that a number of people are. But what is left when the legal practitioners and the accountants and the secretaries of various organizations, members of the Civil Service, etc., have been excluded, is precisely the type of person that you want on a jury, namely the ordinary man in the street who is not influenced by party, preoccupied by prejudice or subdued by fear. In other words, the sort of man who has no connection whatever with the State and who exercises his mind independently and fearlessly. I must say that I take some exception to the attitude which the hon. member for Standerton adopted towards these people, that they were really being frivolous when they took the oath which the hon. member for Klerksdorp read out, viz. &#x201C;to give a true verdict according to the evidence without fear, favour or prejudice&#x201D;. If you take this argument further you find the sort of situation that you have in England where you still have special juries. A special jury was once empanelled in Cambridge, a special jury of dons and academic lawyers, gentlemen like the hon. member for Standerton. They were empanelled to give a decision in a case of negligence. What the judge asked them was&#x2014;it was a simple case: Two motor-cars were involved&#x2014;to go out to consider whose negligence was the proximate cause of the collision. All these learned gentlemen, with all the qualifications which the hon. member for Standerton has, came back after a few hours and told the Judge that they did not understand his question. The Judge had to discharge that special jury. I might add that case was then later tried before an ordinary tribunal, an ordinary jury, and they had no difficulty in understanding the question and had no difficulty in deciding whose negligence was in fact the proximate cause of the collision.</p>

<p>It is all very well for hon. members to speak from up in the clouds, from the universities and from the sidelines, but the Bar of South Africa has pledged itself to support the jury system, and the Bar is the only society which has experience of it, apart of course from the Judges. I have never had any complaints about a jury, about the absurdity of their decision, or their inability to understand the evidence and thus to give effect to their oath to give a true verdict according to the evidence without fear, favour or prejudice. I say that speaking also as an enthusiastic prosecutor on those occasions when the State briefs members of the Bar to prosecute. There is an old, trite saying that if you are innocent then do not take a jury, but if you are guilty, take a jury. That may be so. If I had to express an opinion on this, I would say that it is so. If I thought my client was guilty on the evidence, I would certainly advise him to choose a jury. But that is right. It is in keeping with our legal system. The tenor of our legal system is that the onus is on the State and the accused is always entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It is better to let 99 guilty men go free than to hang one innocent man. That is the principle, and if a jury does lean over towards the accused, that is in keeping with our judicial system and with the spirit of our law. That is in fact the spirit of our law. I believe the jury exemplifies this system and this spirit in their approach to the problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp raised the question that it was important that the ordinary man or woman should take part in the administration of justice. I think that is an extremely important aspect of our judicial system, that there is a place and a way in which the ordinary man in the street can take part in the everyday administration of justice. I feel the same principle applies to the Department&#x2019;s policy in Natal of taking circuit courts up into Zululand, because these people like to see justice being done; they do not like to hear about it. Likewise, the ordinary man and woman should be given an opportunity of taking part in the administration of justice. Otherwise it will become something far removed, exercised by servants of the State, generally speaking&#x2014;I am not referring to the Judges&#x2014;and the ordinary administration of justice then becomes part of the ever-growing bureaucratic system of government which one finds in every Western country in the world. It becomes a decision taken by an official of the Government which is enforcing the law. The principle which is involved in the jury system is that the jury stands between the individual and the harshness of the State. There is no doubt that juries do something which the hon. member for Klerksdorp also mentioned. I think he said they temper justice with mercy. I want to put this a little differently. I would say that juries temper the strict law with the morality of the day. There is no doubt whatever that the law is, always has been and always will be, 30 years behind the time. One can remember that in 1914 it was a criminal offence to commit adultery. The Appellate Division in that year decided that this was not in conformity with the morality of the day and that crime disappeared. It had been abrogated by disuse.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>By disuse of prosecutions. The jury provides these 30 missing years. It is very interesting to see what sort of verdicts juries give when they are asked to apply strictly a law with which they do not agree. If there is ever a truism about our law, about any law. it is that the law is never designed to meet all the cases which come up for decision. All the cases that arise can never be foreseen by the Legislature, which is concerned with the generality of the principle, and in the application of that principle the Judges and magistrates by their training must <span class="col_1507-1508" refersTo="page_770"/>strictly apply that law, even to the extent of allowing an injustice such as would normally be unconscionable to them and to society. But they are trained not to have consideration for the morality of the day, but to have consideration only for the law, for their master, the law, and to apply the facts according to that law.</p>

<p>I was very interested to read in the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning an extract from the <i>Burger,</i> which says that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">at any rate some of the consequences of some of the clauses of the extended Immorality Act and of their application could hardly have been foreseen, as is apt to happen with laws.</block>

<p>I think that is true. It is an observation they make in respect of a particular law which, there is no doubt, if one is to believe the article in the <i>Burger,</i> causes not only injustice but harm to people not connected with the offence, and perhaps even harm to South Africa. The point is that there are many laws which should not be applied to their limits. Judges and magistrates must apply them to their limits. They have no discretion. They are not allowed and they do not allow morality or compassion to enter into their judgments. But a jury does allow that compassion to enter into its verdict, and it gives in the result a judgment which reflects the morality of the day. It gives a judgment which is in all conscience a true verdict according to the evidence.</p>

<p>One can argue that juries, in giving decisions which Judges might not give, in fact have regard to what the real intention of the law is, and not to the strict interpretation of the law. For the reason that it is impossible to make a law to meet every case, and because local conditions must determine whether a law has the same effect in that local area as it does in another local area or not, juries in that regard perform an invaluable function of the law, not only to the law but to society. I believe that is the function of the law, to protect society. It is there for the benefit of society and not for the benefit of the State or for the benefit of anyone else but the people who are affected by it. Here, Sir, is the opportunity for the people who are affected by it to take part in it, to know it and to appreciate it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very difficult question and perhaps I define it differently from the way the Minister does. The State is where society is. I believe that society is the people in the State, and what they think. The State is the edifice in which they live, and the State&#x2019;s edifice, with all its machinery, belongs to the society which lives in that State. The State, as an entity, does not exist apart from society. There are those who believe that the State is what matters, and the State has become personified in the form of the Government, but I do not believe that is true and I am pleased to see the Minister shaking his head to show that he does not believe it either.</p>

<p>One of the arguments which has been used here and no doubt elsewhere against the jury system is that it is a foreign system. Sir, there is nothing foreign, in so far as our legal system is concerned, about what has come from England. What has come from England in our legal system has become, as it did in England, part of the people who live under that system. Justice is the issue which we are debating here to-day, and justice in this country I believe to be without peer as a system of justice. It has the broad principles of the Roman-Dutch law and the vehicle or machinery of the English law of evidence and procedure. No one can gainsay that everything we have, in so far as our system is concerned, not only comes from England but is even to-day part of the English system. The procedural laws and the laws of evidence and the jury system are all tied up together. Only yesterday we had two Bills before this House. One was to deal with the substantive law, with the Roman-Dutch law, as the hon. the Minister said, to bring the Roman-Dutch law forward and replace this other system we had. And the other was the law of evidence, an Act which is on all fours, almost word for word, with the English Act.</p>

<p>When the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with the question of the law of evidence and the argument that the jury system was a foreign system and should therefore be abolished. I was saying that all our procedural law is in fact foreign in that sense, in the sense in which that word was used, because it all comes from England. In fact, our law provides to-day, in the Criminal Procedure Act, that if there is any doubt as to what the law is one has to look to the law relating to the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. This was re-enacted in 1956 as part and parcel of our law. Mr. Speaker, the jury system in South Africa to-day is in fact part of the law of evidence. It is part of the law relating to how you prove facts in a court of law. I have said that we have the best system of justice in the world to-day, and we have it because we have a combination or marriage of the finest legal systems in the form of the Roman-Dutch law, which is based on broad principles of law, and we have the machinery or the vehicle for carrying that law into effect in the form of this system of evidence of which the jury is a part. That law of evidence and the jury system have been accepted by us because it was tried over the centuries, both in England and in South Africa, and so much do we think of that system that <span class="col_1509-1510" refersTo="page_771"/>we even provide to-day that whatever the law is in England, if there is any doubt, that is the law in South Africa. What we have here is a suggestion by the mover of this motion that we begin to break down this system which has stood the test of centuries and which has become part of our own law.</p>

<p>There are many variations, of course, of the English law of evidence, and in South Africa those variations make our system of justice even fairer than the English system. One of these is the question of a confession. In England it is possible to admit in a court of law a confession made to a policeman provided it is proved that it was made voluntarily. In South Africa it is not possible to do that, and one of the reasons why it is not possible and why our law provides that no statement made to a policeman can be produced in evidence as a confession by that policeman, is that it would be prejudicial to the accused, especially if he was being tried by a jury. Mr. Speaker, there are no cases of injustices which have been done to accused persons through their being tried by a jury. It is true that there are cases which have given Judges cause to express surprise at the verdict, but I doubt very much, and no one to-day has been able to produce an example of a Judge who was shocked at the decision of the jury which produced an injustice for the accused. You do not have to look to juries to find injustices, as far as the accused are concerned. If one takes the now famous case, the Bergville murder trial, the so-called &#x201C;dagga trial&#x201D;, where 23 persons were sentenced to death for the murder of a number of policemen who were on a dagga raid, they all asked for leave to appeal, which was refused by the trial Judge. Their petition was heard by a Judge of Appeal who decided that there was no ground for appeal, that there was no chance of success on appeal, and the death sentences were confirmed. At the last minute, while these people were all in the death cells, evidence was collected to show that one man was not there, and the Appeal Court then heard the case and the extraordinary thing about it was that they said there was no evidence whatsoever that this man was at the scene of the crime at all; they said he should have been discharged at the end of the Crown case. But that was a case which was tried by a Judge and assessors. It was a question of fact, and one wonders whether there is any substance in the thought that juries are not able to find on facts as easily or as competently as a Judge. These are the examples which were given, and not one example was given of the verdict of a jury which resulted in an injustice to the accused. That is the object of our criminal law, to provide a system which will produce the truth as far as possible, but at all costs, that there should be no prejudice to the accused. The law is not their function. Even on the law, which is the function of the Judges, they are inclined to disagree. There is a well-known case&#x2014;I hope it is well known to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;of statutory theft where you are regarded as being guilty of theft where you buy something which you ought to have known was stolen property, the test being not whether the accused knew whether it was stolen, but whether the Judge in that position would have thought it was stolen. On this issue in Natal the courts have decided that there is to be compulsory whipping for a first offence, but in the Transvaal the courts have decided that a whipping is incompetent for a first offence. I am sure that the Judges, looking at each other, would have the same thoughts that the hon. member for Klerksdorp mentioned, that they were surprised at the verdict of the jury. I am sure that the Judges in the Transvaal might be surprised at the verdict of the Judges in Natal, and vice versa. Those arguments do not really hold any water, because they can be used on both sides. No one is infallible. Sir, the hon. member for Klerksdorp quoted a lot of extracts from Law Journals. One of the things he said was that justice was administered without a sense of responsibility. I want to say that is nonsense. He went on to say that the responsibility of the jury was divisible in nines and was therefore necessarily a weakness. He also said that there were no facilities for the jury to take notes and there was no elbow room. Sir, I am sorry to say so but anyone who has been in a court of law will see that this is patent nonsense. They may take notes if they want to do so. Papers and pencils are provided, and there is a lot of elbow room. I just want to say that it is not true that in fact happens. So far from being divisible by nine, the decision of the jury is strengthened by nine. Sir, Judges and magistrates are human; they also sometimes get out of the bed on the wrong side; very often the eggs aren&#x2019;t turned properly by their wives and they might have had a motor accident on their way to court. They might like all of us be a little bit gripy in the morning. But the law of averages would indicate that nine men are unlikely to have coincidence of these things on the morning that they go into court.</p>

<p>The choice before this House to-day is whether we believe that an accused is entitled to be tried, if he wants to be, by nine men or whether he should be tried by one. Only the facts are to be tried, and we believe that he should retain this right, if he so wishes, and we believe it so strongly that we shall, if the opportunity arises, vote against this motion. Sir, this is a system of which we can all be justly proud and I believe that we should leave it alone.</p>

<p>Before the luncheon adjournment the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) said that the General Bar Council was in favour of the retention of the jury system. I can understand why the General Bar Council is in favour of the retention of the jury system. The hon. member said that when an advocate has to decide on behalf of an accused, whether to have a jury or not, the accused chose a Judge when <span class="col_1511-1512" refersTo="page_772"/>he was innocent, and a jury when he was guilty. Well, the General Bar Council consists of advocates and they are the people who advise their clients and you can understand, Sir, why they want to retain the jury system, because I have never heard that only persons who were guilty were charged and that because of that they chose a jury. That is why they are against the abolition of the jury system. In connection with this I want to say further that the advocates adopt a different attitude when they are appointed to the Bench. On page 56, paragraph 360 of the report of the Lansdowne Commission published in 1947, a commission which dealt with penal and prison reform, you find this&#x2014;every member of that Commission was a Judge&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Judges of the Supreme Court (including the Appellate Division) are, with the exception of the Judges of the Cape Provincial Division, unanimously in favour of the retention of jury trial. The Judges of the Cape Provincial Division favour the abolition of trial by jury and its replacement by trial by Judge and assessors. Juries are not, in the opinion of the learned Judges of the Cape Provincial Division, fitted to try a case of any complexity. Of the Attorneys-General and the Solicitor-General, three were for abolition, one for qualified retention and one for retention where asked for by the accused.</block>

<p>This report came out in 1947 and since then, I believe, all four provinces of the Republic have been in favour of the abolition of the jury system. In the province of South West Africa, if I may call it that, there is no jury system. You can quite understand, therefore, that the argument is that the General Bar Council is in favour of the jury system, but the moment they get appointed to the Bench, they see the other side of the picture. Then they are no longer members of the Bar Council and they change their opinion.</p>

<p>In his introductory remarks the hon. member went on to say: &#x201C;What we are concerned with here to-day is justice.&#x201D; When he said that I was reminded of a case which was heard in the Supreme Court of the Free State some time ago. It was a murder case where a farmer had shot one of his servants. Wisely the advocate chose a jury to decide the case. Since it is the custom in this country to prove the guilt of the accused, the Crown succeeded in proving that the man had shot his servant. The case against the accused was proved beyond any doubt. The advocate did not have much to say but when he addressed the jury he said this &#x201C;Honourable members of the jury, do you not think that a person on his own farm has the right to take his own gun and shoot his own servant? If that is no longer the position, it is a sad day.&#x201D; Well, the verdict was not guilty. I cannot see therefore, where justice comes into it, because had the accused in this case appeared before a Judge, he would have been condemned to death.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is an unenviable task to have to say anything after the hon. members for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) and Standerton (Dr. Coertze) have stated their cases, but nevertheless I want to point out one or two things which have not been raised yet, and the first is the delays that are caused in our courts because of the jury system. It is a well-known fact that where a trial by jury takes place, it lasts twice as long as when a Judge sits alone. We shall therefore save a great deal of time if we abolished the jury system completely. We know that the rolls of the courts are to-day overflowing and that it takes months, even years, before a case can be placed on the roll. It may be said that you have a jury in criminal cases, but if the jury system were abolished, the Judges who presided criminal courts, could then be used in civil cases. The Lansdowne Commission confirms that a jury takes twice as long to try a case as a Judge or a Judge with two assessors.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp mentioned a long list of classes of persons who were excluded from serving on a jury. There are 21 classes. It is not necessary for me to repeat those classes; they are given in Section 115 of Act 56 of 1955. The question is which classes are left. The only remaining classes are agriculture, trade and industry. The members of these classes are the very people in our society who are the busiest. There is thus a limited number from which jury members may be chosen. I spoke to a Sheriff recently, and he told me that amongst these classes there were people who were continually asking for exemption. They do everything in their power not to serve on the jury. They go so far as to approach the defence and to ask the defence to object to them on some ground or other so that they need not serve on the jury. That only goes to show that the ordinary member of the public is no longer prepared to serve on a jury to-day.</p>

<p>There may be one advantage connected with the retention of the jury system. If we were to have large scale unemployment in the country, members of the jury could be appointed from the ranks of the unemployed, but fortunately we are not in that position to-day.</p>

<p>I want to go further and refer to the costs connected with the compilation of the jury list. The Chief Electoral Officer has to prepare a list of all the registered voters and take from that list all those people between the ages of 25 and 65 years. That takes up a great deal of time because it is obvious that every registration card must be checked to ascertain the age of the person and those details have to be forwarded to the magistrate who in turn forwards it to the Sheriff. That takes up a great deal of time and is obviously costly. But that is not all. After the magistrate has forwarded <span class="col_1513-1514" refersTo="page_773"/>the list to the Sheriff, the Sheriff has to prepare a panel and in that way further time is wasted and it involves high costs, because, as I have said, many people are called upon to serve on the jury who are not prepared to do so. Some people have moved and cannot be traced and the Sheriff has to find substitutes for them. Persons may also obtain exemption and in that case the Sheriff has to find substitutes. It is therefore a waste of time. Let us see who the persons are who can be summonsed to serve as jury members. As I have said they belong to trade, industry and agriculture. Those are hard-working people who are to-day occupied in keeping our whole economy going.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the fees which are paid to members of the jury. When this system was introduced in the Transvaal Republic in 1854 the law provided that a member of a jury could be paid an amount of four sixdollars, equivalent to approximately 6s. per day, as well as his travelling expenses. In 1874 this was increased to 10s. per day and this amount remained unchanged up to 1956 when it was increased to 15s. per day, that is to say, if the jury member is resident in the magisterial district where the case is to be heard, and if he can sleep at home at night, but if the distance between his home and the court is so great that it is necessary for him to sleep in the city, he recieves an additional 15s., a total therefore of &#x00A3;1 10s. per day, from which he still has to pay for his accommodation.</p>

<p>When you consider that a jury member receives a fee of only 15s. you cannot hold it against any person if he does not want to serve on a jury, because which person earns less than 15s. to-day? Those who do are the the weakest type, the very person that you do not want on a jury. We are therefore, doing people a disservice by summonsing them to serve on a jury. It disrupts their business. Sometimes a person has to sit on a jury for weeks on end. If he is an artisan he receives 15s. for his services on the jury and there is no obligation on his firm to pay him the difference between his wage and his jury fee. He, therefore, suffers a dead loss. The same applies to the businessman. Surely his time is worth more to him than 15s. per day, but he is now called upon to attend to something which is of no interest to him at all, simply because some people still wish to retain the jury system. It is therefore a waste of time and money. The Sheriffs also have to incur unnecessary costs in compiling the jury lists and in serving the summonses. In the 1960-61 Budget an amount of R9,000 was voted as jury fees. It does not sound much but it is unnecessary to pay out that amount. It is also proof, on the other hand, that the jury system has served its purpose, and that the jury system is not being used on such a large scale any more.</p>

<p>When the Lansdowne Commission sat in 1947 in connection with penal and prison reform, certain arguments were advanced why the system should be kept alive and they were based mainly on sentimental reasons, such as that the jury system has practically become tradition in South Africa. Nevertheless the Lansdowne Commission felt that the system had served its purpose. From the evidence submitted to that commission in 1947 it appeared that of all which appeared before court, approximately only 25 per cent were cases where a jury could be appointed. Last year less than 2 per cent of those kind of cases appeared before court, which proves that the jury system has served its purpose in South Africa. One might say that it should be allowed to die naturally and that we should leave it at that but if you had listened to the arguments of the mover of the motion and those of the hon. member for Standerton and you considered the costs that were involved in this system and the unnecessary work that was entailed you must come to one conclusion only, namely that the jury system has served its purpose.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the hon. members for Klerksdorp and Standerton by supporting this motion, and I have no doubt that after the Minister has heard us, he will instruct his legal advisers to have the various sections in respect of juries and the jury system repealed. It gives me pleasure, therefore, to support the motion moved by the hon. member for Klerksdorp.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like first to deal with some of the criticisms of the jury system which have been raised from the other side. The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) has suggested to the Minister that he should abandon his good intention of being guided to a large extent by the General Bar Council on the ground that the Bar Council allegedly has some very narrow interest in this matter. Sir, I do wish to cross swords with the hon. member on that point, because I suggest that the General Council most definitely is the body in this country best qualified to express an opinion on the jury system, and that only the weightiest considerations would weigh with them. In addition, he mentioned the question of expense. While one can concede that there is a certain amount of expense attached to the jury system, I suggest that it is a very limited one. Indeed I think some figure was mentioned by the hon. the Minister, a very small amount of, I think, R8,000 a year. I suggest that is a very small amount, particularly if you bear in mind the very great public service which is performed in educating the people of the country in the ways of the courts, and in instilling respect amongst the people for the courts and the administration of justice. Mr. Speaker, I have not yet spoken to a juryman who has not both enjoyed and welcomed the experience of serving on a jury. In ray experience the weightiness of the administration of justice has been brought home to them and they have been glad to have been called to perform their <span class="col_1515-1516" refersTo="page_774"/>duty. Consequently I feel that if there is a certain amount of expense attached to the jury system, it is an expense which, since it is small, can well be afforded.</p>

<p>Then there is the question that was raised by the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), and that is the difficult position of the Minister of Justice in so far as exercising his discretion under, I think Section 111 is concerned. Here he has to decide whether or not to grant a trial by a Judge and deny trial by jury. I suggest that difficulty can easily be met by a small amendment to the Act, making it compulsory in the cases particularly complained of that it should be a Judge and assessor trial. I am thinking there of cases in which Europeans and non-Europeans are involved, where the hon. member for Standerton felt that it placed the Minister in a very invidious position. If there do happen to be others in which the Minister is placed in a particularly invidious position, possibly the same approach could be applied there. Likewise the hon. member for Standerton stressed the fact that South Africa was not a homogeneous country and that this was a further reason for doing away with the jury system. But there too the same approach could be applied, namely that in such cases a trial by a Judge and assessors can be made compulsory.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof referred to the Lansdowne Commission and the attitude set out by the Judges in that report. But, sir, that report was drawn up in 1947, and the passage quoted by the hon. member made it clear that what the Judges were not in favour of then was trial by jury when very complicated matters were at issue, where very difficult matters of accountancy or insolvency were at issue. Those situations have already been dealt with by amendment to the Act, and I take it therefore that the objections of the Judges at that time would fall away. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister can tell us what the present position is, but my impression is that it is certainly not the wish of the majority of the Judges that this system should be done away with. It is, of course, at the present time limited to a considerable extent, and I suggest that limited right should continue to exist.</p>

<p>I think we must bear in mind in this matter that the jury system in fact is maintained in very many parts of the world and, as has been made clear, the ordinary man is brought into the administration of justice in most parts of the world. He is in fact used in the administration of justice in most parts of the world, and it is in this way too that he is used in South Africa. I want to stress that you find the jury system in operation in America, in Australia, and in many other parts of the Commonwealth. And I think in these countries it has obtained a new lease of life largely because certain of the weaknesses have been eliminated, and these weaknesses have likewise been eliminated here by successive amendments to the Act.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite criticized the value of the trial by one&#x2019;s peers. I suggest that right to the layman is probably much more valuable than lawyers are prepared to concede. I think it was said that judicial officers are trained to decide and to weigh evidence and that as the result of their long training they have a certain approach to a case. That is very true and it is very valuable. But I think lawyers will have to admit that this very attitude which their experience and training gives them, is one which has its weaknesses. It is one which very often leads the ordinary man to regard the lawyer as a bit of a freak and as a strange creature who indulges in long debates and discussions upon points over which the ordinary man would not waste any time. I think to the man who is in the dock, accused of some crime, it must often be a great relief to know that when his actions are judged, they will be judged by a man who has not become too imbued with the approach of the reasonable man of the law; but that he will be judged by a set of men not very different to himself, men who have perhaps more foibles than a rather more severe man trained in law. I think it is for that reason that right is very largely prized and regarded as an important right by those who write upon this subject.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton mentioned the work by Mr. Justice Devlin, &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D;. He will agree with me that Judge Devlin there said that he considered that the jury is in fact the best instrument for deciding the reliability or the credibility of the witness. Coming from a most eminent Judge, that is, I suggest, very great testimony to the value of a jury in deciding both the truthfulness and the reliability of a witness. And I do ask the hon. the Minister and the House not lightly to discard an instrument which is described in those terms by so eminent a Judge.</p>

<p>I think the point that was made against the retention of the jury system, namely, that at the time of the Salt River Collision there were extremely high claims for damages arising out of that particular accident, illustrates one of the great virtues of the system. The claims were high and it was apparently feared that high awards of damages would be made. The presumption was that those awards would be higher than the Judges would be prepared to grant. I suggest therefore that there would have been a feeling amongst the ordinary men and women of this country, or amongst the men sitting on that jury, that it would be appropriate that those awards should be high. In that way you have what might be described as justice tempering the law; the law represented by the stern, judicial approach which leads the Judges to feel that in certain cases certain awards should be made; a standard of payment becomes set and that standard tends to be followed. But the ordinary man feels that this is a case where a higher amount of <span class="col_1517-1518" refersTo="page_775"/>damages should be awarded. And so, without damaging the fabric of the law (since the standard remains the same being unaffected by the jury award), the existence of the jury enables the feeling of the people to be expressed, and yet a slightly higher award of damages is made. What applies in civil cases applies equally in criminal cases. You can get a feeling among the people that a certain crime, perhaps a statutory offence, should not be regarded as a crime or a serious offence. This view will be reflected by the jury; they will perhaps acquit on such a charge.</p>

<p>I think nothing illustrates more fittingly the proposition that juries will not always be led by judicial officers, where they have a will not to be, then the story mentioned by the hon. member for Durban (North) of the jury who were asked by the Judge whether all nine of them were insane. They apparently had not been prepared to follow his summing-up to them, and I think it cannot be said that they can merely be taken as rubber-stamps in these matters.</p>

<p>It is often said that a great merit of the jury system is that it is a safeguard against repugnant laws. If I may just quote a passage from this book by Judge Devlin &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D; where he is speaking of Britain, which is a homogeneous country and a country which possibly would be less subject to difficulties in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Trial by jury gives protection against laws which the ordinary man may regard as harsh and oppressive. I do not mean by that more than that it is a protection against tyranny. It is that but it is also an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man&#x2019;s idea of what is fair and just. If it does not, a jury will not be a party to its enforcement. They have in the past used their power of acquittal to defeat the full operation of laws which they thought to be too harsh.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Likewise he makes the point, again in a country where the administration of justice is easier than with us, that the jury can be regarded as a lamp of freedom. He says that as long as the jury is there it may well be an important safeguard in difficult times.</p>

<p>So I would say to hon. members opposite that they must surely accept, where it is suggested that a change should be made, that they must discharge the onus and establish beyond a reasonable doubt that this change should be made. Because I do not think they can seriously argue that the disadvantages, such as they have advanced, are really very considerable. They have admittedly made certain points of criticism and indeed over the years this matter has been a great subject for debate in law moots and in other places. But when it comes to showing that the defects outweigh the advantages, I suggest that they have not made out a case for its abolition. Moreover I think that at this time particularly, when we are all aware of the importance and the difficulty of keeping the name of South Africa high, we should not take a step which may well be misconstrued overseas. In many of the countries that we particularly wish to retain as our friends, this system is retained and respected, and they do write about it in the sort of terms that I have mentioned to the House. I hope very much that we will not take a step which may well alienate their sympathy and their understanding and perhaps lead to further misconceptions about us. I accordingly hope that the hon. the Minister will see it in this light.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I also wish to congratulate the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) on the manner in which he has introduced this motion and especially to thank him for the history which he gave us of trial by jury system. It is quite clear from that history that this form of trial has become traditional; it was established overseas, in our older mother countries, as far back as the 11th century, and it developed gradually. Admittedly when it was first introduced, the system of trial may appear to us to-day to be a little ridiculous, but the mere fact that the form of trial was altered from time shows that the jurists, the legislatures, the governments of the areas at the time realized that there were faults and they continually amended the system until we have it as it is to-day. We ourselves have amended the law from time to time to bring trial by jury to the present system, and I ask that for that reason we should maintain it as it is now. Sir, it was applied for the first time in the Cape in the year 1827, and the hon. member for Klerksdorp told us that the Voortrekkers in the Free State and the Transvaal accepted that form of trial in those two republics.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<p>They took the law with them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the point I want to make is this, that it had only been established for about seven years before the Trek took place, and the fact remains that the Voortrekkers themselves were so impressed with this system of trial that after only seven years of experience of it in the Cape, they took this new system with them and applied it in the Transvaal and the Free State. I say that is the greatest compliment which can be paid to the system of trial by jury.</p>

<p>It was said by the hon. member for Klerksdorp that the basis of this system of justice is that a man must be tried, or a citizen must be tried by his peers and that does not apply in this country in the first place in the magistrates&#x2019; courts where there is no trial by jury or by peers. I grant him that, but I would like to point out this too that any accused has the right of appeal from a magistrate&#x2019;s court to a higher court where other minds can be brought to bear on the facts which are recorded in the case, and he has that right of appeal without <span class="col_1519-1520" refersTo="page_776"/>permission from anybody, so that if an accused feels that a magistrate was wrong&#x2014;and we know from the success of appeals that magistrates are often wrong&#x2014;he has the right to go to another court where other minds can be brought to bear on the evidence. It is said too that this basis falls down in a multi-racial country where we have the juries composed solely from members of a minority group and that in the case of the Bantu, the majority group, they are not given the benefit of trial by their peers. There are obvious reasons for that, but I would like to point out to the hon. members that if an African does not wish to be tried by his White peers, he need not be so tried; the choice remains with him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pelser">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>He has not got the benefit of the system.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He has the benefit of the system in that he can choose to be tried by a jury, and I will tell the hon. member when he does choose this system. He chooses it especially in Native areas, and he chooses it when the evidence produced against him or the evidence which he can produce has to deal with Native habits and Native customs. It has often happened that the evidence in the case may appear to support a conviction according to White standards whereas those who know the thinking of the African and know his habits and know how he would behave as a class, would not accept that evidence. That is where the juries play a very valuable part. In the reserves the African has the right to choose in such cases, and in certain cases he does choose a jury, and there a jury is selected from traders and people living in that area who know the African, who know his customs and who know his way of life, and they are in a much better position to judge the probabilities of the case on the evidence before them, than a strange Judge who may have had no association with the Africans at all and may know nothing of his habits and customs, who has not learned Native law and who is sent around to try cases in a circuit court. Not only is there the disadvantage of having the Judge not knowing these customs, but very often the same applies to the barristers who may not be <i>aux fait</i> with Native habits and customs. In cases like that the African has the right, if he so chooses, to choose a jury of people who know how he behaves and how he thinks. I submit that is a most important consideration, and the hon. the Minister and the House should bear it in mind.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp in justifying his case for the abolition of juries, pointed out that judges have on occasion criticized the verdicts given by juries. They have not criticized the verdicts actually, but have expressed surprise at a verdict given by a jury. I want to point out that a Judge is one man expressing surprise at a judgment given by nine other men. But I would also like to point out that there are many, many cases where appeal courts have expressed surprise at judgments given by Judges. As the hon. member knows, in a trial by a Judge in a criminal case where a Judge is sitting with assessors, there is no right of appeal, unless permission is given; the accused has to obtain leave to appeal, first of the Judge who tried the case and then, if necessary, of the Appeal Court. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) referred to the Natal case in which a Judge refused leave to appeal; eventually the matter was brought before the Appeal Court and certain of the accused were acquitted who had been convicted by the Judge. The hon. the Minister himself will remember a recent case at Umtata where the Judge convicted Clarke, a policeman. Clarke applied for leave to appeal. The Judge rejected the application, and eventually a petition was presented to the Appeal Court, and the Appeal Court then decided that he could appeal, and the Appeal Court found, as stated in the judgment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clearly then the finding that he was guilty of contempt of court cannot be sustained.</block>

<p>And it acquitted the accused. There was another case in Port Elizabeth many years ago when the accused was also acquitted by the Appeal Court after leave had been refused by the lower Judge. There are numerous cases which can be quoted in which the Appeal Court found that the Judge in the first instance was wrong. But as the hon. member for Durban (North) pointed out, the fact remains that in trial by jury there may be surprise occasionally at acquittals, but I have never yet heard of criticism of a conviction of an accused. And surely, Sir, it is much better than 99 guilty men go free than that one innocent man should be found guilty.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp also said that the juries really become a reflection of the Judge&#x2019;s opinion, that the juries&#x2019; verdicts are a reflection of the Judge&#x2019;s summing-up. Sir, because the juries may as a rule agree with the Judge, that does not necessary mean that they are merely falling in with what the Judge says. The Judge sums up the evidence as he sees it and an important point is this that should the Judge be summing up wrongly, the counsel for the defence can always draw his attention to it and, if necessary, take the Judge on appeal. So the Judge has to be careful that in summing up he does give a correct summing-up to the jury, and that he does not prejudice the one side or the other. His summing-up has to be correct, and the jury then decides on the facts as summed up by the Judge.</p>

<p>I know that a lot of the arguments against juries can be justified. The hon. member for Klerksdorp put up an excellent case. But there is no doubt that equally so can a very good case be put up, and was in fact put up by the hon. member for Durban (North), in favour of the retention of this system.</p>

<p>I say that in weighing up the probabilities, even if you should decide that the case to-day against juries is strong and that the facts support the abolition of the system rather than its retention, there must be some doubt and that the traditional form should be maintained. The mere fact that it is only chosen in 2 per cent of the cases heard before the Supreme Court is no justification for abolishing the system.

<p>I submit not. It is only in special cases that the right has been taken away, as for example in cases between Black and White, where you would have a White jury perhaps prejudiced in favour of the White man, and there rightly, we amended the law, as the law in regard to juries has been amended from the 11th century onwards. But I submit that there is no reason now to abolish it, even if it is only chosen by 2 per cent of the accused who are brought before the Supreme Court. Let the people retain that right.

<p>I would not say in the majority of cases, but where customs or habits are apt to play a part in coming to a decision, and where the knowledge of the customs and habits of Africans are of importance in coming to a decision on the probabilities of the facts, they can choose a jury, and also where a Judge is completely new to the African form of life&#x2014;a new Judge who has not practised in a Native area before&#x2014;it is of importance that you have men on the jury who know the African. You will find, Sir, that in choosing juries, as I have often had to do in consultation with the barrister, that the Judge&#x2019;s knowledge of the African way of life is an important consideration. You have some Judges who have practised in those areas before going to the Bench and who have experience of those areas; there it is not so essential that you get a jury of men who know the African way of life, as it is when you get a complete stranger on circuit.</p>

But that is his duty as a citizen. After all citizens lose financially when they are called up for military service, but nobody will say that you must abolish military service and military training merely because citizens may lose financially. This has become part of our social structure, and I submit that we should keep it. I want to ask the Minister to leave it, even if only 1 per cent use this form of trial. Do not take away that right.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, all the hon. members who have spoken up to now have a legal background in the sense that they are entitled to claim certain legal qualifications, and I think it is about time that someone being just a lay member of the public, a possible juryman, one of the very small and privileged class left in this country, should have a few words to say on the subject. I, up to very recently, was one of the people who could qualify, not falling under one of the very many exceptions which were read out to us this morning by the hon. member for Klerksdorp. I could qualify as a member of the jury, and in fact did so qualify on two occasions that I can recall, and I therefore have some practical experience of this matter.</p>

Like many other people, I am not qualified but nevertheless interested in the law and the processess of the law. Now the arguments that we have heard here this morning and this afternoon have all been so compelling, in my opinion, that it would require a Solomon to distinguish between the two courses, and to decide which would be the soundest and the best way of disposing of this motion.</p>

<p>That is the point, Sir. Now I find myself more or less in the role of a Judge, and similarly, Sir, all members present here to-day, will have to take that role because they will have to decide on this issue, and if I can influence them in any way, I will be very grateful.</p>

<p>The main contention of the hon. member for Klerksdorp, if I remember correctly, was that the jury system is dying out. It has been said in different ways to-day that it is dying out, but I should like to say that there is no reason why we should kill something, let alone somebody, merely because that institution is old. Let us assume that it is dying out; then why not leave it to die a natural and decent death as something that has been part of the history of this country for many years. Why this determination to kill this dying institution? There must be some reason. Because, as far as we know other than the fact that it does cost some money (I believe R8,000 a year in direct charges), the cost factor has not been seriously advanced as part of the argument against the system at all. In a country with a Budget as large as our Budget, I doubt whether anybody will contend that the chief reason why the jury system should be abolished, is because of the cost involved. Certainly the cost is not inordinate. The hon. member for Prinshof based his argument mainly on the fact that the time factor was important, that it took twice as long to try a person or to hear a matter in a trial by jury than on the basis of a Judge and assessors. One wonders whether that is a relevant argument. After the event one finds, in one&#x2019;s own life, and also, if I may say with respect, in the life of the people who are sitting in this House, that a great deal of time has been wasted. I am not judging the matter, but we may be wasting a lot of time to-day by arguing against the motion of the hon. member for Klerksdorp. So it is not sufficient to say that merely because you save time, you must do a certain thing. No, the question is: Are you doing the right thing by carrying out your plans as originally intended, will it be better to abolish a particular system and, consequently, are you going to save some time in the process of the law? I do not think that time is really to be regarded as a serious argument against the retention of the system.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was the argument that so few people take advantage of the right to be tried by jury and that for that reason since the system is falling into disuse or desuetude, it does not need to be kept alive. But that is one thing entirely separate and different from saying that it should be abolished. It may be fair to argue that we should do nothing, that the hon. the Minister should do nothing to keep the system alive longer than it will live in a natural way. But to go over to the other argument that merely because it is not used by more than 2 per cent, or whatever it is, of the people who come before the courts, is not in itself a good argument for making an end of it. Because statistically you cannot prove the use or the value of this at all. I want to give you an analogy, Mr. Speaker, since I was reminded of the fact that I have been a member of the City Council of Johannesburg. There, as in many other cities of the Union, there is a serious dearth of public conveniences. There was a time when whenever we (certain members of the Council) tried to persuade the authorities in Johannesburg to establish more of these conveniences, a certain official would argue that those that were already in existence were only used by two or three or seven people a day, and that in other words, there was no need for this particular amenity (if I may use the word) because statistically it could be proved that it was not used by sufficient people I need hardly say that nobody other than this particular person believed seriously in that argument, because there are certain things which commend themselves as either necessary or desirable in case they are required, regardless of the actual use to which they may be put. And I must say, Mr. Speaker, with due respect, that I am not for a moment trying to draw an analogy between the jury system and the establishment of a chain of public conveniences. But the merit of the argument, if any at all, is that while the system is in existence, those who wish to avail themselves of it, for reasons best known to themselves (which do not concern anybody else), are in a position to do so. The abolition of this amenity, this right, may well create a position in which it would be found that there is in fact a serious need of it and that the lack of that amenity then becomes a public problem, and certainly a problem for certain individuals who come before the courts.</p>

<p>I want to deal with an aspect which was raised here to-day in regard to the question of the ability of a jury, or a juryman as such, to bring a fresh mind to bear on the problem. I think it is fair to say that a Judge, like anybody else is inclined to fall into a rut&#x2014;naturally, I speak with the utmost deference about any member of the Judiciary&#x2014;and the very fact that is the vocation of the individual concerned which he follows over a period of years, means that his ways may become set, his outlook may become set, and that he may not be in as close contact with the morality of the day&#x2014;to which the hon. member for Durban (North) referred&#x2014;as he could be, if he were not on the Bench and occupying a very important and responsible position. I think there is a great deal of historical support for this argument. One thinks, for example, of W. S. Gilbert. There have been so many authorities quoted here like Forsyth, Devlin and others, that I wondered whether anybody would quote W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a work called &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D;. The usher in this particular case, which was heard some 70 or 80 years ago&#x2014;the copyright of this story has now run out and I or anyone else can use it&#x2014;was heard to say to the jurymen when they had been empannelled&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now, jurymen, hear my advice, <span class="col_1525-1526" refersTo="page_779"/><br/>All kinds of vulgar prejudice, <br/>I pray you set aside. <br/>With stern judicial frame of mind, <br/>From bias free of every kind, <br/>This trial must be tried.</block>

<p>Surely, Sir, that is the spirit in which any juryman in South Africa, although the usher in a particular court may not have adjured him in the same way that the usher did in the court in London, no doubt approaches his task&#x2014;free from every kind of prejudice. It transpired that in this particular case the Judge was anything but free from prejudice. You may say, Sir, that this is allegorical, but he himself admitted this, for he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I, good friends, was called to the bar, <br/>I&#x2019;d an appetite fresh and hearty, <br/>But I was, as many young barristers are, <br/>An impecunious party.</block>

<p>He goes on to say that he had many difficulties until he fell in love with a rich attorney&#x2019;s daughter, which by common consent, is a short-cut for any barrister to attain wealth and stability in life, if he is impecunious. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For now I&#x2019;m a Judge, and a good Judge, too.</block>

<p>You see, Sir, how easy it is. The moment he is a Judge he is a &#x201C;good&#x201D; Judge too!&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Though all my law be fudge, <br/>Yet I&#x2019;ll never, never budge, <br/>But I&#x2019;ll live and die a Judge, <br/>And a good Judge, too.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, is that not relevant here? The fact is that by virtue of the appointment of a person to high office, he is inclined to become hide-bound, he is inclined to become somewhat out of touch with what has rightly been called public morality and the morality of the day. From that point of view, I think that a very good case can, and in fact, has been made out for the retention of the system as we know it here.</p>

<p>In South Africa, particularly, where there is a great deal of public suspicion at times about whether the White race or one of the others is acting properly, I would say it is most important to retain anything which gives an impression of justice towards all sections of the community. I am not&#x2014;and I say this with great deference as a member of the public not legally trained&#x2014;impressed by the argument that there are cases, and in fact there have been many cases, where it has been proved that a non-White person will never elect to be tried by a jury. Because, Mr. Speaker, we are inclined to forget that there are also White people in South Africa. The whole case seems to be geared to the argument that a non-White, in some area where he knows there is prejudice against him because of what he has done, will not receive a fair trial if he is tried by a jury consisting of persons who are sympathetic towards the person who has been aggrieved or harmed. But what about the Europeans in South Africa? Here we are about to abolish a system in a country which in terms of the present intentions of the Government&#x2014;I do not want to impinge upon national policy&#x2014;will become a White country and a White country only. Why should the argument, that we have a vast number of non-Whites, advanced by the hon. member for Klerksdorp, be a factor in this consideration? Let us try and carry it a little further. Assuming, Sir, that it is the intention of the Government to create a White South Africa in which no non-Whites will live &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>That was what you people have said. Assuming that is the intention, to argue then that this system must now be abolished because it has a certain bearing on non-Whites living in the country to-day, is not a very sound one. But assuming that it is not the intention and assuming it will never come to pass, I still think it should be borne in mind that there are 3,500,000 White people in this country who, up to now, at any are, have had a certain faith and a traditional belief in their right to be tried by their peers. Because, Mr. Speaker, while it is true to argue that when a Bantu or Asiatic or Coloured person is tried by a White jury, he is not being tried by his peers, it is not correct to argue like that when a European is before the court, and he has the opportunity of being tried by a Judge and jury. He is then in fact, being tried, as far as he is aware, by his peers. The point I am trying to make, Sir, is that the retention of the system on that basis alone seems to be merited. Those Whites who in the future may elect to be tried by a jury where there is no question of it being the sort of case which was referred to this morning&#x2014;I think, by the hon. member for Durban (North) and which he called Black on White or White on Black&#x2014;but where it is a case concerning Whites only, should not be deprived of the right to be tried by a jury. As for the point of view, Sir, that only the White man is eligible to serve on a jury, regardless of the fact that he may show no enthusiasm to do so to-day the very fact that the system exists is something which I think gives us in South Africa a certain standing in line with well-tried judicial systems of which we have inherited a great deal, a standing which I think will be diminished if it becomes known that South Africa and this Government are taking positive steps to abolish the jury system. I believe that it is for that reason that the jury system should not be abolished at all, in spite of the very good speech made by the hon. member for Klerksdorp.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, <span class="col_1527-1528" refersTo="page_780"/>at the outset I immediately want to express my sincere gratitude, not only to the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) who introduced the debate in a masterly manner, but to every hon. member who has taken part in this debate. I am in particular grateful for the fact that towards the end of the debate a layman has taken part in it and that the debate has not been limited to the legally trained members in this House. I am particularly grateful that the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) as a layman has taken part in the debate. If I personally&#x2014;and I emphasize the word &#x201C;personally&#x201D;&#x2014;required any further arguments to convince myself that it would be a danger to continue with this system, I have certainly been convinced after the hon. member has spoken as a layman.</p>

<p>May I say this at once, Mr. Speaker, so as to avoid any misunderstanding on the subject. Amongst others the hon. member said this&#x2014; I am not holding it against him because that is the kind of statement a layman would make &#x2014;&#x201C;We are about to abolish the jury system&#x201D;. My reply is: &#x201C;We are definitely not about to abolish the jury system&#x201D;. The fact is that the Government has not decided either to retain or abolish the jury system. The fact of the matter is that the Government has not adopted any stand in this connection, for the simple reason that I as the responsible Minister have not as yet asked the Government to take a stand in this connection. And in spite of the strong views which I hold on the matter, to which I shall come back later, it is not my intention either to go to the Government and to put the matter before the Cabinet before, and according to the attitude which I have already stated, I have had an opportunity of consulting all interested bodies in South Africa in this regard. The mere fact, therefore, that I shall not approach the Cabinet before I have consulted the Bar Council and the Bench amongst others, in this connection, speaks volumes in itself. I therefore, want to state this very clearly, so as to avoid any misunderstanding, that we are not in the process of abolishing the jury system and that the Government has, as a matter of fact, not taken any stand either, because I as the responsible Minister have not as yet asked the Government to do so.</p>

<p>I think, Mr. Speaker, that in the first place we should all congratulate the hon. member for Klerksdorp and the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), the mover and the seconder, on the manner in which they have conducted this debate and the high standard that they have set, a standard which has been maintained throughout by hon. members. This is not the first occasion on which the jury system has come up for discussion. It has often been discussed. I also had the opportunity of referring to the debates which were conducted on this subject in the past, both here and in the Other Place, and I want to say that never before has a debate been conducted on such a high level as the debate which we have had here to-day. I want to congratulate hon. members on both sides of the House on that.</p>

<p>I honestly think that the hon. member for Klerksdorp touched the very core and essentials of the subject by pointing out that we ourselves, that is to say, all governments before this Government, right from the start, have been the cause why this system has landed in the position in which it is to-day; we ourselves are the cause because we have removed the very heart from the system. We did not remove it because we wanted to do so deliberately, but we removed it because the circumstances in which we lived, and in which we are still living, are so different from the circumstances which prevailed when this system originally came into operation. Having listened to the resum&#x00E9; of the history of this system, it is clear to me that this system really came into being because it was a method of tempering the despotism of kings and rulers; that was the outlet of the people of the day to revolt against the despotic manner in which justice was administered. If that were not the basis of the system, I would gladly have associated myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and I want to thank him heartily for the attitude which he has adopted in this connection when he quite rightly pointed out the high standard which was being maintained today in South Africa in the administration of justice. If, on the one hand you look at that, and on the other hand, you look at the origin of the system, you wonder whether you should still keep it in operation under present-day circumstances. Having listened to the list of crimes which the hon. member for Klerksdorp read out as having been taken out of the hands of the jury already, thinking of the crimes that are commonly committed, and having made a hurried note of the crimes that are left, I find that the crimes of theft and culpable homicide are the only two that are actually left. Those are about the only two crimes that have escaped and the question is whether you should retain a system for the sake of those two.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But there are more.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you could mention a number of minor crimes, but I think in the main those are the only two that are left. If it is correct&#x2014;and this is something which struck me personally&#x2014;to argue as hon. members have, that the real function of the jury system is to temper the harsh affects of the law, should we retain it for that purpose? That is an argument which was very ably advanced by the hon. member for Durban (North). The way in which he used that argument impressed me. But if that were correct, and if it were sound to have it, the jury system has actually missed its purpose inasmuch as the jury men, if that were their function, should really have been the people to mete out the punishment. In that case they should not have been the people to find guilty <span class="col_1529-1530" refersTo="page_781"/>or not guilty. That should have been the task of the Judge, also according to the argument of the hon. member for Durban (North). But if the function of the jury were what he ascribed to it, the jury members should really come into the picture after the man has been found guilty by these harsh laws, and they should say what should be done with him now that he has been found guilty. If it is true that the jury reflect the morality of the day, opposed to the law which operates slower, my argument is that if that is the case, the jury would have served a better function and played a more important part if the Judge said: &#x201C;Look, people, this person has appeared before me on this charge; I have found him guilty on the evidence brought before me. What should I do with him, considering the present attitude of morality or whatever it may be?&#x201D; If the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is correct, the jury would have had a function to perform, the function of telling the Judge what he should really do with the man.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton has quite rightly referred to the influences which are brought to bear on members of a jury, and how susceptible they are to things which really are not concerned with the case as such. That reminds me of the story of a colleague at the Bar who pleaded a case before a jury. He had one particularly good witness called Mischak Shabalala. He fared less well with his other witnesses. Towards the end of the case, to the surprise of the Judge, he got up and said &#x201C;Milord, I again want to call Mischak Shabalala.&#x201D; The Judge asked: &#x201C;But surely we have heard his evidence, and why do you want to recall him?&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;Milord, I thought he was so good, that it will do the jury good to hear him again.&#x201D; The hon. member conceded that argument when he said that it was practically a maxim at the Bar that &#x201C;if you have a good case, you go to the Judge; if you have a bad case, take the jury.&#x201D; That was the maxim which the hon. member gave us: &#x201C;When innocent take the Judge; when guilty take the jury.&#x201D; The very fact that is so, and that is the position in practice&#x2014;none of us can deny that&#x2014;in my humble opinion, it knocks the bottom out of the entire argument in favour of the retention of the jury system. The hon. member said something else with which I want to associate myself wholeheartily, and I am very grateful to him for having said it. I am particularly pleased that the hon. member warned against a tendency developing in our courts for Judges to sit alone in cases which may call for the death penalty; a Judge should not sit on the Bench without assessors, particularly where a person&#x2019;s life is at stake. I personally cannot reconcile myself to that at all and if I should find in the least&#x2014;I do not like using the word &#x201C;abuse&#x201D; in relation to the Bench, let me rather put it this way: If I should find that Judges are inclined to make a habit of sitting alone instead of taking assessors with them on the Bench, I shall not have the slightest hesitation in coming to this House in order to amend the relevant section, because I do not think that any person, no matter how capable, how experienced and how learned he may be, any one person should not take the responsibility upon himself to judge on the life or death of a person, if he can get other people to sit with them and to carry the responsibility with him. I am pleased that the hon. member raised that argument.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member followed the speech of the hon. member for Klerksdorp properly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) said that the hon. member for Klerksdorp had said that &#x201C;we must break down this system.&#x201D; I do not think that was really the argument of the hon. member for Klerksdorp. I think the argument of the member for Klerksdorp, as I understood it, was more or less this that the jury system had itself broken down to such an extent that at this stage it served no further useful purpose. As I understood the argument of the member for Klerksdorp when he went from one amendment to the other and when he showed us how the system had in fact been watered down from time to time, I think that his argument rather boils down to that.</p>

<p>*For the rest I should like to pay this compliment to the hon. member by saying that I think what he said in connection with the jury system was the best defence of a weak case that I have heard for a long time. I give him that in consolation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) referred in passing to the time that was unnecessarily spent, and the unnecessary costs that flow from it. I think it is a good thing that the hon. member raised that. I want to say at once that when it comes to the question of the administration of justice, you do not consider costs. If you can administer justice better by spending more money, you not only have the right to do so but it is certainly your duty to do so. We should, however, not only look at the R8,000 that was paid out in the form of jury fees, we should also consider the waste of time that accompanied that. If I were to tell you, for example, Sir, that it has already happened here in Cape Town during a criminal session, that in order to get 18 people to serve as jury members, 100 or more people have had to be summonsed, you would realize what a tremendous amount of money is wasted in respect of deputy sheriff fees and the time that is unnecessarily wasted in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) asked whether the Judges were in favour of abolishing the jury system. Frankly I do not know for the simple reason that I have not asked them. I have not consulted them yet. Perhaps they will be consulted in the future about this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) also raised the point and he asked me whether Judges had complained, and how many, about <span class="col_1531-1532" refersTo="page_782"/>the system. Unfortunately I cannot say how many Judges have complained against this system, but the hon. member is aware that Judges have, particularly recently, from time to time commented upon the system and upon the fact that justice was not served by the decisions taken by some juries.</p>

<p>At 3.55 p.m. the business under consideration was interrupted by Mr Speaker in accordance with Standing Order No. 41 (3) and the debate was adjourned until Friday 9 March.</p>

<p>The House proceeded to the consideration of Orders of the Day.</p>

<heading>IMMORALITY AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Immorality Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very well aware this afternoon that in introducing the second reading of this Bill, I am raising a subject of a difficult and delicate nature. I want at the outset of these discussions to say two things. Firstly, that I sincerely hope that this debate will be kept free of party politics <i>per se,</i> because I do not believe that a matter as delicate as this should be made the subject of party politics and for the scoring of minor victories by political parties. Secondly, in raising this matter, I also wish to make it clear that I am not doing so in order to embarrass the Government. I am doing so in a solemn and serious attempt to try to save people from the devastating effects of legislation. This legislation has had devastating effects upon many people and this is what I wish to avoid in the future.</p>

<p>The Bill which I am introducing to-day, Sir, is a simple Bill. It will repeal all those sections in the 1957 Immorality Act that govern inter-racial sex relations. Clause 2 of this Bill is the relevant Clause for it seeks to repeal Section 16 of the principal Act. All the other Clauses of this Bill are either consequential, such as Clauses 1 and 3 which amend Section 1 and Section 21 of the principal Act respectively, or subsidiary, as Clause 4, which simply removes the differences in penalties that exist at present in the principal Act, penalties which differ according to the colour of the offender. So it is clear, I hope, that nothing in the Bill, the second reading of which I am moving this afternoon, alters in any way those sections of the Immorality Act of 1957 which apply to procuring, to the keeping of brothels, to illicit relations with children under the age of 16, etc. I have no wish to amend any of these sections or similar sections in our existing legislation. I am only concerned with those aspects of the law that affect illicit inter-racial sex relations.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary to give the House a brief historical review of existing legislation. Broadly speaking, it is true to say, I think, that in the first 250 years of this country&#x2019;s history it was not considered necessary to introduce any legislation governing sexual relations between the different colour groups. It is true that before Union there were certain laws for instance in the Transvaal and in Natal, laws that prohibited Black men from cohabiting with White women. In the Cape and in the Orange Free State there were laws prohibiting relations between Black men and White women for purposes of gain. In the Transvaal there was a further legislative effect in so far as there was no machinery, no legal machinery was provided, for marriages between the races. But that was as far as the law went in this country until 1927 when the first Immorality Act was actually placed on the Statute Book. This Act is familiarly know, of course, as the Tielman Roos Act. This Act prohibited extra-marital sexual intercourse (but not marriage), between Europeans and Africans. There were no changes in the legislative position for the next 20 years, although from 1937 onwards the subject both of mixed marriages and the prohibition thereof was under discussion in this House and also outside Parliament. Two private members&#x2019; bills were actually brought into Parliament&#x2014;Maj. Roberts&#x2019;s Bill and General Pienaar&#x2019;s Bill&#x2014;on the question of mixed marriages. But neither of these Bills was proceeded with. Outside of Parliament the Commission of Inquiry on the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages had been appointed and was continuing with its work. That commission reported in 1939. It recommended, interestingly enough, that no actual machinery should be provided&#x2014;the old Transvaal evasion&#x2014;for solemnizing marriages between the different colour groups. The Mixed Marriages Commission did not consider extending the prohibition of marriages between White and Coloured persons, but simply dealt with marriages between Whites and Natives, and it did not include an examination of illicit sex relations between the different Coloured groups. Further discussion or action on this particular subject was postponed by the outbreak of the Second World War, but in 1949, the year after the present Government took office, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was passed, which forbade marriage between White persons and any non-White persons, i.e. not only between White persons and Africans, but between White persons and any non-Whites; and a year later, in 1950, as the then Minister of Justice told us, as a natural corollary to the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, the Immorality Act of 1927 was amended so as to prohibit extra-marital sex relations between White and Coloured persons. In other words, the 1927 Act was amended so as to prohibit illicit relations not only between Whites and Africans but between Whites and Coloured persons, which in terms of the Act means all non-White persons, Coloureds, Asians and Africans.</p>

<p>In 1957 a further amending Act was passed, but the Act of 1957 was firstly a consolidating Act in so far as it pieced together all the <span class="col_1533-1534" refersTo="page_783"/>various laws on the statute book relating to all types of immorality, i.e. the keeping of brothels, illicit relations with children, etc. It consolidated all those pieces of legislation into one statute, but it went further. It also amended the relevant sections which related to illicit relations across the colour line. The amendments were introduced by the 1957 Act in three ways.</p>

<p>Firstly, and perhaps the least important amendment, was to increase the penalty up to seven years&#x2019; imprisonment, and for the first time it was made possible for lashes to be imposed, up to ten lashes, on male offenders, under this particular section of the Act. But the more important amendments to which I wish to refer were, firstly, that it now became an offence for any person to commit, or attempt to commit, or to entice any person across the colour line, and to commit, not only carnal intercourse, but any immoral or indecent act. This is an important amendment, because one has to note that the words &#x201C;indecent act&#x201D; are not defined in law, and incidentally, that is as it affects private acts of indecency. This brings me to the second important change introduced by the 1957 Act, all embodied in Section 16 of the principal Act, the section which my Bill this afternoon seeks to amend. It was pointed out by Mr. Lewin, a senior lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand, that our law hitherto recognized only the offence of public indecency, i.e. such conduct in public as from its very nature must tend to decay the morals of others. So the new feature introduced by the 1957 Act was, firstly, that it was made an offence to commit an undefined act of indecency, whether in the privacy of a home or in any other place, and whether in fact such act led to the actual sex act or not; in other words, simply attempting to commit an immoral act was sufficient to bring a person within the purview of this Act, where persons of different colour were concerned. Only too clearly, to my mind, do these amendments demonstrate the slippery slope down which our legislation has unfortunately been sliding ever since it was first decided in 1927 to make illicit sex relations the subject of legislation in this country. A dangerously wide interpretation of the law has been placed on the law since this 1957 Act was passed.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<p>Because people have been frightened to conduct their lives in an ordinary way, for fear of being trapped under this Act. The hon. the Minister must have seen case after case reported in the Press. People are frightened to drive their motor cars with their non-White servants sitting in it. I can give the Minister certain quotes. Recently in Cape Town a newspaper reported the case of a White bus driver who was charged under the 1957 Act. In fact, what he had been doing was to play cards in a house with Coloured people, and in acquitting the accused the magistrate advised the accused to break off his friendship with this Coloured family because, he said, for a White man to have social contact with non-Whites is to run a very grave risk. I will give the Minister two other examples. A country missionary who gave a weekly lift to an African girl to enable her to see a doctor was warned by a policeman that he risked prosecution if he continued to do so. A certain constitutent of mine recently phoned me indignantly to say that she had been sitting in the front seat of the motor car driven by her African chauffeur and she had been followed all the way to town by a police van. That is why I say that there is a dangerously wide interpretation of the Act, and, indeed, this was recognized by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, if I may use the term. When he was Minister of Jusice in 1959, Mr. Swart actually gave instructions to the police to be very careful in the application of the Immorality Act. &#x201C;Nobody&#x2019;s name,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;should be dragged through the mud without evidence.&#x201D; I cannot believe that he would give that instruction unless it had been brought to his notice that the Act was being very widely interpreted. Only last year, in upholding an appeal against an Immorality Act conviction&#x2014;and whenever I use the words &#x201C;Immorality Act&#x201D; I mean Section 16&#x2014;the Judge remarked that prosecutors should be told by the Attorney-General&#x2019;s office that border-line cases under the Immorality Act should be submitted to the Attorney-General for approval before prosecution. But I understand that this is not done in the majority of cases. The very nature of Section 16 itself in any case is largely against such safeguards, for as I have already pointed out, as the law stands it is quite enough for the prosecution to show that one of the accused has attempted or invited or incited the commission of an indecent act, and &#x201C;indecent act&#x201D; is undefined. So the law itself as contained in the 1957 Act is extremely wide.</p>

<p>Under Section 16 thousands of people have been charged and prosecuted and convicted. It is very significant, and again I draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this since he asked the question, that in the four years between 1957 when the Act was amended and 1960, almost as many people were charged and prosecuted as were charged and prosecuted in the seven years prior to that, although the period is only about half, and the same applies to convictions. The figures I have correlated from answers the Minister gave to questions I put in the House a couple of weeks ago are as follows: From 1950 to 1956 the number of charges laid was 2,977. In the four years from 1957 to 1960 the number of charges was 2,722 almost as many. In 1950 to 1956 the number of persons prosecuted was 3,422, and in the four years from 1957 to 1960 it was 3,355. In 1950 to 1956 the number of persons convicted was 2,092, and in the four years from 1957 to 1960 it was 1,798. In all, between 1957 and 1960, something like 3,500 people were charged more than were actually prosecuted and convicted. <span class="col_1535-1536" refersTo="page_784"/>In other words, all the odium of being charged under this Act fell upon 3,500 more people than were actually found guilty and convicted. Incidentally, the over-all picture shows a steady increase in the number of convictions. In the 11 years between 1950 and 1960 the total number of charges laid was 5,699, of persons prosecuted 6,777, and persons convicted 3,890. So thousands upon thousands of people have been dragged into the courts, charged, prosecuted and convicted. I believe that there are few among us in this House to-day who have not been sickened day after day, in opening the newspapers, to read the glaring headlines of people brought into court under the Immorality Act. In every single working day in our courts at least one couple are having their private lives glaringly exposed to the harsh light of publicity.</p>

<p>I have extracted a few headlines out of the hundreds which have been appearing in the newspapers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Couple aged 63 and 60 in morals case. <br/>Family man sentenced. <br/>Thirty-six-year-old married man with five children sentenced. <br/>Company director on immorality charge. <br/>Doctor found guilty under Immorality Act. <br/>Mother to be spared gaol for immorality charge. <br/>Wife breaks down after morals case. <br/>Man, 69, sent to gaol on morals charge. <br/>Director and woman sentenced. <br/>Senior public servant on morals charge. <br/>Four years for constable under Immorality Act.</block>

<p>Now, those are the straight cases, but there are horrible side-effects of this law. Let me give some of those examples&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Transvaal farmer dies of gunshot wounds after being charged under Immorality Act. <br/>Constable found dead in hotel room, with revolver near body, after immorality hearing. <br/>Carbon monoxide suicide of Klerksdorp man charged under Immorality Act. <br/>Five people in the Cape in the last six months died by their own hand after contraventions of Immorality Act. <br/>Forty-five-year-old father of two hangs himself while out on bail on immorality charge.</block>

<p>And only recently it was reported that a man drove his car into the sea at Port Elizabeth and drowned himself after being detained for questioning under the Immorality Act. Last week the body of a 63-year old man was found floating in the Vaal River. He was due to appear in court on a charge under the Immorality Act. These are only some of the cases involving suicide following charges under the Immorality Act. Judge Schreiner recently had a good deal to say about this when he addressed the Institute of Race Relations. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems likely that legislation prohibiting miscegenation is the cause of a substantial proportion of unexplained suicides of White men.</block>

<p>Small wonder, then, that he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The oppressvie sense of shame engendered by this legislation affects wives, children and relatives of the men convicted for the rest of their lives, and the shadows spread outside the immediate family beyond the first generation, extending still further the range of misery. In such circumstances it is inevitable that some Whites should become increasingly obsessed with the belief that race differences are more important than any other differences such as character or belief. Miscegenation has among them been elevated into a crime so atrocious as to make all other crimes relatively venial.</block>

<p>There are still other side effects of this law. The first is the danger of blackmail, to which people are exposed. Interestingly enough, these dangers were actually anticipated by Mr. Struben as far back as 1927, when the then Immorality Act was under debate in this House. He pointed out the dangers of blackmail. I can give the House two instances of blackmail which have occurred. There are many more. There was the case last year which was headlined under the title, &#x201C;Man Made Living by Morals Trapping.&#x201D; This was the case of two Queenstown warders who testified that a man who had been a Crown witness in a case against a Railway detective-sergeant who had been sentenced under the Immorality Act disclosed that the witness had boasted to them that he paid the girl to act as a trap, that he extorted money from people he caught contravening the Immorality Act, and that he bought himself a motor-car with the proceeds. Secondly, there was the case recently reported where a periurban areas inspector was acquitted of nine charges under the Immorality Act and counsel for the defence said this: &#x201C;The Immorality Act has become an instrument of terror in the hands of unscrupulous people. The position has been reached where men walk in constant fear, especially those who by the nature of their occupation came into frequent contact with the Native races.&#x201D;</p>

<p>There is another extraordinary side-effect to this legislation, and here I quote prominent social welfare workers in the Cape who have remarked that the number of European prostitutes has rocketed since it became an offence for a White man to cohabit with a non-White woman. One of them actually remarked cynically that prostitution had become reserved for White women.</p>

<p>There is a further side-effect which I must mention, and that is that I think everyone in this House will admit that our international relations are not helped by this Act, in two ways. Firstly, when nationals of other countries have been prosecuted under the Act, our relations are harmed, and there have been many such cases, as a casual glance at newspaper <span class="col_1537-1538" refersTo="page_785"/>headlines will reveal. There was the case of the Swedish writer last year, and there are many cases where seamen visiting our ports are prosecuted. In some cases they are in ignorance of the law. The procedures whereby they are informed of our laws are apparently very haphazard indeed. There is a notice in the docks in English and Afrikaans warning them, but if they do not happen to read English or Afrikaans, and many foreign sailors do not, ignorance of the law is no excuse. The other thing is that they cannot easily distinguish colour. Now it is true that they are protected to some extent by sub-sec. (3) of Sec. 16, where it is a sufficient defence to prove that one had reason to believe that the person was of the same colour. Many of the people charged under the Immorality Act are subsequently discharged without being convicted, but enormous harm has been done, because newspapers give publicity to these cases, and the overseas newspapers publish them also, and we have had cases where threats of boycotts have followed reports of foreign seamen having been convicted, and there have been official protests from the Governments concerned.</p>

<p>The other way, of course, in which our international relations are damaged is simply by the glaring sensational publicity given to most of these cases under the Immorality Act, which are cases of human interest and therefore naturally command a good deal of attention in the Press. Could anything have been more damaging to South Africa than the recent Singh case? I believe that something like 95 inches of space was accorded in one day by seven leading newspapers in Britain. A page-long column in <i>Times</i> magazine, with its readership of over 2,000.000, did us no good either. But this grim law completely fails to distinguish between the casual act of immorality across the colour line and enduring relationships, and there are such relationships which have existed between persons of colour. Then again we have cruel headlines &#x201C;White man lived for nine years with Coloured woman, charged under Immorality Act.&#x201D; &#x201C;Two young secret lovers, a White man and an Indian woman, each sentenced to six months under the Immorality Act&#x201D;. A couple recently brought two neatly-dressed children with fair hair to court with them when they were charged under the Immorality Act, the mother carrying one child in her arms, and with a boy of 2 at her side.</p>

<p>There is another side-effect of the Singh case which I want to mention to the Minister. It seems that the Singh case itself actually reverses a standing rule of private international law, which is that a marriage legally contracted outside a country in which the marriage could not be legalized is valid inside that country thereafter. I understand on good authority that this is accented international law. I have mentioned the Singh case, because I must say immediately that I realize that there is a natural consequence to moving the second reading of this Bill, and that is that I must obviously advocate the repeal of the Mixed Marriages Act of 1949, because it is obviously quite wrong to make it legally impossible for people to sanctify in marriage, relations which are legally admissible in extra-marital relations. In other words, it should clearly not be illegal to marry when it is legal to live illicitly, just as the Minister quite rightly said in 1950, when he introduced the Immorality Act, that this was the natural corollary of the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949, so equally do I recognize the logic that if I ask for the repeal of Section 16 of the Immorality Act, I must also subsequently ask for the repeal of the Mixed Marriages Act, and I am quite prepared to face the consequences because I do not favour the Mixed Marriages Act. I do not believe, for instance, that the number of marriages contracted before the law was passed constituted any danger whatever to racial purity. If one glances at the figures, one sees how absurd it is to think that the passing of the Mixed Marriages Act has saved White South Africa. Less than one per cent of the total number of European marriages in 1925 were mixed; it constituted less than one per cent of the total number of marriages contracted by Europeans, and of course, even less if you take the number of marriages contracted by all races. It was less than three per 1,000 in 1936, according to the Mixed Marriages Commission, and in the year before the Act was actually passed only 70 mixed marriages out of thousands upon thousands of marriages were entered into in South Africa. So I believe that if the Act goes, it will not do any great damage, as far as the preservation of the &#x201C;purity&#x201D; of the White race is concerned. But I doubt that if the Act goes there will be a stampede of people to the marriage officers by people of different races wishing to get married, because we must remember that since the Mixed Marriages Act was passed in 1949 we have had much legislation put on the Statute Book which has vastly increased the penalties of crossing the colour line. That is certainly as far as White people are concerned who want to cross the colour line to the Coloured races. We have had the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act and the job reservation clause of the Industrial Conciliation Act. all of which have laid heavier penalties on being non-White than existed in 1949, and therefore I do not believe that unless one is completely and utterly prepared to make self-sacrifices, there will be many people who will want to enter into such marriages, and certainly not in such numbers as could possibly affect the structure of society in South Africa.</p>

<p>This brings me now to my final point, and that is that the law as an agent of social control is a clumsy thing. What social conventions, morals, religious and ethical considerations cannot control, I do not believe the law can control. As long as society frowns on miscegenation there will not be a great deal of it, and in South Africa society increasingly frowns on miscegenation. Of course, there will always be some miscegenation on the fringes of society, but my contention is that <span class="col_1539-1540" refersTo="page_786"/>miscegenation goes on whether there is a law or not. The argument has been used in other debates that even if the law does not completely deter people from miscegenation, who knows how much worse it would be if the law goes? Sir, I am not concerned with any fanciful speculations along those lines. I do not believe there will be an increase in mixed marriages or of miscegenation across the colour line. The main reason is that despite the law this carries on, because the law cannot be properly enforced. Although I have mentioned the cases of thousands of people who come to court, a senior police official remarked recently that for every one person charged they know perfectly well that hundreds are not charged because they cannot be caught. It seems to me that a law which cannot be properly enforced merely brings the whole of the law into contempt and in many ways it is much worse than having no law at all. I want to point out that in immorality cases enforcement of the law is particularly difficult, because unlike most criminal cases there is no complainant. Both parties are guilty, and both parties wish to keep it quiet. So except in exceptional cases where people act as traps, in the vast majority of cases there is no complaint and therefore the detection of immorality cases under the law is extremely difficult. In fact, it is found in practice that the only way in which crimes of immorality can be detected is by turning policemen into &#x201C;peeping Toms&#x201D;, who casually look through car windows or bedroom windows. That is the way in which most of these cases are detected, unless of course there is an informer. Other than that, it is obvious that for every case that goes to court hundreds are undetected. Again, interestingly, the difficulty of enforcing this law was foreseen by Mrs. Spilhaus, one of the commissioners investigating mixed marriages, and although the Commission knew that extra-marital intercourse was outside its terms of reference, it nevertheless examined the position. Mrs. Spilhaus felt that to tackle illicit relations across the colour lines would require &#x201C;armies of detectives, police and night-watchmen for its enforcement&#x201D;. That is precisely what is happening. And of course it is the realization of this that has kept us from legislating against illicit sexual relations between Whites and Whites and Coloureds and Coloureds. It is for a good reason, that all anti-social deeds are not subject to criminal sanctions. The reason is not necessarily that society approves of these deeds and therefore does not pass laws to make them crimes, but because society realizes that private lives would become well-nigh impossible if legal sanctions were instituted on all types of relations. That is the reason we do not have such laws.</p>

<p>Now, to come back to my final point, while we do not know what would happen if the law were not there, and it is fanciful to speculate, we know what has happened in the ten years that this law has been on the Statute Book. and more particularly over the last four years after these broad and far-reaching amendments were introduced. Nothing, but nothing, to my mind, can outweigh the misery and degradation that this law has brought in its wake. Thousands upon thousands of people have been publicly humiliated, have had their careers ruined and their family lives wrecked, and their community lives rendered nonexistent by being dragged into court under the Immorality Act, and for a crime which is only a crime where colour is involved. As Judge Schreiner pointed out, the wives and children and parents of these people suffered equally from the sordid publicity given to these cases.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but in this case it is only a crime if it is done across the colour line. But I am glad the hon. member made that interjection, because it leads me to another point which troubles me very much. I have been reading the Press this week, and particularly the <i>Burger,</i> which seems to forecast that the Government intends to take steps to prohibit publicity in these immorality cases. I will deal with that in a moment, but before that I want to say that if public opinion was deemed to be in favour of this Act when it was first introduced in 1950, and it was so deemed&#x2014;it was one of the arguments used in the debates at that time that public opinion demanded this Act&#x2014;then I am prepared to state categorically that to-day, ten years later, after the passing of the Act, and after its effects have been experienced, public opinion is dead against this law. Leading article after leading article in the English-language and the Afrikaans Press have appeared on this particular subject. Letters by the hundreds have poured into the offices of the editors of these newspapers. Everywhere one goes, one hears people talk of this as a disgusting law. Public opinion to-day is dead against this law.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>What is disgusting about the law?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The effects of this law&#x2014; let me put it that way&#x2014;are disgusting. It has disgusting effects on people&#x2019;s lives. Some of the suggestions offered were mentioned in the <i>Burger</i> last week. It was hinted that the Government might take steps, for instance, to suppress publicity as far as these cases are concerned. Another suggestion was made earlier on by, I think, the <i>Transvaler.</i> I am not sure whether it was the <i>Transvaler,</i> but anyway it was made in a newspaper. The suggestion was that the Press should be allowed to publish the initials only of the accused in these cases. I want to say right away that tinkering around with the normal procedures and the administration of justice in this way, it is highly dangerous, and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister is not going to go along with this suggestion. Speculation as to identity becomes rife; rumour-mongering injures innocent people, a most dangerous procedure <span class="col_1541-1542" refersTo="page_787"/>altogether. The hon. member over here has asked by way of interjection, &#x201C;Why should there be a distinction between persons charged with this crime and persons charged with other crimes such as fraud or murder or any other crime&#x201D; where, as the hon. member rightly points out, the relations and the children and the parents of these people are also brought into odium. Well, of course, the answer is that anonymity should not cloak the effects of crime. The answer why it has become so bad in immorality cases, why people commit suicide, why there have even been murders following upon the arrest of people under the Immorality Act, why policemen approaching cars have been shot dead&#x2014;we had two such cases in the Transvaal&#x2014;is, of course, shame. It is our effective preoccupation with colour that makes this particular form of immorality so heinous a crime that it outstrips other forms of crime, both in its sensationalism and in the social strictures that it brings in its wake. I say therefore that secret trials are not the answer to our difficulties. If the law is good, it should be able to stand the test of open trial and all the publicity which goes with it, and if the law cannot stand this test, then it is a bad law and it should be scrapped forthwith. It is no good trying to stave off damaging publicity which stems from a bad law simply by closing the courts and forbidding free publication of all the names and evidence featuring in these cases. The world would only see this as a secret trial to cover up the ugliness of the law&#x2014;and it would be right. I want to say further that I do not think we need commissions of inquiry at this stage. We have had ten years of experience of this law; we all know what it has brought in its wake. Commissions of inquiry are not necessary; we are all aware of the effects of this law. What we want is to have this section repealed. Let us be honest and admit that we made a terrible mistake a decade ago when we introduced this law. We did make a terrible mistake.</p>

<p>What is the problem that this law purports to solve? This is the thing that we must consider and examine in the last analysis. According to those who originally supported both the Mixed Marriages Act and the Immorality Act of 1950, it was apparently to solve the problem of miscegenation, or as have been said in other debates, to ensure the preservation of the purity of the White race. Miscegenation, which is a mixing of the races, is something which I would say has gone very far in this country to attempt at this late stage to solve it by any law. The very fact of the existence of a mixed population of a million and a half people already proves, I think, that miscegenation is something that is here and the increase in miscegenation will come from the natural increases of those people themselves, so a law at this stage will not solve miscegenation. As to this question of preserving the purity of the White race, I would like to point out that the major dilution of the purity of the White race has not come from children born in either mixed marriages or even of casual unions across the colour line; the major dilution really over the years has come because people have managed to cross the colour line. That is the cause of the major dilution of this so-called purity. I would say that crossing of the colour line has to a large extent been prevented now, or so the Government thinks, at any rate, by the Population Registration Act, which for all times has set the race to which a person belongs, so even the arguments which were used way back in 1949 and 1950 to prevent the dilution of the White race, was to a large extent answered by the passing of the Population Registration Act. I do not want to give the impression that I support the Population Registration Act. I do not. I believe that there are other ways to prevent this so-called dilution, and I believe that the real way, of course, is so to improve the economic and the social conditions of non-Whites that there should be no major advantage in trying for White; that if their own conditions were made at least decently comparable to the conditions enjoyed by the White races, there would be no great attraction in trying for White. That, of course, is the way in which this major problem should be solved.</p>

<p>Finally, I do not say that if this Bill is passed every problem will be solved and that we will all live happily ever after. Social problems clearly will remain, but they are problems which must be tackled with social reforms, improved standards of living, better educational standards and a greater influence of religious beliefs. These are the ways in which immorality can be tackled, not by a law. But I do say that if this Bill is passed, one thing is certain; South Africa will have rid itself of a cruel law that has brought untold misery to thousands of people and that has cast a slur on the country as a whole.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I have something which I would like to say in connection with this Bill now before the House. May I commence at once by saying that on this side of the House we are absolutely opposed to miscengenation. Let me make that point at once. I want to come back to it a little later on, but I want to make that point at once and because of what I have to say in connection with this matter at a later stage. We think in the interests of our people, in the interests of our country, that from whatever point of view you view it, miscegenation should be repudiated and frowned upon. The consequences to our people of this legislation have been very terrible indeed. But miscegenation is merely one aspect of immorality. We are against immorality, and in South Africa we have not got a law dealing with immorality, unless it is a law dealing with immorality across the colour line.</p>

<p>The hon. member has said in explaining her Bill that she is dealing with that and that alone in its intention of repealing a particular section in the Immorality Act; she has said that she is dealing only with that aspect of the law, <span class="col_1543-1544" refersTo="page_788"/>that provision in the law, which her Bill purports to repeal. I want to follow exactly the same line. The Immorality Law as such, in its other provisions, I leave alone. I want to deal just with that particular provision, the particular section, which her Bill seeks to repeal.</p>

<p>In dealing with this matter, I think we come very quickly to the question as to whether the law is dealing adequately with the evil. Does the law in fact have the effect of abating the evil? We on this side of the House believe that is a theoretical question that cannot be tested against the facts because the facts are not known. This is one of those questions which can be raised and which would be the subject of different opinions from time to time and in respect of which there can be no certainty because the facts are not known. If there was no such law, would miscegenation have been more widespread than it is at the present time or would it not? No man can answer that question. From this side of the House in the past we have ventured the opinion, from the commencement, that this law would serve its purpose because one cannot deal with such an evil by means of a law. This is something which cannot be circumscribed, altered, confined and brought to nought by means of a law. We have always believed that. We face the position at the moment that the degree, the magnitude, of the evil is an unknown quantity. Nobody can say whether it is more rife to-day than it was 50 years ago or 25 years ago or five years ago or even last year. Nobody can say that if it were not for this law it would have been more rife than it is to-day. There may be a number of different opinions on that score but there is no evidence; there is nothing whatever to say whether the one opinion is right and that the other opinion is wrong.</p>

<p>In 1950, the late Dr. Colin Steyn, put the case for this side of the House when he dealt with this particular matter. Sir, with your permission I would like to quote for a moment what Dr. Colin Steyn had to say. He said (Hansard, Volume 70, Col. 2171)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The White population has been here for 300 years. They have maintained themselves as no other White civilization has maintained itself in similar circumstances, but they did not maintain themselves by this type of legislation. They maintained themselves by their inherent strength, by the strength of their moral codes. I have said that this legislation will be unworkable. We know how we have tried to enforce laws which on the face of them seemed very sound. We know how we have tried through our liquor laws to protect the Black man in this country. Is there any man in this House who can say that these liquor laws under which we impose sanctions and under which we say that the Natives cannot buy liquor have been a complete success?</block>

<p>I think that has particular point to-day. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I repeat that if this illicit intercourse takes place on a large scale no legislation will ever be successful and no legislation can be successful in dealing with this evil. I believe that inherently this country is moral. There is an old saying of which I would remind the Minister that hard cases make bad laws, and I think the Minister has fallen into that error. He said quite frankly that he was sorry that he had to introduce this legislation. This Bill only shows how one piece of unfortunate legislation leads to another. Last year we had the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Bill before the House and now the Minister tells us that this legislation is a natural consequence of that Bill. I sincerely trust that the Minister will re-consider his attitude in this matter. I say that this Bill is unworkable.</block>

<p>Those words were uttered 12 years ago by the late Dr. Colin Steyn when the particular clause that we are dealing with was before the House. He moved&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute: &#x201C;this House, while opposed to miscegenation of any type, declines to pass the second reading of the Immorality Amendment Bill because it is of the opinion that the evil cannot be effectively dealt with by legislation.</block>

<p>I want to go further than the late Dr. Colin Steyn. I want to deal for the moment with the view of a member of this House who was in the Opposition at that time and who is a Minister to-day, the Minister of Labour and Immigration. This is what the present Minister of Labour and Immigration (Mr. Trollip) said (Hansard, Vol. 70, Col. 2174)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think I would be right in suggesting that there is no legislation in the world which deals effectively with this evil with which this Bill is concerned, that is to say the evil of immorality, or to put it more bluntly, the evil of prosititution, that is why this side of the House has moved this amendment. We say that you cannot have legislation which can prohibit or which can even control immorality of this sort effectively.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member was interrupted by the Minister of Interior and they had a little bit of cross-chat, but I come now to Col. 2177. General Smuts had interjected to say that many of the people in these cases were almost White. Mr. Trollip then proceeded&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, they are almost White, and you can imagine what a state of chaos there will be if those sailors and others are prosecuted under this Bill. You can imagine the state of chaos there is going to be when probably hundreds of them may be thrown into gaol. Instead of going back to their ships as they do in the ordinary course of events they will be thrown in gaol and according to the Bill they will have no defence. The onus is on them.</block>

<p>The Minister of Justice: Will that position continue?</p>

<p>It is not a question of &#x201C;hands up&#x201D; or not. The question is simply one of practicability. As I say, there are ennumerable other cases one can think of, but I am just giving this in broad outline. I say we are seeking to do something here which is beyond the bounds of any legislation. You will require an enormous army of policemen, for instance, in a place like Cape Town. What is the use of making laws which will be observed in the breach? They can never be enforced. We know they cannot be enforced. So what is the use of making these laws? I suggest that the hon. Minister should reconsider the matter and he must give some consideration to these questions which have been raised, particularly the one point which I have raised in regard to the marriage of Europeans and non-Europeans who subsequently are prosecuted, and that marriage is declared to be illegal. I need not dilate on the consequences of such action.</p>

<p>Those words were spoken by an hon. gentleman who is in a position to exercise influence to-day in the affairs of the Government. But he sits on the Government benches with another hon. gentleman who spoke in that debate with very great conviction, a Minister who at that time was a member of the Opposition.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the emotional hysterics of the hon. meber for Brits (Mr. Potgieter) may be very good on a platform in his area but do not behove a House of Parliament. The hon. member has shown the true colours which lie behind this measure. First the organizer of the party, the hon. member for George (Mr. Botha) let the cat out of the bag. This is just a political stunt; that is all it is, a political stunt that has been used only for one purpose, so that the hon. member for George and the hon. member for Brits can go into the platteland and distort politically everything that is said on this Bill. That is all it is. We have had it before. It is an old story. The liberal section of the United Party are opposing this measure, the liberal section that put their arms round the neck of the &#x201C;Kleurling&#x201D; and, sir, we are getting sick of those lies.</p>

<block name="quote">We say this, do you think the 1927 Act saved White civilization in South Africa? Do you think that this Bill, because it is a bit of legislation with a penalty attached to it, will save a purified White civilization in this country? Do you think a penalty of whatever it is, a few months&#x2019; imprisonment or a fine, is going to save White civilization in South Africa? Do you think that the world is going to recognize that? The hon. member for Bloemfontein (City) (Dr. C. F. Steyn) said this will show the world that we are going to maintain White civilization in South Africa by a small bit of legislation. Do you think that will save it, or is it the moral and spiritual soul of the people? That will save it and not these cheap political stunts that you throw across the floor of the House.</block>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is interesting in tracing the course of this particular matter through Parliament to find that in 1951 there was a motion moved in the Other Place by the present member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). I quote from the Senate Hansard, Col. 426, of 27 February 1951. The hon. member moved&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House earnestly request the Government to consider amending the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949, and or the Immorality Amendment Act, 1950, so as to eliminate hardship where it is possible and desirable to do so, fully taking into consideration the principles and objects of the said Act.</block>

<p>It is interesting, Sir, because the present Minister of Finance on that occasion accepted that amendment in the Other Place, and it was passed by the whole of the other House without exception. It is interesting because that <span class="col_1547-1548" refersTo="page_790"/>was in 1951, which was 11 years ago, and already there was apparent a desire to do something to ameliorate the conditions which were coming about in South Africa. The Government of the day&#x2014;this Government&#x2014; through the Minister of Finance accepted that amendment. The 1957 Act made it a crime to attempt to carry out any indecent Act which if fulfilled would have been miscegenation, or would have been construed as miscegenation. Such an attempt, of course, placed a great onus on the accused and increased the number of cases that came before the Courts. It increased public awareness of what was happening; it created further distress and hardship in the homes of various people. I want to come back to that in a moment. That distress and hardship has been building up since those days, and so I repeat: is this legislation now doing more harm than good? Because it seems to me that is the crisp point that everyone of us must answer in our own conscience. Is the legislation doing more harm than good? I remember that in my younger days my old father used to say to me in regard to actions that were contemplated, &#x201C;My boy, ask yourself if you are doing anybody else any harm; then ask yourself whether you are doing yourself any harm &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x2026;&#x201C;don&#x2019;t only ask yourself whether you are doing any good to other people or good to yourself&#x201D;. Here, Sir, is the test that I think we should apply. Are we doing harm to other people by having this law on the Statute Book? And when I say &#x201C;harm to other people&#x201D; let me tell hon. members opposite that if they are not already in &#x201C;moeilikheid&#x201D; as far as this Act and its consequences are concerned, then they are fortunate, not virtuous but fortunate. Let us accept that, Sir. Hon. members opposite can take that to their hearts. They sit in this House with unblemished records; they take part in the law-making&#x2014;rightly so, because they have been elected. How many of them would be elected if in their family there was a case of a conviction under the Act as it stands to-day?</p>

<p>That is why I say that they are not virtuous, they are lucky, damn lucky. Not one of us knows where the axe will fall next. Let them read the Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress and realize that but for the grace of God one of them might go there. That is the lesson that we should learn from the kind of evil that is facing South Africa at the present time. I do not want any taunt thrown at me personally by hon. members opposite. I am in precisely the same case as they are. I am not virtuous, I am fortunate; everyone of us is fortunate. Let us bow our heads and realize the shame that is facing everyone of us in South Africa as White people when we have on the Statute Book legislation which carries with it the humiliation, the pain and the suffering of whole families, which follow upon these cases. But I go further and I say that if this is what comes to people who are related to those who are guilty, what of those who are related to those who are found innocent in the courts but where the stigma still remains? You see, Sir, it is not so much perhaps the precise nature of the penalty inflicted by the court; it is the penalty inflicted by society. A person may be found innocent by the court but the stigma remains.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>Does that not apply to all crimes?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>As a matter of fact it is curious how little it applies to other crimes. It has been pointed out by the mover of the motion how in this country we view colour in human beings as something which for a long, long time past we have realized can lead to the dissolution of our society. We know that and instinctively we recoil from it, and probably that is why White society protects itself in that manner. But whatever the reason may be, I have myself come across instances&#x2014;and I have no doubt hon. members opposite have&#x2014;where even in the case of murder, the relatives have not had the stigma attached to them that they have had attached to them by society when the conviction has been under the Immorality Act under this particular section. That is a fact and whether we like it or not it is true. I repeat that we must ask ourselves: what is the penalty inflicted by society on the dear ones of those who are found innocent in the courts. They never throw off that stigma. They sell their homes, they emigrate, they get away from that atmosphere in which they realize that they are continually suspect. The hon. member who moved the second reading of this Bill dealt with one or two cases where framing had taken place. Framing under this Act is one of the easiest things in human relationships.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member quoted certain cases, but apart from that, in framing it is so easy after the conviction to prove that it was framing that took place. That <span class="col_1549-1550" refersTo="page_791"/>is the point. Framing is so utterly easy, and what is more, it is known to a whole group of people who are not of our colour. They realize it perfectly well. I have heard it talked about and joked about and laughed about by my Bantu servants. They realize perfectly well how easy it is to frame people and that there can be no retracing the step afterwards. When once a conviction has taken place I defy the Minister to explain the circumstances under which the valid evidence to set aside the conviction and to show that framing had taken place could be procured. In the very nature of the case it is impossible, because on the other side of the fence there is the non-European who has been, probably, only too well aware of precisely the meaning of the steps being taken for the purpose of the framing, and I say that this law lends itself to framing, and lends itself very easily indeed to framing.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that a large number of people are being apprehended in terms of this Act, and that therefore the Bill must be doing good. Sir, I do not think that is a good argument. I have said earlier on that is impossible for anyone to say with certainty whether the evil is growing or whether it is lessening, whether the fact that the law is here is a deterrent, or not a deterrent, but I want to say this in regard to a whisper that I have heard that the Government may consider legislation hereafter to make publication of the details of such cases forbidden, to forbid the publication of details, to keep them within a small circle of those officials and others directly implicated with the case, those participating in the case, the knowledge staying there&#x2014;Mr. Speaker, if that is a valid argument, then what is the value of the opposite argument that publicity acts as a deterrent. You can&#x2019;t have publicity acting as a deterrent and stopping people from committing acts of miscegenation and in the next breath saying that the way to deal with the difficulty is to stop publicity. The two things cancel one another. You cannot have it both ways. And however much the Government may attempt to restrict knowledge of the circumstances and events following a conviction, however much publicity through the Press may be prohibited, the knowledge will still ruin the life of that man and his family in the circle in which they move. That knowledge can never be kept away from the circle in which a man moves, from his own group, from the people with whom he works and where he carries out his ordinary daily avocation. Sir, we have but to look at this from another point of view altogether in my opinion.</p>

<p>I think it is incumbent upon the Government now to show that this legislation is serving its purpose. They have to make a case. They have had this legislation since 1950. and the amending Act of 1957. They have had the 1950 Act for 12 years, and surely in 12 years they ought to be able to make out a case and show that the Act is serving its purpose that it is succeeding, that it is doing more good than it is doing harm. Let us get away from the party political shibboleths in this matter and get down to facts. Let us look at some of the broken homes if we want to see whether this Act is doing any good, or more harm than good. Let the Government accept its responsibility and make out a case. We feel that the onus in that regard can best be discharged by a proper investigation by a Select Committee before the second reading. We feel that is the only way in dealing with this particular matter. That Select Committee should have power to take evidence, summon witnesses, and it should be able to call for documents, and bring up an amended Bill, if necessary. Because if the Select Committee in its wisdom feels that legislation can cope with the evil, let them come with an amending Bill. Sir, we on this side of the House are utterly opposed to miscegenation. But we are as utterly opposed to immorality as between members of the same race as we are opposed to immorality between members of different races. But, Sir, where lie the facts in regard to the law and the enforcement of the law? A Select Committee, which the Government can appoint, and this can get evidence from the churches, from social workers, from politicians if they are in a position to give evidence, is the only way to tackle this matter. Sir, I suggest that evidence even be taken from those who come from some of the broken homes. Let them go thoroughly into this, not from a party political point of view, but from the point of view of what is good for us in the Republic of South Africa. What are we doing now in the year 1962 that is going to help to alleviate the position for those who come after us, next year and the years after that? That should be the test. That is why I ask the Government to accept an amendment which I am going to move to send this Bill to a Select Committee before the second reading. Let us have the fullest possible investigation and try and get to the facts. There is no other way known to us in the parliamentary procedure which can achieve that end. It is quite true that the suggestion has been made that we might have a judicial commission appointed, but I want to say that a judicial commission in my opinion is not the answer to this particular problem. So I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Order for the Second Reading of the Immorality Amendment Bill be discharged and that the subject of the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers and to have leave to bring up an amended Bill&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I said just now that it might be suggested that a judicial commission should be appointed. But a Select Committee can call Judges, members <span class="col_1551-1552" refersTo="page_792"/>of the Judiciary, magistrates, the police, they can call all those people who have facts within their knowledge bearing upon this particular problem. It is not necessary to have a commission with a Judge at the head of it. A Select Committee is quite capable to deal with the matter. The Government in its wisdom may decide that they want a judicial commission, and we on this side of the House are not going to complain about that. What we believe is more important than the personnel of the body going into the matter is that the evidence shall come from the widest possible group of people in South Africa, including non-Europeans of all races and colours. Let this matter be threshed out with a view of coming to a decision which is going to redound to the credit as a civilized White race maintaining political authority in this country. I, Sir, was very moved by the leading article in the <i>Burger</i> yesterday where in the English translation it said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that in due course the accumulated evidence and experience and the constructive proposals in regard to the Immorality Act can usefully be co-ordinated and analysed from the point of view that the purpose of the Act and some of its results were good, but that its practical application has also produced unforeseen byproducts which do not do honour to our public life and to South Africa&#x2019;s name. Thorough investigation and reflection under the guidance of experienced minds&#x2014;and much of it by the nature of things have to be conducted privately&#x2014;would do much to check the harmful inflammation which has developed around this problem.</block>

<p>I appeal to the Government to accept this amendment. Sir, this is an opportunity to have the fullest inquiry after the Act has been on the Statute Book for 12 years. If the Government refuses to hold an inquiry, if they are determined, come what may, to go on with this Act with all its evils, then as a protest from this side of the House we shall vote in favour of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I second the amendment.</p>

<p>This is a tragic Act which has had terrible consequences. The Act purports to be legislation against immorality. it purports to be just like all legislation. But it is not legislation against immorality, except in the slightest respect. It is legislation against colour. It is an attempt to enforce morality upon a limited number of people, and it could only be justified if the immorality which it attempts to prevent was carried through to a general end, that is it affected everyone. Sir, sexuality is sexuality whether it is White or Black, and if it is illegal sexuality it is illegal whether it is White or Black. or whether it crosses the colour line, and it is in that respect more than any other that this legislation is so unjust and has caused so much harm. Mr. Speaker, to change the law, to abolish this law, would not, I believe, and that is the opinion of many others, open the floodgates to immoraltiy between colour. This is a sociological law and it could be enforced sociologically and sociologically only. The man who finds it repugnant to cross the colour line for sex will no less find it repugnant if there is no law to deter him, and such is the sex urge, not only in men but in all mammals and even in the insects, that nothing can stop it, and the deterrent of the fear of this law must have had extremely little effect upon those who are urged by that urge.</p>

<p>What was the object of the Act? Why did the Government introduce the Act, or rather the clauses which are now sought to be amended? Presumably it was to protect the purity of the race. It was, one might say, legislation for genetics. But, Sir, let us investigate the purity of this race. Let us see how far the Government are justified in their attitude. We on this side of the House are strongly against miscegenation, very strongly. Let there be no mistake about that. But at the same time: Where did the Coloured people come from? They did not drop out of the sky. They were not here until the White man came, and if we look into the history of the various races in the world, we will find that there is no pure race anywhere, and what is more, it is a disadvantage to be a pure race, because owing to the pure race idea there is so much inbreeding that recessive components of heredity come to the top. I want to give to hon. members on the other side of the House a very strong example from their own forebears. Among those early settlers in this country, Sir, was a family who suffered from haemophilia, where it is not possible to stop hemorrhage in the male. Sir, that family spread and was mixed with other families, until a scientific investigator during the Anglo-Boer War found that there was a large number of haemophiliacs among the war prisoners, and I maintain that had the Voortrekkers and had the early settlers of this country not contacted sexually with the indigenous peoples, or those who were imported from the East as slaves, this propensity towards bleeding could have had very grave effects upon those who trekked out of the Cape.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not. But I say that there is no race which is not hybrid. If you analyse the actual people who deal in this particular form of miscegenation, what do you find? We find that certain groups tend to cross this line. There are firstly the sailors. I don&#x2019;t think it needs an explanation from me to account for them. Many of them are quite unaware of what a slightly coloured person looks like. They will have great difficulty in the poor light in the docks to see what is happening. And, Sir, what is even worse, is this: How are these people apprehended? They are apprehended because the police watch the <span class="col_1553-1554" refersTo="page_793"/>prostitutes. They can&#x2019;t watch the sailor. They don&#x2019;t know where he is or when he is coming. But the police are aware of who are the prostitutes. So they watch the prostitutes, they allow the sailors to break or to attempt to break this law, and then they apprehend them. If the police feel so strongly about this, why don&#x2019;t they first apprehend the prostitutes? Why is the law not changed so that they can apprehend the prostitutes? And that applies not only to the sailors, but it applies to others. I say that 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the prosecutions under this Act are the result of the police watching the prostitutes. They could easily avoid these cases by apprehending the prostitutes. The others are the result of spying.</p>

<p>The next case is the young man who would try anything. He thinks it is some form of experiment that he can carry out, and he is also caught with the prostitute. Thirdly, there is the man who through drink or emotional upset or diseases falls by the wayside. That is another man who is apprehended. It is not a habit with him. None of these people that I have mentioned make it a habit. They are caught because they are associated with people who make it a habit, and we punish the unfortunate youth and the (unfortunate perhaps) businessman (I am not excusing him), who because of temporary aberration or stress or emotion falls to temptation. As the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) said &#x201C;There are a lot of people who are lucky&#x201D;. And lastly, you come to the unfortunate man who has a predilection for colour in sex. Sir, that presents a great problem. I am not attempting to excuse him. I am merely telling you that is a fact, and such cases should not be apprehended by the police. This is a sociological problem and they should be dealt with sociologically, by a psychiatrist perhaps. It often happens that they are dullars or recidivists, who don&#x2019;t know any better. Those people should be dealt with perhaps by segregation. But to put those unfortunate people, who are not criminals&#x2014;they are the victims of a crime which this Government has created for them, it is not a natural crime, it is a crime which has been produced purely by statute, to put those people behind bars, is completely wrong.</p>

<p>On the other side, on the female side, what do we find? We find the prostitutes making a living out of this. In this part of the world, they are largely Coloureds and in Natal they are mostly Native women, and there it is again the sailors who fall victims to these people. There are a few others who are seduced through poverty or contiguity, proximity to the non-Whites, and lastly, those unfortunate people who really have affection across the colour line, who want to marry, who have in fact in many cases been married. Although we are strongly against miscegenation, the few cases like that deserve very careful consideration, and they justify, I believe, the removal of this Act because, as I said before, it is not a crime, it is a perfectly natural procedure.</p>

<p>This situation is complicated still further by the recent actions under the Population Register. So far as I can judge from the cases which have come to my personal notice and to the notice of some of my colleagues, there is something of a witch-hunt for the Coloureds, and to-day it seems to me that the Population Registrar, when in doubt, thinks to himself: Make them Coloured and let them prove that they are not Coloured.</p>

<p>I speak from personal experience. I am satisfied that anybody in Natal who had a grandparent born in Mauritius, has difficulty in getting his population register card and that the Population Registrar goes to all sorts of end to get that person into his office to have a look at him. And what qualifications has the Population Registrar sitting in his Durban office to say whether a person is White or non-White? And many of these people whom I have known personally, who live among Whites, who associate with Whites, whose children go to White schools, are classified firstly as non-Whites, until we can get redress. And if you are going to that fine point with the Population Register, then you must find somebody and some standards by which the Population Registrar can do it. He has no more qualification than anybody else to certify that people are White or non-White. How many are there who are classified as non-Whites whilst they have lived altogether as Whites, and how many families are there, Sir, who can look back on their whole family tree in this country and not find somewhere a nigger in the woodpile? Mr. Speaker, a scientific investigation was carried out some years ago in this country and it is reckoned that no less than 75 per cent of the population have somewhere a trace of non-White blood in them.</p>

<p>I have listened attentively to the attitude of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) and I want to say at once that I have not heard a single argument from the hon. member which induces me to adopt the attitude that this Act, or any of its provisions, should be repealed. On the contrary, every argument advanced by the hon. member is in my opinion a further reason as to why this Act should remain unchanged. I shall come back to that later on.</p>

<p>I am, of course, not surprised at the attitude adopted by the hon. member. In taking this stand she is simply being faithful to the philosophy which underlies her views. In the nature of things one is not liberal in respect of one matter only. Liberalism is a philosophy which permeates the whole of one&#x2019;s life and determines one&#x2019;s attitude in all spheres of life. I am not surprised at the attitude of the hon. member for Houghton therefore. Viewed <span class="col_1555-1556" refersTo="page_794"/>in the light of her political beliefs and views, it is a consistent attitude.</p>

<p>Although I have said this about the hon. member for Houghton, I cannot say it of the United Party unfortunately, because I am not sure what the party&#x2019;s attitude is. I am never sure how long the United Party will adopt a certain attitude before discarding it for another. I am being perfectly honest when I say that if I have to reduce the arguments advanced by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) to their logical conclusion, then it simply amounts to this that we on this side are correct in retaining this Act because he says he does not want miscegenation, but in the same breath he says that the hon. member for Houghton is correct in introducing this Bill for the repeal of this Act. That is what his standpoint amounted to. The hon. member tried to make political capital out of quotations which he read out from speeches made by my hon. colleagues in the past. Why does the hon. member not tell the House that in 1950 the third reading of the then Bill was passed by this House without any discussion and without any dissentient vote? Why does he not mention that?</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, let us go further. This Act was very radically amended in 1957. Hon. members will recall&#x2014;just to link up with the history that the hon. member for Houghton has given here&#x2014;that in 1927 actual carnal intercourse between a White person and a Bantu&#x2014;only between a White person and a Bantu&#x2014;constituted an offence, and it applied to actual carnal intercourse only. In 1950 the word &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; was simply deleted from the Act and non-White person was substituted for &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;. That is the only material change that was brought about in 1950. Now I come to the change in 1957, that is to say, in Section 16 to which the hon. member for Houghton referred. Section 16 provided that &#x201C;any White person (1) who has unlawful carnal intercourse with a non-White female person shall be guilty of an offence&#x201D;. That is as far as the 1950 Act went. The 1957 Act added the words &#x201C;or attempts.&#x201D; But it also added three sub-sections: &#x201C;Commits or attempts to commit with a Coloured female person any immoral or indecent act; or entices, solicits or importunes any Coloured female person to have unlawful carnal intercourse with him; or entices, solicits or importunes any Coloured female person to the commission of any immoral or indecent act.&#x201D; All this was added in 1957. On that occasion the hon. the Minister of Immigration again spoke on behalf of the United Party. And has it slipped the memory of the hon. member for South Coast that as a result of the attitude adopted by the hon. member, the second reading of this Act, the repeal of which is now being advocated, was accepted without a division and with only one speaker taking part in the debate, namely the hon. member who now sits on this side? It was accepted without any division. No division was even called for and the United Party endorsed that attitude without a murmur. What was interesting in the 1957 debate was the fact that the attitude which the hon. member for Houghton now adopts, was adopted by the then member, Mr. Stanford, and the hon. the Minister who now sits on this side strenuously repudiated him, and so did the whole of the United Party.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Is it not true that the then member for Benoni, Mr. Lovell, wished to ask for a division but that Mr. Speaker ruled that no new principle was being introduced and a division was therefore not called for?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, that is only a half-truth as far as this matter is concerned. Many clauses were inserted and the whole House was certainly at liberty to vote against those clauses and therefore against the Bill. Nobody could be compelled to vote for it. That does not in any way alter the fact therefore that there was no division on the second reading, in spite of this new principle that was being introduced. But the point I want to make is that the hon. the Minister repudiated Mr. Stanford, and at that time Mr. Stanford adopted more or lesss the attitude that the hon. member for Houghton now adopts, and the hon. the Minister repudiated him on behalf of the United Party. But to-day, the hon. member for South Coast allows himself to be taken in tow by the hon. member for Houghton. That is the difference between the stand then taken by the hon. member and the attitude which he adopts now.</p>

<p>I would therefore respectfully make this submission to the hon. member for South Coast for his consideration: He is trying in vain to shield behind the attitude which the Ministers concerned adopted in this House at the time in an attempt to conceal his party&#x2019;s lack of policy. He will not succeed, Mr. Speaker, just to show you how hot and cold the United Party is blowing in regard to this measure and this very serious principle that we are dealing with to-day, let me point out how cynically the United Party views this principle. Take the attitude of the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford). On the one hand he tells us with great verbosity that &#x201C;there is no such thing as a pure race&#x201D;. He has said that on more than one occasion in this House. And then in the next breath he says, &#x201C;We are deadly against miscegenation.&#x201D; If it is true that there is no such thing as a pure race, why is he against miscegenation? Surely then one does not have the elementary right to be against miscegenation in principle. After all, they are two conflicting principles, and even if one wishes to do so one cannot reconcile them.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, before I deal further with the arguments of those hon. members, you will permit me to deal in the first instance with the arguments of the hon. member for <span class="col_1557-1558" refersTo="page_795"/>Houghton. The hon. member herself, apparently because she realizes the untenability of the point of view which she tried to state here, touched upon a point which to my mind is a very serious one. Let me say in the first instance that it is of no importance to me what the hon. member said and what she wishes to do with her Bill which is now before the House; what is of more importance to me is what the hon. member does not want to do. It strikes me as strange that the hon. member should come here and ask in all seriousness that the provisions which form the very basis of the Immorality Act should be repealed but does not ask that the Mixed Marriages Act should be repealed. Towards the end of her speech the hon. member herself realized that she was placing herself in an untenable position. The question that occurs to me is this: If one is in earnest in connection with this type of racial relationship, why not begin by asking that the Mixed Marriages Act be repealed? Because what is the essence of the hon. member&#x2019;s request? Let us assume that we conceded that she was right, that we took her at her word and accepted and disposed of all the stages of this Bill to-day without further ado. What would the result of that be? The result would be that this House would be placing its stamp of approval on the conduct of unmarried people, who give free rein to their carnal pleasures while denying the right to people to live together in decency as married couples. That in essence is what the hon. member asks for in this Bill.</p>

<p>That is in fact what the hon. member should ask us to do. She now realizes what she is up against, and now she says that if we pass this Bill to-day, she will repeal the Mixed Marriages Act next week. If the hon. member were in earnest she would first have tried to get the other Act repealed. Let me say to the hon. member that it is firstly a question of philosophy&#x2014;and I do not hold this against her&#x2014;it is the liberal philosophy that causes one to advocate the extreme step which the hon. member seeks to take here. But in the second instance&#x2014;and this is my charge against the hon. member&#x2014;it is not a popular thing to ask that the Mixed Marriages Act be repealed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not the reason.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is the reason. It is more popular to drift along with the stream and to ask that the Immorality Act be repealed. Perhaps that is the reason why the hon. member adopted that attitude.</p>

<p>I told the hon. member for South Coast this by way of interjection, and I also want to say it to the hon. member for Houghton: There is a great deal of talk going around as to what the effect of this measure is going to be. I do not want to try in any way to minimize the serious consequences of the Act from the point of view of the publicity that wives and children have to endure. I am fully conscious of its seriousness and how it affects these people. I do not want to deny that, nor do I want to minimize it. But at the same time I should like to put this question: Does that not in fact prove in what a serious light this offence is regarded? Why should such a great stigma attach to the commission of this act if the public does not regard it as a particularly serious offence? Does that stigma not prove that we were right when we introduced this Bill originally, and that in doing so we were expressing the feelings of the public, Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking? But, Mr. Speaker, I want to go further. Has the hon. member ever heard of a single Bantu father or Bantu mother or of a single Coloured father or mother who has asked that we should repeal this Act? Are the Bantu father and mother not intensely grateful to us for protecting the honour of their daughters against unscrupulous people who have money and influence and position? Are the Coloured father and mother not intensely grateful to us for safeguarding the honour of their daughters? Let me say this to the hon. member for Houghton: However poor one may be, whatever one&#x2019;s colour may be, there is not a decent father or mother who does not value the honour of his or her daughters and children. I want to make this accusation against the hon. member, that she used the most shocking argument that I have ever heard in this connection, and that was the following: One of the arguments that she advanced as to why this Act should be repealed is that &#x201C;the number of European prostitutes is soaring on account of this Act&#x201D;. She said that the number of White prostitutes was soaring as a result of this Act because people are afraid now to have intercourse with non-Whites. In other words, the hon. member stated&#x2014;and she must accept the consequences of her argument because she said it in this House&#x2014;that we should rather see to it that there are more non-White prostitues and then there will not be so many White prostitutes. That is the consequence of the argument advanced by her, and it is one that one cannot escape because that is in fact the argument which the hon. member advanced.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not believe for a single moment, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member was referring to me. I think she is accustomed to talking to herself. I repeat the argument that I have not come across a single Bantu or Coloured or Indian who holds it against us that we passed this Act. On the contrary numerous appeals have come from Coloureds who ask that their daughters should also be protected against the Bantu, and from Bantu fathers and mothers who ask that their daughters should also be protected against Indians or members of other races. I say that every decent person&#x2014;and one is very grateful that is so&#x2014;values the honour of his daughter and I am grateful for any law which seeks to protect that honour.</p>

<p>The hon. member then goes on to submit as one of the reasons why this Act should be repealed&#x2014;and I do not want to put into her mouth arguments that she did not use but I made a note of this&#x2014;is, as she put it, &#x201C;because the law cannot properly be enforced&#x201D;. Because we cannot eradicate the evil entirely, we must repeal the Act. By implication therefore her argument is that if we could catch all those who contravene the law, then it would be all very well and then she would not ask that this Act be repealed. Surely that is not the sort of principle to adopt. That argument was also used in part by the hon. member for South Coast. I know that we do not arrest all those who contravene the Immorality Act. I know that there are many people who do so secretly, of whom we are not aware and on whom we cannot lay our hands. But that does not mean to say that the State must close its eyes to that fact. I do not want to allege for a moment that we have eradicated immorality. The hon. member has said that unless we can prove that we have done so or that we are in the process of doing so, we should adopt a different attitude. Since when has that been the criterion by which laws of this nature are judged? Let us take the law in respect of prostitutes. There is not a single civilized country in the world which is without legislation in respect of prostitutes and which does not make it punishable for them to roam the streets at night. And yet no single country in the world has succeeded in eradicating prostitution. We know that in spite of all the laws in Britain, the Netherlands, France and South Africa, and laws which may exist elsewhere, there is still prostitution and it is probably still increasing.</p>

<p>No, but I am using that as an anology. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument&#x2014;and he must not try to run away from his argument now&#x2014;was that because we cannot eradicate this thing root and branch, we must not retain this Act. My argument is that in that case we should also say that because we cannot eradicate prostitution, which is also an immoral act, and because it is steadily increasing, we should abandon all legislation dealing with prostitution. That is no valid argument.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton talked about &#x201C;this disgusting law&#x201D;. She was referring to this measure as it stands on the Statute Book. Since when has it been a &#x201C;disgusting law&#x201D; to the hon. member?</p>

<p>And nevertheless, in spite of that, the hon. member did not even condescend in 1957 to vote against this &#x201C;disgusting law&#x201D;. We are not dealing here with a &#x201C;disgusting law it is the act itself which is so disgusting and so abhorrent. If the hon. member wants to render this House a service, she must not come here and attack this Act. She should attack those people who commit acts which bring them within the ambit of this measure. Let me put this question to the hon. member for Houghton: She did not have a single word of condemnation for those people who contravene this Act&#x2014;not a single word throughout the whole of her speech. I do not want to mention the reasons why she did not do so. I leave that to her. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I have already said that the hon. member for Houghton has not advanced a single argument as to why we should repeal this legislation. On the contrary, every argument advanced by her is a reason why we should retain this Act. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member&#x2019;s entire argument amounted to this that we were trying to achieve the impossible by trying to draw a line between colour and colour as far as this matter is concerned; that we were trying to do the impossible and that was why we were in this predicament. The hon. member says that we might as well repeal this Act because, to use her words, we need not be afraid that &#x201C;there will be a stampede to marriage officers&#x201D;. In other words, here again we have evidence of the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude that she is not concerned with those people, however wrongly and badly they may be advised, who wish to marry; her concern is that we should repeal this law so as to come to the assistance of those people who wish to give free rein to their carnal desires. That is why the hon. member herself gives the answer that &#x201C;there will be no stampede <span class="col_1561-1562" refersTo="page_797"/>to marriage officers&#x201D;. The hon. member has drawn the inference from what she has read that the Government or rather that I intend forbidding the publicity which is associated with contraventions under this Act. Let me say that I have no such intention and that the Government has no intention of forbidding publicity in respect of these contraventions only.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Precisely what I say. That is my reply to the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell).</p>

<p>The argument has been advanced hereby the hon. member for South Coast and by the hon. member for Houghton that we are not dealing here with a crime really: &#x201C;You made it a crime&#x201D;. In other words, Mr. Speaker, it is an act to which no stigma attaches. That is the argument on the one hand. But on the other hand we are told that people&#x2014;and I accept that is so&#x2014;commit suicide because of the stigma which attaches to this crime. I realize that, Mr. Speaker; as a matter of fact, I am one of those who subscribe to the belief that a great stigma attaches to the commission of this crime. But, after all, why is it emphasized so much in this case? It is done because the sensation-seeking Press exploits particularly this type of court case to publicize it to the world. It is true that people who have been charged under this Act have committed suicide. It is also true, however, that people you would be surprised to know how many&#x2014;commit suicide because they are arrested on charges of falsitas and theft and for other crimes. But the point is that you will seldom read in the newspapers that a person committed suicide because he was charged with falsitas. But wherever a person commits suicide because he is afraid of the consequences that will flow from his rash deeds you will find it reported in banner headlines. It is true, Mr. Speaker, and one regrets it very sincerely that innocent wives and children do suffer. Nobody has seen that more than I have and nobody appreciates it more than I do. But all wives and all children suffer when husbands and fathers commit crimes or contravene the law. That is a matter about which I am not indifferent and about which I do not want to be indifferent. But if we adopt the attitude that it is only these wives and these children&#x2014;for whom we are all very, very sorry indeed&#x2014; who suffer then we are wide of the mark and we certainly do not promote the object that we are trying to achieve.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, that is typical of the hon. member. I did not say at all that I was going to prevent publicity being given to any crime. That is the inference that the hon. member draws. The hon. member has already erred in the past in drawing certain inferences, as he did at Bloemfontein when he inferred that the Progressive Party would be the party of the future. It is frequently said by members of the public that people are being prosecuted nowadays for every bagatelle. One frequently hears, particularly in private conversations between the uninitiated, that the position is so dangerous to-day that one cannot even take one&#x2019;s domestic servant home or that one cannot do this, that or the other. I have challenged hon. members on the other side, and I shall be glad if they will accept the challenge, to bring to my notice one case amongst all the cases which come before our courts, where, to use the word of hon. members opposite, a person was &#x201C;framed under this Act&#x201D;. I shall be grateful if they can produce one <i>bona fide</i> case where people have been framed under this Act. I shall be very grateful if such cases are brought to my notice. I was being perfectly serious when I said that to the hon. member. I have discussed the situation very fully with the parties concerned and I am not aware of any person who has been caught innocently in the net of this Act. I want to say that very clearly. Let me also make this submission to the House and re-assure the public that the Attorneys-General and the prosecutors exercise the greatest care in deciding in connection with these cases whether they should prosecute or whether they should not prosecute. Let me give this as an example in connection with the figures which I have already given the hon. member by way of reply to a question; let me take the year 1960. The hon. member will recall that she asked me how many charges there had been in 1960. The reply was 780&#x2014;these are charges in respect of the whole Republic of South Africa. In respect of 273 of those charges the Attorney-General or the prosecutor decided not to prosecute. They did not decide not to prosecute because the person concerned had been arrested for a mere bagatelle; they did not decide not to prosecute because the person concerned, on the papers before them, was innocent, but they decided not to prosecute because of the stigma which attaches to it when a person is charged under this Act, and they gave him the benefit of the doubt in 273 cases. The hon. members also tried to insinuate that, amongst other things, we were simply prosecuting indiscriminately because we have a mania in this connection. I give these figures, Mr. Speaker, because I want to indicate that Attorneys-General and prosecutors exercise the greatest care before they charge people in this connection. There are many other arguments that one could advance, but in view of the lateness of the hour, I move&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 12 is a bit of very clumsy legislation, and will quite possibly get the hon. the Minister and this Corporation and its Board into some difficulty on occasion. This clause provides in sub-section (3) that this Corporation will be subject to the undistributed profits tax, and it seems to me quite extraordinary that the hon. Minister and a board of this nature when they are considering the question as to what amount should be put to reserve in the ordinary course of the company&#x2019;s activities, should have to take into account the possibility of paying undistributed profits tax. I accept that the company has to pay taxes, but why the hon. the Minister should have to bend his mind in regard to this particular tax. is beyond my understanding.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>As the Bill stands now, this corporation will have to pay income tax as well as undistributed tax. I think we had better leave it like that. There is a provision under the Income Tax Act, the Schedule to the Act, which provides for exemption of undistributed profits tax or income tax, and I think this Corporation might be dealt with under that section.</p>

<p>The C.S.I.R. is being dealt with in that way at the present moment and is being added to the list in the Schedule to the Income Tax Act. I think that is the way to deal with the matter.</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;by&#x201D; in line 19, to the end of sub-section (1) and to substitute &#x201C;the Controller and Auditor-General&#x201D;</block>

<p>The intention of my amendment is clear. The intention of course is to remove the shadow of accountability to Parliament which the clause as it now stands provides and to replace it with the substance of accountability by placing the responsibility for the audit of the accounts of this corporate body in the hands of the Controller and Auditor-General. During the second reading debate, the hon. the Minister signified agreement with a speaker on this side of the House that it was desirable that there should be adequate parliamentary control over the finances of a body such as this. In other words, the hon. the Minister signified agreement that public moneys to be administered by a body such as this, which is being brought into being by Parliament to discharge certain functions, should be under the control of Parliament, and that accordingly there is a duty on Parliament to ensure that it can continue to carry out its own financial responsibilities of supervision through its Standing Select Committee on Public Accounts.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that the hon. the Minister did qualify his agreement, by saying that it would be preferable that this sort of procedure should apply to other bodies of a somewhat similar nature. But I think the hon. the Minister rather overlooked the fact that more such bodies already fall within the rule of accountability than are exempted from that general rule. When the hon. the Minister spoke in the way he did, I am sure that he had in mind bodies such as the Industrial Development Corporation <span class="col_1565-1566" refersTo="page_799"/>and the Iron and Steel Corporation. Now whether those bodies should or should not fall within the accountability rule need not be debated, because they are not comparable with this one at all. What is happening here is that although this body, which is about to be created, is a statutory corporate body, yet in plain business parlance it is of course a wholly owned subsidiary of the C.S.I.R. Sir, in this case responsibility for the administration of the Act is to fall on the same people. It is the council which is going to appoint the directors of this Corporation; it is the council that is going to second staff to the Corporation; and it is the council that is going to put funds available to this corporate body to discharge its functions. In fact, the objects of the Corporation are similar to those of the parent body, the C.S.I.R. What is being created here is not a new type of undertaking. What is being done is merely to extend to this new subsidiary the powers which are already being exercised by the C.S.I.R. In fact to all intents and purposes all this Bill does is to make this Corporation part and parcel of the parent body. As the hon. Minister knows, the accounts of the parent body (the C.S.I.R.) are audited by the Controller and Auditor-General. Section 13 of the principal Act provides that should be done. Logically therefore, and also for the sake of continuity of control, these accounts should also be subject to the audit of the Controller and Auditor-General. I say therefore that we are dealing here with a case that is in no way comparable with bodies such as the I.D.C. We are dealing here with a body which is unique to this extent that it is a subsidiary of an existing corporate body that complies with this rule of accountability to Parliament. I know that the clause goes on to provide that there should be a laying on the Table of information. Sir, as Parliament&#x2019;s work has increased so has laying on the Table become a mere formality. It is to-day nothing but a shadow of whatever it might have been before. It is there only to keep Parliament informed, it is not there to help Parliament to exercise any form of supervisory control. As the hon. the Minister knows. Parliament carries out its financial functions at two stages: Firstly at the stage of proposal when Estimates are being considered and voted; and then at the stage of result, that is when accounts have been audited by the Controller and Auditor-General, when his report goes for examination to the Select Committee on Public Accounts, and that Committee then reports in due course to this House. So far as the first aspect is concerned, there is going to be that form of control because the funds of the C.S.I.R., the parent body, are voted by Parliament, either in the form of capital funds or of loan funds. When therefore capital funds are voted, Parliamentary control will be exercised at the stage of proposal to the extent that the responsible Minister will have to explain or have to answer questions as to what the money is for. But where the whole system of control will break down is that there will no longer be any control at the stage of results. The purpose of my amendment therefore is to give the Minister an opportunity to show his sincerity, the sincerity which he expressed in his views at the second reading. I say he can show his sincerity by adopting the amendment. You see, Sir, we are trying to prevent here that exceptions should continue to be made. I submit that my amendment should be adopted for all these reasons. It is true that the clause as it stands provides for audit by registered accountants and auditors. No harm will be done to them by adopting my amendment, because the Auditor-General is empowered to use the services of registered accountants and auditors, and in fact he does so if circumstances warrant it. I am not quite sure whether he does so in the case of the C.S.I.R., but he has power to do so, if he so desires, and he could do so in this case. As I have said, he has shown his ability to handle this type of audit, because the C.S.I.R. to-day is doing precisely what this body will do in future. It might do it to a greater extent, but it will do principally the same thing. The Auditor-General moreover is <i>au fait</i> with what has happened and there is every reason, both on grounds of logic and on grounds of continuity of audit, that the amendment should be adopted.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to express myself strongly against the amendment of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) and the views he propounded here, and therefore I should like to put the matter a little more broadly than just within the narrow confines of the clause, but without going too far. The hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion now is that the audit of this Development Corporation should be done by the Auditor-General because he says that the Auditor-General audits the C.S.I.R. and that this makes parliamentary control possible. My first real objection to this is that the audit carried out by the Auditor-General is not one which can be regarded as a functional audit in which he regards critically the economic operation of the institution, in the same way as a good private auditor does so to-day. No, it is merely a formal audit to ascertain whether the Treasury rules have been complied with. The whole modern tendency in auditing is to go further than the purely formal control of revenue and expenditure, and to couple with the formal control of revenue and expenditure a consideration as to what is economically practicable and desirable in the circumstances. Very often we find that it is the modern tendency for the auditor to advise the industry or the business. I think we must get away from this idea of auditing with the idea that it will provide parliamentary control. The really important audit is not to see whether a shilling or a sixpence has been formally spent in terms of parliamentary authorization and thereafter with the approval of the Treasury. The importance of an audit lies in taking a broad view to see whether that money has been spent not only in a formally correct way, but whether it has really been disbursed for the intended purpose. Therefore in the first <span class="col_1567-1568" refersTo="page_800"/>place I want to oppose the idea that we should place these funds under the control of the Auditor-General. I would welcome an outside auditor, as is provided for here by the Bill.</p>

<p>For the rest, there is absolutely no substance in the argument that the Auditor-General of the State can do anything which the outside auditor would not do. The private auditor, just like the Auditor-General, must ascertain whether the funds have been spent in terms of a resolution of the board of directors of this Corporation, and he can undoubtedly also go further and see whether it was done in terms of the instructions of the C.S.I.R. The outside auditor can add to the functions of the Auditor-General but he cannot derogate from them. What the Auditor-General can do is the minimum that the outside auditor must do. But I particularly rose to point out that the C.S.I.R., as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) correctly stated, is subjected to audit by the Auditor-General, and consequently that is one of the actual methods by which control terms of Treasury regulations is applied to the C.S.I.R., and a body like the C.S.I.R. and the Corporation have to be flexible in the performance of their duties and necessarily cannot work to set rules according to which a State official can always specify beforehand as to how the shilling or the sixpence or the &#x00A3;500 or the &#x00A3;1,000 should be spent. Therefore it is very undesirable that this organization should be permeated with the spirit that everything closely connected to the C.S.I.R. should be compelled to submit to a State audit. This Parliament will be satisfied if we know that the money has been spent according to the allocations made by the C.S.I.R. That is, after all, the only thing that we as a Parliament want to know, and this Bill provides how the C.S.I.R. in its turn can make funds available to the Corporation. I therefore want to express the hope that the Minister will not accept this amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) has explained the difficulties so lucidly that it is scarcely necessary to add anything. The point I wish to make is that this is another example of control being taken away from Parliament to be put into the hands of bodies that are constituted by Parliament. We have for many years complained about this question of accountability to Parliament. The C.S.I.R. is accountable to Parliament because through the Auditor-General and our Public Accounts Committee there is a revision of their accounts. But now we have gone a step further. Now we have the C.S.I.R. controlled by Parliament through the Auditor-General and our Public Accounts Committee, but we say that a subsidiary of that company need not be controlled. I am sure that is a departure in the wrong direction. What the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) is suggesting is that the same system that is applied to the parent company should be extended to the subsidiary, and that this House, that Parliament, voting the money should have the opportunity of knowing how that money is being expended.</p>

<p>It is not a question of an audit of pointing out as my hon. friend said, that 1s. 6d. or 15c are not being accounted for. The question is how are the affairs of this company being conducted. The parent company is accountable to Parliament and any departure from this rule is to be regretted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). Everything he said is correct, and it is not realized that although we continually talk about how parliamentary control of public funds is slipping out of our hands, how far that slipping has gone. The danger point, in my opinion, has been passed and a stop must be put to this process at some stage or another, and this is a particularly good place to put a stop to the practice, because, as has been said already, this is to all intents and purposes a subsidiary of the C.S.I.R., and whereas the C.S.I.R. is accountable to Parliament, so should this subsidiary company be. I hope the hon. Minister won&#x2019;t say that this corporation is in the public interest and that this is the best way of handling it, and that the amount involved at the moment will only be R200,000. Because in my hand at the moment I hold the accounts of a few Government-controlled companies and their assets total approximately R260,000,000, quite a lot of money and none of it subject to parliamentary scrutiny. There are of course more of these funds. There is the Bantu Development Corporation and the Coloured Development Corporation and there are others. The Auditor-General in his Report for 1960-1 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The total public debt outstanding at 31 March 1961 was R2,531,000,000. As this amount can reasonably be regarded as represented by interest-earning capital, permanent assets and recoverable amounts, no portion of the amount represents unproductive debt.</block>

<p>On the same page (32) he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In terms of Section 2 of Act No. 64 of 1934, as amended, the Railway Administration share of this debt is R1,439,000,000 odd.</block>

<p>These so-called public utility companies&#x2019; assets must also be revenue-producing, and we have now reached the position where the handling of an amount of over 25 per cent of our real public debt is out of parliamentary scrutiny altogether. I am excluding the Railways of course, because the Railways are on their own. I can almost say, not with my tongue in my cheek, that we are fast reaching the position where most of the money voted by Parliament for investment will be completely outside parliamentary scrutiny and control, and I do suggest that this is a good time at which to stop this insidious movement. I know we are all tempted to do it. It sounds much more <span class="col_1569-1570" refersTo="page_801"/>businesslike, but the fact remains that these funds should be under the control of Parliament and that difficulties should come to our notice timeously. So I do hope that the hon. the Minister will agree to give the audits to the Auditor-General.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say a few words on the subject. Hon. members opposite have made it quite clear why they do not want private firms and auditors to do this audit. If this House, as the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) put it, wants to know how the affairs of that undertaking are being conducted, surely that can be ascertained from the annual report, nor is it the Auditor-General who informs this House how the work is being done; it is properly audited, and the Auditor-General can only report whether the money has been properly spent and whether the regulations have been properly applied, and so forth. And as the hon. member for Kempton Park has already said, that can be done equally well by a private auditor. If hon. members feel that there is an undertaking in the country where a private auditor did not do the work properly, or where an auditor did not do his duty, we could perhaps say that a private firm of auditors did not do its work properly and that it should fall under the Auditor-General. If there are such cases we can say that this should be considered, but I am convinced that not a single case like that can be mentioned here. On the contrary, I want to emphasize it further and say that I am of opinion that where private firms of auditors have been appointed, the work has been done equally well, and then we still have the additional knowledge of the private auditors, so that I contend that in this case the audit can be better done by private auditors because in their profession their training has been such that in this specific case they can give better guidance to the directors in regard to these matters, much better than the staff of the Auditor-General is able to give. They have additional knowledge in regard to marketing and other problems which will be valuable in this regard, and it will be of more value to this House to have a private auditors&#x2019; firm taking care of these matters than to have the Controller and Auditor-General. I therefore hope that the hon. the Minister will not accede to these requests by the Opposition.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) missed the whole point. Nobody has queried the efficiency of public accountants or auditors. I think the hon. member for Sunnyside does not appreciate that if this work is done by the Auditor-General, the subsequent report will come before the Public Accounts Committee and will come before Parliament. If these accounts are audited by private accountants, however, there is no possibility of them coming before Parliament for debate. Nobody is querying the efficiency of public accountants, and as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) said earlier on, the Auditor-General can appoint private accountants and firms of public accountants to do the work on his behalf. They then submit a report to the Auditor-General and the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report will come before Parliament. In Committee we have already passed Clause 10 which provides for the share capital of this company and this share capital will be paid out by the C.S.I.R., and the C.S.I.R. accounts are subject to audit by the Auditor-General, and yet this company which gets its money from the C.S.I.R. will not have accounts which can be debated in Parliament. The whole object of the amendment is to have the accounts audited by the Auditor-General so that they in turn can be dealt with by the Public Accounts Committee and can be debated in Parliament. Far from belittling the work done by public accountants, the whole object of the amendment is to ensure accountability to Parliament so that there can be adequate control of funds voted by Parliament and there can be debate in this House at an appropriate time and we can avoid the difficulties which we have experienced so far with many of these quasi Government companies whose accounts are not being tabled in this House and not debated here and where there is no adequate parliamentary control.</p>

<p>I wonder if the House could persuade the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) to explain to us what he thinks of the new system proposed by the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl). If the system of the hon. member for Sunnyside is pursued to its logical conclusion, we won&#x2019;t need a Public Accounts Committee at all. We shall not need responsibility and accountability to Parliament. The hon. member for Sunnyside is perfectly content with the words &#x201C;private auditors practising outside this House&#x201D;. If that is so why should private auditors not examine the accounts of the hon. Minister of Social Welfare and assure the House that everything is in order? He would not have to trouble about 15 cents or 20 cents as the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) has said. We are emphasizing the fact, Mr. Chairman, as we have said, that we wish to have accountability to Parliament through the Auditor-General and our Public Accounts Committee. And when the hon. member for Sunnyside tells us that the work can be done as well by private auditors practising outside this House, he may be right. But that is not what we want. We want the accountability to be to us, not to the C.S.I.R.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) gave quite a wrong impression of the proposition stated by the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl). The hon. member for Sunnyside referred to this specific institution. What happens here now? Parliament indirectly votes, by making an amount of money available to the C.S.I.R., the share capital of this Corporation. This Corporation then functions further with this share capital. with possible expansions via the C.S.I.R. Parliament does not vote funds <span class="col_1571-1572" refersTo="page_802"/>for this Corporation year after year. It does not appear on our Estimates again. To-day we are debating and deciding as to the desirability of granting R200,000 to this specific undertaking. The argument of hon. members opposite now amounts to this, that the activities of this board of directors of the Corporation which is being established and which in future will operate in terms of the provision of this Bill, and which will not in future receive funds on the annual Estimates, should now be reported to the Public Accounts Committee. What is the function of the Public Accounts Committee? It is to correlate the Acts providing money for various objects with the Treasury regulations in regard to how those funds should be allocated in detail after the funds have been voted&#x2014;to scrutinize that and to see whether the money has been properly spent, and if a mistake has slipped in, to report to this Parliament. What is the relationship between these two functions, if this board of directors operates an independent undertaking; what is the relationship between that financial activity and the voting of funds in this House every year? No, Mr. Chairman, we have here a very false argument. We cannot blame the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) for having a professional love for the functions of the Auditor-General. But he first advanced the argument, and other hon. members as well, that the parent company, the C.S.I.R., is audited by the Auditor-General and therefore it is logical that the subsidiary company should also be audited by the same Auditor-General. Why should that necessarily be so? It is often the most convenient practice, but it is not necessary that the auditor of the subsidiary company should be the same man as the auditor for the parent company. It is a question of convenient practice, but here it is being advanced as a logical argument.</p>

<p>And, finally, in regard to parliamentary control, I want to point out that these accounts and the report have to be tabled. If in the opinion of any hon. member something wrong has taken place in the running of this Corporation, it can be raised in the Budget debate, the first Budget debate after the report has been tabled. It can be discussed fully here. Other ways may even be found for discussing it if it is a serious matter, perhaps by means of a motion moved by a private member. But the matter can be discussed. Here we are not giving up any parliamentary control over funds voted by Parliament. We are simply dealing here with a rational arrangement for the further administration of an undertaking which had a specific object outside the ordinary course of State administration.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down rather indicated that the hon. member for Kensington had misunderstood the hon. member for Sunnyside. All I can say is that I think the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) has misunderstood the whole concept of public audit. We, Sir, are concerned here with the prerogative of Parliament. The hon. member for Kempton Park now reduces this prerogative of Parliament to less than a formality. He suggests that all the information that you want will be there and that the supervision and investigation which takes the Public Accounts Committee practically throughout the whole session, can be done in this House. If there was one wise rule it was the rule of practice that the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report should not be discussed in this House. It is examined by a Select Committee which then reports to this House. Can you imagine the confusion that would arise, Sir, if the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report had to be discussed and debated in this House. What we have had this afternoon indicates what a shambles it really would be. There is complete misunderstanding of the purpose of this audit. It is to preserve the prerogative of Parliament and nothing else. That is what it is for and to reduce it to this sort of formality, which both the hon. member for Sunnyside and the hon. member for Kempton Park are trying to do, is wrong. I hope the hon. the Minister will not be guided by them. The hon. the Minister has at least served as the chairman of a Public Accounts Committee and he at least knows the value of the spade work that is done by a Select Committee of this House. All we are asking is that same very wise arrangement should prevail and that the reports on the audit of these accounts should also go to that same body to be examined in the same way. That body is the agent of Parliament and they should examine those reports and bring to the notice of Parliament those aspects which should be brought to our notice. I hope the hon. the Minister will not be persuaded by his two colleagues</p>

<p>I cannot allow this important debate to die without saying a few words. It seems to me that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) is quite right in saying that hon. members opposite do not understand the underlying importance of what we are discussing now. This is not a case of the books of account of a subsidiary company being examined by one of two kinds of auditors. This goes to the very roots of the establishment of Parliament itself. Parliament was originally established so that it could control the Executive by having control of the expenditure of money. Any Executive, whether it be the King or the President (or through the President, the Cabinet), need moneys, supplies, to conduct the business of the State. We in turn say that we will not give them those moneys until they do this, that or the other. We impose conditions, and must see that they are observed. In our modern state the handling of finances has become increasingly complex and as a result, about half-way through the last century a parliamentary select committee was established which checked, on our behalf, the public expenditure of money voted by Parliament to the Executive. It does not, as the hon. member seems to suggest, examine in detail the <span class="col_1573-1574" refersTo="page_803"/>whole expenditure of the State. That task would be beyond their capacity. So we have created another piece of machinery. We have an Auditor and Controller-General who reports. The Public Accounts Committee only examines those items and those expenditures which are brought to their attention by the Controller and Auditor-General. If this process were not followed the financial workings both of the Public Accounts Committee and this House would be quite impossible. We wish to preserve this. We say that if public money is voted, if we hand over, for expenditure, to any public body, moneys voted by this Parliament, the taxpayers&#x2019; money, some form of parliamentary control should be exercised. That control must be exercised by Parliament. Parliament&#x2019;s usual instrument to exercise that control is the Public Accounts Committee. If those hon. gentlemen only realized that they were doing something to preserve the sovereignty of Parliament by keeping control by this House over the Executive through control of expenditure, then they would know what they were talking about. But the hon. member over there quite clearly does not understand the underlying principles of what he is arguing &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should like to raise a few points in regard to this matter. The hon. member who has just sat down spoke about the control of this institution. It is an amount of R200,000, which is not a large amount. The expenditure incurred by this Corporation will be scrutinized by a private auditor. But the control about which they are so concerned is in fact eventually exercised by the parent body. I cannot see why those hon. members are so concerned about the expenditure, because the board of directors of the C.S.I.R. can also exercise control over the subsidiary company, and in that way they also indirectly control the finances. If the hon. members insist that it should resort under the Auditor-General, they should remember that this is not an annual expenditure. Why is the Opposition then not concerned about the other expenditures which are voted annually by this House in large amounts and which are not audited by the Auditor-General?</p>

<p>There are amounts much larger than this. There are the I.D.C. and the subsidies paid to the Provincial Councils, which are further distributed to the local government bodies, etc. Why do they not suggest that the Auditor-General should also audit private businesses? Surely the revenue of the State is derived from private businesses. Here they are concerned about a small amount which is paid out only once, but they are not concerned about the globular revenue of the State, viz. businesses, the mines, etc., which have to provide that revenue. Why do they not suggest that the Auditor-General should audit those businesses also? Mr. Chairman, I think they want to take this matter too far. It is quite a good thing that the Auditor-General should have a finger in the pie in so far as State expenditure is concerned. We should just take care that we do not take the matter too far, and I feel that hon. members opposite seek to go too far.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this matter of public or semi-public bodies being responsible to the Select Committee on Public Accounts has often been discussed in this House. We are familiar with these suggestions which come from the other side of the House every year, just as we also know that nobody has ever come along with a well-considered scheme which will satisfy everybody or which will solve all the problems in this regard. I therefore stand by what I said during the second reading of this Bill, that until we can find a general pattern into which all these semi-public bodies can fit, I am not prepared to make an exception in this particular case. I know that there is much merit in what hon. members opposite say, but neither I nor hon. members opposite have ever discovered a method by which all these private bodies or semi-State corporations can be included in one general rule in regard to auditing and responsibility to Parliament. If one day we can find a pattern which is satisfactory and which can solve all these problems, then we can throw them all into one basket. It is a fact that large institutions like the I.D.C., K.O.P., Foscor, Fiscor, and Sasol are all audited by private auditors. Their financial reports are tabled here every year, and those reports can be discussed in this House every year. In fact, they are discussed. They are not sent to the Public Accounts Committee, but are discussed here. Hon. members know very well how year after year there were lengthy discussions on Sasol, with reference to the accounts which Sasol tabled here. It is therefore not correct to say that Parliament has no control, because it has the right to discuss these public bodies. But what is the reason why the accounts of Sasol, Fiscor, Foscor and the K.O.P. can be audited by private auditors and that the accounts do not go to the Select Committee on Public Accounts? I <span class="col_1575-1576" refersTo="page_804"/>think there must be a reason for it. I think the reason is that these bodies are quite different from those bodies for which Parliament votes money every year and which therefore appear in the revenue and expenditure accounts. Here we are dealing with business corporations in which the State has invested capital. It is not the same as in the case of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or the Department of Public Works for which Parliament votes certain sums every year, various sums on various Votes, and where it is the duty of the auditor to see to it that the money voted for those Departments are spent in a certain way in that year by those Departments. It is quite a different matter when a capital amount is voted for an undertaking once only.</p>

But it is a capital contribution which is made once only, and that is the end of it.</p>

<p>There is also another element. These bodies like Sasol, K.O.P., Fiscor and Foscor, etc., are business undertakings, and when one deals with business undertakings one is often dealing with matters of a confidential nature which cannot be discussed in the public forum of the House of Assembly, and not even in the Public Accounts Committee which has to report to this House.

<p>I shall come to that point in a moment. In regard to these corporations, one has to do with possible competition. Take, for example, a body like Sasol, which is concerned with the chemical industry. Are there not many of its affairs which a competitor would like to know about?</p>

<p>The Department of Defence is a Department of State which is directly represented in Parliament by a Minister. It is quite different from Iscor or Sasol. I say I think we should be quite satisfied that where a capital amount is granted once to a body, that body will more or less become a business body. In this case this body is going to work with patents which are often of a confidential nature.</p>

<p>The control boards are all bodies established by the State in terms of an Act passed by the State. This body will be a subsidiary body of another body, i.e. the C.S.I.R., which is controlled by the State. The C.S.I.R. is in fact controlled by the State. It is responsible to this Parliament. This body will be responsible to the C.S.I.R. and therefore the State, through the C.S.I.R., has access to the expenditure of its funds by that corporation. I think hon. members must agree that it is going too far to ask that this body should also be directly responsible to the Select Committee on Public Accounts, and therefore to Parliament. The annual reports will be tabled here and hon. members will have opportunity enough, if they so wish, to discuss those reports here. I eagerly look forward to the years that lie ahead and I should like to see in three, four or five years&#x2019; time how many times hon. members opposite make use of the opportunity to discuss this body in this House. I am sorry, but I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Fifth Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for second reading,&#x2014;Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Amendment Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Health, adjourned on 22 February, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>When this Bill came before the House earlier, I expressed regret that so little time had been given to us to consider it. I want once again to emphasize the fact that on a Bill like this, which is largely technical and which involves a great number of interests and a great number of people, and which also brings some degree of conflict or agreement to different professions both of whom are concerned with the life and the health of the people of the country, we should be given much more time to give consideration to this type of work and in order to try to avoid, if possible, any disagreement.</p>

<p>This is a Bill which is particularly important because it introduces principles into the practice of pharmacy which did not exist before. It breaks new ground completely and I do not think these things should be accepted easily and without a good deal of consideration, nor should we carry on with a Bill like this without being given the opportunity of consulting those people who are affected by it. Personally, in this case I will deal only with one of the principles involved and leave the remainder to my colleagues. I want to deal particularly with the question of the admission to practice in this country of people who, in the ordinary course of events, would not be acceptable to the Pharmaceutical Board. This is a principle which, as I said before, is completely new and I think we must ask the Minister particularly to justify this complete <i>volte face.</i> A similar matter occurred before the Medical Council some years ago and presented great difficulty, but it was finally overcome. There were, however, in the case of the Medical Council, very definite reasons why this change was called for, and I find it difficult without further information to appreciate why this should be brought to pass also in the pharmaceutical profession. In the medical profession we have scientists who come out and wish to work in our institutions and they carry on scientific research, very often research which of great value to us. We have peculiar conditions here, like parasites which do not exist in other countries. We have a population which lends itself easily to research, and therefore we are sought after by other countries. But I would take a good deal of convincing that this is necessary in the case of the pharmaceutical profession. In the case of the medical profession, it became necessary to register these people because only registered medical men can have contact with patients. Any ordinary person who claims to be a doctor is committing an offence if he has to do with the public. Therefore under very strict precautions the Medical Council agreed that this should be done and persuaded the Legislature to give effect to it.</p>

<p>But the contact of the pharmaceutical profession with the public is limited more or less to the supply of drugs and I fail to see why under those circumstances this should be brought to pass. It is said in this Bill that these people will be brought in only for educational and scientific purposes. Let us take each separately.</p>

<p>In the educational field we have found that there has been a shortage of highly trained medical men to carry on the educational work of the country in medicine, but there is extraordinarily little educational work carried out in the pharmaceutical field which cannot be dealt with by the average pharmacist. There is not a great deal of it. The technical institutions and the universities already contain faculties or departments which work in this field and I cannot see that in the purely educational field there can be a great call for these people.</p>

<p>We come, therefore, to the scientific field. Now, in the scientific field there is some reason for appreciating that there might be highly trained people who cannot otherwise be brought to the country because they do not have registerable qualifications. But in the scientific field, in pharmacy, there can be no reason for not employing these people in universities. There is no tie-down on the universities <span class="col_1579-1580" refersTo="page_806"/>or on the technical colleges. Everyone who has the knowledge can be employed, and there is no reason why he should be registered to supply drugs and chemicals to the public. It is said that these people will be required to handle habit-forming drugs, perhaps, which can only be handled by a chemist and pharmacist. That is a detail which can be easily overcome without giving these people the broad right to be registered as pharmacists and chemists.</p>

<p>Another factor which this brings into the picture is this point which worries me more than anything else, and that is that there is a habit among industrialists and commercial people in general, who work on a large scale, people like motor assemblers and those who have engineering works, to bring into the country as their head man, as their managing director or as their chairman, people from foreign countries. Now I see no reason why they should not do it if they wish to in ordinary commerce, but there are now establishing themselves in this country pharmaceutical manufacturers, people who are really bottlers more than anything else, and this, I believe, could be used as a backdoor for replacing our people, our own qualified men and women by foreigners in positions of responsibility. Therefore I would like to ask the Minister particularly to give us some information as to the safeguards he is going to apply.</p>

<p>Lastly, I ask myself, although I do not wish to mix in colour problems, whether this is perhaps not another backdoor for the supply op pharmacists and chemists to the non-White areas. It is very easy to stretch the description of a scientific institution. It is even easy at times to speak of an educational institution, and there is a grave shortage, and in fact a complete absence, of pharmacists in 90 per cent of the non-White areas. Is this not a backdoor by which our people will again he pushed out of their profession, and this is not an easy profession to which to gain entrance? Our people may be unemployed, while others, to suit the purposes of different people, could be employed. This is not a clause which I think we should accept without a great deal of reserve and without very clear information from the Minister as to how he is going to safeguard our own people.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has spoken is himself a member of the Medical and Dental Council, and there is no doubt that he has done a great deal in past years to raise the standard of medicine in South Africa, and one of the ways that the Council undoubtedly use is to exercise control over people who come to South Africa to practise here. I can understand therefore why he feels so strongly that in pharmacy, too. in which the standard is particularly high to-day in comparison with other countries, we must make sure that the opportunity is not created for persons to come and practise in South Africa as chemists and druggists when they have not undergone the requisite training and, secondly, that they do not perhaps endanger the position of our chemists and druggists. I share the hon. member&#x2019;s view that, as he put it, we should not open a backdoor for such people. But I do not think he is entirely right in his interpretation of the intention of this clause. This amendment in Clause 2 states perfectly clearly that can only happen on the recommendation of the Pharmacy Board. The Pharmacy Board are the very people who watch over the interests of the chemists and druggists, and under this clause no person will be able to come to South Africa in the future except on the recommendation of the Pharmacy Board, and it is only thereafter that the State President will be able to make it possible for that person to come. But the matter does not end there either. There is a whole series of provisos whereby this legislation, and we as a Parliament, seek to ensure that we do not open a backdoor here. Not only does the Board make a recommendation to the State President, but after that recommendation has been made, certain regulations are prescribed and promulgated by the State President in respect of such persons; and apart from that it is specifically provided in this clause that such persons may only practise as chemists and druggists under certain circumstances. The clause contains four provisions. The first is that such persons can only practise for an initial period not exceeding five years, and thereafter for such period or periods as the Board may decide, and the body which looks after the interests of chemists and druggists is the Pharmacy Board. In other words, such persons are not given the right to come to South Africa and to practise here for the rest of their lives. The period is limited to five years and thereafter the matter will come up for review from time to time by the Pharmacy Board. Secondly, they are limited to an area or areas and, thirdly, they are also limited in respect of their professional activities. It is perfectly clear to me that it was felt that it was essential to introduce this clause by reason of the fact that there are people who, while they cannot be registered as chemists and druggists in South Africa, can nevertheless be a great asset in the training of chemists and druggists. This clause really makes provision for a method whereby the standard of pharmacy can be raised in South Africa and the number of available chemists and druggists increased, and I really feel that in this clause we have so many provisos and that we are laying down so many requirements that there is not the slightest possibility that a person will be able to come and practise as a chemist and druggist in South Africa unless the Board and the State President are convinced that it is a special case for which provision should be made in the interest of pharmacy. I just want to emphasize again that we go even further and that we do not leave this in the hands of the Pharmacy Board only but that we have three specific provisos in this clause in respect of the period and the area and the professional activities. I do feel therefore that this clause <span class="col_1581-1582" refersTo="page_807"/>does not contain the dangers visualized by the hon. member. I say again that I fully share his concern about lowering the standards of chemists and druggists in South Africa, and I shall always endorse his attitude that we must not lower the standards, but I do not think that there is anything in this clause that will have the effect of lowering the standard of pharmacy. On the contrary, I think it is intended as an aid to make people available for the training of chemists and druggists, people who can raise the standard, and unless this clause is on the Statute Book it will not be possible for them to render those services.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I really rose to talk about a different aspect of this Bill, and that is the clause which deals with Section 56<i>bis</i> of the principal Act. It deals mainly with potentially harmful drugs. This is an intricate matter. and although this is a short Bill it is a very important matter, not only as far as the medical profession or pharmacy is concerned, but also as far as the public is concerned. You will therefore permit me, Sir, to say a word or two to show what this really deals with. One must be very careful here not to confuse the various drugs which can only be obtained on prescription by a medical practitioner. It is in the interests of the public to place certain restrictions on the sale of certain drugs. Let me mention just three types of drugs to emphasize the distinction as far as this clause is concerned. This clause deals with poisonous drugs, habit-forming drugs and potentially harmful drugs.</p>

<p>No argument has been advanced in this debate in respect of poisonous drugs as such, because it stands to reason that they must be controlled, and as far as habit-forming drugs are concerned we all agree that it may create a great problem if the public is allowed to obtain these drugs without any restrictions. It would create not only moral and social problems but also serious health problems. But when it comes to potentially harmful drugs, then we are dealing with a rather different matter. This is also proved by the fact that it was not originally visualized in the legislation of 1928. The first time that a provision in this regard was inserted in the Act was in 1954, in Act No. 29. which was later amended by Act No. 11 of 1957, to which I shall come back later. Potentially harmful drugs are those drugs which are not normally harmful but which may have undesirable physical effects in unusual circumstances or when taken in excessive quantities. Usually these drugs have no harmful effect but they may have a very harmful effect when taken in unusual health circumstances or in large quantities. If it were possible to obtain these drugs without prescription it would definitely be a great danger to the public, but that would apply only to a small group of persons. Generally speaking people would be able to use these drugs without any harmful effects, but it is this small group of people that we have to consider. When this legislation was introduced in 1954 we provided for this in Section 56<i>bis.</i> We made very sure that people who needed these drugs every day would not be restricted, and this was stated very clearly in Section 4 particularly. Restrictions were placed on the acquisition of potentially harmful drugs as far as the public was concerned, but it was stated perfectly clearly that no prescription would be needed by a medical practitioner, dentist, authorized veterinarian or chemist and druggist, or anybody trading outside the Union as a wholesale chemist and druggist, or a responsible medical officer of a hospital or other institution used exclusively for the admission of sick persons. In other words, no restrictions are placed on persons who should not be subject to restrictions. Similarly in 1957 a fourth group of persons was added, persons or organizations who have been authorized in writing by the Secretary for Health to obtain such medicine for scientific, research or educational purposes. I say again that no restrictions apply to persons who find it necessary to use these drugs; the restrictions apply only to the general public. But these restrictions were imposed together with fairly stringent instructions. Such a drug cannot be given to a person except on prescription from a medical practitioner but that prescription must set out a whole series of things such as the date, the person&#x2019;s name and address, the name of the medical practitioner, his signature and his qualifications. In practice it has been found that this causes very many problems, and this legislation is designed to make it easier in practice to make these drugs available, but without losing control over the supply of these drugs. We have now had these provisions for seven years, and it would appear that to a certain extent some of these provisions have operated unfairly. One is faced with this problem that quite a number of chemists and druggists have had charges preferred against them. These are not imaginary problems. In the second half of 1960 the prescriptions for potentially harmful drugs, which are kept in custody by chemists and druggists, were examined and the chemists and druggists concerned were charged because of defects in those prescriptions. If there is any defect in such a prescription, the chemist and druggist is held responsible for it, and he can be charged and sentenced for it. We find that admissions of guilt were signed involving fines of more than R1,200 in certain cases, and I understand that there are various cases of this kind which are still pending. Since that is the position, I want to point out&#x2014;and I do this because I think it is necessary that this House should go into this matter thoroughly and that we should have a reply from the Minister&#x2014;that a prosecution instituted against a chemist and druggist creates enormous problems for him. I want to quote just one paragraph from the Bill that we have before us, or let me rather read out the original section first. It is stated very clearly in Act 29 of 1954 that a potentially harmful drug can only be supplied on a prescription presented to the chemist and druggist, provided there appears on it the date of issue of the prescription. the name and address of the patient or, in the case of a prescription <span class="col_1583-1584" refersTo="page_808"/>given by an authorized veterinarian, the name and address of the person to whom the drug is to be supplied; thirdly, the name and quantity of the drug to be supplied, the number of times and the intervals at which the prescription may be dispensed and, except in the case of a preparation intended for internal use, the amount and frequency of each dose to be taken; and, fourthly, the usual signature, address and professional qualifications of the person who issued the prescription. In this clause which we now have before us a certain amount of relief is given by the insertion of the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that where the medical practitioner, dentist or authorized veterinarian who issued the prescription has omitted to insert thereon the address of the patient or person as aforesaid, such address may be inserted by the person by whom the prescription is dispensed.</block>

<p>In other words, where the medical practitioner has omitted to write in the name of the patient the chemist and druggist may do so. Now, as far as the date is concerned, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not perhaps give his attention to the question of allowing the date to be inserted also, because it can very easily happen that the medical practitioner omits to fill in the date on such a prescription. The chemist and druggist has the right to fill in the address of the person himself, but if the date does not appear on it he has to send the prescription back to the medical practitioner and this, of course, raises the whole question of principle of the function of the chemist and druggist <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the medical practitioner. As the legislation now reads, the chemist and druggist practically has to sit in judgment on the medical practitioner. I do not want to go into the question as to whether that is right or wrong, but it does create practical problems. What happens in practice is this: the patient comes to the chemist and druggist with his prescription; the chemist and druggist now has to tell the patient that the medical practitioner has given him a wrong prescription although the only defect may be the absence of the date; and since we are bringing about this very good change here that the address may now be written in by the chemist and druggist, it may perhaps also be advisable to consider whether he should not also be allowed to enter the date on the prescription as well as the address.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to one further point, and that is that we are now putting it very clearly in this new proposed section that where a prescription has been issued for a potentially harmful drug, it will only be valid for a single issue of that potentially harmful drug. But it is also laid down in the original legislation that all prescriptions which are presented to the chemist and druggist must be retained for at least three years. Section 20 of the principal Act provides in sub-section 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person by whom a prescription referred to in sub-section (1) is dispensed for the last time according to the particulars to be set forth therein in terms of sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (c) of sub-section (1). shall retain such prescription for a period of not less than three years as from the date on which it is so dispensed for the last time.</block>

<p>In other words, all these prescriptions&#x2014;and there are thousands of them must be retained for three years by the chemist and druggist who dispensed the prescription. In practice it works this way that chemists and druggists usually have to submit these prescriptions, particularly to sick funds, etc., in order to receive payment, and the chemist and druggist is obliged therefore to make a copy of every prescription presented to him. The object iin fact is to have as few as possible of these copies because these things may lie about and if they fall into the hands of patients they can get as many potential harmful drugs as they like. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to bring about a change here because the fact of the matter is that it creates an enormous problem for the chemist and druggist when he is required to make a copy of each of these prescriptions and to retain them for three years. There are other stipulations under which the chemist and druggist has to keep a record of prescriptions, and I was wondering whether it would not result in an improvement in the practice if we amended this clause in some way or another in the Committee Stage. I feel that here we are placing a burden on the shoulders of the chemist and druggist and that perhaps we could relieve him of this burden. I am very grateful for the fact that we have this legislation before us, because I think you will agree with me, Sir, that this Bill shows very clearly that the hon. the Minister is making a very serious attempt to remove these minor practical difficulties which confront both the chemist and druggist and the medical profession. This to no easy task. We have had seven years&#x2019; experience of this and I think many years will still have to elapse before we will be able to iron out every difficulty. but this is definitely a very great improvement in comparison with the situation as we have known it over the past seven years.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>It would appear to me in going through this Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Amendment Bill that the theme underlying this Bill is to provide for the shortages in personnel which have arisen in our country over the years. We find throughout the Bill, a tendency to attempt to ease the present situation and secondly to bring into the profession of pharmacy unqualified people who have not been recognized previously. It seems to me that the introduction of these people is motivated by one reason only, and that is to overcome the difficulties that have arisen in providing sufficient personnel throughout the country and also to combat the accidents of prescription-writing which occur due to rush.</p>

<p><span class="col_1585-1586" refersTo="page_809"/>Sir, I have gone through this Bill and I find that there are one or two things which need very careful probing before I can agree to the second reading, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a very satisfactory reply on these points. I feel that in introducing this Bill he is acting sincerely, after due consultation, but those of us who have not had the opportunity of consulting with other people find these amendments a little difficult to understand. Firstly, I want to say immediately that the apprentice pharmacist who we knew in the old days, the man who used to come into the profession and start his education with the chemist, complete his apprenticeship with the chemist and augment his practical knowledge by theory taught at university or a technical college, should have full recognition. Then I am a little mystified about new terms which are used in the Bill. We find that we are now going to recognize unqualified assistants and pharmaceutical technicians. I have gone through the Act as it stands, and the definition of &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; is still a little vague to me. Perhaps I do not understand it properly. I would like to know whether &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; means a person who has passed, say, one or two examinations but not his final examination, or does it mean a person who has worked for a pharmacist or a druggist behind the counter for a number of years and has never become qualified? Those are two different things and they are both unqualified assistants. The one has made an attempt to become qualified and the other one has not made an attempt to qualify. They both stand behind the counter; neither of them has a degree, and I do not know which of these two groups is going to be accepted. Is the girl who stands behind the counter and sells cosmetics or helps to wrap medicines going to be classified as an unqualified assistant; is the period of her service in the chemist shop going to be recognized; or does &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; mean a person who is a duly registered apprentice who may or may not have passed his examination over a period of years and who still works for the chemist without any qualification? Not only do I want to know to which of these two groups the term &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; refers but I should also like to know what type of work this unqualified assistant is going to be allowed to do. It is terribly important &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely not prescriptions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. It is terribly important because if this unqualified assistant is going to be allowed the right to dispense, then obviously it becomes unnecessary for him to qualify, and the owner of the chemist shop will then naturally be able to get the services of an unqualified assistant to help him to do the dispensing at a much lower rate of pay than he would have to pay to a qualified assistant. I would like to know whether or not these unqualified assistants, when they are recognized, are going to be entitled to do certain types of work and whether the Minister in consultation with the Pharmacy Board is going to prescribe by regulation what an unqualified assistant may do and what he may not do, and how he is going to indicate to the lay person who is an unqualified assistant and who is not an unqualified assistant.</p>

<p>Then we come to the pharmaceutical technician and here we have a term being used which again is not defined. The Minister has given us no definition of a &#x201C;pharmaceutical technician &#x201D;, nor has he set out, either in a White Paper or any second reading speech, what type of work a pharmaceutical technician is going to do. If he is going to work in a factory and pull the lever of a machine that dispenses pills, then I do not see any reason for registering that type of person, but if he is going to measure out very carefully, dangerous drugs, then it may be necessary to have these people registered and placed under some form of control. But as the Bill reads we are going to accept a series of terms which are quite meaningless. There is no definition of those terms in this Bill or in the Act, and I would like the Minister to tell us this afternoon when he replies what he means by an &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; and by a &#x201C;pharmaceutical technician&#x201D; and what work these people are going to be allowed to do in the pharmaceutical profession.</p>

<p>To come to paragraph (2), here we are going to deal with people who come to us from overseas. They will either come here by invitation or because of desire on their own part to settle in this country. I understand that they will have to be assured of work before they come here. On the face of it, it would seem that the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. A. Radford) is quite right when he says that these people will be imported primarily by industrialists for their own technical work. But the Bill also says that they may be brought in for educational and scientific research and they will be allowed to work in these institutions. Sir, if a man is entitled to teach pharmacy, if he knows how to demonstrate all the intricacies of pharmacy, if he knows how to lecture in a university, why should he not be able to dispense in his own shop? If he is unqualified to do these things in a shop, how can he be said to be qualified to do it in a university or a technical college? I do not follow the logic of this at all. <b>I</b> do not know why a man should be allowed to go to, say, Stellenbosch University and teach students how to be good pharmacists and yet not be allowed to be a pharmacist himself if he so wishes. But these people are being brought into the country and I say that they must be given an opportunity to remain in this country to work here. I should hate to see them stay here for five years and then leave us, especially if they are good people. I say that we must make provision for these people to be given the opportunity of attaining the necessary qualifications in this country. The whole thing seems topsy-turvy to me if we are going to ask these people to attain qualifications <span class="col_1587-1588" refersTo="page_810"/>which they in turn are teaching students to attain. [Interjection.] Sir, I am not concerned whether they are teaching one subject or a complete course. If people are specialists in one particular course in pharmacy, then surely they have already taken the course in pharmacy. On the other hand I do not expect a man who has a B.Sc. and who knows organic chemistry only to be recognized as a pharmacist, but I say that if he has been a pharmacist overseas and has come here and is teaching a subject in pharmacy at one of our universities, he should be given the opportunity to attain those standards which we require for registration in this country. Sir, we have a terrible shortage of personnel throughout the pharmacy world in South Africa. We have not got enough personnel in the towns; we have not got enough personnel in the universities; we have not got enough personnel in the technical colleges, and outside of the towns pharmacists are almost non-existent. During the last Budget debate I pointed out that we did not have a single pharmacist in some of the reserves, and I am hoping that perhaps by this means we will be able to attract some people to come and work for us in those areas which are not attractive to our own South Africans. I do not know why that should be so, but we do find that there is a lack of attraction in the reserves for qualified people. I know the difficulties that have arisen in the past. Chemists have told me that they cannot make a living in the reserves because of the practice of the doctors there to dispense their own medicine. That happens in many cases. But I feel that if we did have the opportunity of establishing proper clinics&#x2014;not the type of clinic that I read about to-day; 300 clinics in reserves which are manned by medical aids, with an occasional district surgeon visiting them; I do not mean that sort of thing; I mean proper medical clinics in the reserves&#x2014;those clinics will have to be built in such a way that they have proper dispensaries attached to them, and it is there that these people will have an opportunity of practising the dispensing part of pharmacy.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about the difficulties that have arisen in the prescribing of medicine by doctors and the difficulties that chemists have with prescriptions that they receive from medical practitioners. In terms of this Bill it is not going to be as necessary in the future as it was in the past to take certain precautions. These precautions have been provided for for two purposes, firstly, to protect a chemist who dispenses the prescription and secondly to protect the patient. The difficulty of a date on the prescription can easily be overcome. I think it should be obligatory for every prescription to be date-stamped by the chemist on the date of dispensing. If the date of dispensing is stamped on that prescription by the chemist, then it is not always necessary for the doctor to have to receive the prescription back for the purpose of putting a date on it. But I think the name and address of the doctor must be indicated on the prescription. If it is too much trouble to write out a long address on the prescription, then I think the telephone number of the doctor should always be put on the prescription. These are difficulties which I think can easily be overcome, but I do feel that they need sorting out.</p>

<p>Now I want to say a word about the dispensing by doctors of samples which are given to them by companies. One of the things in my opinion that causes the price of medicines to soar is the almost unnatural dispensing of samples to doctors. Every day we have literally tens of representatives of chemical companies visiting doctors who give the doctors extravagant hand-outs of drugs. Some of these drugs, such as antibiotics and cortisone, are very expensive. It has been said that some of the doctors sell these samples to the patients. I have never seen it happen but I have heard about it. I do know, however, what does happen, and that is that very often the doctor hands the package unmarked to a patient and tells him to use it. The directions on these packages are not always clear&#x2014;and here I refer to the amendment which deals with labelling. I have seen packages marked, say, &#x201C;250 milligrams three times a day&#x201D;. The drug is put up in a capsule containing 250 milligrams. The patient does not know that a capsule contains 200 milligrams, and I have known a patient to go back to the doctor and say, &#x201C;doctor, you told me to take 250 milligrams three times a day &#x201D;, thinking that each capsule is only 1 milligram, &#x201C;but there are only six in the bottle; what do I do? Do I just take the six that you have given me?&#x201D;</p>

<p>I can tell you that because of that accidents have already taken place. It happens time and again that a doctor will hand a patient a bottle of unmarked drugs, and I think that if the hand-out has to come from the doctor, then that sample should be properly marked and properly labelled. Some of the companies are putting on a label at the moment, a label which can be attached to the bottle, but this rarely happens. I want to ask the Minister to be particularly careful to see that samples are properly marked when they are handed out for dispensing and handed out to the patient.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to say a word about repeat prescriptions. I feel that here we should be careful when it comes to habit-forming drugs. I think the Minister should lay down that no habit-forming drugs shall be repeated more than once on a prescription and that a fresh prescription should be handed to the patient by the doctor if it becomes necessary.</p>

<p>I said that I was dealing with habit-forming drugs. I have known drug addicts to come to a doctor, get a prescription, go to a chemist, have the medicine dispensed, go to another doctor on the same day, get another prescription, go to another chemist and get the medicine dispensed. These people make a full round of chemists in the district to get a series of prescriptions dispensed from different doctors, and then they return a few days later and do the same thing all over again. Once that has happened and they think they are under suspicion they start having prescriptions dispensed in different districts. These people pay anything for a prescription; they go to all sorts of extremes to get these prescriptions dispensed. I feel that no doctor should give a prescription and order it to be repeated more than once. If it should come back again, then the doctor will immediately know that there is something suspicious and he could then investigate the matter on his own.</p>

<p>I do not want to keep the House any longer but I want to say to the Minister that we put forward these criticisms in a spirit of cooperation. I feel that this Bill, although it appears to be a simple one, is riddled with practical difficulties, and I hope that he will be able to deal with the suggestions we have made to him this afternoon and give us an adequate reply.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. I. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think we are making this Bill unnecessarily complicated. The hon. member who has just sat down, has referred to people who themselves are not qualified chemists and druggists training others as chemists and druggists in the one or other direction. That happens daily. He says he thinks it improbable that people will work in educational institutions who are not qualified chemists and druggists and he asks how they can be allowed to practise at a later stage. He says it is peculiar that they are able to train people as chemists and druggists and that they only have the opportunity after that to practise. It sounds illogical to him that people who themselves are not chemists and druggists are used to train chemists and druggists. I want to tell him that I think he is making it unnecessarily complicated, because that happens in all professions. It even happens in his own profession. There are people who train doctors who themselves are not doctors and who would not be allowed to practise as doctors because they are not qualified. It happens in the medical profession and it happens in every profession. It happens in the engineering profession, for example. It is not necessarily only engineers who train other engineers. It happens in the chemical profession and it happens daily in the pharmacy profession. In order to qualify chemists and druggists have to take many courses at a university which are not pharmacy courses. I am thinking of chemistry, for example. The person who lectures on chemistry at a university to people who are being trained as chemists and druggists, is not necessarily a chemist and druggist, because usually a chemist and druggist does not know sufficient chemistry to lecture on it. With the result that you often find a person giving lectures to students on chemistry at a university, although he himself cannot practise as a chemist and druggist, because he is not a trained chemist and druggist. Neither should he be given that opportunity nor would he care to have the opportunity to qualify as a chemist and druggist at a later stage because he has a profession of his own. You should not think, therefore, that because somebody trains chemists and druggists, that should entitle him to qualify as a chemist and druggist. That is the one point. The other point I want to touch upon is that raised by the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford), which also appeared to me to have been somewhat unnecessarily complicated. His argument is that persons who have come to this country and who have done certain work here, research work or work at institutions, should not of necessity be allowed to register as chemists and druggists. He mentioned certain types of persons, assistants etc. and he posed the question whether we would care to have them as chemists and druggists or not. One of his objections against the Bill is that those people are perhaps not capable and ought never to become members of the profession. In this connection I also want to say that the matter is not as complicated as all that. It has already happened in the medical profession that certain people who are not as well qualified as our South African medical practitioners have been allowed, on the recommendation of the Medical Board, to register in South Africa as medical practitioners. The hon. member for Durban (North) shakes his head, but I can even give him the names of certain people, if he wants to have them. It rests with the Medical Board and it is the profession, therefore, that supervises that and the profession will ensure that nobody is registered who is not sufficiently qualified to practise as a medical practitioner or a doctor in our country. As far as these people are concerned who are now supposedly applying after having served for years in the pharmaceutical industry and who may perhaps have had the opportunity of doing pharmacy work for years, possibly in hospitals, as is often the case, I feel that when those people apply for registration on the strength of the knowledge that they have acquired, they should be given the opportunity to do so. It is not the State President who has to decide whether such a person may become a chemist and druggist and may be registered as such. His name, together with his qualifications, his experience and all the details in respect of what he has done, are first of all submitted to the Pharmacy Board and the members of the Pharmacy Board are professional people capable of deciding whether such a person should be allowed to register. In that case, too, it seems to me that the profession is so clearly and adequately protected. as in the case of the medical profession, that <span class="col_1591-1592" refersTo="page_812"/>there is no danger of anything going wrong. In that event we have this advantage in present-day circumstances that people enter the country who can assist us in developing our pharmacy industry in this country, whilst the profession remains protected. Those people will not necessarily ever become chemists and druggists, or if they do, we can be sure that they would be capable because the Pharmacy Board would seed them carefully. If no doubt exists as to their qualifications, the Board may say that they are sufficiently qualified to become registered as chemists and druggists.</p>

<p>The final point I want to make is in respect of the remarks of the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet). There too, in terms of the provisions of the Act, the medical practitioner has to do certain things when he issues a prescription. We are now told that if they do not comply with those requirements, the chemist and druggist should be allowed to fill in certain things. Nobody finds fault with the few examples which he gave, but he advanced a peculiar argument, namely that if the chemist and druggist dispensed a prescription which was incomplete, the chemist and druggist was responsible for it and the chemist and druggist was the person who would have to pay if damages were claimed. If you want to change the law, Sir, change it in such a way that the chemist and druggist will be able to recover the money from the doctor, because he is the person who originally made the mistake. But if the information that has to appear on the prescription is essential in terms of the requirements of the Medical Council, I do not think the position of the doctor should be made easy in that he may omit to comply with those requirements and that the chemist and druggist should then correct it.</p>

<p>The hon. member was not here when the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark spoke. His argument was that if the chemist and druggist were allowed to make the correction, it seemed as though the chemist and druggist was more important than the doctor. I agree with that argument. In that case it seems as though the chemist and druggist is controlling what the doctor has done. The hon. member said that he was not anxious to have that and that was why in the case that he mentioned the chemist and druggist also had to pay the damages claimed, I think &#x00A3;600. The point I want to make is this: That if he is not satisfied with that, we should ensure that the doctor complies with the requirements of the law, and if he fails to do so, the chemist and druggist should either not dispense it or he should be allowed to dispense it and then recover the costs from the medical practitioner who had failed to comply with the requirements.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>First of all, I should like to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister in that he has made provision for this Bill to come before Parliament at such an early stage during this Session. In his speech at the second reading, the hon. the Minister referred to the fact that the Bill had been brought forward as a result of certain recommendations which had been placed before him by the South African Pharmacy Board. I am sorry in one respect, namely that certain recommendations which have been on the stocks, as it were, for many years and which the pharmaceutical profession was of the opinion required amendment, do not appear under this particular heading. But the Minister has given his reasons which in my humble opinion are valid reasons, and I will not deal with that aspect of the amendments.</p>

<p>But I feel in the first place that I should make it quite clear that in so far as Section 65<i>bis</i> is concerned, a section which deals with potentially harmful drugs, a certain background to the history of this particular section would be of value to hon. members. I would like to tell hon. members that as far back as 1947, the Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa, after due consideration, came to the conclusion that there was a certain class of drugs which was not catered for by the existing Schedule but which left uncontrolled, would result in a threat to the public, and purely in the interest of the public a resolution was passed, requesting the Pharmacy Board and those bodies intimately concerned with the administration of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, to institute some form of control over these particular preparations which could be bought, possibly on signature, and some of which could be bought without any restriction at all. I believe that Act 29 of 1954, to which an hon. member has already referred this afternoon, was the direct outcome of the representation initiated as far back as 1947. I believe still that the experience of the administration of that Act during the intervening years has shown that there are many aspects which no longer are necessary in the interest of the public and which could well be amended in such a way as in no manner to interfere with the welfare of the public but which would relieve many irksome restrictions which exist in so far as the chemists and druggists themselves are concerned.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to deal with that section, I would like to refer briefly to other aspects of the Bill, particularly in regard to Clause 2. There have been discussions on the possible dangers which might eventuate if Clause 2 became a part of the Act. I believe that the South African Pharmacy Board is extremely jealous of the qualifications and of the standard of education which it demands before a chemist and druggist can be registered and can practise in South Africa. That standard has been maintained for many years, but this particular amendment, I am sure, has been brought forward by the hon. the Minister on the representation of the Pharmacy Board, and <span class="col_1593-1594" refersTo="page_813"/>I would like to stress one particular point. There is a very eminent man who fulfils a very important educational post in the Potchefstroom University. He holds the degree of a chemist and druggist which is not registerable in South Africa because there is no reciprocity between South Africa and the country from which he comes. That man in his very important capacity and the very important function he fulfils in the education and training of our chemists and druggists, is extremely highly qualified. As I see it, however, he is unable to perform the acts of a chemist and druggist and in such a way teach students the acts of a chemist and druggist and the art of pharmacy, because, by virtue of the fact that he is not registerable in this country, he cannot perform those acts according to law. I believe that the shortage of adequately trained lecturers in pharmacy is so acute that every encouragement should be given to allow people who are suitably qualified to perform such acts, and I want to say that I believe that Clauses 1, 2 and 3 and a provision of Clause 4 are a perfect and full guarantee that the individuals whom we have in mind will in no way be registered unless they can comply with the most stringent conditions.</p>

<heading>FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AND GREAT BRITAIN</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as announced by the State President in his Opening Speech to both Houses of Parliament on 19 January 1962 discussions are being held regarding the future relationships between the Republic of South Africa and the United Kingdom, and also between the Republic and the High Commission Territories.</p>

<p>These discussions, which are still being continued, cover the whole range of the relationship between the two countries and between the Republic and the High Commission Territories. They therefore cover a very wide field. The discussions have not yet been finalized, and full information about certain aspects cannot yet be made available.</p>

<p>A Bill has already been presented in the British House of Commons relating to those matters which require legislation by the United Kingdom. The Second Reading debate on the British bill commences this afternoon when the Minister concerned will furnish information regarding certain matters which have been under discussion. This statement is intended to make information available to the House about the progress of the negotiations.</p>

<p>As the Republic is no longer a member of the Commonwealth, citizens of the Republic will in future be regarded as aliens in the United Kingdom, as well as in the High Commission Territories. Citizens of the United Kingdom and the High Commission Territories will henceforth be aliens in the Republic. (This is the legal position resulting from South Africa&#x2019;s withdrawal from the Commonwealth, and it must be accepted as such).</p>

<p>Arrangements or relationships which exist only between Commonwealth countries will no longer continue. Nor was it the intention of the Government that such relations should be retained.</p>

<p>It is nonetheless the desire of both Governments to maintain the traditional bonds of friendship which have existed between the United Kingdom and the Republic, although they will now be bonds of friendship between foreign states and territories. This spirit of mutual goodwill prevailed throughout the discussions. It is the desire, as far as possible, to promote still further, good relations with the United Kingdom in regard to all matters of common concern.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to go into detail this afternoon, but I can state that agreement has been reached on a considerable number of subjects which are of interest to both parties. I mention the following examples:</p>

<p><i>Maintenance Orders</i></p>

<p>The present arrangements for the reciprocal enforcement of existing and future maintenance orders will be retained.</p>

<p>In terms of the United Kingdom &#x201C;Naval Forces (Enforcement of Maintenance Liabilities) Act, 1947&#x201D; the British Admiralty is empowered to enforce maintenance liabilities by means of deductions from the pay of British seamen in the Republic. The South African Government have agreed to the continuance of this arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Deceased Estates</i></p>

<p>The present arrangements for the reciprocal recognition of letters of administration in respect of deceased estates will continue.</p>

<p><i>Double Taxation</i></p>

<p>The Hon. the Minister of Finance informed the House on the 23rd January that a draft Agreement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation had been initialled, on 15 January by officials of the Governments of the Republic and of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Medical and Dental Qualifications and Registration of Veterinary Surgeons</i></p>

<p>The existing arrangements whereby medical and dental practitioners with South African qualifications can register in the United Kingdom, on a basis of reciprocity, will be continued. The only change will be that such practitioners will henceforth be registered on the &#x201C;Foreign&#x201D; list in the United Kingdom instead <span class="col_1595-1596" refersTo="page_814"/>of on the &#x201C; Commonwealth &#x201D; list, as has been the case heretofore. The present arrangements whereby veterinary surgeons with South African qualifications can register in the United Kingdom on a basis of reciprocity, will be continued. Here also the only change is that such veterinary surgeons will henceforth be registered on the &#x201C;Foreign&#x201D; list in the United Kingdom and not on the &#x201C;Colonial&#x201D; list as has been the case up to the present.</p>

<p><i>Matrimonial Matters</i></p>

<p>There will be mutual recognition in our respective countries of orders issued in respect of certain matrimonial matters.</p>

<p><i>Pensions</i></p>

<p>The existing arrangements whereby medical services are rendered to disabled ex-Servicemen, on a basis of reciprocity, will continue.</p>

<p>The South African Government will, as in the past, act without charge, as agents for the British Ministries concerned, for payment in the Republic of British military, social and other pensions.</p>

<p>As regards the granting of South African Old Age Pensions, United Kingdom citizens will henceforth have to comply with a residential requirement of 25 out of the 30 years immediately preceding the date of application, as is the case with other foreigners. United Kingdom citizens already receiving South African old age pensions, or to whom such pensions have been granted before the termination of the &#x201C;standstill&#x201D;, are not affected by the increased residential qualification.</p>

<p>The Blind Persons Act, 1936, and the Disability Grants Act, 1946, as amended, lay down the lower residential qualification, for all foreigners in the Republic, of 10 out of the last 15 years.</p>

<p><i>Defence</i></p>

<p>As regards defence, a great measure of cooperation existed in the past between the Republic and the United Kingdom. This cooperation did not stem from the common Commonwealth connection, but from mutual defence interests. Now that we have left the Commonwealth, these needs have in no way diminished and it was felt that the co-operation of the past should continue, subject, of course, to such amendments and modifications as the changed constitutional position might call for. With this object in mind, discussions took place in London last year between our Minister of Defence and the United Kingdom Minister of Defence. Since then, related matters have also been discussed at other levels. All that I can say at this stage, is that there will be no departure of any consequence from the existing pattern of our defence relations with the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Trade and Customs Relations</i></p>

<p>South Africa&#x2019;s special relations with the United Kingdom and certain British dependent territories in regard to trade are based on the Ottawa Agreement of 1932, the validity of which is not affected by South Africa&#x2019;s withdrawal from the Commonwealth. This is a matter which also is not affected by the present negotiations, and the parties concerned will remain bound by the contractual obligations of the Agreement, which can only be terminated in accordance with the provisions contained in the Agreement.</p>

<p>As part of this traditional pattern of trade, the United Kingdom Government have agreed to continue the arrangement relating to the Multiple Content requirement for Commonwealth preference in respect of:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) South African goods exported to a Commonwealth country other than the United Kingdom for final processing and subsequent export to the United Kingdom; and</li>

<li>(ii) goods imported from a Commonwealth country into South Africa for final processing and subsequent export to the United Kingdom.</li>

</ol>

<p>The present arrangements in relation to certain matters concerning the maintenance of branch registers of companies which are registered in the other country, will be continued.</p>

<p>There are certain arrangements which existed in the past, and which will now lapse as a result of the changed position, as for example:</p>

<p><i>Civil Aviation</i></p>

<p>In terms of British legislation, it will in future no longer be possible for South African citizens (unless they are also United Kingdom citizens) and bodies incorporated in South Africa to own a legal or beneficial interest in aircraft registered in the United Kingdom or in any of its colonies.</p>

<p>As regards sea-mail and telecommunication tariffs, the position will be as follows:</p>

<p>As a member of the Commonwealth, South Africa was entitled to Commonwealth preferential sea-mail and telecommunication tariffs. As a result of the changed constitutional position, it has become necessary for both countries to apply the higher international rates on sea-mail and telecommunication traffic between them. The two Postal Administrations are already engaged in negotiations to arrange the details administratively.</p>

<p><i>Extradition</i></p>

<p>A new extradition treaty between the Republic and the United Kingdom will have to be concluded. Similar treaties will also have to be concluded between the Republic and <span class="col_1597-1598" refersTo="page_815"/>each of the High Commission territories. In the case of these territories, new machinery will have to be created to replace the arrangements which existed under the British &#x201C;Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881&#x201D;. These matters are at present receiving attention.</p>

<p><i>High Commission Territories</i></p>

<p>As to the future relations between the Republic and the High Commission Territories, it has been agreed in principle that special customs relations between the three territories and the Republic will be maintained in the form of new agreements between the Republic and each of the territories concerned. This is a matter which is receiving attention. Until such time as the new agreements are concluded, the existing arrangements will remain in force. In the new arrangements, provision will have to be made, <i>inter alia,</i> for a suitable formula which will guard against any possible action, arising from the marketing of a product of one of the parties, which will be unduly detrimental to the interests of the other party. Furthermore, a periodic review of the marketing arrangements for agricultural produce by the Republic and the High Commission territories is envisaged. The South African Government feels that the present proportion of percentages of the Customs and Excise revenue, payable to each of the three High Commission territories, should be reviewed and incorporated in the proposed separate agreements, that is to say, it is not envisaged that the aggregate of the proportions of Customs and Excise revenue be adjusted, but merely the proportion of revenue, payable to each of the individual territories.</p>

<p>As regards the admission to and employment in the Republic, of inhabitants of the three High Commission territories, the Government will still be prepared to make available, opportunities for employment to the inhabitants of the three territories, subject, however, to the employment needs of the Republic&#x2019;s own citizens.</p>

<p>In this connection I should, however, point out that, as hon. members are aware, a Commission has been appointed by the House to inquire into the whole question of foreign Bantu in the Republic. At this stage I can say no more than that future employment opportunities for inhabitants of the three territories will have to be determined in the light of the labour requirements of the Republic&#x2019;s own citizens. Provision will therefore have to be made for the application of some form of influx control and/or employment control.</p>

<p><i>Citizenship</i></p>

<p>A matter which is still receiving the attention of the South African authorities concerned, is citizenship. As I have already pointed out, citizens of the United Kongdom and the High Commission territories will henceforth be aliens in the Republic. However, consideration is being given to the manner in which they will be treated and I would rather not expand on this matter at this stage. Amending legislation will be necessary, and when it is introduced, full particulars will of course be given to the House by the Minister concerned.</p>

<p>Finally I would like to repeat that the foregoing should not be regarded as an exhaustive list of all the questions which were discussed and on which agreement was reached. There are certain matters on which negotiations are continuing and others which require special arrangements, such as, for instance, the provision of consular services abroad. In this connection I might add that the arrangements which obtained while South Africa was a member of the Commonwealth and according to which the United Kingdom representatives in many countries acted on our behalf, will henceforth have to be replaced in certain countries by the appointment of our own consular representatives.</p>

<p>In some of the cases mentioned, amending legislation will be necessary during the present session of Parliament. Full details will be given when legislation is introduced.</p>

<p>The information furnished by me to-day serves more specifically to give hon. members an indication of the general trend of the discussions and, in broad outline, what has so far been accomplished.</p>

<p>Discussion on motion for second reading of the Bill resumed.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was dealing with Clause 2 of the Bill in relation to the registration of certain types of chemists and druggists purely on the ground of their educational qualifications. I have referred to the three clauses which would appear to provide ample protection to ensure that chemists and druggists registered under this particular class would in fact only be able to exercise the functions for which they were registered.</p>

<p>Carrying on to Clause 3 of the Bill there has been some discussion on the terms &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; and &#x201C;pharmaceutical technician&#x201D;. I believe that the &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; is merely taking the place of the definition which appears in the Act which says that &#x201C;an &#x2018;unregistered assistant&#x2019; for the purposes of Sections 37, 50 and 55 means a person who has completed any one of the periods of apprenticeship or service with a chemist or druggist as prescribed in Section 27&#x201D;. So that instead of reading &#x201C;unregistered assistant&#x201D; it now reads &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; and there will therefore be certain consequential amendments in other clauses of the Bill. But I feel that this change is purely a change in terminology and has no other implications and that in so far as the description of an &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; is concerned, the definition that is laid down in the Bill will always be the accepted <span class="col_1599-1600" refersTo="page_816"/>definition. In so far as &#x201C;pharmaceutical technicians&#x201D; is concerned, I would like to refer, in order to clarify this position, to wording which has been forwarded from the Registrar of the Pharmacy Board. I want to read this in order to give hon. members an idea of what the Pharmacy Board had in mind when they requested the hon. the Minister to make this necessary amendment. It is the opinion of the Board as expressed by the Registrar in a telegram, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Pharmaceutical technician will be employed solely in pharmaceutical manufacturing on wholesale scale to attend machines such as tablet, pill, capsules and responsible for conditions of hygiene, humidity, temperature during manufacturing processes. He will not compound; will not be in contact with public.</block>

<p>So I feel, Mr. Speaker, that while the Bill is merely seeking provision to establish a register for this particular type of person, that if and when the time comes for this register to be established, the definition of &#x201C;pharmaceutical technician&#x201D; will be framed along these lines and should under no circumstances cause anxiety that a new form of unqualified dispenser will operate. Because it is made quite clear here that it is not the intention that this particular type of individual would come in contact with the public neither will he be able to dispense medicines, because that right is reserved for chemists and druggists, for apprentices registered under the Act and for those who will now be &#x201C;unqualified assistants To my mind there is no doubt about that, Sir.</p>

<p>Before returning to Section 65<i>bis,</i> I wish to refer briefly to Clause 8. This particular clause, I know, chemists and druggists will find very welcome indeed. It merely provides that methylated spirits should be packed in clear-glass bottles. The necessity for that provision is a very practical one because there are no bottles of the size required by law which are distinguishable by touch. They are not made in this country. So we welcome this provision as chemists and druggists who carry the responsibility of selling methylated spirits.</p>

<p>Now I should like to revert to Section 65<i>bis</i> and to say at the outset that though various changes have been made, with respect, Sir, they do not represent the considered opinion of the conjoint committee of the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Board. These opinions have been forwarded to the Minister and the recommendations therein went a good deal further than is suggested in this amendment. I say with complete earnestness, Mr. Speaker, that the recommendations will, in my opinion, not in any way affect the safety of the public. But if these recommendations which have been forwarded on behalf of the two professions, recommendations on which they have agreed, with the exception of one point with which I shall deal later, were accepted, the safety of the public would still be maintained but many irritating and irksome processes with which chemists and druggists find it necessary to comply, in order to keep on the right side of this particular section of the Act, would be removed. I would like to elaborate briefly on a point of difference which did exist. That point of difference relates to the issuing of repeat prescriptions. I believe that the amendment put forward here in Clause 7 (a) and (b) makes provision for adequate safeguards in respect of the issue of repeat prescriptions of potentially harmful drugs. Here I differentiate between the restrictions in respect of &#x201C;potentially harmful drugs&#x201D; and those in respect of &#x201C;habit-forming drugs&#x201D; which are dealt with in Section 65 of the Act. I would like to quote some information on the question of &#x201C;potentially harmful drugs&#x201D; which I hope will clarify the position in the minds of hon. members, because there is a distinct difference between a &#x201C;habitforming drug&#x201D; and a &#x201C;potentially harmful drug&#x201D;. I quote from a publication issued by the S.A. Pharmaceutical Society which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Among the lay public there is a common misconception that potentially harmful drugs are mild narcotics. It should be explained, therefore, when discussing the matter with non-pharmacists, that potentially harmful drugs are not in the nature of habit forming drugs which are in wide demand for illicit use and which have to be guarded and controlled at every stage of distribution. Drugs are not classed as potentially harmful because they necessarily lend themselves to unlawful use but purely because they can have harmful effects when used in inappropriate quantities or circumstances. The latter possibility is avoided by ensuring that they are supplied only on the authorization of a doctor who is acquainted with the patient&#x2019;s condition. His authorization can be communicated to the chemist by means of an ordinary prescription, and no special formalities are necessary to achieve the basic control provided by the Act. From the point of view of the chemist, only the authorization by a medical practitioner should be of any importance, and if the judiciary considers special formalities necessary for other purposes, this should not affect the chemist and druggist.</block>

<p>I feel too, that I should emphasize that the distribution of potentially harmful drugs is not the sole prerogative of the chemists and druggists. There are other professional people and other individuals who are part of this system of distribution. I would refer, in the first instance, to the medical profession. One of the hon. members has already made reference to that form of distribution. But Section 65<i>bis</i> of the Act makes it quite clear that &#x201C;general practitioners, particularly those who do their own dispensing have certain responsibilities under this Act, almost to the same extent as the chemist and druggist has&#x201D;. But, <span class="col_1601-1602" refersTo="page_817"/>Sir, as far as distribution is concerned, there is another big weakness which seems to me to make the position of the chemist even more anomalous, and that is in regard to certain potentially harmful drugs which are exempted from the provisions of the Schedule by virtue of the fact that they fall under the control of the Farm Feeds, Seeds and Fertilizers Act. I would like to read, Sir, a brief excerpt from a memorandum published by the S.A. Pharmacy Board on the subject of poisons and dealing particularly with this aspect. The memorandum says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many potentially harmful drugs, if registered under the Farm Feeds, Seeds and Fertilizers Act, are exempted from the provisions governing the 6th Schedule. When one realizes that amongst this exempted group are antibiotics, Sulphonamides etc. and that the veterinary product differs from its human counterpart in pack only and in some instances in colour only, the situation becomes a farce. The general public merely ask for the veterinary product and proceed to use it themselves or give it to their employees.</block>

<p>That, Sir, is a big gap in the control of these potentially harmful drugs.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, my mind goes back to what seems to me to be a very quaint anomaly. Because in this House last year there was an amendment to certain sections of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act. By virtue of one amendment the power was given to create regulations which had the effect of enabling lay people not only &#x201C;to acquire, to use but also to administer habit-forming drugs &#x2026;&#x201D; I am referring to the power that was given for regulations to be promulgated which would allow captains of aircraft, midwives, of all races, and masters of ships to have in their possession habit-forming drugs, to acquire them and to administer them. To me, Sir, it seems paradoxical that a chemist and druggist, with a minimum of five years&#x2019; training, finds himself in a position where he is bogged down by irksome and irritating restrictions under Section 65<i>bis,</i> irritations which this amendment does not do away with altogether. The question that has been raised in regard to technicalities is a very valid one. I have here a copy of a summons which was issued to a chemist and druggist. There are 312 charges. Most of the charges relate to the address of the patient not having been described in full and the qualifications, signature and address of the prescriber not being reflected. So here we have a professional man, duly trained and conscious of his professional integrity, being subjected to the indignity of having to combat legal action. I must in fairness say that when the Attorney-General learnt about the facts of this case and when he realized that the offences were purely of a technical nature, he offered to withhold prosecution until such time as the law in this particular respect could be amended. These amendments in the Bill will to a certain extent relieve that responsibility but the opening to which the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) referred, still remains, and that is the question of the date. There is no provision for the date to be inserted and it seems to me that if the amendment is accepted as it stands, the chemist will still be in the invidious position of being liable to prosecution on a technicality. There are other aspects of the amendment which I think actually entrench certain requirements and they do so to protect the public. These amendments now make it possible that where a doctor, due to various reasons such as pressure of professional work etc. has not the time to insert the address on the prescription, the chemist may fulfil that function. They also make provision for the chemist and druggist to write into his prescription book the full details of the prescription plus the name and the address of the patient plus the name of the prescriber. Now that has been provided for, I suggest that to a large extent the provisions of Section 65<i>bis</i> (3) could well be done away with. Because I say with complete earnestness that it is this Section which is the one which causes the greatest inconvenience to the chemists and druggists of this country and which, in all humility and respect, I say is not needed now, because the details which the Minister has indicated he requires for the sake of tracing these particular drugs, will be provided in the prescription books of the chemists, books which remain on the chemist&#x2019;s shelves for time eternal. I should like to read this Section so that those members who are not particularly familiar with this legislation will realize the difficulty under which we labour. Section (3) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person by whom a prescription referred to in sub-section (i) is dispensed for the last time according to the particulars to be set forth therein in terms of sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (c) of sub-section 1, shall retain such prescription for a period of not less than three years as from the date on which it is so dispensed for the last time.</block>

<p>I appreciate that the Minister has put forward certain consequential amendments to sub-section (iii), amendments which, I submit with respect, in no way affect the principle of the retention of such prescriptions. I should like to give hon. members a brief description of the difficulties which the chemist and druggist encounters in the carrying out of this particular section. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark did refer to the question of benefit societies and I am aware that in the case of certain benefit societies, the organization is such that a doctor issues a prescription on a special form so that the various requirements are complied with. But the other aspect which is causing increasing annoyance is in the case of benefit societies which do not operate on that basis, those benefit societies which operate <span class="col_1603-1604" refersTo="page_818"/>on the basis that the member of the society is responsible for the submission of the prescription with the relevant invoice before they receive payment for the prescription. This particular person, who is a member of a benefit society, goes to the general practitioner and receives a prescription on which there is no indication that the person belongs to a benefit society. He hands in the prescription to be dispensed and sometimes it is a prescription containing five items, one of which may be a potentially harmful drug or may contain a small percentage of a potentially harmful drug. He hands in this prescription and when it has been dispensed he asks if he may have a cash sale slip and the prescription. Now, Sir, in terms of this Act, because that prescription contains one item only which falls within the provisions of sub-section (3), the chemist is bound to keep that prescription for three years. The benefit society in turn demands the prescription before it pays. There is an alternative I admit and that is for the chemist and druggist to supply a copy of the prescription. But, Mr. Speaker, if you bear in mind that technically and legally the only people who can make a copy of that prescription are the chemist and druggist himself&#x2014;his time is valuable, Sir&#x2014;the chemist&#x2019;s apprentice or an unqualified assistant in terms of this new amendment, under the supervision of the chemist and druggist, you will realize that in respect of one prescription containing four or five different items, the chemist has to sit down and make a copy. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the incidence of these particular prescriptions and the number of times that customers ask for copies in order that they may receive payment for the medicine, are increasing. It is becoming a considerable source of embarrassment to the chemists and druggists in South Africa to have to comply with this particular provision. I ask most earnestly. Sir, that the hon. the Minister will consider some form of alleviation. I submit that there could be amendments which would enable the prescription to be handed to the benefit society, if necessary, or to be marked &#x201C;cancelled&#x201D; in such a way that it is no longer valid. And all the particulars which the hon. the Minister requires and which he made quite clear he wanted, will be available in the prescription book of the chemist and druggist in his pharmacy. I submit that the public would be protected, but the chemist and druggist would at least be relieved of a very irksome procedure.</p>

<p>I should like to take this aspect a little further in dealing with another sub-section under Section 65<i>bis,</i> namely sub-section (5). Sub-section (5) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any potentially harmful drug may. in in the case of an emergency, be sold or supplied to any person on verbal instructions of a medical practitioner, dentist or authorized veterinarian given direct to a seller or supplier to whom the medical practitioner, dentist or authorized veterinarian concerned is personally known.</block>

<p>Let me give you the practical implications of such a regulation Sir. Take a city like Durban for example. I believe there are approximately 300 medical practitioners in Durban and I think there is not a single chemist and druggist who can claim that he knows all the medical practitioners in Durban. But as sub-section (5) stands at the moment it is required that the verbal instructions given by the medical practitioner must be given &#x201C;direct&#x201D; to the chemist and druggist, not to his apprentice who is qualified under the law to perform such work, and that the chemist and druggist or the supplier must be personally known to the prescriber. Sir, I submit that it is quite impracticable for such a provision to be carried out and again I appeal to the hon. the Minister to see if there is some way in which this position could be eased. Sir, I realize that this particular aspect, to my knowledge, has not received the attention of the Medical Council, but I would like to record that in so far as the S.A. Pharmacy Board is concerned, after due consideration of this particular sub-section, it is felt that the position could well be met by the deletion of the word &#x201C;direct&#x201D; and by the deletion of the word &#x201C;personally&#x201D; from this sub-section.</p>

<p>I have tried to deal with the practical difficulties of this particular amendment in so far as it affects chemists and druggists. I have tried to show hon. members that it is not the intention of organized pharmacy in any way to suggest any release that may in the end be harmful to the welfare of the public. I sincerely appeal to the hon. the Minister to see if he can find it in his heart to grant us some exemption from provisions which we find no longer tolerable.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) has given us a very clear exposition of their problems. I am tempted to say that in this case we cannot reproach him and say that we could not see the trees for the wood. The fact of the matter is that contrary to what some hon. members have said, he has to a great extent defended this Bill and given his blessing to Clauses 2, 3, 8 etc. It is refreshing to hear anybody trying to treat some of these matters objectively. As a matter of fact, he has expatiated on it to such an extent that he has nearly convinced me to agree with him that the three years during which the chemist must keep a prescription is indeed a very irritating provision and a long period.</p>

<p>The hon. member also strongly contradicted the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) who alleged that Clause 2 was a dangerous clause. The hon. member may not have meant to do so, but he gave me the impression that he thought that chemists were simply an insignificant group of people, a group which did not really perform such <span class="col_1605-1606" refersTo="page_819"/>an important service, inasmuch as he alleged that the medical profession had accepted these measures; but, he says, there were definite reasons why the medical profession did that. But this other group of people&#x2014;I repeat that he may not have meant it in that way, but he created the impression&#x2014;is, in his opinion, not so important; in their case there are not such good reasons for it. No, Mr. Speaker, I think it has become clear from the debate that there are equally good reasons in the case of the chemists and druggists why the same measures should be introduced as those introduced in the case of the medical profession. The hon. member for Durban (Central) tells us that it was done in the case of the medical profession only after particularly strong precautionary measures had been taken. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) stated it very clearly that here too very good precautionary measures were being taken, so that it will not be possible to make misuse of Clause 2. The hon. member said that in the case of the medical profession it was necessary because of the shortage in medical lecturers and professors. But that is the very problem in this case and that is why this clause is so necessary, it is necessary to make provision because of the tremendous shortage as explained by the hon. member for Berea.</p>

<p>I want to assure the hon. member for Durban (Central)&#x2014;not that I have anything to do with it&#x2014;that only a few of those people will be allowed. The country will not be overrun by this type of person and I also want to tell him that while I appreciate it greatly that he is concerned about it that our own people may be ousted from the profession, while we appreciate it greatly where he says that our own people may be ousted from the lecturing personnel, I want to assure him that this Government will see to it that does not happen.</p>

<p>Where I said a moment ago that I have nearly been convinced to concede certain requests made by the hon. member for Berea and to agree with him, I in turn want to issue a word of warning and say that we should be careful when we deal with these potentially harmful drugs. We should not become too slack in this matter. As a matter of fact, the chemists and druggists themselves have said so. That was why they recommended that those medicines should be placed on a special list. You often hear the argument, Sir, that it is not really necessary to be so strict, that whereas you must be strict in the case of habit-forming drugs and poisonous medicines, it is not necessary to be so very careful in the case of the other. Only a small group of people are affected and not much damage can be done. The principle should be to protect the public. My contention is that it is a weak argument to maintain that only a small number are affected, because when it comes to habit-forming drugs, it is also only a small number, proportionately speaking, who are affected, but in that case we are prepared to limit it very strictly. The same applies here, because the fact remains that the numbers that are affected are not as small as we think. I want to emphasize that the number of persons who are affected by these potentially harmful drugs is not as small as is commonly believed. Where the argument is used that when you are dealing with poisonous medicines and habit-forming drugs, everybody who comes into contact with the person who uses these medicines is placed in a dangerous position, I want to say that the same applies in some cases where you are dealing with potentially harmful medicines. You cannot say that there is little danger because the numbers are small. The fact remains that even these small numbers, which I said a moment ago were not so small, should be protected against themselves. It is necessary to ensure that those persons who are perhaps unaware of the fact that they are allergic to one or other of these medicines, are protected for their own sakes and for the sake of those who are near to them. It is a fact that some of these medicines have an affect on people which, in spite of all our scientific knowledge, cannot be determined to-day, and because we do not know what the future holds in store if people use these medicines regularly, it is impossible for us to become lax. I do not think a proper survey has ever been made, but I am curious to know how many motor car accidents are the direct result of the use of some of these medicines. Many of us are in the habit when we go on a long journey, to take some of these things to keep fit knowing how they affect some people and making it impossible for them to handle a car safely at a high speed.</p>

<p>That is why I want to plead that we should be careful that we do not always make concessions and in doing so make it easier for the public to lay their hands on these potentially harmful drugs. I want to emphasize that although this is a big problem as far as the chemist and druggist is concerned, we must, until such time as we know definitely what the affects of these medicines are, be careful as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am inclined to take the view taken a little earlier by the hon. member for Hercules (Dr. A. I. Malan) that we are making a complicated issue out of something which is not so complicated at all. I think that really is the position. If one looks at this Bill one realizes that it is a comparatively simple Bill. It sets out to achieve two objectives. The first is to remove some of the sting from the application of Section 65<i>bis</i> in so far as it applies to the requirements on prescriptions for the supply of this particular class of drugs. It has partially done that, but as the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) has pointed out, it has also left in, some of the simpler things which could quite easily have been removed at the same time. This Bill was obviously prepared in haste. It is obvious that it has not been given the full <span class="col_1607-1608" refersTo="page_820"/>consideration it should have been given, because if it had I am quite sure it would have made adequate provision for the removal of the provision in regard to the date in Section <i>65bis</i> (1), which still remains; this Bill has not taken it out, and it has also failed to provide for things such as the registration of apprentices which is a very important matter.</p>

<p>But I want to touch on another aspect of this in regard to the second objective of this Bill, which is to create registers for the registration of certain classes of people who are not at present registered or are not entitled to be registered. I particularly have in mind the technicians who are mentioned in the Bill itself. I think this springs possibly from an address by the then hon. Minister of Health, Mr. Viljoen, when he opened the annual general meeting of the Pharmaceutical Society in Cape Town in April, 1957. He stated that he had been advised that several millions of pounds of foreign capital was waiting to come into this country for investment in new pharmaceutical manufacturing laboratories, but that it was being withheld because of certain restrictions on the activities of such businesses imposed by the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act. He stated that he wished to see those obstacles removed in order that the country could benefit by the introduction of that foreign capital and the resultant expansion of our industries. I think that this particular aspect in the Bill which applies to technicians springs from that source. Personally, I think it is a good thing, but I have doubts as to whether this Bill will really achieve what it is setting out to do along those lines. This problem of the establishment of the bigger pharmaceutical industries in South Africa, is such an important one to us because it ties up, as I have indicated to this Minister before, particularly with the expansion of Sasol. Sasol is the ideal place for the establishment of such satellite industries on a very big scale, but there are many aspects besides the aspect of registering a particular type of technician. I think the Minister appointed a commission not long ago to go into the high cost of medicine, amongst other things. This also ties up with this particular aspect, because if the Minister wants to reduce the high cost, in this country, of certain of these very specialized products, I think he must start at the bottom and investigate the thing as a whole, and not start with one or two little aspects which create an odd technician here and there and make him available to these concerns. The problem is far bigger than that and it goes far deeper. I think the Minister in this Bill has actually just scratched the surface. He has not dealt at all with the real problem he is trying to solve. I accept that the facilities for training chemists and druggists in South Africa do not cover all the aspects which are required by these companies producing these specialized products. I accept that in time we will produce that type of chemist and druggist, but we have to face the fact that at the moment we do not. But our law requires that such a man, possibly not properly trained&#x2014;he may have gone overseas and had such training; there are those exceptions to the rule&#x2014;that such a man shall supervise all of that work. In many cases I accept that he is probably supervising work which he does not understand very well. This Bill does not make provision for that. It still says there must be supervision; there must be a technician but he must still act under the supervision of a chemist and druggist. I do not want to comment any further on that and give my opinions, but I do not think it solves the problem that the Minister is really trying to solve. I do not think it solves the problem which Mr. Viljoen had in mind when he made this statement in Cape Town. So I submit to the Minister that this is something which needs very much deeper investigation before it is introduced into a Bill of this nature. When I looked at this Bill I wondered why the Minister had been in such a hurry to introduce it, because apart from relieving the situation in so far as the chemists and druggists are concerned in relation to Section 65<i>bis,</i> I can see no other matter of extreme urgency in it. I believe that if the Minister would get down to solving all the requirements of these companies he is trying to help by means of this measure, he will achieve far more.</p>

<p>There are other problems, too. The high cost, to a large extent, is not because they have to pay the salary of a chemist and druggist as well as the technician. That is a minor item in the production cost. The Minister must investigate the question of research and the moneys spent on it not being allowed as a rebate for taxation purposes. If you couple that up with an inquiry into what technical staff is required in the production of these special drugs and all the other aspects that go with it, I think the time would be ripe to decide what type of persons should be registered as chemists and druggists, other than chemists and druggists, to meet and deal with the position that the Minister is trying to deal with.</p>

<p>I do not want to go any further into that. However, before I sit down I want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider the points put forward by the hon. member for Durban (Berea) as to the further removal of the necessity for the date, and in addition to that, to provide also for the registration of apprentices which I think is a very important aspect which has been omitted from the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for the objective way in which they discussed this Bill and the whole matter we are now considering. I was almost moved by the sympathetic way in which the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) put his case and pleaded the cause of the pharmacists. Most of the questions and arguments which were mentioned earlier in the discussions <span class="col_1609-1610" refersTo="page_821"/>were subsequently answered by other hon. members, so I do not think the House would like me to cover the whole ground again. I shall only touch upon a few points where I may be helpful.</p>

<p>Firstly, I should like to remind the hon. member who has just sat down that the object of this Bill is not really to reduce the high cost of medicine, nor is it to assist in the development of our industries. The real object is to alleviate the position of pharmacists in certain circumstances. I can quite appreciate the difficulty mentioned by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), in connection with the definition of pharmaceutical technicians and the other definition of unqualified assistants. I can appreciate the difficulty hon. members have with the definition of pharmaceutical technicians, because I share it with them. It is the way lawyers sometimes have, to define things in this fashion. If hon. members will refer to Section 96 they will find that the definition of a dentist is framed in the same way as the definition of a pharmaceutical assistant. A dentist is defined as a person registered as such under this Act. That is hardly a definition, but the draughtsmen in this particular case have followed the example of their predecessors and they are now defining a pharmaceutical assistant as a man registered as such. The hon. member for Durban (Berea) has explained very fully what exactly is meant by a pharmaceutical technician, and perhaps I may just remind hon. members of a few of the things that we expect from such persons. We expect from them that they should know the ingredients of the products they handle. They must at the same time feel at home with the machines needed for the production or the packaging of products such as pills which they manufacture. They must know exactly the temperatures and the moisture needed for the production of medicines like powders and tablets. They must be well acquainted with the art of applying specific coatings on tablets. They must know the medicines they are required to handle in the performance of their work.</p>

<p>Hon. members must not forget that this Bill is not only for the advantage or the protection of pharmacists. It is basically a Bill intended for the protection of the public. Perhaps I should just remind hon. members that when we have to deal with this type of potentially harmful drug, we are dealing with drugs which can be a menace to society. Two years ago the same matter was considered by the Committee for the Ministry of Health in England as they were very concerned about the position there, because they said that many of these drugs could attack or affect the central nervous system of the individual taking them, and result in physical and psychological deterioration. They came to the conclusion that the injudicious use of this type of drug is something so accompanied by dangers to the individual that the use of such medicines should be carefully restricted. When we make laws we have to deal not only with law-abiding citizens, but also with the people who do not abide by the laws of the country. Section 65<i>bis</i> was framed in this way originally, in 1954, with the concurrence of the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Board, because at that time the Pharmacy Board was convinced of the necessity for protecting the public. If you want to protect the public, you must force the pharmacist to dispense drugs only on the instructions of a medical man. It is the medical profession which has to see to it and has to decide as to the correctness of prescribing a certain drug to a patient, and under no circumstances was it considered advisable that the pharmacist of his own accord should sell these drugs to the public. In order to safeguard the public, one must be able to trace the pharmacist who exceeds or does not fufil the requirements of the Act. One must be able to trace him, and in order to do so it is essential that we should know, firstly, the name of the doctor who gives the prescription. We must know the name of the person for whom he prescribes it, but we must also know the address of the patient. Unless you know the name and address of the patient, it is impossible to follow up in order to determine whether the pharmacist has acted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. If on the prescription you simply find the name of Miss Jones or Mrs. Smith, it is impossible to trace such a person, and unless you can trace the person for whom the prescription has been made out, it is impossible to bring home to the pharmacist any transgression of the law.</p>

<p>May I ask a question? May I ask whether the Minister has had many occasions where chemists and druggists have been prosecuted in a court of law for failing to carry out the provisions of Section 65<i>bis,</i> between 1954 and the present time?</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have had to ask that a large number of prosecutions be stopped, because pharmacists have not followed the instructions of this section. I think the hon. member himself mentioned the case of a chemist who had no fewer than 300 possible charges laid against him for contravening the law.</p>

<p>On a point of clarification, I meant in so far as non-technical offences are concerned, where there was an abuse.</p>

<p>That is the unfortunate thing. Supposing a doctor has not written on the prescription the name or address of the patient, then the chemist is inclined to look upon it as just a technical offence, but it is not a technical offence. It is absolutely essential, if you wish to be able to prosecute a pharmacist who has wrongfully given a drug to a patient. It is essential for the Department of Justice to be able to trace this chemist who freely dispenses these things to our young people, to students, and who sell <span class="col_1611-1612" refersTo="page_822"/>them to people to whom they are not entitled to sell them without a prescription from the doctor. When they are taken to court, they produce a number of prescriptions without addresses and it is impossible to identify the persons for whom the prescriptions have been made out, and consequently it is impossible in such cases to bring home the transgression to the pharmacist himself. All these requirements of the Act, all the essentials are absolutely essential if you wish to make sure that these potentially harmful drugs are dispensed correctly and made available to the correct people. It is not because one is unsympathetic towards the profession of a pharmacist. We know the difficulties with which they are faced, but it is because it is essential for the protection of the public that these provisions must be retained as they are, excepting for the amendments we are introducing to assist all concerned. Primarily these concessions are in favour of the medical profession, because in future it will not be necessary for the medical practitioner to write in his own handwriting his name and address. He need not write in his address at all and he need not write in his qualifications or the address of the patient, provided that someone writes it in, whether it is his typist or the pharmacist himself. It is further provided that the doctor need not state the frequency with which these drugs can be dispensed, but if he does not state the frequency it is accepted that it is intended to be dispensed only once. I think that by these small concessions we are materially assisting the profession. I think it is difficult to make more concessions because then it would become impossible to protect the public.</p>
