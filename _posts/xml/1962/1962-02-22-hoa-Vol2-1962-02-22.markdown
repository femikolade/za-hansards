<heading>SPECIAL REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS BILL</heading>

<p>Dr. JONKER, as Chairman, brought up a Special Report of the Select Committee on the subject of the Undesirable Publications Bill, as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Your Committee has given careful consideration to the South African Press Union&#x2019;s published self-disciplinary code for newspapers which are members of this Union and is of the opinion that if the proposed disciplinary board should succeed in persuading all its members to abide by the suggested code of conduct the code will eliminate the evils which the legislation, the subject of which has been referred to your Committee, seeks to combat. Under the circumstances your Committee considers that the South African Press Union should be given the opportunity to apply its proposed scheme in practice and to prove that this code can be effectively applied. Your Committee has therefore decided not to make any legislation which it may submit to the House, applicable to newspapers which are members of the Press Union.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>In connection with the acceptance of this proposal, I should like to make it perfectly clear that the Government has had the opportunity to note this proposal which the Select Committee submits for the consideration of this House, namely that any legislation which it may submit to the House in its final report will not be made applicable to the newspapers which are members of the Press Union. The Government would like to endorse the Select Committee&#x2019;s decision with regard to this matter and give the assurance in advance that if the Select Committee excludes from this proposed legislation the aforementioned category of newspapers, namely those which are members of the Press Union, the Government will approve of it and accept it.</p>

<p>The Government welcomes the self-disciplinary code drawn up by the Press Union and believes that the code of conduct as published in the Press offers a means of combating the evils which the proposed legislation sought to combat. At this stage, therefore, it would probably be wrong on the part of the Government to duplicate steps which are taken to combat the same evils. It goes without saying that in taking this step the Press Union is taking very much greater responsibility on its shoulders, and this in turn brings with it greater obligations towards its readers and its supporters and towards the interests of the country and the nation, but the <i>bona fides</i> of the Press Union are accepted, and I should like to make use of this opportunity to wish its members every success with the application of the code of conduct which the Press Union itself has drawn up and accepted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>On behalf of this side of the House I wish to say that it is satisfactory to know that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Select Committee as set forth in this report. Speaking for myself, I am sure that the Press Union is a responsible body. I think the Government has been wise in accepting the offer made to allow a body of that nature to apply a disciplinary code such as the one they have published. Acceptance by the Government of this report means that it will ease the burden originally placed upon the committee of this House and will now enable the committee to continue its inquiry into the further aspects of the scope of the Bill which has been referred to it.</p>

<p><span class="col_1433-1434" refersTo="page_733"/>This being an agreed measure and the rest of the business of the committee being in effect <i>sub judice,</i> it seems to me that this would be an appropriate time to move&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Before calling upon the hon. the Minister of Transport to move the motion, I wish to remind hon. members that on the motion for the House to go into Committee on the Estimates of Additional Expenditure, as well as at later stages, the debate must be confined to the subjects contained in the Estimates and the reasons for the increase in expenditure. Discussion should not re-open the question of policy involved in the original grant.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee on the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure to be defrayed from Railways and Harbours Revenue Funds during the year ending 31 March 1962, and on the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works to be defrayed during the same period.</block>

<p>As hon. members will note from the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure from revenue funds, which I have already tabled, provision is being made for additional expenditure amounting to R4,333,552 which will have to be incurred during the current financial year. However, appreciable savings have been effected, so that the additional funds now being asked for will not increase the amount already voted in the Main Estimates and the First Additional Estimates for the present financial year.</p>

<p>The original Estimates provided for an amount of R419,396,200, the First Additional Estimates for R56,421,942, and these Additional Estimates for R4,333,552; i.e. a total amount of R480,151,694. It will be noted from the latest Estimates tabled that savings are estimated at R49,583,494, so that the total revised Estimates now amount to R430,568,200.</p>

<p>I want to inform the House that the salaries of Railway Commissioners have been increased from R6.000 to R6,800 per annum as from 1 April 1961. It will be noted that in the present Estimates under the head Miscellaneous Costs, against which their salaries are debited, additional funds are not being asked for because of savings which are expected to be made under this head as a whole. I intend, however, when the Finance Bill is introduced later this Session, including a paragraph which will make provision for the necessary approval to be granted by Parliament in this regard.</p>

<p>Hon. members will therefore be able to debate this matter during the Main Budget debate, if they so desire.</p>

<p>I briefly want to explain the factors which are responsible for the additional funds being asked for.</p>

<p>The most important item under Railways is the one under Head No. 2&#x2014;Maintenance of Permanent Way and Works&#x2014;which is due to increased Sunday time and overtime payments, the consolidation of cost-of-living allowances, salary concessions to clerical and related personnel, and also increased expenditure due to washaways and maintenance of the permanent way.</p>

<p>There is an increase of R761,984 under Head No. 4&#x2014;Running Expenses&#x2014;chiefly caused by increased Sunday time and overtime payments to trained staff and higher expenditure on coal and electrical power due to an increase in traffic and the increased price of coal.</p>

<p>I feel, Mr. Speaker, that I must come back for a moment to the amount I mentioned as being savings, because I am afraid that perhaps there may be a misconception. It is the amount of R49,583,494 which I mentioned. This may perhaps be understood to be a saving on the general running costs of the Railways. But this is mainly the savings effected on the payment of cost-of-living allowances as the result of consolidation. Originally in the Estimates provision was made for the payment of this amount as cost-of-living allowances; when consolidation took place the payment of cost-of-living allowances of course fell away. I would not like the country to be under a misapprehension that such a considerable amount was saved in other ways.</p>

<p>The increase of R697,042 under Head No. 5&#x2014;Traffic Expenses&#x2014;is also due to the improved salary scales of clerical and related personnel, additional Sunday time and overtime payments, consolidation of cost-of-living allowances, and also an increase in the cost of supplies and equipment, due to the increase in traffic.</p>

<p>The provision of R487,360 under Head No. 12&#x2014;Subsidiary Services&#x2014;is mainly due to increased repairs to road motor vehicles which have been in service for an appreciable time already.</p>

<p>The increase of R53,884 under Interest on Superannuation and other funds&#x2014;Head No. 15&#x2014;arises as the result of the increase in the Insurance Fund balance and the Elimination of Railway Crossings Fund.</p>

<p>The amount under Head No. 17&#x2014;Miscellaneous Expenditure&#x2014;represents a large number of smaller items arising from unforeseen circumstances. The first amount of R95,000 under this head is required to strengthen the <span class="col_1435-1436" refersTo="page_734"/>Benevolent Fund in order to cover the payment of special allowances to the increased number of pensioners and the recipients of widows&#x2019; pensions.</p>

<p>Certain investments have been realized during the financial year and re-investment at appreciably higher rates of interest. It is true that the cost connected to this amounts to R177,548, but the transactions will in the long run be of considerable financial advantage to the Administration.</p>

<p>The amount of R30,248 under Bad Debts and Sundry Items represents a number of relatively minor items consisting mainly of under-charges in regard to railage.</p>

<p>In the Main Estimates provision has been made for a nominal amount of R12,000 in respect of the repayment of amounts retained as penalties for liquidated damages due to delayed deliveries by contractors, but the actual amount required for this is R90,000 more.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 24&#x2014;Interest on Capital: Harbours&#x2014;an amount of R76,201 is being asked for because the actual interest-bearing expenditure has amounted to a larger sum than was provided for in the original Estimates.</p>

<p>The increase of R208,826 under Head No. 28&#x2014;Airways: Exploitation and Maintenance&#x2014; was due to an increase in services with accompanying higher expenditure&#x2014;mainly fuel.</p>

<p>An additional amount of R 100,424 is required for interest on capital, particularly as the result of increased working capital in respect of spare parts for Boeing aircraft.</p>

<p>The amount of R1,250 under Head No. 30 &#x2014; Miscellaneous Expenditure &#x2014; represents a number of smaller items, whilst the amount of R34,500 is required in respect of the S.A. Airways&#x2019; share of compensation which in terms of a pool agreement is paid by B.O.A.C. to Central African Airways for losses on regional traffic.</p>

<p>In regard to the Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works, I just want to say the following. In the Second Additional Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works provision is made for an amount of R2,517,000 which has to be voted to cover expenditure under various heads. It will, however, not be necessary to obtain additional loan funds to defray this expenditure, seeing that sufficient savings are available for that purpose.</p>

<p>Of the additional amount of R2,031,000 under Head No. 2&#x2014;New Works on Open Lines&#x2014;almost half is required to cover delayed debits of more than R2,000 for each work in respect of works which were expected to have been completed by the end of the previous financial years. That is in accordance with Resolution No. 6 in the Second Report of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours, 1949.</p>

<p>I shall deal briefly with the most important items in the Estimates.</p>

<p>During the building of the railway line Ogies/Van Dyksdrif&#x2014;as authorized by Construction Act No. 38 of 1946&#x2014;an agreement was entered into with the mining company Transvaal Consolidated Land and Exploration Company Ltd., in terms of which the Railway Administration must compensate the company for loss of profits in respect of coal which cannot be developed as the result of the building of the railway line. Payment in terms of the agreement was to take place when the coal, during the normal working of the mine, would have been developed. This stage has already been reached and a claim for the amount of R650,000 must now be paid. A special power of attorney for payment of this amount has already been obtained from the State President.</p>

<p>As the result of the terrain conversion schemes necessary to provide for the quadrupling of the Natal main line between Durban and Booth, the terrain at Congella is being abandoned, and the activities shifted to the marshalling yard at Bayhead. It has, therefore, become necessary, in order to ensure the smooth flow of traffic, to provide staging roads at Churchill Road which will serve as receiving and despatch depots. This work is being carried out simultaneously with the doubling and electrification of the railway line between Alice Street and Duff&#x2019;s Road. It is expected that the amount of R177,900 will be required for this purpose during the current financial year. A special power of attorney has already been received from the State President for this amount.</p>

<p>Further, an amount of R350.000 is required to defray betterment expenditure in respect of various relaying projects.</p>

<p>Of the additional amount of R182,300 provided for under Head No. 3&#x2014;Rolling Stock&#x2014; R109,600 is intended for the replacement of bell buffers on locomotives and coal trucks by automatic couplers. This is a safety measure, it speeds up shunting and to a large extent eliminates the high maintenance costs of the old type of couplings. The balance of R72,700 is required for delayed debits.</p>

<p>The additional amount of R110,200 under Heads Nos. 5 and 7 represent delayed debits in respect of works not included in the Estimates of the current year, in view of the fact that it was expected that they would be completed before 31 March 1961.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 8&#x2014;Working Capital (Recoverable Advances)&#x2014;provision is made for an amount of R150,000 advanced to the Sick Fund of the S.A.R. &amp; H. There are indications that the working results of the Sick Fund for the current financial year will show an appreciable deficit, which is mainly due to the increased expenditure on Sick Fund services, viz. the services of doctors and specialists, hospitalization, drugs and medicine. This increase in expenditure is firstly due to the abolition of free hospitalization in the Cape Province and the Transvaal, the increased hospital tariffs and the fact that more patients <span class="col_1437-1438" refersTo="page_735"/>were admitted; secondly, the increased expenditure on drugs and medicine is due to the fact that new and more expensive preparations were used; thirdly, the increased utilization of auxiliary services and the services of specialists; and, fourthly, because it was found necessary to increase the salaries of Railway doctors and specialists in order to keep pace with the latest developments in this sphere. A special power of attorney has been obtained from the State President for this amount.</p>

<p>The balance of R43,500 under Head No. 8 is required to finance the building of a private branch line for Messrs. Ingeni Quarries (Pty.) Ltd., to whom the contract for the supply of ballast to the Railways on the north coast line has been awarded. The company is not able itself to finance the work connected with the building of the branch line and the Railway Administration is advancing the necessary funds on condition that the whole amount be repaid during the term of the contract which expires in September 1964. The conditions attaching to the agreement entered into afford sufficient protection of the interests of the Administration.</p>

<p>When the First Additional Estimates for the year 1961-2 were passed, it was the intention that the works for which provision was made in it would be financed from loan funds and the Betterment Fund, as set out in the Third Schedule to Act No. 63 of 1961. Sufficient savings, however, have now been effected under other heads to finance those works, as also those contained in these second additional Estimates. Therefore, there is no necessity to obtain additional loan funds, and a special paragraph in that regard has been included in the Additional Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill.</p>

<p>I intend introducing my Budget for the financial year 1962-3 on 7 March 1962, and in the circumstances I trust that these Additional Estimates will not take up too much of the time of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the almost minute detail in which he has dealt with the main items of these additional expenditures. I am thankful that he was able to pass me a copy of his speech just as he started to make it; but he will realize that even with that advantage it is difficult to follow all the reasons that he has given to justify these additional demands. As is usual we will leave the detailed examination of some of the items to those members on this side who feel they would like to raise them at a later stage in Committee.</p>

<p>From the copy of the speech which I have here. Sir, it seems that we have before us for consideration Estimates of Additional Expenditure for some R4.3 million to be defrayed from Railway and Harbour Revenue Funds for this financial year and the sum of some R2.5 million on capital and betterment works, bringing the revised total, in that respect, to some R106.3 million. If I might go back just temporarily, Sir, to the additional expenditure from Revenue Funds, it now adds up to a total of estimated expenditure of R480 million. There are so-called savings of R49&#x00BD; million and the total revised figure now is some R430.5 million. I said &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; savings, because very often what is given off as savings is really the result brought about by optimistic over-estimation and not really actual savings at all. It is, in fact, overprovision. We have always asked the Minister to watch those tendencies carefully. We hope he will be more careful in future than he has been on all of these previous occasions. On capital and betterment works so-called savings that are not available to meet excess expenditure, amount to some R28.5 million, leaving a total of revised estimates there of some R77.7 million. I notice in the Minister&#x2019;s explanation that in the matter of the increase in the salaries of Railway Commissioners, he will regularize the increase of R800 later in the Finance Bill. We are grateful for his explanation in that regard. I notice that he did not give any explanation in respect of the gratuitous payment to one of the members of the Commission. He was significantly silent and that item will be closely examined when we go into Committee.</p>

<p>I may say, Sir, that it is not easy for us, as &#x201C;shareholders&#x201D; in the Railways (as we have been described by the Minister), to have more than a vague idea of what the financial position of the Railways is, as of now. One of our functions, and a function which we are trying with difficulty to fulfil in this debate, is to exercise a financial check on the Government and on the Railway Administration. We find it extremely difficult to do so when the latest figures that we have available are those for October. And these are published in the <i>South African Railway News</i> for December which in turn was only made available to us on 6 February. It makes it extremely difficult, Sir. I did address a question to the hon. the Minister earlier this Session asking him to give us more up-to-date figures. He replied and said that he would make more recent figures known in the main Budget on 7 March. I had, of course, no alternative but to accept that unsatisfactory state of affairs, As I say, the Minister must be aware&#x2014; and I hope his action is not deliberate&#x2014;that this makes it exceedingly difficult for us to criticize his financial expenditure in a way that we would like to do. At on time, as the hon. the Minister knows, we used to get weekly statements of revenue earnings for all services but those have been discontinued. They are now published in the <i>Gazette</i> but the <i>Gazette</i> appears rather late for our purposes. The Minister discontinued this service to us because, as he claimed, they only gave one side of the picture and therefore gave a false and erroneous impression. Yet the Minister himself must get weekly figures. He must get a profit and loss account every week. So I beg of him to try to see if he cannot supply us with up-to-date information so that we can discuss the financial position of the Railways and criticize Additional Appropriations more intelligently than is now possible.</p>

<p>I see that these expenditures contain, amongst other things, as the Minister has pointed out, a sum of some R45 million in &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; savings. I think the Minister said&#x2014;I hope I heard him clearly&#x2014;that this really was in relation to the non-payment of cost-of-living allowances &#x2026;</p>

<p>I thought so, but as I said, we too should be allowed a little bit of latitude in this matter. I am glad that the Minister has confirmed my thoughts.</p>

<p>We also have an item here which shows that on Loan Vote Capital Expenditure R20,000,000 was not called upon. I should like to ask the Minister if he realizes the possible serious consequences of that practice of over-provision for this country. When the Railways ask for these loan facilities and do not use them, it must of necessity crowd out the loan requirements of other Departments and it might in that way retard our economic progress.</p>

<p>This is Gilbertian. It seems that this gentleman was prematurely retired at his own wish, but did not really want to retire. His services were so valuable that he was retained by the Administration in another responsible capacity. I realize that the Minister is not always his own master in his own house. In this case he had to obey another, bigger boss. I suggest that his explanation is rather superficial; that the real reason is something entirely different from what he tells us. I suggest further that it is a bad principle for railway commissioners to be drawn from the ranks of politicians. We have had Dr. van Abo as a railway commissioner for some time. He represented engineering interests and he knew his job thoroughly. He is now taken away from his semi-technical job to make way for yet another politician on the Railway Board. Using the Railways for political purposes is not correct. The Minister knows that the 1909 Act says that the railway commissioners should be nonpolitical. I am afraid all parties have erred in the past by making political appointments. But it is high time this practice ceased. I think the Minister should stop it. The Railways and Harbours Board was originally intended to protect the Railways and Harbours from political influences. It was intended to see that the administration of the Railways did not come under undue interference from the Government. This Minister has departed from that policy entirely. I am sure that in the interests of the Railways, the Minister should not allow this process to proceed any further. If Dr. van Abo had been replaced by an engineer I would have had nothing against it. But he merely had to make way as the result of a political manoeuvre. Dr. van Abo had to go to make way for Mr. de Villiers so that Mr. Waring could take his Vasco seat. That is not the right way to run a business, and the Railways should be run on business lines. I am sure the Minister in his heart of hearts disapproves as strongly as I do of this political manoeuvring to get a so-called English-speaking member into this House. It should not take place. I would like to know whether the Minister really approves of this whole sordid transaction?</p>

<p>I do not quite agree with the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). He correctly stated that this was the practice of all previous Governments. I know that when we took over Mr. Louis Esselen was the General Secretary of the United Party, but he was a member of the Railway Board, and also Mr. Teichman. This was the usual practice in the past. But I think it is valuable to have politicians, or at least ex-politicians, on the Railway Board. It is necessary, particularly when you deal with staff matters, that you should have a man there who has concentrated on staff matters during his political career and who has come into contact with the staff and knows their requirements. So I certainly do not agree that there should be no politicians on the Railway Board. I think they serve a very useful purpose indeed.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What has Queenstown got to do with it? The hon. member does not know what he is talking about. He is probably still regretting Queenstown. I might say also that the gentleman who was appointed, Mr. de Villiers, is a man whom I find fully competent to do the work and I think he is a valuable acquisition to the Railway Board. The Railway Board occupies quite a different position to-day from what it did just after 1910, as the hon. member knows. To-day, to a large extent, the Railway Board is merely an advisory body. It has no executive function, except that it is the final court of appeal in regard to appeals lodged by the staff. Apart from that, it of course has certain functions in regard to finances. I personally think that the Railway Board should be balanced. The chairman of the Board is an economist who has the respect of everybody who knows him. and the other two members, Mr. du Plessis and Mr. de Villiers, are known to hon. members of this House. Both of them were chairmen of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours. I think the knowledge they have of railway matters in general and of staff matters in particular is very valuable to any member of the Railway Board. This has nothing to do with politics. It is quite incidental that a vacancy was created for Mr. de Villiers and as the result of his appointment Minister Waring was nominated in his seat, <span class="col_1443-1444" refersTo="page_738"/>but although it was incidental I think it is a very good thing that it did happen.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Minister should be more frank and less warying about this situation. The hon. the Minister quoted Section 136 of the South Africa Act to justify the item which appears on the Estimates. Sir, Section 125 of the South Africa Act says that the salaries of the commissioners shall be fixed by Parliament and shall not be reduced during their term of office. Therefore, when Mr. van Abo was appointed, Parliament, in one way or another, fixed his terms of remuneration, and this is not within the provisions of Section 136 at all. It is something over and above what was fixed upon in terms of Section 136, and it is not a salary because that is what Section 136 says shall be fixed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<p>You mean Section 126.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, I am quoting from Section 126, which says that the salary shall be fixed by Parliament, and presumably that was done in some way. There is, therefore, no justification for what the Minister originally explained, because this is a gratuity, and I think the Committee is entitled to fuller details as to why this gratuity is being granted, on what basis it is calculated and for what purpose it is being granted. Therefore, I think the Minister should be a little more frank.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>May I just explain to the hon. member that Section 126 provides for the fixing of salaries, but this gratuity scheme was formulated in 1956. It is not a special gratuity scheme merely for the retiring commissioner, Dr. van Abo. As a matter of fact, the widow of Hr. Haywood, who died last year&#x2014;Parliament agreed to it and she received a gratuity in terms of that scheme. So this is not a new thing. It was actually introduced in 1956. Similar gratuity schemes were introduced for members of different boards some years ago, and the Railway Commissioners were brought into line with the members of certain boards.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to raise two matters with the hon. the Minister under (d) and (e). The Minister explained that the increase under (d), bad debts and sundry items including <i>ex gratia</i> refunds, was due to a large number of small items having been added. Sir, the increase here is in the nature of a 75 per cent increase and I think the Committee is entitled to a more explicit explanation as to why such a large increase has come about, because this certainly is not a case where a nominal amount was put on the original Estimates. The amount provided in the original Estimates was R40,000, whereas it has now been increased by 75 per cent.</p>

<p>Then I would also like the Minister to deal with (e), where the increase is from R12,000 to R90,000. There the Minister did explain that the R12,000 was merely a nominal provision. Will the Minister tell us what was the expenditure under this head the previous year, so that there may be some sort of comparison? R90,000 is being provided for the year 1961-2, but there is nothing to indicate what the comparative figure was in 1960-1. Will the Minister please give us that information?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to Item (d), bad debts and sundry items including <i>ex gratia</i> refunds, the figure is as follows. The increase is due to provision being made for an anticipated net increase&#x2014;an amount of R18,245 owing to the Administration by Messrs. Union Steel Corporation of South Africa Ltd. in respect of railage undercharged on traffic hauled locally between private sidings is being written off as a charge against bad debts and sundry items, the undercharge having arisen through the Administration&#x2019;s error and unfortunately having become prescribed; and R20,446 represents portion of under-charges due to the wrong rate being charged on consignments of ammunition consigned during the period June 1956 to February 1958 by the British Admiralty from Jan Kemp Dorp to Simonstown. The amount is being written off as even on legal grounds it is doubtful whether the recovery could be made. The <i>ex gratia</i> refund of R518 was made to Clerk P. A. van Straten, being portion of the cost of repairs and renovations recovered from him on a property re-allocated under the house ownership scheme on his transfer for departmental reasons. The property was reallocated in error as it was defective and should have been disposed of. That accounts for the total amount R30,248.</p>

<p>With regard to Item (e), that is increased <span class="col_1445-1446" refersTo="page_739"/>provision required in respect of refunds in justifiable circumstances of amounts claimed by contractors as damages for late deliveries. The hon. member knows that there is a penalty clause in all the contracts and a certain amount is retained for late deliveries, but when the contractor makes out a good case for a refund of the whole amount, or part of it, it is considered by the Administration and a refund is made.</p>

There is an existing water supply and certain repairs had to be done. A float chamber, a float and a valve had to be fitted to the pump.

That was estimated by both the mining company and by the Railway Administration, and I think they also called in the assistance of the Department of Mines.

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<p>In line 6, to omit &#x201C;an act or omission in conflict with a&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a breach of&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The amendment is a very simple one and it logically follows on the contention advanced on this side of the House during the second reading debate. The intention of the Bill is to restore the Roman Dutch law principle dealing with penalties and liquidated damages. That being so I think it would be wise to adhere as closely as possible to the language which is used by the courts and their interpretation of the original principle in giving effect to it. I know that it might be argued that the words &#x201C;an act or omission in conflict with a contractual obligation&#x201D; is in fact a breach. If that argument is to be used, then all I can say is that it seems to me to be an argument in favour of the adoption of the simpler term &#x201C;a breach of&#x201D;, because that is the language which is well known in the judicial world, and significantly enough, it would then also bring the section into line with the marginal note. The marginal note to this clause says, &#x201C;stipulations for penalties in case of breach of contract to be enforceable&#x201D;, and since the marginal note uses what I consider the correct terminology I cannot see any justification for leaving it out of the clause itself. We have no conflict with the hon. the Minister in regard to the provisions of the Bill, and the purpose of my amendment is rather to avoid confusion and not to add an additional difficulty in the interpretation of a principle which is now going to be set out by statute instead of being part of our common law. I hope the hon. the Minister will give consideration to this suggestion because I do not think it does anything to harm the provision which is contained in the clause, but I do think it makes its interpretation simpler.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I had the opportunity of discussing the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment with the law advisers, and my information in this connection is that the Law Revision Committee considered this matter very thoroughly and that the text of this Bill is the responsibility of this Committee generally. It is just possible&#x2014;at this stage I do not want to say that is so&#x2014;that if we accept the words proposed by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) we shall be accepting something with a narrower meaning than the words actually contained in this clause. I have already said that the Law Revision Committee as a whole accepted responsibility for the drafting of this Bill as far back as 1950. The then chairman of the Law Revision Committee is a person who is not unknown to my hon. friends on the other side. I refer to His Honour Mr. H. A. Fagan. Who am I to quarrel with his words in a Bill of this kind? These words were chosen with great circumspection, and since the dispute here is not on a matter of principle but purely a matter of wording and since my information from the law advisers is that this correctly sets out what the entire Law Revision Committee decided, I do not think we should split hairs about words &#x2014;we should rather leave the wording as it stands here. I do not say that because I do not want to meet the hon. member; I say it because I want to guard myself against the possibility that a different interpretation may then be placed upon this text. In those circumstances I am sorry that I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

It is a well-known term. When they go and see their lawyers they can advise them what that means, and it just may mean something different, and if it does mean something different then I think some explanation other than that the Law Revision Committee wants it to remain should be given.

<p>Well, then, someone along the line, presumably the law adviser, has seen the advisability of choosing what I believe and what my hon. friends over here and what I believe the Minister believes is the correct term and that is &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;. I think it is a pity that we should not deal with the matter as I believe we ought to deal with it. I think we should use the language that we are all agreed upon. I do not think that we should use different language merely for the reason that a different body, not the legislative body, has chosen different words. I have little doubt, knowing the stature and the ability of the men in question, that if the argument had been put to them, they might well have said, &#x201C;yes, we believe that is the best language to use&#x201D;. It is quite evident that the law advisers regard the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; as the better term because that is the term that they have introduced into the marginal note. I agree with the hon. the Minister that there is no principle involved here, except the principle that legislation passed by this House should be couched in the best form in which we can put it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. FOUCH&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to make it clear at the very outset, for the sake of the record, that the hon. the Minister mentioned the name of a prominent jurist here simply to show the House and hon. members on the other side that the members of the Law Revision Committe, who asked for this Bill and for the wording in this clause, are enlightened and well-read people. They are people with legal experience, and I resent the fact that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) sought to attribute to the Minister an attitude which the Minister did not adopt. Then I want to say that I agree with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) that as far as possible we should try to draft our legislation in the correct words. I would also say to the hon. member that as I see this matter I would say that the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; as proposed by him would be the most convenient term to use in this clause. But the point is that the Law Revision Committee asked for this Bill, and the people who serve on that Law Revision Committee are people who have to do with the practical working of this measure from day to day. They are the people who asked for this wording. The hon. the Minister has told us that these are the words for which they asked. I want to appeal to hon. members not to come along and say that the hon. the Minister is shielding behind the Law Revision Committee. The point is that the Law Commission asked for these words. Let me say, as the hon. the Minister also stated, that we can see no objection to the words proposed by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) but the Law Revision Committee asked for these words with a specific purpose and. as the hon. the Minister has said, it is possible that having accepted this amendment and having amended the Bill as proposed by the hon. member, we may then find that the words accepted by us do not have the same scope as the words for which the Law Revision Committee specifically asked. If anything then goes wrong the responsibility would be on the shoulders of the hon. the Minister and on the shoulders of this whole House. I would therefore appeal to hon. members to accept this wording.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield has now repeated what the hon. the Minister said, namely, that the Revision Commission has asked for this clause to be passed and that the Revision Commission drafted the Bill which they presented to us. We on this side of the House, as also the hon. member for Smithfield, agree that the words &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; are preferable. It is a term which we all understand. But the Minister says, and so does the hon. member for Smithfield, that we must accept the wording as drafted by the Revision Commission because the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; may not cover what they intended. Now I submit that if that is so, we should rather find out from the Revision Commission what the objection is against the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; because if they intended these words that they use &#x201C;act or omission&#x201D; to mean something else than a breach of contract, we should know, Sir. We are passing the law. The Revision Commission is not passing the law and if those words mean something else than &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;, we in this House should know exactly what they do mean. On the other hand, if they do mean nothing else but &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; then we appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept the accepted phrase, the words we have all become accustomed to using. We know exactly what &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; means. If there is a chance of these words &#x201C;act or omission&#x201D; meaning something more than &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;, as the hon. the Minister himself said, then we have no right to pass this Bill. We must know exactly what it means. My difficulty is this: Some of the members of the Law Revision Committee may sit in judgment on this Act, and the ordinary interpretation by the laymen and by the lawyers may be one thing, but when the matter is taken before a court on which may be sitting some of the members of the Law Revision Committee, they will interpret it as they intended it to be. It may not be what the Legislature intended it to be. The Legislature, as far as I can make out from what the hon. member for Smithfield said and what the Minister said, intends that it should merely cover a breach of contract. If that is our intention, we should say so, and we should not then use words which may have some other meaning, as was submitted by the Minister himself.</p>

I don&#x2019;t know that there is no difference between these two terms &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; and &#x201C;act or omission in conflict The one that we know should remain if there is no difference.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister may say that we know them both. That is correct. We know both expressions, but this is intended to apply in the event of a breach of contract. Now if they are the same thing, then why is a different expression used from the one which is known to all lawyers, to all laymen, to all businessmen, to all the Judges? If they are in fact synonymous it is very odd that different expressions are being used, and it makes one think that in fact the meaning of &#x201C;an act or omission in conflict&#x201D; is something different. <i>Prima facie</i> it is something different. You can have an act or omission which is in conflict with a contractual obligation but is not necessarily a breach of that contractual duty. I mention that here because it is something that occurs to one by just looking at it. The words don&#x2019;t mean the same thing, and I must remind the hon. the Minister that when provision was made in the Act of 1935, when this matter came up the last time in this House, provision was made for precisely the same principle as is involved in this Bill and that Bill also went to the Law Revision Committee, and the members of that Law Revision Committee were also very distinguished people, possibly even more distinguished people, and the expression which they used in the 1935 Act was &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D;. Now here is an expression used which our law does not know, and I am surprised at the hon. member for Smithfield adopting the attitude he has adopted. He knows that this expression is not to be found in the Roman-Dutch Law, let alone in our case law. I appeal again to the hon. the Minister to accept the amendment in the interest of the ordinary business people who will be called upon to make contracts.</p>

On that point we were entirely <i>ad idem.</i> I have told hon. members that the reason why I do not want to accept the words proposed by them is that there is a possibility that the term &#x201C;breach of contract&#x201D; may be capable of a narrower interpretation than the words &#x201C;act or omission in conflict with a contractual obligation&#x201D;.

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Here is another instance where I certainly am not happy about the phraseology which is being used in the clause, and significantly again, it is the marginal note which I think gives correct expression to the <span class="col_1459-1460" refersTo="page_746"/>law as we always have understood it. Here again there has been introduced into this legislation the words &#x201C;out of proportion to the prejudice suffered&#x201D;. Sir, the legal textbooks that one has reference to and also the decided cases used the word &#x201C;excessive&#x201D;. Here again when the law adviser came into the matter apparently, he used what I believe is the correct term &#x201C;excessive penalty&#x201D;, something which has been interpreted in our courts. I do not want to repeat the arguments we used in regard to the previous clause and I move no amendment, but I would like to have this assurance from the hon. the Minister that the phrasing that is being used will place the onus upon the party seeking to avoid payment to establish these words &#x201C;out of proportion to the prejudice suffered&#x201D;. I want to have the assurance from the hon. the Minister that the law advisers are convinced that is the position. Then I would also like to know whether the adoption of this new phraseology is going to put a different onus on either party to litigation than what exists under the Common Law as it has always been applied? It seems to me that we are possibly putting a heavier onus on one or other of the litigants than would otherwise have been the case had we simply used the straightforward language &#x201C;that the penalty was excessive&#x201D;. During the second reading debate, I quoted to the hon. the Minister the terms of the judgment in the case of the Pearl Assurance Company in 1933, where it was, I thought, very clearly put that where a fixed amount has been stipulated to be paid by one party to a contract, in the event of a breach, such an amount is <i>prima facie</i> recoverable and the onus is on the party seeking to avoid payment of the penalty to prove that the penalty is excessive. That seems to me very straightforward and simple language, and I would like to have an explanation of the hon. the Minister on these two points.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised this matter in the course of the second reading debate. There are two issues to bear in mind in this connection. In the one case you have to deal with a default judgment and in the other case you have a contested claim. In the case of a contested claim, naturally, the onus will be on the applicant or the plaintiff&#x2014;in any case the man who avers must prove his case. That is the general law. So there we will have no difficulty. The only case where we can have a difficulty at all is on the question of a default judgment. There the general rule would be that where the other party is in default, the court will automatically give judgment in favour of the party asking for it and the fact that the other party is in default will bring about that the court will not query the statements in the pleadings of the plaintiff. But as in every default judgment, the court has the right to refuse default judgment under certain circumstances, and so in this matter, in the case of a default judgment if on the fact of it the amount asked, is absurd to such an extent that it is out of all proportion to the damage suffered, the court will have the right to go into the matter and to ask further proof.</p>

<p>As I understood him, the hon. the Minister said that in the case of a default judgment, being a case where the &#x201C;guilty party&#x201D; does not come to court to contest the matter, the matter will not be raised by the court of its own motion. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister there bears in mind that certainly under the Cape rules of court, and I think also under the Transvaal rules, where it is a question of damages on a default judgment, it is necessary for the applicant for such judgment to prove his damages. And as the hon. the Minister will know, it is essential for the applicants to file pleadings setting out the damages and so forth, and it is necessary for those damages to be proved in the ordinary course.</p>

<p>With respect, where the claim made is for damages, and there is no appearance entered, it is still essential for a declaration to be filed, (which is not so in the case of the ordinary liquidated claim) and for the plaintiff or applicant, as the case may be, to prove his damages. And the hon. the Minister will know in default judgments you do in fact get the applicant or the plaintiff leading evidence where in fact damages are being claimed, and I am wondering what the position will be under this particular provision.</p>

<p>It may be a penalty, but it is a penalty in the nature of damages, and I wonder therefore whether in fact the Minister&#x2019;s interjection is a reply to it. If it is not, certain consequential points may follow. As <span class="col_1461-1462" refersTo="page_747"/>the hon. the Minister will know, with the Hire-Purchase Act, you have a similar sort of situation. There it is left to the courts of their own motion to consider whether the damages are excessive. As the hon. the Minister will know, in that case it is the practice of applicants seeking default judgment to file an affidavit setting out what in fact they have suffered by way of damages, and a court will not grant judgment in the absence of such an affidavit. They insist upon such an affidavit, and I am wondering whether that will be the position here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>As far as this matter is concerned we have nothing to do at all with damages which have to be proved, because there is nothing to prove in view of the fact that it has already been stipulated in the contract that in the case of an act or omission you will be bound by what is contained in the contract. When it comes to an application for judgment by default therefore, you do not have to prove anything. You would proceed in precisely the same way that you would have proceeded if, for example, you had claimed the delivery of a motor-car. The question of proof plays no role at all there. After all, the basic difference between the English legal principle and the Roman Dutch legal principle, which we are restoring here, is that I am no longer called upon to come to court to prove that the amount specified in the contract is the predetermined damage I suffered, but that is the amount on which we agreed. That is the only question with which the court is concerned. In other words, where judgment is given by default the court does not want to know whether that is the amount of damage I suffered or whether it is not the amount of damage that I suffered. The court is only concerned with the fact that it is stipulated in my contract that I undertake to pay this or to do that. That is the only issue with which the court is concerned at that stage and consequently there is no question of proving any other item except the fact that is what the contract stipulated. I cannot therefore share the hon. member&#x2019;s objection.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This is a small Bill to amend the principal Act of 1928 and is being introduced at the request of the Pharmacy Board. The Bill consists of only four clauses of any real significance: Clause 2 amends Section 22 of the principal Act; Clause 3 amends Section 32 of the principal Act; Clause 7 amends Section 65<i>bis</i> of the principal Act and Clause 8 amends Section 82 of the principal Act. All the others are mainly consequently amendments.</p>

<p>The first section that is being amended is Section 22 of the principal Act which deals with registration and reciprocity between countries. According to the existing Section 22 the State President has the right to prescribe what degrees, whether they have been obtained in South Africa or overseas, a doctor or a dentist or a chemist should have in order to practise in South Africa. The law provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that three requirements should be complied with before a degree obtained overseas can be recognized in South Africa. In the first place, the person who holds such an overseas degree must be entitled to practise in that country. In other words, a person holding a degree of another country must also be able to practise in that country. The second requirements is that a South African should also be able to practise in that country. Thirdly, the overseas degree should not be of a lower standard than the equivalent South African degree entitling a doctor or a dentist or a chemist to practise in South Africa.</p>

<p>The principal Act provides for the State President to make certain exceptions in the case of doctors and dentists but there is no provision entitling the State President to make exceptions in the case of chemists and the Pharmacy Board have now asked for this amendment so that the State President will be entitled <span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_748"/>to make exception in their case as well, in other words, to allow chemists from overseas to practise their profession here in South Africa, but only if they practise that profession at university institutions or at scientific research institutions.</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the amending Bill amends Section 32 of the principal Act. In other words, the provisions in connection with auxiliary services. The S.A. Medical Council has the right to register health personnel, medical auxiliary personnel, such as, for example, masseurs, physiotherapists, speechtherapists, dieticians etc., to let them write examinations and to lay down rules to control them. The chemists now want the same kind of right in connection with auxiliary services as far as their profession is concerned, namely, in the case of pharmaceutical technicians, that is to say technicians who make up pills and capsules etc. and also in the case of unqualified assistants. An unqualified assistant is a person who has already served his apprenticeship as a chemist but who has not as yet written his final examination. The chemists now want the same rights in respect of these people as the Medical Council have in respect to their auxiliary services.</p>

<p>Clause 7 amends Section 65<i>bis</i> of the principal Act and deals with medicines that may be harmful. In 1954 the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Council realized that certain abuses may result from the handling of certain types of medicines.</p>

<p>The hon. member is being frivolous. I shall just repeat what the position is as far as this clause is concerned and I shall try to be as clear as possible so that hon. members may follow the position even though the Bill is not before them. I return to Section 65<i>bis</i> and Clause 7 which amends that section. It refers to medicines which may possibly be harmful. The Medical Council and the Pharmacy Board approached the Government in 1954 because they were concerned about the position that was developing in the country. They were worried that certain abuses might develop in respect of certain classes of medicine; antibiotics. sedatives and the use of hormones, for example. That was why they came to the Government and asked that the law be changed according to amendments which they themselves suggested and which they themselves thought would be good. The principle that they suggested should apply was that not one of these possible harmful drugs should be sold, unless they were sold on a doctor&#x2019;s prescription. In other words, a chemist should not sell these medicines unless a doctor has prescribed them. And they suggested that in order to prevent any abuse the prescription should comply with certain requirements. This was a provision which the Pharmacy Board themselves asked for. They asked that the following should appear on a prescription, and if you look at the existing Act, Sir, you will see that these requirements are stipulated there: On the prescription must appear, in the doctor&#x2019;s own handwriting, the date, the name of the patient, the address of the patient, the name of the medicine, the quantity of the medicine, how often it should be taken, how often the chemist may renew it, the doctor&#x2019;s address, the doctor&#x2019;s qualifications and the doctor&#x2019;s signature. Those were the requirements which had to appear on a prescription in terms of the law. The reason was that the chemists realized that in the best of professions there were always people who contravened the law, and that it should be possible to determine when such contraventions had taken place and to confront the guilty persons with such contravention. That was the reason why they said these requirements were essential. As time went on, however, Mr. Speaker, it was found that certain of those requirements were unnecessary. As a result of that various chemists have made representation to us to amend this section in the Act somewhat. I discussed the matter with members of the Pharmacy Board and after detailed dicussion it was decided that most of those requirements should remain on the prescription but that concession could nonetheless be made.</p>

<p><span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_749"/>That is why the following amendments are suggested in the Bill. In the first place it is still necessary to show the patient&#x2019;s address. It is essential to know who the patient is for whom the prescription was given so as to determine whether the prescription is genuine. But whereas the original Act provides that the doctor himself should fill in the patient&#x2019;s address, that will no longer be necessary. The patient&#x2019;s address may be typed in by the doctor&#x2019;s typiste, or the chemist may even fill it in, but the patient&#x2019;s address must at some time or other be filled in on the prescription. In the second place, it provides that if the doctor does not indicate on the prescription how often the chemist may renew the prescription for the patient, he may only make it up once. In other words, it makes the position of the chemist easier. He knows that if it does not state on the prescription how often, he may only make it up once. In the third place, it has been decided that it will no longer be necessary for the doctor to fill in his address and professional qualifications in his own handwriting on the prescription. That was necessary under the original Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are the amendments which are being effected to the principal Act as far as prescriptions are concerned. It is unfortunately not possible to make further concessions because if you were to make further concessions it would not be possible to protect the public against the abuse of these various medicines.</p>

<p>The hon. member is now trying to make the House look ridiculous. Clause 8 amends Section 82 of the principal Act. It is a very small amendment. Section 82 of the principal Act provides that when methylated spirits is sold in small quantities&#x2014;that is quantities of less than 30 ounces&#x2014;it may only be sold in bottles marked &#x201C;poison&#x201D; and in bottles with a rough surface. As against that the Liquor Act provides that methylated spirits may only be sold in clear-coloured bottles. In other words, the position is that there are two conflicting laws, and in order to do away with this conflict we are effecting this amendment which lays down that in future methylated spirits may also be sold in small quantities in ordinary coloured bottles.</p>

<p>These, Mr. Speaker, are actually the only material amendments which are contained in this small Bill and I hope the House will approve of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we wish to record our objection to the adjournment of the House. We feel that this is no way in which to conduct the business of Parliament. We saw what took place a short while ago when we were expected to discuss a Bill which was not before us. Mr. Speaker, I want to make it quite clear to the Leader of the House that as far as it has been possible he has met us when we have gone to him from time to <span class="col_1467-1468" refersTo="page_750"/>time and asked him to give us some time. In respect of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Amendment Bill the Leader of the House agreed that the hon. the Minister would give his second reading speech and that the debate would then be adjourned. But it was generally understood that the Bill would be available first thing this morning. The position is this, Sir, that to-day is the 24th sitting day of this Session. In 1960 we had had eight evening sittings at this stage; in 1961 we had ten evenings sittings at this stage. And here in 1962, at this stage of the session, we have only had two evening sittings. During this Session so far 32 Bills have been released of which 11 have been passed, 10 have been referred to Select Committees and there are four private Bills. The remainder of the Bills are on the Order Paper and have been disposed of as far as possible this afternoon. In terms of Rule 25 of our Standing Rules and Orders evening sittings should commence after the sixth sitting day. As the Leader of the House indicated earlier during this Session, under the old Rules evening sittings started after the 11th sitting day and he quite rightly suggested that we should revert to the old Rule. But even then, as I have shown already, we have only had two evening sittings at this the 24th day stage of the session. We have never yet had that experience. As I have said, the Leader of the House has accommodated us as far as possible. I suggest, Sir, that Parliament is not functioning properly. Either the number of law advisers must be increased or it will become necessary to publish proposed legislation during the recess so that Parliament will have the legislation introduced at an earlier stage. The Leader of the House has given me a long list of legislation that will come before us this Session and as far as possible the workings between the Whips and the Leader of the House have gone off very smoothly this Session.</p>

<p>We have no complaint as far as the notification of the proposed legislation is concerned. But notification is not enough, Mr. Speaker. What is essential is that the House should see that legislation. The Prime Minister indicated certain Bills that would be introduced in the Senate and even all of those have not been introduced in the Senate. The danger exists that there will be a cluttering up of the Order Paper, particularly as the session advances, when the House will not have adequate time to consider that legislation and where outside interests will not have adequate time to consider it. We have an example of the Group Areas Amendment Bill which the Leader of the House has agreed should be considered next Tuesday. The Leader of the House has given us time before that Bill comes under discussion. But there will be no opportunity for that Bill to be considered at length by people outside who are interested. Local authorities and other people all over the country are interested in the legislation that we pass here and I suggest that the duty of this Parliament is to pass legislation after mature and careful consideration. We have seen the effect of rushed legislation time after time. I think the Leader of the House who has probably had more experience than anybody else in the House of the arrangement of the Order Paper, will be the first to agree with me when I say that there has never before been such a shambles when it came to arranging the Order Paper. It may be due to lack of staff or to a variety of other reasons, but I think it is essential that at this stage we should place our objections on record. This is no way to treat people who come from all parts of the Republic to Parliament. Parliament should sit for its full time and dispose of its business as soon as possible. Officials are brought down from various parts of the country; members of Parliament travel great distances; the country pays for that expense but it does not pay for people to remain idle. We do want evening sittings to discharge our business, to discharge the work of Parliament as speedily as possible in the interests of the country. We also want adequate time to consider the legislation which is being introduced into this House in the interests of the country. We cannot conduct Parliament in this way Mr. Speaker. Legislation is dealt with in a rushed manner and later on in the session we shall have a cluttered-up Order Paper, with Ministers running to and fro between this Chamber and the Other Place; Ministers arriving breathless from duties in the Other Place as happened this afternoon to the Minister of Justice. He rushed in post-haste from the Other Place to attend to business here. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this is the right and proper time to record our protest in the interests of Parliament and in the interests of the country</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am giving you the reasons why the Opposition cannot speak. Had we had their assistance because they were doing their duty, as we feel they ought to do their duty, namely, to study the legislation and to voice their opinion, the legislation which was before Parliament would have been quite enough. We would have had too much legislation as a matter of fact. I think the fact that we cannot sit the whole afternoon or in the evenings, is largely due, I am tempted to say, to their disinterest in the legislation which has been before Parliament. I remember, for example, the Additional Estimates of the Railways which were passed this afternoon. When we were in opposition, we did not allow that to go through within 1&#x00BD; hours, and we must remember that at that time many millions of rand less were involved than to-day. If we have to reproach one another, we can equally reproach them. I want to add that I can introduce the Bill on the Group Areas Act to-morrow. But they asked me in heaven&#x2019;s name to wait with that till Tuesday. That is an important matter and I hope they will have something to say about it. I wanted to place it on the Order Paper to-day, but it was to accommodate them that we have not got it before us to-day. They should, therefore, not complain so much.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is needless for the hon. the Minister to say that we could have gone on with that Bill this afternoon or tomorrow. It is just trifling with this House to talk like that, apart from the fact that tomorrow is private members&#x2019; day. I think the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) has raised a perfectly valid point and I am sorry the Minister of Lands has not dealt with it on its merits. He is just being facetious about it. We are not burning to sit here at night, just for the sake of sitting at night. But we do believe this, that unless we do some night sittings we shall never finish this Session, or else we shall have, as my hon. friend has said, a cluttered-up Order Paper with everyone in a state of distress and unable to do the work properly. The hon. the Minister complains that we have not talked enough this Session, and he boasts about the quite irresponsible and obstructive way in which he behaved when he was a member of the Opposition. We do not take that view. It just happens that most of the Bills that have been introduced this Session &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I do not think the hon. member is entitled to call it obstructive.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I was really referring to the hon. member&#x2019;s disreputable past. [Laughter.] But the fact remains that it is no argument for the Government to say that the Order Paper is as it is at present because the Opposition has not talked enough. If the Opposition exercises its discretion in a responsible manner, when a Bill is introduced in this House, it is judged on its merits, and if it is a good Bill or is desirable, we support it, as the hon. member knows very well. So that is no argument at all. The fact remains that if legislation can be prepared in good time I would not be surprised if it was possible to get through the Session without sitting in the evenings. In fact, it might be a good thing; if Bills were prepared in good time and the House was given adequate notice of those Bills, members might very well sit at home at night and study those Bills to facilitate their passing through the House. But sitting at night itself is not in issue; what is in issue is the working of this House, and I think the hon. the Minister of Lands very tactfully, as well as my colleague here, put his finger on the spot, and that is that there are not sufficient legal draughtsmen available to enable these Bills to be drafted. I do think that if the hon. the Minister of Lands would take our protest in the spirit in which it is uttered, it is not in any way aimed at him or his Whips. The co-operation has been very good this Session, and last session too. If he takes it in the spirit in which it is intended, which is to facilitate the work of the House so that it will work smoothly right throughout the Session, without having the appalling mess-up we often do have towards the end of the session, and if he agrees that the real difficulty lies in getting Bills drafted in order to publish them and introduce them in the House in good time&#x2014;if he takes steps to see that is remedied I think the work of the House will be facilitated and there will be no need for the Opposition to protest now or in the future.</p>

<heading>JURY SYSTEM</heading>

<speech by="#pelser">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in moving this motion which stands in my name and which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that the jury system has no further useful function to fulfil in our administration of justice,</block>

<p>I want to point out immediately that this motion does not deny that the jury system possibly at some stage in the past in fact fulfilled a useful function. In fact, the wording of the motion implies that. There is therefore no difference of opinion on that particular point, and I mention it because I should like to see hon. members confining themselves to the allegation contained in this motion, namely that in present circumstances in this country the jury system has no further useful function to perform in our administration of justice.</p>

<p>When discussing a motion of this nature, I believe it will be useful in the first instance to investigate the origin and history of the jury system; secondly, to point out how the system has gradually been broken down, particularly in this country during the past 50 years; and then to ask ourselves the question: What really are the aims and objects in regard to this system, and to what extent does the system in the present circumstances still comply with those aims and objects? Then finally I want to quote what certain competent persons have said from time to time about this system.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the origin of the jury system there are certainly few subjects of research which have given research workers so many headaches and caused them so much confusion. In fact, there are researchers who have despaired and exclaimed that the jury system is so steeped in antiquity that it confounds all research. Others again believe that the jury system originated in Normandy, which in turn adopted it from the Scandinavian countries. Others again believed that the jury system is typical of and belongs exclusively to the Anglo-Saxons and that it is Anglo-Saxon by nature and in origin. Others believe that the jury system was derived from the courts which the Crusaders established in Jerusalem during the latter part of the eleventh century. Still others believe that the jury system derives from the Roman system where the Praetor, assisted by his Judices, heard trials. Under this system it is the practice that the Judices who assisted the Praetor were each supplied with three plates. On one plate there was only the letter &#x201C;A&#x201D;. It stood for the word &#x201C;Absolvo&#x201D;, or in other words, &#x201C;Absolve&#x201D; or &#x201C;Absolved On the second plate there was a &#x201C;C&#x201D;. That stood for &#x201C;Condemno&#x201D;&#x2014;condemn. On the third one there were the letters &#x201C;NL&#x201D;, which stood for &#x201C;Non Liquet&#x201D;, which meant that the matter was not clear; in other words, the case was not properly proved. After the trial each of the Judices, according to his judgment, put one of these plates into a container. The Praetor then withdrew them and gave his judgment according to which plates were in the majority. Now it is readily admitted that there is great similarity between the Roman system and the jury system, but in spite of that it has been proved conclusively that it is not true that the jury system was derived from the Roman system.</p>

<p>The most generally accepted theory in regard to the origin of the jury system is that it was introduced for the first time and in its most primitive form in England and was used by the Norman conquerers, and we must note that when it was introduced the intention was not to use it for the administration of justice, but to use it for administrative purposes. The Norman conquerors conceived the bright idea that one could use a purely religious institution like the oath also for administrative purposes. If they wanted to arrive at the truth for administrative purposes they considered that the best way of doing so was to put a man under oath&#x2014;and at that time the oath had tremendous power&#x2014;and that if he was under oath he would tell the truth. So it is alleged that this system was, e.g., used in the compilation of the well-known Domesday Book. People in the vicinity were placed under oath to give evidence as to the particular circumstances pertaining to that area. In other words, the first jurors, the first people who were so placed under oath for this particular purpose, were nothing else but witnesses. It was only in the eleventh century, after the old system of trial by ordeal was abolished, that the jury system developed further. You know that trial by ordeal was, for example, that a man had to carry a piece of hot iron for a certain distance, and if he managed to do so he was considered innocent; or there was trial by water, where he had to put his hand into a pot of boiling water and remove an iron ball, <span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_756"/>and if he succeeded in doing so his innocence was proved. The third system was what they called the &#x201C;accursed morsel&#x201D;. The idea was to give a man a piece of dry bread which he had to try to swallow. There was an accompanying prayer to the effect that if he was guilty he should choke. Well, this system had the advantage that the sentence was immediately applied to the so-called guilty person.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I say it is only after this system of trial by ordeal was abandoned in the second half of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth century that the jury system, or the system of jurors, as the Norman conquerors called it, was applied to the administration of justice. From the nature of the matter, this system was originally used for the giving of evidence. People under oath gave evidence and they were known as jurors. Later it happened that those put under oath also became the prosecutors. The jurors became the prosecutors as well. At a certain stage they were both prosecutors and witnesses. It was only later, towards the end of the twelfth century, that the jury system in England was used more or less in the form as we know it to-day, although of course quite in its initial stages. In the thirteenth century this system became properly established, so much so that when the Magna Charta was drafted and King John had to sign it in 1215, the system was established to such a degree that Chapter 29 of the Charta specially provided that, translated very freely, no free man shall be injured either in his person or in his property without the legal judgment of his peers and the law of the land. That is the idea behind the system. We can accept that during the thirteenth century the system had already been established in England, and therefore, Sir, when we discuss this system in the House to-day we must clearly realize that we are discussing a system which is more than 700 years old and which has a tremendous tradition behind it. From the thirteenth century to the second half of the nineteenth century the development of this system took place. Various rules were made and refined. There is the rule as to who may not be jurors, that a juror may not be a relative, that he should have no interest in the case, etc. etc. The other rules developed that the jury should be segregated and that nobody should come into contact with them. You will remember that it was this rule which was recently contravened in the well-known Moodie case, where somebody had been in the presence of the jury.</p>

<p>The rule of unanimity was developed. The jury had to be unanimous. In England all 12 members of the jury had to be unanimous, and there are many interesting tales about how they were forced to arrive at unanimity. They were readily deprived of food and water until they became unanimous. They were carted from one Assize to another until eventually they returned a unanimous verdict. Rules were developed as to how the Judge had to sum up to the jury and regarding what he had to tell them, and the rule developed in regard to what the Judge had to decide and what the jury had to decide&#x2014;the Judge on legal points and the jury on the facts. All kinds of developments took place, but what is of interest to us is that from the early thirteenth century to the second half of the nineteenth century very little was done to derogate from the jury system, except perhaps for the establishment of the Courts of Equity in England. In 1854, in England, for the first time we find something being done to break down the jury system. The system in England right throughout until to-day has been that the jury sits in both civil and criminal cases, but in 1854 it was decided that where the parties to a civil case agreed, a Judge could be asked for and the jury could be eliminated. In 1873 there was further legislation derogating from the jury system, and again in 1883 and, lastly, again in 1933. To-day the position in England, where the system has been in operation for so many years, is that in criminal cases only 5 per cent of cases is tried by a jury. For the rest a Judge is preferred. Approximately between 5,000 and 6,000 cases are tried by a jury, whilst the average number of cases in the higher courts is between 110,000 and 130,000 per annum. In civil cases in England at the moment a jury is used in only between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of cases. In other words, in England itself the system has been broken down to such an extent after 750 years that it is practically only just by way of exception that a jury is used.</p>

<p>This country learnt to know the jury system for the first time shortly after the second British occupation of the Cape in 1806. De Mist instituted investigation into the administration of justice in the Cape Colony and submitted his report, and in 1827 the Royal Charter of Justice was promulgated, and Section 34 of this Royal Charter provided that criminal trials in the Supreme Court would be heard by a Judge assisted by nine jurors, a deviation from what the practice was in England, where the jury consisted of 12 members. Section 43 of the Charter specifically excluded civil cases, and what struck me while reading the Charter was that another section specifically provided that the fact that a person had no knowledge or comprehension of English would not preclude him from serving on the jury in the Cape Colony; he was compelled to serve despite the fact that he did not know English. In terms of this Charter, the Supreme Court was established in 1831 and provision was made for jury lists. Only in 1854 in the Cape Colony was this system also extended to civil cases. In 1852 the system was introduced in Natal for both civil and criminal cases. It also provided for a jury of nine men, but it deviated from the existing practice to the extent that instead of having unanimity a majority of seven would be sufficient to give a competent verdict.</p>

<p>The jury system was extended to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State Republics in the early 1850s, and it was incorporated in both constitutions, but it was limited to criminal <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_757"/>cases. That is significant, and I think the explanation for it is that when the Trekkers left the Cape Colony in 1836 the only system they knew was the jury system in criminal cases, because it was only in 1854 that it was made applicable to civil cases in the Cape Colony, and so they took the existing law with them and applied it only in criminal cases.</p>

<p>In 1910, at the time of Union, the position was that in the Cape Colony and Natal the jury system was used in both civil and criminal cases, whilst in the Transvaal and the Free State it was used only in criminal cases, and it is to be noted that at that stage it was still a requirement that the jury should be unanimous in its verdict. All nine men had to arrive at the same verdict. The first breaking down of the jury system took place in 1914. In 1914 this Parliament passed an Act establishing special courts. The Act provided that if the Attorney-General was of opinion that the administration of justice would suffer, he could report to the Minister of Justice to that effect, and then the Governor-General was empowered to establish a special court where the jury was excluded and which consisted of a Bench of two or three Judges, and it was made applicable in cases of high treason, public violence and riots. In those three cases the jury system was not used and provision was made for them to be heard by special courts. In 1917 there was a consolidation of the criminal procedure laws of the various provinces. Act 31 of 1917 consolidated the criminal procedure and in the first place it reaffirmed the establishment of special courts in cases of high treason, public violence and riots. But, interestingly enough, two other categories were added. The one was any crime in connection with the possession or sale of precious metals or minerals and the other any case concerning the provision of intoxicating liquor to Natives and Coloureds. Originally these cases had, of course, been excluded, and the only reason one can advance for the fact that they were now included here was the realization, even then, that the jury system did not operate properly in cases concerning the provision of liquor or the illegal trading or possession of precious metals and minerals. I hope to say something more about this later. In any case, the special courts were reinstituted.</p>

<p>However, they went a step further and whereas in the past in three of the provinces the verdict of the jury had to be unanimous, they now took over the Natal system and it was provided that a unanimous verdict by seven members of the jury would be competent. That is one of the good things which came from Natal. But the most important of all the provisions in the 1917 Act was that for the first time it provided that the accused could have a choice between trial by jury or by a court consisting of a Judge and assessors. This was a particular deviation and one we should take cognizance of. Up to that stage there had been no exception, except in the case of the special courts, but for the rest all criminal cases had to be tried by a jury. In 1917 for the first time we find that there is a change and that the accused now has the right to choose between trial by a jury or by a Judge and assessors.</p>

<p>In 1927 the jury system in regard to civil matters was abolished in the Cape Province and Natal. It is alleged that what gave rise to it was the train disaster which occurred at Salt River at that time. It was feared that heavy claims would be instituted and it was a well-known fact, in England as well as here, that when claims were instituted and the jury was given the opportunity to lay their hands on a public institution, whether it was the State or a municipality or an insurance company, they went out of their way to award as much compensation as possible. Consequently the Act was passed in 1927 abolishing the jury system in civil cases.</p>

<p>In 1935 the jury system was broken down even much more. In 1935 it was provided that in certain cases the Minister of Justice could order a trial to take place not by a Judge and jury but by a Judge and assessors. Then there is a long list of cases given where the Minister has that power. At that stage the cases in connection with the supply of liquor and the possession of minerals and gold were taken away from the special courts. From time to time further cases were added. In 1948 were added cases where a knowledge of minerology or bookkeeping was required. Then the Minister could also give instructions that the case should be tried in that way. Another matter which was added was contraventions of the Atomic Act, and in 1956 still another case was added. At the present moment these cases comprise the following, and it is worth while paying attention to it because it covers such a wide field. Under the present circumstances, as the law stands at the moment, the Minister of Justice has the right at any time, if the Attorney-General reports to him that he considers it is not in the best interests of the administration of justice for a trial to be heard by a jury, to give instructions that in the following cases the trial will take place before a Judge and assessors: murder and arson and attempts to commit those crimes; prosecutions in terms of Chapter I of the Riotous Assemblies Act and the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act of 1940; prosecutions in terms of Section 33 of the Atomic Act; prosecutions in regard to illicit trading or illegal possession of precious metals and precious stones; prosecutions in regard to the supply of intoxicating liquor to Natives or Coloureds; prosecutions in regard to insolvency; prosecutions in regard to which the facts concerning prescribed material in Section 1 of the Atomic Act will possibly be considered; prosecutions in regard to which facts will probably have to be considered for the proper understanding of which and expert knowledge of bookkeeping, accountancy, geology, minerology or metallurgy may be necessary; prosecutions in connection with a non-White if the accused is a White person, or in connection with a White person if the accused is a non-White; prosecutions in terms <span class="col_1483-1484" refersTo="page_758"/>of paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 11 of the Suppression of Communism Act. If one looks at this list one realizes what a tremendously wide field it covers and in how many cases the Minister of Justice can take away the right of an accused person to be tried by his fellow citizens, and without giving reasons can say that it is not in the interest of the administration of justice and, therefore, he orders that the trial shall take place before a Judge and assessors.</p>

<p>In regard to this particular section I have just referred to, I want to point out in passing in what an invidious position it places any Minister of Justice, particularly in regard to cases where a White man has committed an offence against a non-White, or vice versa. Unfortunately it is a fact that in this country the jury is either too sympathetic or else is prejudiced in such cases. The facts have proved this. Now I can imagine that when a case like this occurs in a particular magisterial district, where it is a White man who is the accused and a non-White who is the complainant, representations will be made to the Minister of Justice to allow the case to be tried by a jury and that he should not make use of his right to have the trial heard by a Judge and assessors. Just imagine in what an invidious position any Minister of Justice is then placed. He is now in the position that if he agrees to a jury trial it is practically certain that the administration of justice will suffer. If he does not agree to a jury trial, it is taken amiss. I want to say frankly that while this particular section is in operation I pity any Minister of Justice who has to take that decision. I feel that if this is the case and when we know for a fact that unfortunately these things do happen, the obvious thing surely is to do away with this section so as to obviate the Minister of Justice being put into this invidious position every time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have already mentioned the special courts of 1914 and 1917 and the exceptions which were made in 1935, but in 1954 we really find the <i>coup de gr&#x00E2;ce</i> being given to the jury system. Whereas formerly it was the rule for a man to be tried by a jury unless he specially asked for a Judge, the position now was just the opposite. In 1954 this Parliament provided that the normal procedure in this country in regard to criminal trials would in future be trial by a Judge with or without assessors, and that the exceptional case would be trial by a jury. Then a jury would have to be specially applied for. This is of course a tremendous blow to the jury system, and to-day we can really no longer say that the jury system is our system. Our normal system is trial by a Judge, without a jury.</p>

<p>But the jury system was also broken down from a different angle. We should remember that in this country we have magistrates&#x2019; courts which are sometimes given increased jurisdiction, and that we even have regional courts. If we realize that our magistrates can try any crime except three, viz. murder, high treason and rape, and if we think of the tremendous number of crimes tried in the magistrates&#x2019; courts with or without increased jurisdiction, as well as in the regional courts, then only do we realize to what extent the jury system has already disappeared. The ordinary magistrate&#x2019;s court has a jurisdiction of six months or R200, and with increased jurisdiction it is one year or R400, and the regional court has a jurisdiction of three years or R600. Only very serious crimes do not fall into this category of three years&#x2019; imprisonment and/or R600 fines. The hon. the Minister said in the Other Place the other day that only 2 per cent of trials are still being heard by a jury, but I think that if we remember that in the magistrates&#x2019; courts, with ordinary or increased jurisdiction, and in the regional courts so many cases are already disposed of which would normally have been tried in the Supreme Court, I wonder whether the Minister&#x2019;s figure should not be halved. My honest opinion is that if we were to make a survey of the criminal cases which were normally heard by the Supreme Court in the past, we would now find it to be less than one per cent.</p>

<p>Now we must ask ourselves: To what extent does the jury system still comply with those cases? As hon. members know, the jury system means that an accused person in certain cases is tried by a court consisting of a Judge and nine jurors, actually laymen, and the underlying idea of the system is not that these nine laymen are more competent to judge than the Judge himself. The idea is not that nine heads are better than one, although it sometimes has that advantage, but the underlying advantage is that the nine jurors will be the peers of the accused. They come from that vicinity and are his peers, as it is called in England. Because they come from that area and know the people and conditions there and are better able to appreciate how people of that class will react in certain circumstances and what goes on in their hearts and minds, the idea is that in this way justice will be better served. That is the underlying idea. It is also said that the system has various advantages. It is said, <i>inter alia,</i> that one advantage is that by making use of this system one can get rid of unpopular legislation, that the jury is in fact a small Parliament established to get rid of such legislation. Secondly, they say, it tempers justice with mercy. Then it is said that a particularly great advantage is that it brings the ordinary man, the man in the street, into contact with the administration of justice. Another advantage they mention is that it relieves the Judge of his tremendous responsibility. I just want to say in passing that this may be so to some extent, but if we remember that the average jury in the final result is guided by the Judge when he sums up to them, I do not think it relieves the Judge of his responsibility if the jury thereafter arrives at their verdict. Everybody knows that when the jury give their verdict it is only a reflection of what the Judge has told them. Let us take the other example they mention, that it tempers justice with mercy. It sounds very <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_759"/>nice, this idea of humaneness at a trial, but then we have to be very careful that it does not become a travesty of the law, and I fear that is what often happens. Instead of tempering justice with mercy, the jury in many instances makes a travesty of justice. I can mention a few examples. I just want to quote what Forsyth says in his book. It is an old book but a particularly good one on this subject&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But can it with equal truth be asserted that juries never acquit in ordinary cases when they ought to condemn? I fear not. This is no doubt the vulnerable point of the system, that feelings of compassion for the prisoner, or of repugnance to the punishment which the law awards, are sometimes allowed to overpower their sense of duty. They usurp in such cases the prerogative of mercy, forgetting that they have sworn to give a true verdict according to the evidence.</block>

<p>And that is unfortunately what happens only too often. Mercy belongs to the executive authority. We should be careful that we do not make a mockery of the law in trying to introduce some human kindness when accused persons are tried. I want to read to you, Sir, what Judge Dowling said in a very well-known case in the Northern Transvaal when a White man and his son were charged with the murder of a non-White whom they had apparently attacked viciously. The evidence was overwhelming. The jury left the courtroom, came back and, instead of giving a verdict of guilty of murder, which very clearly should have been the verdict according to the evidence, they gave a verdict of guilty of common assault. Judge Dowling then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my opinion the accused is a very lucky man; the verdict came as a surprise to me.</block>

<p>If the verdict of a jury is regarded as a surprise by a Judge, I feel that in that case the law has not been watered down by mercy; I feel that a mockery has been made of the law and we should guard against that.</p>

<p>But I want to confine myself particularly to this approach namely that the accused should be tried by his &#x201C;peers&#x201D; as they are called in English. In a country such as England where the jury system originated and where it still operates, you have a homogeneous population, although there are social classes, and I honestly believe that in such a country the jury system, in spite of its weaknesses, operates better than in South Africa. In England, if the accused belongs to the nobility, the jury does not consist of the ordinary man; the jury consists of his &#x201C;peers&#x201D;, twelve &#x201C;lords&#x201D;. If an ecclesiatic is charged, the jury does not consist of the ordinary man, but Bishops form the jury. If the ordinary man is charged, then &#x201C;lords&#x201D; do not serve as members of the jury, but it is the ordinary man who has to listen to the evidence and come to a decision. I do not think anybody in this country can rightly contend that people in this country are tried by their peers. In this country the administration of justice is in the hands of the Whites; the members of the jury are White. The majority of the people in this country are Bantu; a large number are Coloureds, a smaller but nevertheless large section are Asiatic. If we want to be true to this system that a person should be tried by his peers, we should in all fairness see to it that when a Black man is charged, he should be tried by a jury consisting of nine Black persons, because they are the people who know what goes on in his heart and in his mind; they are the people who know what the circumstances are; they are the people who know how he will probably react. How can we contend that a White jury knows the circumstances and the reaction of the Bantu? In that respect we have departed completely from the original idea of what a jury system should be. I am not pleading that we should have Black juries; I am not pleading that we should have Coloured or Asiatic juries. All I am doing is to point out that we cannot on the one hand adhere to this idea of a jury system, the idea that a person should be tried by his peers and on the other hand not allow people to have a jury consisting of their peers. When we do that we make a mockery of our jury system. But take even the case of the White people in this country. Can it be said of all cases that when a jury is empanelled the accused is being tried by his peers? I hope, when I point out at a later stage who may not serve on a jury, that I will convince hon. members that it is extremely doubtful whether an accused is always tried by his peers in the case of Europeans. I want to add that we should remember that in the majority of our criminal cases the accused are usually Black, Coloured or Asiatic. The cases where the accused is White are in the minority. We cannot, on the one hand, adhere to the tradition and the wonderful idea of &#x201C;being tried by your peers&#x201D; and on the other hand allow these things to happen. I feel, therefore, that we should get away from this jury system and that is the reason why I have introduced this motion.</p>

<p>When you read the literature on this subject, Sir, you find that everyone returns to the much-lauded advantage of the jury system, namely that it gives the ordinary man a share in the administration of justice that is supposed to be the particular big advantage of the jury system. The ordinary man is given an opportunity of playing his part in the administration of justice. When you analyse the facts, however, Sir, you find that we are also making a mockery of this. Take South Africa for example. The 10,000,000 Black people are eliminated; they do not have the privilege of sharing in the administration of justice, a privilege which they should have, if we want to follow this system strictly. The Coloureds do not have that privilege, and the Asiatics do not have it. But take the White people. How many White people have it? In the first place the entire female sex is excluded. Hon. members are aware of the fact that although women <span class="col_1487-1488" refersTo="page_760"/>may serve on a jury, they can only do so when the accused is a woman or when the accused is a person under the age of 18 years, and in addition the entire jury must consist of women. You must have a panel of nine members and what happens in this country in actual fact? In this country&#x2014;I speak subject to correction but I am almost 100 per cent sure&#x2014;you will not be able to appoint a single jury consisting of women only. We have controlled that in Cape Town. You simply cannot get a jury consisting of women together for the simple reason that there is not a jury list in respect of women and for the simple reason that they do not apply to serve on a jury. In other words, the entire female population is excluded and do not enjoy this wonderful privilege of sharing in the administration of justice. What is more, they have not been excluded against their will. They want to be excluded; that is why they do not come forward and that is why in the whole of Cape Town you cannot get a jury of nine women. I believe the position is the same in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Durban. I speak subject to correction but I believe that is the position. I am not even speaking about outside districts. In other words, the female sex do not enjoy the so-called wonderful privilege of sharing in the administration of justice.</p>

<p>I now want to show you, Sir, who else are excluded. All male persons under the age of 25 years and over the age of 65 are excluded. A male of 24 years 11 months dare not enjoy the privilege of sharing in the administration of justice and when he is one day over the age of 65 he is also excluded. But those are not the only people who are excluded. Every hon. Minister of ours is excluded and members of the Executive Committee. Not one of them may share in this wonderful privilege. All Judges of the Supreme Court are excluded; members of either House of Parliament are excluded; I believe there is probably good reason for that! Members of the Provincial Council and members of the Executive Committee are excluded; any officer of Parliament or of a provincial council; all ministers of religion are excluded. They may not share in this privilege. Advocates and attorneys duly admitted and actually practising, articled or managing clerks to attorneys, and enrolled agents in the magistrates&#x2019; courts, may not share in this privilege; all medical practitioners, dentists, chemists and druggists are excluded; persons who are serving or actually undergoing training in any land, sea or air force under the laws relating to the defence of the Union and members of any police force; members of the Public Service are excluded; deputy sheriffs and sheriffs&#x2019; officers; college professors and lecturers, school inspectors and school teachers are excluded; masters of vessels and pilots are excluded; persons continuously employed in any public railway are excluded; in other words, railway workers are excluded; people employed in tramway, electrical works, waterworks or sewerage works in connection with a hospital are all excluded; persons actually engaged as editors or reporters for newspapers; persons accredited to the Union as consuls are also excluded. Persons in the service of Her Majesty the Queen in any of her Governments are excluded; persons incapacitated by deafness, blindness or other permanent infirmity are excluded. Well, this is a very wise provision and I do believe that they should not serve on a jury. You cannot, therefore, hold it against the law-giver for having deprived these people of the right of sharing in the administration of justice. Others who have been excluded are secretaries of divisional councils, municipal councillors, heads and sub-heads of municipal departments, traffic police in the employ of local authorities. Mr. Speaker, who is left after all these people have been excluded? I have made a calculation and I took it that women comprised a little over half the population and that 30 out of 70 persons were under 25 or over 65 years. My estimate as far as these people are concerned was very conservative and I came to this conclusion that in the whole country, with a total population of 15,000,000, there were hardly 400,000 persons who could serve on a jury. That is not even 2 per cent. Only 2 per cent of your entire population have the wonderful privilege of sharing in the administration of justice.</p>

<p>When we realize what the position is, I think the time has arrived that we get away from the jury system. We must get away from the idea that you should be tried by your peers. Let us return to the actual facts and realize that hardly 2 per cent of the people of this country can serve on a jury.</p>

<p>I have shown the House how the system has been whittled down; I have shown that there are special courts to-day; I have shown in respect of what a great field the hon. the Minister of Justice could simply eliminate the jury system. I have shown you, Sir, that at the moment the jury system is the exception and that the normal system is a judge with two assessors. I have pointed out what a tremendous number of criminal cases were heard in magistrates&#x2019; courts and regional courts, and I have pointed out that these alleged advantages of jury system simply do not exist once you analyse the position and examine it closely.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to read a few extracts to show what people have already said in this country about the jury system. The first extract I wish to read is from the <i>Cape Law Journal.</i> This is what the editor says pursuant to a remark made by Sir Henry de Villiers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We would ask with Sir Henry de Villiers if the system is a good one, why limit it to one court? If bad, why not abolish it?</block>

<p>If the system is good we should extend it and if it is bad we should abolish it. The editor goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When a jury is required nine men are drawn by ballot by the Registrar of the court. These may comprise farmers, mercantile men, mechanics. Some of them have <span class="col_1489-1490" refersTo="page_761"/>probably never served on a jury before. Under ordinary circumstances none of them have previously heard anything of the cases upon which they are called to decide. They can have but little idea of sifting evidence. Such a body of persons can scarcely be considered the best tribunal to give due weight to the evidence in an intricate case of embezzlement, or to piece together the links in a long chain of circumstantial evidence, upon which a charge of murder may depend. No doubt they are in most cases guided by the presiding Judge; but we are strongly tempted to ask whether any harm would result if the whole case, verdict and all, were left to the Judge.</block>

<p>That is pursuant to a remark made by the Chief Judge of the Cape Province in 1885. I wish to refer to another article by the editor of the <i>South African Law Journal,</i> 1906&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Jurymen are selected without any reference to their fitness. They may have to decide a complicated engineering problem or a question of copyright, or some abstruse point of shipping customs, or they may be called on to distinguish between culpable and fraudulent insolvency. &#x201C;One of the gravest defects of trial by jury is that justice is administered without a proper sense of responsibility. Only for the moment does a juryman fill the judicial office; he is in the courts to-day and resumes his obscure place in the general mass to-morrow. Unlike the Judge, who sits on the bench day after day, he has no reputation for judicial wisdom to establish or maintain. No condemnation can follow him for his share in a wrong verdict. The jury&#x2019;s very number is destructive of a true sense of responsibility; a responsibility that is divisible into ninths is necessarily weak. But this is not the full extent of the defect. In the great majority of cases the verdict of the jury, as has been said, is merely a reflection of the opinion of the Judge. It is inevitably so when, as sometimes happens, the Judge shows that he has not wholly lost his original powers of advocacy.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I now want to read another extract from the <i>South African Law Journal</i> of 1916&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Trial by jury must indeed be regarded as one of the most remarkable of popular delusions. It supposes that men taken from the workshop, the counter, the desk, the farm, are more competent to sift and weigh evidence than the Judge who is a trained lawyer, who has had many years&#x2019; experience, both at the Bar and on the Bench, and whose whole life has been given to the study of law. Surely jurymen would be more useful to their country and would be doing much better work in their stores, offices, and workshops than they are able to do in the jury-box, where, if they merely follow the Judge&#x2019;s directions, they are a superfluity, and if they disagree with the Judge, are sure nearly always to perpetrate injustice.</block>

<p>I want to read what Mr. Morice, Q.C., had to say about the jury system. I think at one stage or other he was also a Judge in some British territory outside the Union. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am no supporter of the jury system in South Africa. When one considers that the Native population is more than five times as large as the White population, and probably the proportion of Natives that come before the courts is very much greater, while a considerable number of the crimes are committed by members of the one race against those of other, the jury in its present form appears a grotesque anomaly. It is not, however, enough to give an accused person the right to be tried without a jury.</block>

<p>That was written shortly after 1917&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That would be to perpetuate the most crying evil of the jury system in this country. Trial by jury should be abolished altogether. The last shred of justification for it seems to be taken away when it is enacted, as it does in Section 215 of the Act, that the Government may provide that persons charged with treason, sedition, public violence and certain other offences, shall be tried without a jury by a special criminal court of two or more Judges. It was just in political cases that the jury was considered a bulwark of British liberties.</block>

<p>Finally I want to read what Sir Patric Devlin wrote. He is one of Her Majesty&#x2019;s Judges in the High Court of Justice. He is a fervent advocate of the jury system but this is what he has to say about the system&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The English jury is not what it is because some law-giver so decreed but because that is the way it has grown up. Indeed, its invention by a law-giver is inconceivable. We are used to it and know that it works; if we were not, we should say that it embodies a ridiculous and impracticable idea. Consider what the idea is. Twelve (why 12?) men and women are to be selected at random; they have never before had any experience of weighing evidence and perhaps not of applying their minds judicially to any problem; they are often, as the Common Law Commissioners of 1853 tactfully put it, &#x201C;unaccustomed to severe intellectual exercise or to protracted thought &#x201D;. The case may be an intricate one, lasting some weeks and counsel may have in front of them piles of documents, of which the jury are given a few to look at. They may listen to days of oral evidence without taking notes&#x2014;at least, no one expects them to take notes and no facility is provided for it in the jury-box, not even elbow room. Yet they are said to be the sole judges of all the facts. At the end of the case they are expected within an hour or two to arrive at the same conclusion. Without their unanimous verdict no man can be punished for any of the greater <span class="col_1491-1492" refersTo="page_762"/>offences. Theoretically it ought not to be possible to successfully enforce the criminal law by such means.</block>

<p>This is one of the greatest advocates of the jury system who points out the weaknesses of the system.</p>

<p>Various Judges have at various times expressed themselves on the jury system. I just want to quote what Judge Sutton said. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my view the time has gone by for jury trials in a mixed racial community. They are an anachronism in modern times.</block>

<p>I agree that even in the few remaining cases where the jury system still applies it simply does not fit into the circumstances prevailing in this country, and for that reason I believe it is our duty and our task as law-givers to face up to the facts and to get away from the idea that this system has a long tradition when we are convinced that it does not work in South Africa. There is practically nothing left of it; it simply does not work and for that reason I have no hesitation in suggesting to this House that the jury system has served its purpose and that it can serve no further useful purpose in our administration of justice.</p>

<p>I regard it as a privilege to second this motion moved by the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser). I take pleasure in doing so, and I do it for the same reason that he does, namely that the jury system has become obsolete as a concept and as a system. It is, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has said, a very old institution which deserves a certain amount of veneration because of its age. But the fact that it has reached a great age still does not compel us to adhere to it. It is true that when the jury system was evolved it resulted in a new system of law, and that may probably be one of the reasons why it has endured for so long. Possibly we all know what a new system of law the jury system brought about in England when it was introduced there, but there may be some of us who are perhaps not aware of what a good thing the jury system was when it was first evolved and applied. If we just have regard to the system as it existed in England before the jury system came into being, we can realize in what high esteem this system was later held. The hon. member for Klerksdorp has indicated how the jury system may have had several origins. I will not weary the House with that. I am one of those who believe that it was evolved from the Anglo-Saxon countries, but at the time when the jury system was evolved the legal process in England was a very remarkable one. It was a process of people&#x2019;s courts, a process in which the population played a role, and it operated more or less in the following way. If, for example, A alleged that B had done him an injustice, the Judge decided beforehand which of the two would lose the case, and if the person was not satisfied with that decision, long before the evidence was given, he had to come there and state that he was not concerned in the injustice. He had to swear on oath that he had not done an injustice to A&#x2014; assuming B was the accused&#x2014;and if he swore that he did not do an injustice to A, that was the end of the case. But it was not always so easy, because A swore that B had in fact done it, and then a conflict ensued. Then both of them had to find people, not to come and swear, in respect of the injustice, whether it was committed or not, but they had to swear that A or B, whichever one they came to assist, was a good man, and the oath so sworn simply meant that B&#x2014;let us assume that B was the defendant and that the Judge had decided that he was the person who would have to lose the case&#x2014;then these oath-helpers only came to swear that B was a good and decent man and that he would not make a false oath. It is interesting to note that they swore that this oath was pure and not perjury. That was all they had to say. The type of oath sworn depended on the nature of the case and on the defendant or on the accused person himself. It is possible that the Judge decided. or that the people&#x2019;s court decided, that he should not come with only one oath-helper. Sometimes he had to bring as many as 48, which was the maximum, but he could also bring fewer, although the minimum was 12. And then there was, moreover, a whole system to evaluate the worth of a man&#x2019;s oath. The oath of a baron was worth more than that of an ordinary baronet, that of a baronet was worth more than that of a squire, and that of a squire again was worth more than the oath of an ordinary man. There was a whole schedule, and then they only added up the oaths to determine who had won and who had lost.</p>

<p>But even that was not enough. One of the litigants who felt that an injustice had been done to him by the number of oaths which had been built up against him could always say: They are all perjured, and then there really was trouble. Then they could proceed to the Judgment of God, to which the hon. member for Klerksdorp referred, but the hon. member touched on it only lightly, and to give hon. members an idea of how good the jury system was after that, I think I must give the House an idea of how good the Judgment of God was. There was the judgment by means of the hot iron. A hot iron was put into a person&#x2019;s hand and when he dropped it after nine yards his hand was bound and opened up after three days, and if there was a blister on his hand it meant that person had committed perjury. Or it was the trial by hot water. The accused either had to put his hand or his whole arm into hot water, as ordered by the people&#x2019;s court and according to the crime committed and the charge which was laid. and if when the man withdrew his hand or his arm. and it was unscalded, he had not committed perjury; then his oath was pure and not perjury. Or it was trial by cold water. <span class="col_1493-1494" refersTo="page_763"/>They threw a man into the water, and if he sank he was guilty but if he floated he was innocent.</p>

<p>Then he floated. In any case, the question never arose of guilt or innocence, but the point at issue was whether the person who took the oath had committed perjury or not. And certainly the most picturesque of these Judgments of God was the judgment of &#x201C;the accursed morsel&#x201D;, to which the hon. member for Klerksdorp referred. An ounce of cheese or an ounce of bread was given to a person who was charged with perjury. If he choked it meant that he had committed perjury, but if he swallowed it then he had not. And this, Mr. Speaker, was the ordinary court procedure, and peculiarly enough, it worked very well, because when the court was dealing with a criminal he could get no oath-helpers because nobody would commit perjury on behalf of someone whom they knew to be guilty.</p>

<p>But it did not work well in every respect because there were people who considered this to be a primitive procedure. In the course of time the jury system developed. This is an old Anglo-Saxon institution which developed in England. When the Norman kings came there, a new process was evolved alongside this old process, quite independently, and that was the procedure of the inquisition. The king, when he laid a charge against his subjects that they had trespassed on his land or that they had not paid enough in taxation, or for any other reason, saw no chance of looking for oath-helpers or of proceeding to apply the Judgment of God, because he had to govern the State and often an end had to be put to the litigation. He therefore took a short cut to the truth. He sent out an official with instructions to assemble a number of neighbours and put them under oath and then to question them, mainly in regard to some or other matter with which the king was concerned, and generally this was in regard to matters of taxation.</p>

<p>You know, taxation was not always a duty; it was a privilege, and it was regarded as a donation to the State, and then they agreed in the general council of the king that they would give the king a gift, say, the 40th penny (that was customary) and then everybody paid the 40th penny&#x2014;at least they were supposed to but they did not always do so, and with the approval of the council the king then sent out an official with the high-sounding name of an inquisitor, i.e. one who was curious, and he held a session which was called an inquisition.</p>

<p>This session took place in the area where he had assembled the people and had taken an oath from them, and then they said whether a person had actually paid the 40th penny, or if he had paid, whether it was in fact the 40th penny he had paid. In that way he arrived at the truth. This process, as one can understand, was appreciably more popular than the process of the swearing of oaths by oath-helpers and the Judgment of God, and gradually we reached the stage where the two processes really merged into one another and became intermingled with each other, so that the inquisition with its system of oaths and the people who were placed on oath tried to establish the truth, and the oath-helpers&#x2019; system again assisted the inquisition. That was a popular method of ascertaining the truth. The people who appeared before such an official at an inquisition were no more than witnesses, but they were also oath-helpers as well, in the sense that they helped each other to get at the truth. However, they no longer swore that the plaintiff or the defendant was a lover of the truth; they came and told on oath what they knew about the matter, and in that way they were at the same time witnesses and also judges of the facts.</p>

<p>The next step was that any person could obtain from the king a warrant to hold an inquisition on payment of the prescribed fee, and that is probably also the reason why this system became popular, because it provided an income for the king when he sold these warrants. All one had to do was to ask the chancellor or the king to institute such an inquisition, and then that was a short cut to the truth, and the inquisitor went to the area and assembled the people, put them on oath and found out whether there was any substance in the allegation that A had done an injustice to B.</p>

<p>The next step was that everybody was compelled to subject themselves to the inquisition if they could. At first they gave an accused a choice as to whether he would subject himself to the inquisition or not. If he refused, they proceeded to apply the system of the Judgments of God. The two systems remained in existence next to each other. England is a remarkable country. The English never abolish anything; they just store it away on the loft. Until to-day these Judgments of God have not been abolished; they have just fallen into desuetude. What happened now was that someone who felt aggrieved, or someone against whom a charge had been laid, stated: I subject myself to my neighbours for better or for worse. Gradually it became a duty, and if he subjected himself to it the other party was also compelled to do so. In this way the jury was established as a compulsory element at every trial under the English system. But still the members of the jury were witnesses on the one hand, whilst on the other hand, they were the people who had to hear the evidence. Therefore on the one hand they were judges, and on the other hand they were witnesses.</p>

<p>That brings me to the first weak point in the jury system. I will be forgiven for having spoken at length on this aspect of the development of the jury, but as is the case with all historical products, it carries in itself, when one gets such an admixture, the germ of self-destruction. As I have said, in this process of development, the jury system also carried within itself the germ of its own destruction. <span class="col_1495-1496" refersTo="page_764"/>Herein lies the weakest as well as the strongest point of the jury system. If a member of the jury can himself give evidence in regard to the matter, he may already be prejudiced. In such a case he is unfitted to attend the trial. If he had to hear evidence and knew nothing about the matter he had to be able to sift the lies from the truth, and if he could not do so he was also unfitted for his task. The objections I have against the jury system to-day revolve round these two points, particularly the last one. One is surprised that this institution was in operation for so long because the jury, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has said, is leally unfitted for the work it has to do.</p>

<p>They remind me of Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s horse. It will be remembered that when he saw a circus horse walking on its hind legs he was asked whether he did not find it peculiar that this could happen, and he said, &#x201C;Well, I do not find it peculiar that the horse can walk so well on its hind legs, but what I do find peculiar is that the horse can manage to walk on its hind legs at all.&#x201D; I find it peculiar that this system has lasted so long, but when I recollect what there was before we had the jury system I can appreciate that there was a certain fear in the minds of people of reverting to what they had had before, and therefore why the jury system lasted as long as it did. I want to repeat: On the one hand the juror is disqualified if he has knowledge of the matter he has to decide; on the other hand he is disqualified because he must perform a task in regard to which he has very little experience, namely to determine what the truth is, when he is really unable to do so by virtue of his mental equipment and past experience. It remains a double disqualification. Mostly he has not the capacity to judge, particularly not when he has been subjected to arguments for a few days by two or three advocates from either side.</p>

<p>When the ordinary juror comes to court, he finds himself in a milieu which is quite strange to him. That increases the possibility of his being influenced by all kinds of factors which have nothing to do with the case, but which still influence his judgment and which probably also do not assist in the administration of justice. When we analyse the average juror we find that his judgment is very probably conditioned by his preconceived ideas in regard to the case. It is conditioned by the psychological influence of minor incidents in court; it can also be influence by what he has read in the Press when the newspapers have published reports of the preparatory examination. And, last but not least, the juror is very often influenced by the striking impression created by a clever advocate in court. You know, a broad scab on a wound on the bare stomach of a person makes a much greater impression on a jury than the detailed evidence of a doctor in regard to the shallowness of a wound.</p>

<p>If we look at the average juror we can sum it up by saying that a juror&#x2019;s judgment is the result of his pet prejudices, his religious intolerances, his political antipathies and his own view of life. In saying that, I am saying a mouthful, and if I had to give examples of it I would detain the House perhaps until to-morrow. But I just want to say one thing, and that is that in our country we did not make all the exceptions referred to by the hon. member for Klerksdorp without good reason. We know, for example, that there are areas of our country where one simply cannot get a jury to convict in an illicit diamond buying case. I am not saying anything against the people who live in that area. I am simply saying that one gets a verdict which is conditioned by their own view of life, and they simply do not realize that it is wrong to deal illicitly in diamonds. I mention that as an example, but there are other examples I could mention.</p>

<p>These defects in the jury system are also manifested in other ways. It has a very broad influence on our law of evidence. The jury consists of inexperienced people who do not know much about litigation and who are not able to sift the truth from the chaff, and in order to assist the jury we have an extensive system of rules whereby certain facts are admissible at a trial and others are inadmissible. We have a whole series of rules in regard to the inadmissibility of evidence, which often confuse even the expert. The Judges, people who deal with the administration of justice every day, have learnt by experience how to sift the evidence and they realize that certain facts have great evidential value whilst others have not. But one cannot entrust the jury with those functions, and for that reason certain evidence must be withheld from the jury completely. Then one finds at a trial a dispute as to the admissibility of evidence where the Judge and the advocates on either side have to decide whether a certain bit of evidence is admissible or not. The one advocate addresses the Judge; the other also addresses the Judge, the Judge speaks to both advocates, whilst on one side of the court the jurors sit wondering when they will get to the point as to who committed the crime, or who stole the sheep. It is a state of affairs which is really farcical. But the greatest comedy is really provided by ourselves, our lawyers and the society which tolerate this system. I want to put it to hon. members this way: The conclusion at which we arrive in regard to this matter is that it is a comedy in our modern times. To begin with, we appoint a court which is unnecessarily large, consisting of nine or 12 jurors and a Judge. We man it with people who are not sufficiently equipped for the task entrusted to them&#x2014;with the exception, of course, of the Judge. Then, because there is a lack of experience on the part of a section of the court, we have rules of evidence to exclude evidence from the jury, from the people who sit there to judge whether a person is guilty or not, and often we exclude the very facts which the members of the jury use as evidence every day in their ordinary <span class="col_1497-1498" refersTo="page_765"/>lives in order to regulate their own lives. It is a comedy and a farce!</p>

<p>And the system also has its effects in other spheres. Because we are landed with this mediaeval institution we cannot succeed in letting the law of evidence develop as it should. It is simply not possible. If we look at the Continent of Europe, where there is no jury system, we see that they take all kinds of short cuts to arrive at the truth, just as the king in the year 1200 used the inquisition as a short cut to get at the truth. On the Continent, the people have for a century or more been taking short cuts to get at the truth. There is, e.g., in Holland and in Germany a system of preliminary investigation. According to that system, the accused appears before the Judge&#x2014;it is not a third degree, it is not really a police inquiry, although it is similar to it&#x2014;and the Judge puts certain questions to the accused to which he has to reply. The inquiry takes place in the presence of the accused, his advocate and the advocate of the complainant, and in the presence of the complainant. That is an example of where the police investigation and the administration of justice are really merging into one another, much in the same way as we have seen how the oath-helper system and the inquisition system merged into each other. If we have that system, and I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister should investigate it, he will be able to carry on with half the number of Judges of the Supreme Court; he will have fewer cases, and he will need fewer people than are needed under the system we have now. Because to-day we take up much time in court in proving something which everybody knows exists, or we are greatly inconvenienced by not compelling the accused to make certain admissions which are peculiarly within his knowledge. Not that we want to commit an injustice or have to commit an injustice. I am only saying that we should devote attention to a development which has proved of great benefit to other countries, without harming the administration of justice. If we had not been landed with the jury system we would also have succeeded in looking to other parts of the world and in learning from them in regard to the law of evidence, and how it can be improved. As it is, jurors are the subject of their own prejudices. And when I say that, it is not theoretical. We have had it here in Cape Town. There is a very famous case of a woman who alighted from a tram. She was evidently negligent and a municipal lorry driver ran into her and injured her leg. That was before 1927, before the abolition of the jury system in civil cases. This lorry driver employed by the municipality was brought to court and was found not guilty by the magistrate, but that did not prevent the keen advocates and attorneys and the plaintiff from bringing a civil case against the municipality. The complainant&#x2019;s case was tried by a jury. Her advocate started off by showing the large injury on the woman&#x2019;s leg to every one of the jurors. After having inspected the leg, there was no longer any problem in regard to proving the case.</p>

<p>That is a shocking indictment!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>But it happened. Those are the facts. The magistrate had acquitted the driver, but the jury found that there was in fact negligence. When I read it I was reminded of the Irish adage that an Irish jury &#x201C;will never find against a fair lady, but always against the Railway&#x201D;. That is so, and it is also clear that our authorities took note of that particular verdict by a Cape Town jury. Mindful of what could happen if the State was the defendant in such a case, this Parliament abolished the practice of using jurors in civil cases in 1927. They abolished it as the result of the extravagant claims made by people injured in the railway disaster at Salt River in 1926. These claims were so extravagant that the Government decided at least to abolish the jury system, in civil cases. The significant thing is that thereafter plaintiffs in such cases thought twice, and the number as well as the scope of the claims were appreciably reduced. They did not dare to abolish trial by jury in criminal cases. The time was not yet ripe for it. But the considerations which were valid then in civil cases are still valid to-day in respect of criminal trials. I am not saying anything against the jury system. The jurors acted to the best of their ability. I am not saying they did their work badly. I am not saying they were prejudiced, but I do say that they bring their whole personality to court with them and then they have to do work for which they are not equipped and which we cannot reasonably expect from them because the world has developed and become much more complicated.</p>

<p>When we have to judge of the merits of the jury system, there are a few arguments which are advanced, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has said. I do not wish to repeat those arguments, but I would like to return to them. The supposed merit of the jury system is that the jury brings the law into line with ordinary life. If I have to go into that, I must ask myself: Who brings the law more into line with life, the jury or the Judge? I must ask myself whether the Judge in his exalted position really becomes so far removed from actualities that he is longer in touch with ordinary life. I should say that a Judge who comes into contact with all the offenders every day in court has a much better and a much greater understanding of life than a jury, which perhaps comes into contact with such things only once in a lifetime. The Judge is much more aware of all the tensions of life and in court than a jury which happens to come there once in a lifetime. And I do not think a single juror of the past or of the future will quarrel with me when I say that the juror is not exactly the best medium for telling us what public opinion is in regard to any particular matter. I do not think it is within the power of one person, or even of seven or nine or 12 persons, to tell us what <span class="col_1499-1500" refersTo="page_766"/>public opinion is on a particular point. Nor do I think it is relevant.</p>

<p>A second argument advanced is that the jury system gives the public the opportunity to take part in the administration of justice. The hon. member for Klerksdorp has estimated that this public barely numbers 400,000. But there is still a further reply to that. The contribution of the jury to the making of law is precisely nil. When they still had to decide what customs existed in a particular hamlet, when they still had to expound what the law was in respect of a certain incident, then they made a contribution; when they still had to correlate the facts and had themselves to give evidence as to what the law was, they still made a contribution. But thereafter the only people who contributed towards giving shape to the law were the Judges themselves and the advocates, and still later, Parliament. To-day Parliament and the various legislative bodies like the Provincial Councils and the municipalities form the law, and of course also public opinion. But we need not have a medium like the jury to tell us what public opinion is.</p>

<p>The third merit the jury system is supposed to have is that it relieves the Judge of an unpleasant duty. I quite believe that the Judges will perhaps hesitate before voting immediately for the jury system to be abolished, because it makes matters easier for them when they need not decide on the facts. The law is already complicated enough and the Judge must devote his attention to that. But, Mr. Speaker, that is the responsibility of the Judge. That is what he is appointed for, that is what he has experience of, and that is why we choose our Judges from the best advocates available, men with long and ripe experience. They have experience not only in respect of the law, but also in respect of the behaviour of people when they are in the witness box and are supposed to be telling the truth. The Judge cannot evade that responsibility. What is more, he does not evade it either; nor does he intend evading it, because he gives a summing up to the jury which must convince the jury that they have to decide this way or the other. In his own mind he has already come to a decision in regard to the facts, but he keeps it to himself because it is not his duty to impart that to the jury. In any case, he must shoulder the responsibility connected to his position. And I believe that our Judges are prepared to do so.</p>

<p>There is one advantage of the jury system which I cannot argue away, but it is an advantage which we will also have with the system of assessors, if we only stick to it. That advantage is this, that the Judge gives an oral judgment in which he reviews the facts as they have been ascertained in the particular trial. It is a very important matter and a very great advantage that a person should loudly record his own convictions, or do so in such a way that all interested parties, or those who need to do so, can record it themselves. Now, we need not have a jury in order to retain this advantage. The Judges do so to-day. When they sit with assessors, the Judge gives a summing up. Perhaps he does not give such a detailed summing up because he is dealing with more skilled people. But we can retain that system. This is the only advantage I can still see in the jury system, namely that the Judge gives an oral summing up.</p>

<p>In seconding this motion moved by the hon. member, I say I do so because, even though it is old, it is obsolete. I do so because it hampers development. I do so because the Judges, through their experience, are better equipped to do the work which we entrust to a college of inexperienced people who should not really have to do that work. For those reasons I take pleasure in supporting this motion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) on the very lucid and very clear exposition which he gave this House on the history of the jury system, especially its beginnings in England. The hon. member has obviously gone to great pains to present the picture and the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) also presented some of the history of the jury system. Both these hon. members spoke as observers, if I may say, from the outside. I should like to speak on this debate as an observer from the inside, as a person who has had experience of juries, the workings of our system, not only appearing for the accused but appearing also for the Crown, for the State.</p>

<p>What we are concerned with here to-day, Sir, is justice, justice in our criminal courts. Justice in a court takes the form of seeking after truth, a very difficult and engaging pursuit to which people have devoted their lives, to which societies have devoted their everything. Over the centuries in our own courts and throughout England there has been built up an edifice, a machinery, for the purpose of finding truth. A very elusive task and a very difficult task, a task in which everyone accepts one cannot be perfect. And the jury system is part of that edifice. It is part of that machinery which has been developed over the centuries whose purpose and function it is to seek out the truth. It is part of a great system of justice in South Africa of which we in this country can be justly proud. Because I believe, Sir, that there is no system of justice in the world which is the peer of the South African system of justice. And it is in the light of this that I wish. Mr. Speaker, to discuss this motion.</p>

<p>What one must bear in mind right from the beginning is that the jury system only operates in respect of criminal charges&#x2014;they do not operate in civil courts&#x2014;and secondly that they are not forced on to anyone at all. That is a right which an accused person has in certain circumstances. They are not bodies which are foisted upon any accused. So far <span class="col_1501-1502" refersTo="page_767"/>as those who practise the law are concerned, I would like to remind the House that the General Council of the Bar of South Africa, which is a sort of federated body on which all members of the Bar all over the country are represented, recently unanimously decided that it was against any further inroads being made in the jury system. In other words, they favour the retention of the jury system. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister, who is here, when he replies to the debate, to indicate to us whether there are any Judges, and if so how many, who have complained about the jury system. I do not believe, Sir, that there are.</p>

<p>One of the arguments which the hon. member for Klerksdorp advanced was, as I understood him, that less than 5 per cent of all the criminal cases before the Supreme Court were heard by jury. Or only in less than 5 per cent did the accused ask for trial by jury. One must have regard to the very factors he mentioned when one assesses this figure. The Criminal Procedure Act has been so amended over the years&#x2014;we had an example last year &#x2014;that the instances in which the accused can have a trial by jury get less and less.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>One attributes the various causes to the various instances. One of them is the Riotous Assemblies Act. One can appreciate that to choose a jury from the area where the riotous assembly has taken place, in as much as the matter could also assume the form of <i>crimen laesae majestitis,</i> would be something inadvisable; it would be inadvisable to have a jury in that case. That is the point, Sir, that in all the instances that there are it is considered not advisable to have a jury. The point is not that a jury could not give a proper verdict or that the jury is incompetent to give a verdict. The question is whether in these cases the jury should be called upon to give a decision. Under the Atomic Energy Act the hon. the Minister has the power to withhold trial by jury, and probably quite rightly so, because of the very technical nature of the subject matter. One could press this argument further and say that even a Judge or even a magistrate would have difficulty in understanding the technicality of the subject matter of offences under the Atomic Energy Act. And if one pressed it even further one could make a case for a special jury of experts to consider and decide upon the facts which are in issue.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in practice that is where the assessors would come in. One of the points which arise in relation to assessors is that as the Act stands to-day Judges need not any more have assessors in any criminal cases. I must say, Sir, that it is to be regretted that the law was changed in this regard. While it is true that the Appellate Division has said that it is advisable that Judges should take assessors when they sit in cases and while it is true that Judges generally do take assessors when they sit in these cases, the fact remains that they can try them alone. The fact is that the Judges and the Appellate Division have decided in their wisdom that one man should not have the responsibility of trying a man, especially when he is being tried for his life. It is very interesting that in regard to the matter which the hon. the Minister has raised, the Judges themselves, learned as they are and experienced as they are, still feel that one man should not be called upon to decide the facts in these cases. There is a point to which I shall later allude which I believe strengthens the argument for juries being the finders of fact. The other example is the illicit possession of precious metals or stones: The hon. member for Standerton said that no jury called from the district in which the offence took place will probably find the accused guilty. I do not think that since the days of the great advocate Upington there have been any of these cases. I believe it was after his successes with the jury in relation to these diamond cases, that this Act was amended. I know of no case in which a jury trial has taken place in this regard. Another example is that of supplying intoxicating liquor to Natives. Another example is that of insolvency. All these matters are really of a technical nature.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important restriction on trial by jury, and one which I personally approve of, is where the &#x201C;offence is towards or in connection with a non-European, if the accused or any of them is a European or towards or in connection with a European, if the accused or any of them is a non-European&#x201D;. In this regard the hon. the Minister has a discretion. I cannot think of a case where the choice has been for trial by jury in one of these Black on White or White on Black cases. In those cases the decision has already been made before the Minister&#x2019;s warrant arrives saying that the trial was not to be by jury. It is this sort of case that is pointed to by those who advocate the removal of the jury system. There is a story which is true, I understand, because the same characters appear in it every time. Mr. Justice Greenberg went on circuit in the Transvaal. One of the cases which came before the circuit court was that of a local farmer who had beaten one of his boys and the boy had died. The accused was charged with murder. It was apparently a cut and dried case of murder. The accused obtained the services of the great advocate Harry Morris, who went up to defend him, and he found that he had nothing to say at all. He said that the only thing he could think of was temporary insanity. He duly put this defence up. The Judge summed up very strongly for a verdict of guilty of murder and the jury returned a verdict of &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D;. It is alleged that Judge Greenberg then said <span class="col_1503-1504" refersTo="page_768"/>to the foreman: &#x201C;It is not within my scope really to ask you, but I am very interested, what was the ground of your decision?&#x201D; The foreman replied: &#x201C;My Lord, temporary insanity.&#x201D; The Judge looked down at him and said: &#x201C;What, all nine of you?&#x201D; It is that sort of incident, and the sort of incident that the hon. member for Standerton mentioned about the girl who showed her leg and was more favourably received by the jury than she would otherwise have been, that strengthens the case of those who are against the jury system. But, of course, it is a very moot point as to whether a magistrate might not have been equally moved by such an exhibition. We believe that they also are human, Sir.</p>

<p>Last year the right to be tried by jury was further invaded in the General Law Amendment Act. It is now provided that even in cases of murder and arson the hon. the Minister may exercise his discretion and refuse the accused the right to be tried by jury. It is not clear in what circumstances that is going to be done. The jury system as it is to-day exists in any event in a very restricted form by reason of all these restrictions that I have mentioned, and they are mostly restrictions in respect of technical matters. One of the arguments which were used by the mover of this motion&#x2014;and he called a lot of evidence to support him in the form of extracts from law journals&#x2014;was that these jurymen were not really in a position to decide in any case because they were not trained to sift evidence; they were not trained in the law in any way at all. Mr. Speaker, in my opinion that is precisely why a jury is a better judge of fact than a man trained in the law. When one considers what a jury is required to do, it becomes apparent that the function of a jury is far better discharged by persons who apply their minds only to the facts. A jury is required only to give a decision on the facts. It is required to decide whether a witness is telling the truth; it is required to decide whether something is probable in their experience as men of the world. I believe that they bring a fresher mind to bear upon the case. They have no experience of other cases. It is desirable indeed, Sir, that they have no experience of other cases. The facts in every case are different. Anyone who is connected with the law knows the sort of attitude one adopts towards cases. You take the average <i>pro deo</i> murder. You go into court, you have heard it all before and it is described by people who practise, as a variation of the same theme. You have the feeling that you have seen it all before. Indeed, when you consider how hard-worked magistrates are, they spend their whole day seeing the same thing, one case after the other. It must develop in them&#x2014;I am prepared to say it does develop in them&#x2014;a sense of &#x201C;this is nothing new; I have seen all this before; I have seen this policeman before; he has always told the truth as far as I know; I do not have to decide whether he is telling the truth or not; my mind is conditioned to his telling the truth &#x201D;. That is the sort of thing that happens. And I do not say this to the detriment of any of our judicial officers. It is the sort of thing that happens to any human being. Because he is human.</p>

<p>What do they have to decide? The jury has to decide the facts. It has to decide whether there is a reasonable doubt as to the accused guilt or innocence. According to Gardiner and Lansdown &#x201C;reasonable doubt&#x201D; is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The doubt must not be light or capricious, such as timidity or passion prompts, and weakness or corruption readily adopts. It must be such a doubt as, upon a calm view of the whole evidence, a rational understanding will suggest to an honest heart; the conscientious hesitation of minds that are not influenced by party, preoccupied by prejudice or subdued by fear.</block>

<p>When you consider &#x201C;not influenced by party, preoccupied by prejudice or subdued by fear&#x201D; I think you cannot find any individual better suited to discharge these functions, having regard to this, than the ordinary man in the street. The ordinary man in the street has nothing to fear, nothing to lose, nothing to gain by giving his decision. He has no experience which guides his decision as to what the facts in that case are. I do not have to remind the House that the facts in every single case are different. No two cases are alike.</p>

<p>The other thing they have to decide as to guilt is whether the evidence given by an accused person might reasonably be true having regard to their experience of life. They do not sit there like people up in the clouds, not like some academic lawyer who is going to write a book, not like a Judge whose experience of the lower social orders is necessarily restricted. The test is not whether such a person thinks it might reasonably have happened, but whether a person who is the same sort of person as the accused thinks that something might reasonably have happened. That is the test, Sir, that is applied. The ordinary man who lives in the same society as the accused, is able to judge whether what the accused says may or may not be true. He is the man that the centuries have decided should judge the facts and the actions of his fellow-man. I go so far as to say that in that regard he is better qualified, much better qualified, than a Judge of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>No, Sir. In saying that the hon. the Minister of Defence does not take account of the fact that the Judge is there to see that the facts which filter through to the jury are admissible facts. He is there to protect the accused as well. He is there to apply the law; to tell them what the law is. But he has nothing whatsoever to do with the facts. I do not know one Judge who has not expressed the opinion that a jury is just as <span class="col_1505-1506" refersTo="page_769"/>qualified to decide upon the facts of a case as he is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp spoke about the number of people who were excluded from the jury. It is true that a number of people are. But what is left when the legal practitioners and the accountants and the secretaries of various organizations, members of the Civil Service, etc., have been excluded, is precisely the type of person that you want on a jury, namely the ordinary man in the street who is not influenced by party, preoccupied by prejudice or subdued by fear. In other words, the sort of man who has no connection whatever with the State and who exercises his mind independently and fearlessly. I must say that I take some exception to the attitude which the hon. member for Standerton adopted towards these people, that they were really being frivolous when they took the oath which the hon. member for Klerksdorp read out, viz. &#x201C;to give a true verdict according to the evidence without fear, favour or prejudice&#x201D;. If you take this argument further you find the sort of situation that you have in England where you still have special juries. A special jury was once empanelled in Cambridge, a special jury of dons and academic lawyers, gentlemen like the hon. member for Standerton. They were empanelled to give a decision in a case of negligence. What the judge asked them was&#x2014;it was a simple case: Two motor-cars were involved&#x2014;to go out to consider whose negligence was the proximate cause of the collision. All these learned gentlemen, with all the qualifications which the hon. member for Standerton has, came back after a few hours and told the Judge that they did not understand his question. The Judge had to discharge that special jury. I might add that case was then later tried before an ordinary tribunal, an ordinary jury, and they had no difficulty in understanding the question and had no difficulty in deciding whose negligence was in fact the proximate cause of the collision.</p>

<p>It is all very well for hon. members to speak from up in the clouds, from the universities and from the sidelines, but the Bar of South Africa has pledged itself to support the jury system, and the Bar is the only society which has experience of it, apart of course from the Judges. I have never had any complaints about a jury, about the absurdity of their decision, or their inability to understand the evidence and thus to give effect to their oath to give a true verdict according to the evidence without fear, favour or prejudice. I say that speaking also as an enthusiastic prosecutor on those occasions when the State briefs members of the Bar to prosecute. There is an old, trite saying that if you are innocent then do not take a jury, but if you are guilty, take a jury. That may be so. If I had to express an opinion on this, I would say that it is so. If I thought my client was guilty on the evidence, I would certainly advise him to choose a jury. But that is right. It is in keeping with our legal system. The tenor of our legal system is that the onus is on the State and the accused is always entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It is better to let 99 guilty men go free than to hang one innocent man. That is the principle, and if a jury does lean over towards the accused, that is in keeping with our judicial system and with the spirit of our law. That is in fact the spirit of our law. I believe the jury exemplifies this system and this spirit in their approach to the problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp raised the question that it was important that the ordinary man or woman should take part in the administration of justice. I think that is an extremely important aspect of our judicial system, that there is a place and a way in which the ordinary man in the street can take part in the everyday administration of justice. I feel the same principle applies to the Department&#x2019;s policy in Natal of taking circuit courts up into Zululand, because these people like to see justice being done; they do not like to hear about it. Likewise, the ordinary man and woman should be given an opportunity of taking part in the administration of justice. Otherwise it will become something far removed, exercised by servants of the State, generally speaking&#x2014;I am not referring to the Judges&#x2014;and the ordinary administration of justice then becomes part of the ever-growing bureaucratic system of government which one finds in every Western country in the world. It becomes a decision taken by an official of the Government which is enforcing the law. The principle which is involved in the jury system is that the jury stands between the individual and the harshness of the State. There is no doubt that juries do something which the hon. member for Klerksdorp also mentioned. I think he said they temper justice with mercy. I want to put this a little differently. I would say that juries temper the strict law with the morality of the day. There is no doubt whatever that the law is, always has been and always will be, 30 years behind the time. One can remember that in 1914 it was a criminal offence to commit adultery. The Appellate Division in that year decided that this was not in conformity with the morality of the day and that crime disappeared. It had been abrogated by disuse.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>By disuse of prosecutions. The jury provides these 30 missing years. It is very interesting to see what sort of verdicts juries give when they are asked to apply strictly a law with which they do not agree. If there is ever a truism about our law, about any law. it is that the law is never designed to meet all the cases which come up for decision. All the cases that arise can never be foreseen by the Legislature, which is concerned with the generality of the principle, and in the application of that principle the Judges and magistrates by their training must <span class="col_1507-1508" refersTo="page_770"/>strictly apply that law, even to the extent of allowing an injustice such as would normally be unconscionable to them and to society. But they are trained not to have consideration for the morality of the day, but to have consideration only for the law, for their master, the law, and to apply the facts according to that law.</p>

<p>I was very interested to read in the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning an extract from the <i>Burger,</i> which says that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">at any rate some of the consequences of some of the clauses of the extended Immorality Act and of their application could hardly have been foreseen, as is apt to happen with laws.</block>

<p>I think that is true. It is an observation they make in respect of a particular law which, there is no doubt, if one is to believe the article in the <i>Burger,</i> causes not only injustice but harm to people not connected with the offence, and perhaps even harm to South Africa. The point is that there are many laws which should not be applied to their limits. Judges and magistrates must apply them to their limits. They have no discretion. They are not allowed and they do not allow morality or compassion to enter into their judgments. But a jury does allow that compassion to enter into its verdict, and it gives in the result a judgment which reflects the morality of the day. It gives a judgment which is in all conscience a true verdict according to the evidence.</p>

<p>One can argue that juries, in giving decisions which Judges might not give, in fact have regard to what the real intention of the law is, and not to the strict interpretation of the law. For the reason that it is impossible to make a law to meet every case, and because local conditions must determine whether a law has the same effect in that local area as it does in another local area or not, juries in that regard perform an invaluable function of the law, not only to the law but to society. I believe that is the function of the law, to protect society. It is there for the benefit of society and not for the benefit of the State or for the benefit of anyone else but the people who are affected by it. Here, Sir, is the opportunity for the people who are affected by it to take part in it, to know it and to appreciate it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very difficult question and perhaps I define it differently from the way the Minister does. The State is where society is. I believe that society is the people in the State, and what they think. The State is the edifice in which they live, and the State&#x2019;s edifice, with all its machinery, belongs to the society which lives in that State. The State, as an entity, does not exist apart from society. There are those who believe that the State is what matters, and the State has become personified in the form of the Government, but I do not believe that is true and I am pleased to see the Minister shaking his head to show that he does not believe it either.</p>

<p>One of the arguments which has been used here and no doubt elsewhere against the jury system is that it is a foreign system. Sir, there is nothing foreign, in so far as our legal system is concerned, about what has come from England. What has come from England in our legal system has become, as it did in England, part of the people who live under that system. Justice is the issue which we are debating here to-day, and justice in this country I believe to be without peer as a system of justice. It has the broad principles of the Roman-Dutch law and the vehicle or machinery of the English law of evidence and procedure. No one can gainsay that everything we have, in so far as our system is concerned, not only comes from England but is even to-day part of the English system. The procedural laws and the laws of evidence and the jury system are all tied up together. Only yesterday we had two Bills before this House. One was to deal with the substantive law, with the Roman-Dutch law, as the hon. the Minister said, to bring the Roman-Dutch law forward and replace this other system we had. And the other was the law of evidence, an Act which is on all fours, almost word for word, with the English Act.</p>

<p>When the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with the question of the law of evidence and the argument that the jury system was a foreign system and should therefore be abolished. I was saying that all our procedural law is in fact foreign in that sense, in the sense in which that word was used, because it all comes from England. In fact, our law provides to-day, in the Criminal Procedure Act, that if there is any doubt as to what the law is one has to look to the law relating to the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. This was re-enacted in 1956 as part and parcel of our law. Mr. Speaker, the jury system in South Africa to-day is in fact part of the law of evidence. It is part of the law relating to how you prove facts in a court of law. I have said that we have the best system of justice in the world to-day, and we have it because we have a combination or marriage of the finest legal systems in the form of the Roman-Dutch law, which is based on broad principles of law, and we have the machinery or the vehicle for carrying that law into effect in the form of this system of evidence of which the jury is a part. That law of evidence and the jury system have been accepted by us because it was tried over the centuries, both in England and in South Africa, and so much do we think of that system that <span class="col_1509-1510" refersTo="page_771"/>we even provide to-day that whatever the law is in England, if there is any doubt, that is the law in South Africa. What we have here is a suggestion by the mover of this motion that we begin to break down this system which has stood the test of centuries and which has become part of our own law.</p>

<p>There are many variations, of course, of the English law of evidence, and in South Africa those variations make our system of justice even fairer than the English system. One of these is the question of a confession. In England it is possible to admit in a court of law a confession made to a policeman provided it is proved that it was made voluntarily. In South Africa it is not possible to do that, and one of the reasons why it is not possible and why our law provides that no statement made to a policeman can be produced in evidence as a confession by that policeman, is that it would be prejudicial to the accused, especially if he was being tried by a jury. Mr. Speaker, there are no cases of injustices which have been done to accused persons through their being tried by a jury. It is true that there are cases which have given Judges cause to express surprise at the verdict, but I doubt very much, and no one to-day has been able to produce an example of a Judge who was shocked at the decision of the jury which produced an injustice for the accused. You do not have to look to juries to find injustices, as far as the accused are concerned. If one takes the now famous case, the Bergville murder trial, the so-called &#x201C;dagga trial&#x201D;, where 23 persons were sentenced to death for the murder of a number of policemen who were on a dagga raid, they all asked for leave to appeal, which was refused by the trial Judge. Their petition was heard by a Judge of Appeal who decided that there was no ground for appeal, that there was no chance of success on appeal, and the death sentences were confirmed. At the last minute, while these people were all in the death cells, evidence was collected to show that one man was not there, and the Appeal Court then heard the case and the extraordinary thing about it was that they said there was no evidence whatsoever that this man was at the scene of the crime at all; they said he should have been discharged at the end of the Crown case. But that was a case which was tried by a Judge and assessors. It was a question of fact, and one wonders whether there is any substance in the thought that juries are not able to find on facts as easily or as competently as a Judge. These are the examples which were given, and not one example was given of the verdict of a jury which resulted in an injustice to the accused. That is the object of our criminal law, to provide a system which will produce the truth as far as possible, but at all costs, that there should be no prejudice to the accused. The law is not their function. Even on the law, which is the function of the Judges, they are inclined to disagree. There is a well-known case&#x2014;I hope it is well known to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;of statutory theft where you are regarded as being guilty of theft where you buy something which you ought to have known was stolen property, the test being not whether the accused knew whether it was stolen, but whether the Judge in that position would have thought it was stolen. On this issue in Natal the courts have decided that there is to be compulsory whipping for a first offence, but in the Transvaal the courts have decided that a whipping is incompetent for a first offence. I am sure that the Judges, looking at each other, would have the same thoughts that the hon. member for Klerksdorp mentioned, that they were surprised at the verdict of the jury. I am sure that the Judges in the Transvaal might be surprised at the verdict of the Judges in Natal, and vice versa. Those arguments do not really hold any water, because they can be used on both sides. No one is infallible. Sir, the hon. member for Klerksdorp quoted a lot of extracts from Law Journals. One of the things he said was that justice was administered without a sense of responsibility. I want to say that is nonsense. He went on to say that the responsibility of the jury was divisible in nines and was therefore necessarily a weakness. He also said that there were no facilities for the jury to take notes and there was no elbow room. Sir, I am sorry to say so but anyone who has been in a court of law will see that this is patent nonsense. They may take notes if they want to do so. Papers and pencils are provided, and there is a lot of elbow room. I just want to say that it is not true that in fact happens. So far from being divisible by nine, the decision of the jury is strengthened by nine. Sir, Judges and magistrates are human; they also sometimes get out of the bed on the wrong side; very often the eggs aren&#x2019;t turned properly by their wives and they might have had a motor accident on their way to court. They might like all of us be a little bit gripy in the morning. But the law of averages would indicate that nine men are unlikely to have coincidence of these things on the morning that they go into court.</p>

<p>The choice before this House to-day is whether we believe that an accused is entitled to be tried, if he wants to be, by nine men or whether he should be tried by one. Only the facts are to be tried, and we believe that he should retain this right, if he so wishes, and we believe it so strongly that we shall, if the opportunity arises, vote against this motion. Sir, this is a system of which we can all be justly proud and I believe that we should leave it alone.</p>

<p>Before the luncheon adjournment the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) said that the General Bar Council was in favour of the retention of the jury system. I can understand why the General Bar Council is in favour of the retention of the jury system. The hon. member said that when an advocate has to decide on behalf of an accused, whether to have a jury or not, the accused chose a Judge when <span class="col_1511-1512" refersTo="page_772"/>he was innocent, and a jury when he was guilty. Well, the General Bar Council consists of advocates and they are the people who advise their clients and you can understand, Sir, why they want to retain the jury system, because I have never heard that only persons who were guilty were charged and that because of that they chose a jury. That is why they are against the abolition of the jury system. In connection with this I want to say further that the advocates adopt a different attitude when they are appointed to the Bench. On page 56, paragraph 360 of the report of the Lansdowne Commission published in 1947, a commission which dealt with penal and prison reform, you find this&#x2014;every member of that Commission was a Judge&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Judges of the Supreme Court (including the Appellate Division) are, with the exception of the Judges of the Cape Provincial Division, unanimously in favour of the retention of jury trial. The Judges of the Cape Provincial Division favour the abolition of trial by jury and its replacement by trial by Judge and assessors. Juries are not, in the opinion of the learned Judges of the Cape Provincial Division, fitted to try a case of any complexity. Of the Attorneys-General and the Solicitor-General, three were for abolition, one for qualified retention and one for retention where asked for by the accused.</block>

<p>This report came out in 1947 and since then, I believe, all four provinces of the Republic have been in favour of the abolition of the jury system. In the province of South West Africa, if I may call it that, there is no jury system. You can quite understand, therefore, that the argument is that the General Bar Council is in favour of the jury system, but the moment they get appointed to the Bench, they see the other side of the picture. Then they are no longer members of the Bar Council and they change their opinion.</p>

<p>In his introductory remarks the hon. member went on to say: &#x201C;What we are concerned with here to-day is justice.&#x201D; When he said that I was reminded of a case which was heard in the Supreme Court of the Free State some time ago. It was a murder case where a farmer had shot one of his servants. Wisely the advocate chose a jury to decide the case. Since it is the custom in this country to prove the guilt of the accused, the Crown succeeded in proving that the man had shot his servant. The case against the accused was proved beyond any doubt. The advocate did not have much to say but when he addressed the jury he said this &#x201C;Honourable members of the jury, do you not think that a person on his own farm has the right to take his own gun and shoot his own servant? If that is no longer the position, it is a sad day.&#x201D; Well, the verdict was not guilty. I cannot see therefore, where justice comes into it, because had the accused in this case appeared before a Judge, he would have been condemned to death.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is an unenviable task to have to say anything after the hon. members for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) and Standerton (Dr. Coertze) have stated their cases, but nevertheless I want to point out one or two things which have not been raised yet, and the first is the delays that are caused in our courts because of the jury system. It is a well-known fact that where a trial by jury takes place, it lasts twice as long as when a Judge sits alone. We shall therefore save a great deal of time if we abolished the jury system completely. We know that the rolls of the courts are to-day overflowing and that it takes months, even years, before a case can be placed on the roll. It may be said that you have a jury in criminal cases, but if the jury system were abolished, the Judges who presided criminal courts, could then be used in civil cases. The Lansdowne Commission confirms that a jury takes twice as long to try a case as a Judge or a Judge with two assessors.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp mentioned a long list of classes of persons who were excluded from serving on a jury. There are 21 classes. It is not necessary for me to repeat those classes; they are given in Section 115 of Act 56 of 1955. The question is which classes are left. The only remaining classes are agriculture, trade and industry. The members of these classes are the very people in our society who are the busiest. There is thus a limited number from which jury members may be chosen. I spoke to a Sheriff recently, and he told me that amongst these classes there were people who were continually asking for exemption. They do everything in their power not to serve on the jury. They go so far as to approach the defence and to ask the defence to object to them on some ground or other so that they need not serve on the jury. That only goes to show that the ordinary member of the public is no longer prepared to serve on a jury to-day.</p>

<p>There may be one advantage connected with the retention of the jury system. If we were to have large scale unemployment in the country, members of the jury could be appointed from the ranks of the unemployed, but fortunately we are not in that position to-day.</p>

<p>I want to go further and refer to the costs connected with the compilation of the jury list. The Chief Electoral Officer has to prepare a list of all the registered voters and take from that list all those people between the ages of 25 and 65 years. That takes up a great deal of time because it is obvious that every registration card must be checked to ascertain the age of the person and those details have to be forwarded to the magistrate who in turn forwards it to the Sheriff. That takes up a great deal of time and is obviously costly. But that is not all. After the magistrate has forwarded <span class="col_1513-1514" refersTo="page_773"/>the list to the Sheriff, the Sheriff has to prepare a panel and in that way further time is wasted and it involves high costs, because, as I have said, many people are called upon to serve on the jury who are not prepared to do so. Some people have moved and cannot be traced and the Sheriff has to find substitutes for them. Persons may also obtain exemption and in that case the Sheriff has to find substitutes. It is therefore a waste of time. Let us see who the persons are who can be summonsed to serve as jury members. As I have said they belong to trade, industry and agriculture. Those are hard-working people who are to-day occupied in keeping our whole economy going.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the fees which are paid to members of the jury. When this system was introduced in the Transvaal Republic in 1854 the law provided that a member of a jury could be paid an amount of four sixdollars, equivalent to approximately 6s. per day, as well as his travelling expenses. In 1874 this was increased to 10s. per day and this amount remained unchanged up to 1956 when it was increased to 15s. per day, that is to say, if the jury member is resident in the magisterial district where the case is to be heard, and if he can sleep at home at night, but if the distance between his home and the court is so great that it is necessary for him to sleep in the city, he recieves an additional 15s., a total therefore of &#x00A3;1 10s. per day, from which he still has to pay for his accommodation.</p>

<p>When you consider that a jury member receives a fee of only 15s. you cannot hold it against any person if he does not want to serve on a jury, because which person earns less than 15s. to-day? Those who do are the the weakest type, the very person that you do not want on a jury. We are therefore, doing people a disservice by summonsing them to serve on a jury. It disrupts their business. Sometimes a person has to sit on a jury for weeks on end. If he is an artisan he receives 15s. for his services on the jury and there is no obligation on his firm to pay him the difference between his wage and his jury fee. He, therefore, suffers a dead loss. The same applies to the businessman. Surely his time is worth more to him than 15s. per day, but he is now called upon to attend to something which is of no interest to him at all, simply because some people still wish to retain the jury system. It is therefore a waste of time and money. The Sheriffs also have to incur unnecessary costs in compiling the jury lists and in serving the summonses. In the 1960-61 Budget an amount of R9,000 was voted as jury fees. It does not sound much but it is unnecessary to pay out that amount. It is also proof, on the other hand, that the jury system has served its purpose, and that the jury system is not being used on such a large scale any more.</p>

<p>When the Lansdowne Commission sat in 1947 in connection with penal and prison reform, certain arguments were advanced why the system should be kept alive and they were based mainly on sentimental reasons, such as that the jury system has practically become tradition in South Africa. Nevertheless the Lansdowne Commission felt that the system had served its purpose. From the evidence submitted to that commission in 1947 it appeared that of all which appeared before court, approximately only 25 per cent were cases where a jury could be appointed. Last year less than 2 per cent of those kind of cases appeared before court, which proves that the jury system has served its purpose in South Africa. One might say that it should be allowed to die naturally and that we should leave it at that but if you had listened to the arguments of the mover of the motion and those of the hon. member for Standerton and you considered the costs that were involved in this system and the unnecessary work that was entailed you must come to one conclusion only, namely that the jury system has served its purpose.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the hon. members for Klerksdorp and Standerton by supporting this motion, and I have no doubt that after the Minister has heard us, he will instruct his legal advisers to have the various sections in respect of juries and the jury system repealed. It gives me pleasure, therefore, to support the motion moved by the hon. member for Klerksdorp.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like first to deal with some of the criticisms of the jury system which have been raised from the other side. The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) has suggested to the Minister that he should abandon his good intention of being guided to a large extent by the General Bar Council on the ground that the Bar Council allegedly has some very narrow interest in this matter. Sir, I do wish to cross swords with the hon. member on that point, because I suggest that the General Council most definitely is the body in this country best qualified to express an opinion on the jury system, and that only the weightiest considerations would weigh with them. In addition, he mentioned the question of expense. While one can concede that there is a certain amount of expense attached to the jury system, I suggest that it is a very limited one. Indeed I think some figure was mentioned by the hon. the Minister, a very small amount of, I think, R8,000 a year. I suggest that is a very small amount, particularly if you bear in mind the very great public service which is performed in educating the people of the country in the ways of the courts, and in instilling respect amongst the people for the courts and the administration of justice. Mr. Speaker, I have not yet spoken to a juryman who has not both enjoyed and welcomed the experience of serving on a jury. In ray experience the weightiness of the administration of justice has been brought home to them and they have been glad to have been called to perform their <span class="col_1515-1516" refersTo="page_774"/>duty. Consequently I feel that if there is a certain amount of expense attached to the jury system, it is an expense which, since it is small, can well be afforded.</p>

<p>Then there is the question that was raised by the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), and that is the difficult position of the Minister of Justice in so far as exercising his discretion under, I think Section 111 is concerned. Here he has to decide whether or not to grant a trial by a Judge and deny trial by jury. I suggest that difficulty can easily be met by a small amendment to the Act, making it compulsory in the cases particularly complained of that it should be a Judge and assessor trial. I am thinking there of cases in which Europeans and non-Europeans are involved, where the hon. member for Standerton felt that it placed the Minister in a very invidious position. If there do happen to be others in which the Minister is placed in a particularly invidious position, possibly the same approach could be applied there. Likewise the hon. member for Standerton stressed the fact that South Africa was not a homogeneous country and that this was a further reason for doing away with the jury system. But there too the same approach could be applied, namely that in such cases a trial by a Judge and assessors can be made compulsory.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof referred to the Lansdowne Commission and the attitude set out by the Judges in that report. But, sir, that report was drawn up in 1947, and the passage quoted by the hon. member made it clear that what the Judges were not in favour of then was trial by jury when very complicated matters were at issue, where very difficult matters of accountancy or insolvency were at issue. Those situations have already been dealt with by amendment to the Act, and I take it therefore that the objections of the Judges at that time would fall away. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister can tell us what the present position is, but my impression is that it is certainly not the wish of the majority of the Judges that this system should be done away with. It is, of course, at the present time limited to a considerable extent, and I suggest that limited right should continue to exist.</p>

<p>I think we must bear in mind in this matter that the jury system in fact is maintained in very many parts of the world and, as has been made clear, the ordinary man is brought into the administration of justice in most parts of the world. He is in fact used in the administration of justice in most parts of the world, and it is in this way too that he is used in South Africa. I want to stress that you find the jury system in operation in America, in Australia, and in many other parts of the Commonwealth. And I think in these countries it has obtained a new lease of life largely because certain of the weaknesses have been eliminated, and these weaknesses have likewise been eliminated here by successive amendments to the Act.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite criticized the value of the trial by one&#x2019;s peers. I suggest that right to the layman is probably much more valuable than lawyers are prepared to concede. I think it was said that judicial officers are trained to decide and to weigh evidence and that as the result of their long training they have a certain approach to a case. That is very true and it is very valuable. But I think lawyers will have to admit that this very attitude which their experience and training gives them, is one which has its weaknesses. It is one which very often leads the ordinary man to regard the lawyer as a bit of a freak and as a strange creature who indulges in long debates and discussions upon points over which the ordinary man would not waste any time. I think to the man who is in the dock, accused of some crime, it must often be a great relief to know that when his actions are judged, they will be judged by a man who has not become too imbued with the approach of the reasonable man of the law; but that he will be judged by a set of men not very different to himself, men who have perhaps more foibles than a rather more severe man trained in law. I think it is for that reason that right is very largely prized and regarded as an important right by those who write upon this subject.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton mentioned the work by Mr. Justice Devlin, &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D;. He will agree with me that Judge Devlin there said that he considered that the jury is in fact the best instrument for deciding the reliability or the credibility of the witness. Coming from a most eminent Judge, that is, I suggest, very great testimony to the value of a jury in deciding both the truthfulness and the reliability of a witness. And I do ask the hon. the Minister and the House not lightly to discard an instrument which is described in those terms by so eminent a Judge.</p>

<p>I think the point that was made against the retention of the jury system, namely, that at the time of the Salt River Collision there were extremely high claims for damages arising out of that particular accident, illustrates one of the great virtues of the system. The claims were high and it was apparently feared that high awards of damages would be made. The presumption was that those awards would be higher than the Judges would be prepared to grant. I suggest therefore that there would have been a feeling amongst the ordinary men and women of this country, or amongst the men sitting on that jury, that it would be appropriate that those awards should be high. In that way you have what might be described as justice tempering the law; the law represented by the stern, judicial approach which leads the Judges to feel that in certain cases certain awards should be made; a standard of payment becomes set and that standard tends to be followed. But the ordinary man feels that this is a case where a higher amount of <span class="col_1517-1518" refersTo="page_775"/>damages should be awarded. And so, without damaging the fabric of the law (since the standard remains the same being unaffected by the jury award), the existence of the jury enables the feeling of the people to be expressed, and yet a slightly higher award of damages is made. What applies in civil cases applies equally in criminal cases. You can get a feeling among the people that a certain crime, perhaps a statutory offence, should not be regarded as a crime or a serious offence. This view will be reflected by the jury; they will perhaps acquit on such a charge.</p>

<p>I think nothing illustrates more fittingly the proposition that juries will not always be led by judicial officers, where they have a will not to be, then the story mentioned by the hon. member for Durban (North) of the jury who were asked by the Judge whether all nine of them were insane. They apparently had not been prepared to follow his summing-up to them, and I think it cannot be said that they can merely be taken as rubber-stamps in these matters.</p>

<p>It is often said that a great merit of the jury system is that it is a safeguard against repugnant laws. If I may just quote a passage from this book by Judge Devlin &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D; where he is speaking of Britain, which is a homogeneous country and a country which possibly would be less subject to difficulties in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Trial by jury gives protection against laws which the ordinary man may regard as harsh and oppressive. I do not mean by that more than that it is a protection against tyranny. It is that but it is also an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man&#x2019;s idea of what is fair and just. If it does not, a jury will not be a party to its enforcement. They have in the past used their power of acquittal to defeat the full operation of laws which they thought to be too harsh.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Likewise he makes the point, again in a country where the administration of justice is easier than with us, that the jury can be regarded as a lamp of freedom. He says that as long as the jury is there it may well be an important safeguard in difficult times.</p>

<p>So I would say to hon. members opposite that they must surely accept, where it is suggested that a change should be made, that they must discharge the onus and establish beyond a reasonable doubt that this change should be made. Because I do not think they can seriously argue that the disadvantages, such as they have advanced, are really very considerable. They have admittedly made certain points of criticism and indeed over the years this matter has been a great subject for debate in law moots and in other places. But when it comes to showing that the defects outweigh the advantages, I suggest that they have not made out a case for its abolition. Moreover I think that at this time particularly, when we are all aware of the importance and the difficulty of keeping the name of South Africa high, we should not take a step which may well be misconstrued overseas. In many of the countries that we particularly wish to retain as our friends, this system is retained and respected, and they do write about it in the sort of terms that I have mentioned to the House. I hope very much that we will not take a step which may well alienate their sympathy and their understanding and perhaps lead to further misconceptions about us. I accordingly hope that the hon. the Minister will see it in this light.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I also wish to congratulate the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) on the manner in which he has introduced this motion and especially to thank him for the history which he gave us of trial by jury system. It is quite clear from that history that this form of trial has become traditional; it was established overseas, in our older mother countries, as far back as the 11th century, and it developed gradually. Admittedly when it was first introduced, the system of trial may appear to us to-day to be a little ridiculous, but the mere fact that the form of trial was altered from time shows that the jurists, the legislatures, the governments of the areas at the time realized that there were faults and they continually amended the system until we have it as it is to-day. We ourselves have amended the law from time to time to bring trial by jury to the present system, and I ask that for that reason we should maintain it as it is now. Sir, it was applied for the first time in the Cape in the year 1827, and the hon. member for Klerksdorp told us that the Voortrekkers in the Free State and the Transvaal accepted that form of trial in those two republics.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<p>They took the law with them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the point I want to make is this, that it had only been established for about seven years before the Trek took place, and the fact remains that the Voortrekkers themselves were so impressed with this system of trial that after only seven years of experience of it in the Cape, they took this new system with them and applied it in the Transvaal and the Free State. I say that is the greatest compliment which can be paid to the system of trial by jury.</p>

<p>It was said by the hon. member for Klerksdorp that the basis of this system of justice is that a man must be tried, or a citizen must be tried by his peers and that does not apply in this country in the first place in the magistrates&#x2019; courts where there is no trial by jury or by peers. I grant him that, but I would like to point out this too that any accused has the right of appeal from a magistrate&#x2019;s court to a higher court where other minds can be brought to bear on the facts which are recorded in the case, and he has that right of appeal without <span class="col_1519-1520" refersTo="page_776"/>permission from anybody, so that if an accused feels that a magistrate was wrong&#x2014;and we know from the success of appeals that magistrates are often wrong&#x2014;he has the right to go to another court where other minds can be brought to bear on the evidence. It is said too that this basis falls down in a multi-racial country where we have the juries composed solely from members of a minority group and that in the case of the Bantu, the majority group, they are not given the benefit of trial by their peers. There are obvious reasons for that, but I would like to point out to the hon. members that if an African does not wish to be tried by his White peers, he need not be so tried; the choice remains with him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pelser">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>He has not got the benefit of the system.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He has the benefit of the system in that he can choose to be tried by a jury, and I will tell the hon. member when he does choose this system. He chooses it especially in Native areas, and he chooses it when the evidence produced against him or the evidence which he can produce has to deal with Native habits and Native customs. It has often happened that the evidence in the case may appear to support a conviction according to White standards whereas those who know the thinking of the African and know his habits and know how he would behave as a class, would not accept that evidence. That is where the juries play a very valuable part. In the reserves the African has the right to choose in such cases, and in certain cases he does choose a jury, and there a jury is selected from traders and people living in that area who know the African, who know his customs and who know his way of life, and they are in a much better position to judge the probabilities of the case on the evidence before them, than a strange Judge who may have had no association with the Africans at all and may know nothing of his habits and customs, who has not learned Native law and who is sent around to try cases in a circuit court. Not only is there the disadvantage of having the Judge not knowing these customs, but very often the same applies to the barristers who may not be <i>aux fait</i> with Native habits and customs. In cases like that the African has the right, if he so chooses, to choose a jury of people who know how he behaves and how he thinks. I submit that is a most important consideration, and the hon. the Minister and the House should bear it in mind.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp in justifying his case for the abolition of juries, pointed out that judges have on occasion criticized the verdicts given by juries. They have not criticized the verdicts actually, but have expressed surprise at a verdict given by a jury. I want to point out that a Judge is one man expressing surprise at a judgment given by nine other men. But I would also like to point out that there are many, many cases where appeal courts have expressed surprise at judgments given by Judges. As the hon. member knows, in a trial by a Judge in a criminal case where a Judge is sitting with assessors, there is no right of appeal, unless permission is given; the accused has to obtain leave to appeal, first of the Judge who tried the case and then, if necessary, of the Appeal Court. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) referred to the Natal case in which a Judge refused leave to appeal; eventually the matter was brought before the Appeal Court and certain of the accused were acquitted who had been convicted by the Judge. The hon. the Minister himself will remember a recent case at Umtata where the Judge convicted Clarke, a policeman. Clarke applied for leave to appeal. The Judge rejected the application, and eventually a petition was presented to the Appeal Court, and the Appeal Court then decided that he could appeal, and the Appeal Court found, as stated in the judgment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clearly then the finding that he was guilty of contempt of court cannot be sustained.</block>

<p>And it acquitted the accused. There was another case in Port Elizabeth many years ago when the accused was also acquitted by the Appeal Court after leave had been refused by the lower Judge. There are numerous cases which can be quoted in which the Appeal Court found that the Judge in the first instance was wrong. But as the hon. member for Durban (North) pointed out, the fact remains that in trial by jury there may be surprise occasionally at acquittals, but I have never yet heard of criticism of a conviction of an accused. And surely, Sir, it is much better than 99 guilty men go free than that one innocent man should be found guilty.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp also said that the juries really become a reflection of the Judge&#x2019;s opinion, that the juries&#x2019; verdicts are a reflection of the Judge&#x2019;s summing-up. Sir, because the juries may as a rule agree with the Judge, that does not necessary mean that they are merely falling in with what the Judge says. The Judge sums up the evidence as he sees it and an important point is this that should the Judge be summing up wrongly, the counsel for the defence can always draw his attention to it and, if necessary, take the Judge on appeal. So the Judge has to be careful that in summing up he does give a correct summing-up to the jury, and that he does not prejudice the one side or the other. His summing-up has to be correct, and the jury then decides on the facts as summed up by the Judge.</p>

<p>I know that a lot of the arguments against juries can be justified. The hon. member for Klerksdorp put up an excellent case. But there is no doubt that equally so can a very good case be put up, and was in fact put up by the hon. member for Durban (North), in favour of the retention of this system.</p>

<p>I say that in weighing up the probabilities, even if you should decide that the case to-day against juries is strong and that the facts support the abolition of the system rather than its retention, there must be some doubt and that the traditional form should be maintained. The mere fact that it is only chosen in 2 per cent of the cases heard before the Supreme Court is no justification for abolishing the system.

<p>I submit not. It is only in special cases that the right has been taken away, as for example in cases between Black and White, where you would have a White jury perhaps prejudiced in favour of the White man, and there rightly, we amended the law, as the law in regard to juries has been amended from the 11th century onwards. But I submit that there is no reason now to abolish it, even if it is only chosen by 2 per cent of the accused who are brought before the Supreme Court. Let the people retain that right.

<p>I would not say in the majority of cases, but where customs or habits are apt to play a part in coming to a decision, and where the knowledge of the customs and habits of Africans are of importance in coming to a decision on the probabilities of the facts, they can choose a jury, and also where a Judge is completely new to the African form of life&#x2014;a new Judge who has not practised in a Native area before&#x2014;it is of importance that you have men on the jury who know the African. You will find, Sir, that in choosing juries, as I have often had to do in consultation with the barrister, that the Judge&#x2019;s knowledge of the African way of life is an important consideration. You have some Judges who have practised in those areas before going to the Bench and who have experience of those areas; there it is not so essential that you get a jury of men who know the African way of life, as it is when you get a complete stranger on circuit.</p>

But that is his duty as a citizen. After all citizens lose financially when they are called up for military service, but nobody will say that you must abolish military service and military training merely because citizens may lose financially. This has become part of our social structure, and I submit that we should keep it. I want to ask the Minister to leave it, even if only 1 per cent use this form of trial. Do not take away that right.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, all the hon. members who have spoken up to now have a legal background in the sense that they are entitled to claim certain legal qualifications, and I think it is about time that someone being just a lay member of the public, a possible juryman, one of the very small and privileged class left in this country, should have a few words to say on the subject. I, up to very recently, was one of the people who could qualify, not falling under one of the very many exceptions which were read out to us this morning by the hon. member for Klerksdorp. I could qualify as a member of the jury, and in fact did so qualify on two occasions that I can recall, and I therefore have some practical experience of this matter.</p>

Like many other people, I am not qualified but nevertheless interested in the law and the processess of the law. Now the arguments that we have heard here this morning and this afternoon have all been so compelling, in my opinion, that it would require a Solomon to distinguish between the two courses, and to decide which would be the soundest and the best way of disposing of this motion.</p>

<p>That is the point, Sir. Now I find myself more or less in the role of a Judge, and similarly, Sir, all members present here to-day, will have to take that role because they will have to decide on this issue, and if I can influence them in any way, I will be very grateful.</p>

<p>The main contention of the hon. member for Klerksdorp, if I remember correctly, was that the jury system is dying out. It has been said in different ways to-day that it is dying out, but I should like to say that there is no reason why we should kill something, let alone somebody, merely because that institution is old. Let us assume that it is dying out; then why not leave it to die a natural and decent death as something that has been part of the history of this country for many years. Why this determination to kill this dying institution? There must be some reason. Because, as far as we know other than the fact that it does cost some money (I believe R8,000 a year in direct charges), the cost factor has not been seriously advanced as part of the argument against the system at all. In a country with a Budget as large as our Budget, I doubt whether anybody will contend that the chief reason why the jury system should be abolished, is because of the cost involved. Certainly the cost is not inordinate. The hon. member for Prinshof based his argument mainly on the fact that the time factor was important, that it took twice as long to try a person or to hear a matter in a trial by jury than on the basis of a Judge and assessors. One wonders whether that is a relevant argument. After the event one finds, in one&#x2019;s own life, and also, if I may say with respect, in the life of the people who are sitting in this House, that a great deal of time has been wasted. I am not judging the matter, but we may be wasting a lot of time to-day by arguing against the motion of the hon. member for Klerksdorp. So it is not sufficient to say that merely because you save time, you must do a certain thing. No, the question is: Are you doing the right thing by carrying out your plans as originally intended, will it be better to abolish a particular system and, consequently, are you going to save some time in the process of the law? I do not think that time is really to be regarded as a serious argument against the retention of the system.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was the argument that so few people take advantage of the right to be tried by jury and that for that reason since the system is falling into disuse or desuetude, it does not need to be kept alive. But that is one thing entirely separate and different from saying that it should be abolished. It may be fair to argue that we should do nothing, that the hon. the Minister should do nothing to keep the system alive longer than it will live in a natural way. But to go over to the other argument that merely because it is not used by more than 2 per cent, or whatever it is, of the people who come before the courts, is not in itself a good argument for making an end of it. Because statistically you cannot prove the use or the value of this at all. I want to give you an analogy, Mr. Speaker, since I was reminded of the fact that I have been a member of the City Council of Johannesburg. There, as in many other cities of the Union, there is a serious dearth of public conveniences. There was a time when whenever we (certain members of the Council) tried to persuade the authorities in Johannesburg to establish more of these conveniences, a certain official would argue that those that were already in existence were only used by two or three or seven people a day, and that in other words, there was no need for this particular amenity (if I may use the word) because statistically it could be proved that it was not used by sufficient people I need hardly say that nobody other than this particular person believed seriously in that argument, because there are certain things which commend themselves as either necessary or desirable in case they are required, regardless of the actual use to which they may be put. And I must say, Mr. Speaker, with due respect, that I am not for a moment trying to draw an analogy between the jury system and the establishment of a chain of public conveniences. But the merit of the argument, if any at all, is that while the system is in existence, those who wish to avail themselves of it, for reasons best known to themselves (which do not concern anybody else), are in a position to do so. The abolition of this amenity, this right, may well create a position in which it would be found that there is in fact a serious need of it and that the lack of that amenity then becomes a public problem, and certainly a problem for certain individuals who come before the courts.</p>

<p>I want to deal with an aspect which was raised here to-day in regard to the question of the ability of a jury, or a juryman as such, to bring a fresh mind to bear on the problem. I think it is fair to say that a Judge, like anybody else is inclined to fall into a rut&#x2014;naturally, I speak with the utmost deference about any member of the Judiciary&#x2014;and the very fact that is the vocation of the individual concerned which he follows over a period of years, means that his ways may become set, his outlook may become set, and that he may not be in as close contact with the morality of the day&#x2014;to which the hon. member for Durban (North) referred&#x2014;as he could be, if he were not on the Bench and occupying a very important and responsible position. I think there is a great deal of historical support for this argument. One thinks, for example, of W. S. Gilbert. There have been so many authorities quoted here like Forsyth, Devlin and others, that I wondered whether anybody would quote W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a work called &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D;. The usher in this particular case, which was heard some 70 or 80 years ago&#x2014;the copyright of this story has now run out and I or anyone else can use it&#x2014;was heard to say to the jurymen when they had been empannelled&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now, jurymen, hear my advice, <span class="col_1525-1526" refersTo="page_779"/><br/>All kinds of vulgar prejudice, <br/>I pray you set aside. <br/>With stern judicial frame of mind, <br/>From bias free of every kind, <br/>This trial must be tried.</block>

<p>Surely, Sir, that is the spirit in which any juryman in South Africa, although the usher in a particular court may not have adjured him in the same way that the usher did in the court in London, no doubt approaches his task&#x2014;free from every kind of prejudice. It transpired that in this particular case the Judge was anything but free from prejudice. You may say, Sir, that this is allegorical, but he himself admitted this, for he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I, good friends, was called to the bar, <br/>I&#x2019;d an appetite fresh and hearty, <br/>But I was, as many young barristers are, <br/>An impecunious party.</block>

<p>He goes on to say that he had many difficulties until he fell in love with a rich attorney&#x2019;s daughter, which by common consent, is a short-cut for any barrister to attain wealth and stability in life, if he is impecunious. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For now I&#x2019;m a Judge, and a good Judge, too.</block>

<p>You see, Sir, how easy it is. The moment he is a Judge he is a &#x201C;good&#x201D; Judge too!&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Though all my law be fudge, <br/>Yet I&#x2019;ll never, never budge, <br/>But I&#x2019;ll live and die a Judge, <br/>And a good Judge, too.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, is that not relevant here? The fact is that by virtue of the appointment of a person to high office, he is inclined to become hide-bound, he is inclined to become somewhat out of touch with what has rightly been called public morality and the morality of the day. From that point of view, I think that a very good case can, and in fact, has been made out for the retention of the system as we know it here.</p>

<p>In South Africa, particularly, where there is a great deal of public suspicion at times about whether the White race or one of the others is acting properly, I would say it is most important to retain anything which gives an impression of justice towards all sections of the community. I am not&#x2014;and I say this with great deference as a member of the public not legally trained&#x2014;impressed by the argument that there are cases, and in fact there have been many cases, where it has been proved that a non-White person will never elect to be tried by a jury. Because, Mr. Speaker, we are inclined to forget that there are also White people in South Africa. The whole case seems to be geared to the argument that a non-White, in some area where he knows there is prejudice against him because of what he has done, will not receive a fair trial if he is tried by a jury consisting of persons who are sympathetic towards the person who has been aggrieved or harmed. But what about the Europeans in South Africa? Here we are about to abolish a system in a country which in terms of the present intentions of the Government&#x2014;I do not want to impinge upon national policy&#x2014;will become a White country and a White country only. Why should the argument, that we have a vast number of non-Whites, advanced by the hon. member for Klerksdorp, be a factor in this consideration? Let us try and carry it a little further. Assuming, Sir, that it is the intention of the Government to create a White South Africa in which no non-Whites will live &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>That was what you people have said. Assuming that is the intention, to argue then that this system must now be abolished because it has a certain bearing on non-Whites living in the country to-day, is not a very sound one. But assuming that it is not the intention and assuming it will never come to pass, I still think it should be borne in mind that there are 3,500,000 White people in this country who, up to now, at any are, have had a certain faith and a traditional belief in their right to be tried by their peers. Because, Mr. Speaker, while it is true to argue that when a Bantu or Asiatic or Coloured person is tried by a White jury, he is not being tried by his peers, it is not correct to argue like that when a European is before the court, and he has the opportunity of being tried by a Judge and jury. He is then in fact, being tried, as far as he is aware, by his peers. The point I am trying to make, Sir, is that the retention of the system on that basis alone seems to be merited. Those Whites who in the future may elect to be tried by a jury where there is no question of it being the sort of case which was referred to this morning&#x2014;I think, by the hon. member for Durban (North) and which he called Black on White or White on Black&#x2014;but where it is a case concerning Whites only, should not be deprived of the right to be tried by a jury. As for the point of view, Sir, that only the White man is eligible to serve on a jury, regardless of the fact that he may show no enthusiasm to do so to-day the very fact that the system exists is something which I think gives us in South Africa a certain standing in line with well-tried judicial systems of which we have inherited a great deal, a standing which I think will be diminished if it becomes known that South Africa and this Government are taking positive steps to abolish the jury system. I believe that it is for that reason that the jury system should not be abolished at all, in spite of the very good speech made by the hon. member for Klerksdorp.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, <span class="col_1527-1528" refersTo="page_780"/>at the outset I immediately want to express my sincere gratitude, not only to the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) who introduced the debate in a masterly manner, but to every hon. member who has taken part in this debate. I am in particular grateful for the fact that towards the end of the debate a layman has taken part in it and that the debate has not been limited to the legally trained members in this House. I am particularly grateful that the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) as a layman has taken part in the debate. If I personally&#x2014;and I emphasize the word &#x201C;personally&#x201D;&#x2014;required any further arguments to convince myself that it would be a danger to continue with this system, I have certainly been convinced after the hon. member has spoken as a layman.</p>

<p>May I say this at once, Mr. Speaker, so as to avoid any misunderstanding on the subject. Amongst others the hon. member said this&#x2014; I am not holding it against him because that is the kind of statement a layman would make &#x2014;&#x201C;We are about to abolish the jury system&#x201D;. My reply is: &#x201C;We are definitely not about to abolish the jury system&#x201D;. The fact is that the Government has not decided either to retain or abolish the jury system. The fact of the matter is that the Government has not adopted any stand in this connection, for the simple reason that I as the responsible Minister have not as yet asked the Government to take a stand in this connection. And in spite of the strong views which I hold on the matter, to which I shall come back later, it is not my intention either to go to the Government and to put the matter before the Cabinet before, and according to the attitude which I have already stated, I have had an opportunity of consulting all interested bodies in South Africa in this regard. The mere fact, therefore, that I shall not approach the Cabinet before I have consulted the Bar Council and the Bench amongst others, in this connection, speaks volumes in itself. I therefore, want to state this very clearly, so as to avoid any misunderstanding, that we are not in the process of abolishing the jury system and that the Government has, as a matter of fact, not taken any stand either, because I as the responsible Minister have not as yet asked the Government to do so.</p>

<p>I think, Mr. Speaker, that in the first place we should all congratulate the hon. member for Klerksdorp and the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), the mover and the seconder, on the manner in which they have conducted this debate and the high standard that they have set, a standard which has been maintained throughout by hon. members. This is not the first occasion on which the jury system has come up for discussion. It has often been discussed. I also had the opportunity of referring to the debates which were conducted on this subject in the past, both here and in the Other Place, and I want to say that never before has a debate been conducted on such a high level as the debate which we have had here to-day. I want to congratulate hon. members on both sides of the House on that.</p>

<p>I honestly think that the hon. member for Klerksdorp touched the very core and essentials of the subject by pointing out that we ourselves, that is to say, all governments before this Government, right from the start, have been the cause why this system has landed in the position in which it is to-day; we ourselves are the cause because we have removed the very heart from the system. We did not remove it because we wanted to do so deliberately, but we removed it because the circumstances in which we lived, and in which we are still living, are so different from the circumstances which prevailed when this system originally came into operation. Having listened to the resum&#x00E9; of the history of this system, it is clear to me that this system really came into being because it was a method of tempering the despotism of kings and rulers; that was the outlet of the people of the day to revolt against the despotic manner in which justice was administered. If that were not the basis of the system, I would gladly have associated myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and I want to thank him heartily for the attitude which he has adopted in this connection when he quite rightly pointed out the high standard which was being maintained today in South Africa in the administration of justice. If, on the one hand you look at that, and on the other hand, you look at the origin of the system, you wonder whether you should still keep it in operation under present-day circumstances. Having listened to the list of crimes which the hon. member for Klerksdorp read out as having been taken out of the hands of the jury already, thinking of the crimes that are commonly committed, and having made a hurried note of the crimes that are left, I find that the crimes of theft and culpable homicide are the only two that are actually left. Those are about the only two crimes that have escaped and the question is whether you should retain a system for the sake of those two.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But there are more.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you could mention a number of minor crimes, but I think in the main those are the only two that are left. If it is correct&#x2014;and this is something which struck me personally&#x2014;to argue as hon. members have, that the real function of the jury system is to temper the harsh affects of the law, should we retain it for that purpose? That is an argument which was very ably advanced by the hon. member for Durban (North). The way in which he used that argument impressed me. But if that were correct, and if it were sound to have it, the jury system has actually missed its purpose inasmuch as the jury men, if that were their function, should really have been the people to mete out the punishment. In that case they should not have been the people to find guilty <span class="col_1529-1530" refersTo="page_781"/>or not guilty. That should have been the task of the Judge, also according to the argument of the hon. member for Durban (North). But if the function of the jury were what he ascribed to it, the jury members should really come into the picture after the man has been found guilty by these harsh laws, and they should say what should be done with him now that he has been found guilty. If it is true that the jury reflect the morality of the day, opposed to the law which operates slower, my argument is that if that is the case, the jury would have served a better function and played a more important part if the Judge said: &#x201C;Look, people, this person has appeared before me on this charge; I have found him guilty on the evidence brought before me. What should I do with him, considering the present attitude of morality or whatever it may be?&#x201D; If the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is correct, the jury would have had a function to perform, the function of telling the Judge what he should really do with the man.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton has quite rightly referred to the influences which are brought to bear on members of a jury, and how susceptible they are to things which really are not concerned with the case as such. That reminds me of the story of a colleague at the Bar who pleaded a case before a jury. He had one particularly good witness called Mischak Shabalala. He fared less well with his other witnesses. Towards the end of the case, to the surprise of the Judge, he got up and said &#x201C;Milord, I again want to call Mischak Shabalala.&#x201D; The Judge asked: &#x201C;But surely we have heard his evidence, and why do you want to recall him?&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;Milord, I thought he was so good, that it will do the jury good to hear him again.&#x201D; The hon. member conceded that argument when he said that it was practically a maxim at the Bar that &#x201C;if you have a good case, you go to the Judge; if you have a bad case, take the jury.&#x201D; That was the maxim which the hon. member gave us: &#x201C;When innocent take the Judge; when guilty take the jury.&#x201D; The very fact that is so, and that is the position in practice&#x2014;none of us can deny that&#x2014;in my humble opinion, it knocks the bottom out of the entire argument in favour of the retention of the jury system. The hon. member said something else with which I want to associate myself wholeheartily, and I am very grateful to him for having said it. I am particularly pleased that the hon. member warned against a tendency developing in our courts for Judges to sit alone in cases which may call for the death penalty; a Judge should not sit on the Bench without assessors, particularly where a person&#x2019;s life is at stake. I personally cannot reconcile myself to that at all and if I should find in the least&#x2014;I do not like using the word &#x201C;abuse&#x201D; in relation to the Bench, let me rather put it this way: If I should find that Judges are inclined to make a habit of sitting alone instead of taking assessors with them on the Bench, I shall not have the slightest hesitation in coming to this House in order to amend the relevant section, because I do not think that any person, no matter how capable, how experienced and how learned he may be, any one person should not take the responsibility upon himself to judge on the life or death of a person, if he can get other people to sit with them and to carry the responsibility with him. I am pleased that the hon. member raised that argument.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member followed the speech of the hon. member for Klerksdorp properly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) said that the hon. member for Klerksdorp had said that &#x201C;we must break down this system.&#x201D; I do not think that was really the argument of the hon. member for Klerksdorp. I think the argument of the member for Klerksdorp, as I understood it, was more or less this that the jury system had itself broken down to such an extent that at this stage it served no further useful purpose. As I understood the argument of the member for Klerksdorp when he went from one amendment to the other and when he showed us how the system had in fact been watered down from time to time, I think that his argument rather boils down to that.</p>

<p>*For the rest I should like to pay this compliment to the hon. member by saying that I think what he said in connection with the jury system was the best defence of a weak case that I have heard for a long time. I give him that in consolation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) referred in passing to the time that was unnecessarily spent, and the unnecessary costs that flow from it. I think it is a good thing that the hon. member raised that. I want to say at once that when it comes to the question of the administration of justice, you do not consider costs. If you can administer justice better by spending more money, you not only have the right to do so but it is certainly your duty to do so. We should, however, not only look at the R8,000 that was paid out in the form of jury fees, we should also consider the waste of time that accompanied that. If I were to tell you, for example, Sir, that it has already happened here in Cape Town during a criminal session, that in order to get 18 people to serve as jury members, 100 or more people have had to be summonsed, you would realize what a tremendous amount of money is wasted in respect of deputy sheriff fees and the time that is unnecessarily wasted in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) asked whether the Judges were in favour of abolishing the jury system. Frankly I do not know for the simple reason that I have not asked them. I have not consulted them yet. Perhaps they will be consulted in the future about this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) also raised the point and he asked me whether Judges had complained, and how many, about <span class="col_1531-1532" refersTo="page_782"/>the system. Unfortunately I cannot say how many Judges have complained against this system, but the hon. member is aware that Judges have, particularly recently, from time to time commented upon the system and upon the fact that justice was not served by the decisions taken by some juries.</p>

<p>At 3.55 p.m. the business under consideration was interrupted by Mr Speaker in accordance with Standing Order No. 41 (3) and the debate was adjourned until Friday 9 March.</p>

<p>The House proceeded to the consideration of Orders of the Day.</p>
