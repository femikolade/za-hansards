<p>This motion covers a wide field and in moving that this urgent investigation should be undertaken, I say without fear of contradiction that the conservation, division and use of our land constitutes the only guarantee of our existence. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, this House must realize that all laws and all debates, every important statement which has been made and will be made in future, are secondary to this one consideration that our people or the nation or the population groups must have space within which to live in South Africa. In other words, the soil, the surface area of our only home, the Republic of South Africa, must not only feed, house and supply all raw materials, indeed life itself, for this generation, but also for the generations to come. Mr. Speaker, it does not matter how many millions are spent on Bantu development or on the implementation of our separate parallel development or on community development or on housing, pensions or building of railways, etc.&#x2014;it does not matter how much we spend, if we do not look after the soil of the Republic properly. You do not divide and use it properly without practising exploitational farming, and if we do not see to it at an early stage that our land is not cut up and torn to shreds, then all these other things amount to seeking the unattainable. The first instruction given to mankind by the Creator we find in Genesis 2. It came even before the Ten Commandments. It was one of the most important injunctions ever issued, that we must live on the land and protect it; we must look after it, we must till the soil and husband it. In this sense &#x201C;husband&#x201D; means that we must look after it and protect it&#x2014;this soil which gives life to mankind. Mr. Speaker, all visible things, gold, silver, everything you see here, the Speaker&#x2019;s chair, the benches, the briefcases, the books, the mace, even you, Mr. Speaker, man himself, spring from the earth, from the soil, and we cannot increase this soil. Unfortunately this soil is frequently trampled on, burnt, robbed and neglected by man. I trust, Mr. Speaker, the result of this motion will be that the Republic of South Africa and the present generation will not be accused by the unborn generations of having cut up the land, of having left them with an inhospitable soil and of having stolen their living space. If one looks at man himself the first man was Adam, a name which means: Till the land, look after it, husband it. In other words, the earth, the soil, offers living space, offers life to man himself. When we look back into history we find that all wars of the past&#x2014;we can even include those of the future&#x2014;were fought, however much the purpose was camouflaged, over the ownership, over the political dominion, over the right of occupation, over the means of production and the right to exploit the land. The land gives life to man and to nations. It is what man yearns for. In other words, this motion deals with life itself.</p>

<p>Let us now analyse how the Department of Agriculture in America defines land in their investigation into the injudicious cutting up of land. We find the following in their Year Book <i>Land&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Land in the economic sense is our entire natural environment, all the forces, all the opportunities that exist, independently of man&#x2019;s activity.</block>

<p>In other words, we use all our energy to exploit the land and to extract from it food, a roof over our heads, clothes, furniture, telephones, motor-cars, washing machines, soap, newspapers, radios, books, in short everything which makes life worthwhile, comes from the land. I find that when Israel investigated the question of economic units, they made the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Agriculture is the foundation of the country&#x2019;s economic structure.</block>

<p>That does not apply to Israel only; it applies to the whole world. It does not matter what man does or plans, if one cannot feed a nation it dies; and a nation cannot be fed if the land is not looked after properly. Materially, this generation can leave tools, factories, railways, roads, buildings, dams, wire, fencing, livestock, etc. to the generations to come. These generations can have energy, the ability to work, vision, the will to plan, to plant and to work, but the decisive factor was and will always be the land, that which provides fertility, the precious and base metals, iron, coal, fuel, food, etc. What do we find, Mr. Speaker? In the report of the study group on agricultural credit we find that it is stated clearly in paragraph 23&#x2014;</p>

<p>The most important capital asset in agriculture is land, and in financing it, regard must be had to the fact that the purchase price of land is often influenced by subjective considerations such as love of the land, family sentiment, etc. Apart from this, land is an investment and a means of speculation, since it has a permanent value, because with proper treatment it is indestructible and is basic to the survival of man.</p>

<p>I wish to emphasize that land has a permanent value. But that is subject to one condition and that condition is proper treatment, proper use. One cannot just let it lie exposed to the <span class="col_513-514" refersTo="page_273"/>elements, or cut it up or let it be trampled upon. If we look back into history, we see that in the Crusades, the crusaders used Malta as a feeding station where they kept goats and cattle in order to obtain meat on the way to Israel. They so ravaged the island that only a bare piece of rock remained. The island died and the land could not give life to man. Later on they carted soil in baskets and in boats to put on the rock so that they could have some soil in which to plant. We cannot ravage the land in this way. That is the condition.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, how much land have we, the only guarantee of our survival in South Africa? Our surface area is 473,000 square miles, i.e. 143,000,000 morgen. But we must bear in mind that only 10 per cent of this surface area, if we include irrigation, can be ploughed and is suitable for cultivation. It will apparently never be more than 15 per cent. The reason for this is to be seen when we look at the lovely mountains, at the rocks, at the mountain ranges, the desert regions and at the climatic conditions such as droughts and so forth. I think we can safely estimate that only 20 per cent of the remaining 85 per cent is pasture. In other words, our highest potential for agricultural development is only 22 per cent of 143,000,000 morgen, or 45,670,000 morgen. That is all there is. We must realize that in most areas the grazing potential is also dependent on agriculture as a result of winter and other circumstances. In my area, for example, we find that farmers who do not have sufficient land for agriculture have to trek great distances with their cattle&#x2014;70, 100 to 150 miles. Every year as winter approaches, we see cattle on the way to the Lowveld. The grazing and agricultural land, or the Highveld area, is to a large extent dependent on the agricultural potential. Mr. Speaker, this House must also realize that all our Bantu areas are included in this surface area. We must note the fact that the Bantu areas are the farming areas with the highest farming potential in the Republic. They are mostly in the eastern regions; they are frost free, they have the best rainfall. They are in the tropical and sub-tropical regions and we are conserving them and looking after them for those people as well and doing all the planning, etc. It also fits in with our policy of separate development because we must also provide living space for them for the future. In other words, if these Bantu areas together with those parts which still have to be bought in terms of the 1936 Act, are subtracted from the 45,000,000 morgen which we have, we find that the rest is divided, according to the census statistics, into 112,000 farms or farming units. These 112,000 farming units must be farmed in such a way that at the moment we can feed 3,000,000 Whites, the 2,000,000 non-Whites still living on the White farms and the 5,000,000 non-Whites who are still in our White areas. In other words, at the moment we must feed 10,500,000 million people. But that is not all. From time to time we have to send food to the Protectorates and the Bantu areas to meet the needs of those people who cannot produce so efficiently so that they can also live. Then we also have to produce out of our land so that foreign exchange can be earned for the Republic. Let us see what is already been earned by means of agricultural production. We find that in 1960 we exported agricultural produce to the value of R232,520,024, which is foreign exchange earned for South Africa. If we look at the gross value of our agricultural production, we find that in 1957-8 it was R723,388,000. In 1959 it was R729,990,000. In 1959-60 it was R766,264,000. We find an ever-increasing tendency in the gross value of our agricultural production which comes from the earth. By 1995 this land which we must guard without being able to increase it, will have to feed and provide living space for 29,800,000 people just in the Republic of South Africa and will have to provide all the raw materials for these people to live. At the moment it is providing for only about 14,000,000 people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in order, therefore, to see this motion in its right perspective, this House will have to take note firstly of the economic unit of our agricultural land in the light of the agro-economic production potential. This is the first item which will have to be analysed. Secondly, we shall have to take note of the prices of products and production costs compared with those prices. We shall have to take note of mechanization, labour potential and labour capacity. We shall have to take note of all these factors, and what is the distressing tendency? When one looks at this, when one takes note of all these details, one finds, if one analyses the price index of farming implements&#x2014;and I take the figure for 1938 as 100&#x2014;that the index price of tractors has risen to 269, of lorries to 406, farming implements to 303, spares to 313, fertilizers 62, fuel 206, fencing material 302. There has been a tremendous increase in production costs in South Africa. But what is the price index relating to farming products? If we take mealies at 100 in 1938, then the price index in 1959-60 was 307, wheat 284, kaffir corn 261, dried beans 408, potatoes 281. There is also a rising tendency, but if we take an average, we find that the rise in produce prices has not kept pace with the rise in production costs. Production costs are rising faster than produce prices. It is so bad that the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services found it necessary the other day at the show a Worcester to issue a warning that this was the problem facing us and that the farmer would have to plan. This brings us back to the idea that he will have to plan in such a way that the land is not ruthlessly exploited and this at once brings the land unit into the picture. Notwithstanding this we must also take note of the fact that in the last few years there has been an unparalleled increase in production. I must analyse this unparalleled increase in South Africa, because later on we shall have to ascertain how it has affected the farming <span class="col_515-516" refersTo="page_274"/>unit financially. I wish to deal with the position from 1947-8 to 1960. We find that there was an increase in wool production from 196,500,000 lbs. to 279.1 million lbs.; in respect of beef from 646,000,000 lbs. to 677,000,000 lbs.; mutton from 226,000,000 lbs. to 297,000,000 lbs. The production of butter has increased tremendously, to such an extent that we have a problem on our hands, as a result also of the effect of small-holdings in this connection. It has increased from 59,000,000 lbs. to 108,000,000 lbs. The production of cheese has increased from 20.3 million lbs. to 32.6 million lbs. The production of condensed milk has increased from 32,000,000 to 78.3 million. In the case of mealies the production has increased from 32.1 million bags to 41,000,000 bags, etc., etc. I wish to put it in this way, Mr. Speaker, that these increases are most certainly due to better instruction, better agricultural technical services, better opportunities which have been created and offered by this Government. But in part it is also due to the fact that it is necessary for the farmer to produce more if he does not want to go under. This creates the unfortunate anomaly that as we produce more, our agricultural problems will become more difficult in the future. When we consider the economic units, we must also take note of the comparative standard of living and the economic structure or the right to a living of the farmer in relation to the rest of the economy of the country. How is the economic unit measured in America? It is fixed as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Consider an acre of wheatlands that yields 30 bushels. Those 30 bushels measure the total physical productivity of all the resources used in producing wheat on that acre.</block>

<p>But now it introduces the economic factor and it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to get the idea of economic productivity, however, we must make use of an economic measure, the price the wheat will bring when it is sold.</block>

<p>It is said that the economic factor has to be considered. It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before we can measure the contribution of land to its total, we must make allowance for the cost of labour, gasoline, fertilizer, wear and tear of machinery, and so on. If these other costs amount to 55 dollars an acre, the economic productivity of the acre is 5 dollars and not as originally visualized, 60 dollars. That is quite different from the 30 bushels we started with, but it is a more useful figure.</block>

<p>It goes on to show that the economic factor must be considered in determining economic units of land. In their 1960 Year Book the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus changes in prices of crops usually have a more direct and immediate effect on the price of land than do changes in the price of livestock or livestock products.</block>

<p>This shows that a change in the prices of agricultural products has a much greater effect on the price of agricultural land than the price of animal products. I mention this because in a moment I want to show how in some cases we have neglected and cut up our agricultural land. We find that Roosevelt considered an investigation necessary and we find a warning which I want to borrow from this Year Book. It starts with these beautiful words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Land where my fathers lie <br/>Land of the pilgrims&#x2019; pride <br/>Of thee I sing.</block>

<p>That is followed by this distressing statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So the fathers conquered a continent and learned much about land and themselves. And the sons? The sons, for big profits and heedless of sons to come, cut over and let burn many forests.</block>

<p>Then it warns against the cutting up of land and it ends as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Still denuded water-sheds, choked reservoirs led to floods and waste water, which was becoming more and more precious. People poughed land that should be grassland, and that is how dust-storms started.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, will this charge also be levelled against these sons of South Africa, that we wrongly cut up this land which was acquired for us by our forefathers, that we acted wrongly and ploughed where we never should have ploughed because of uneconomic units, because lovely cattle country is being sold in small units, and people are planting groundnuts in the Bushveld where groundnuts should never be planted? Must this accusation also be made against us? What has the American expert Lowdermilk to say about this? He says that he knows of no better way to impoverish a nation than to divide its land into small pieces and he cites China as an example. I wish to ask pertinently whether the time has not arrived when we should create a central board for surface planning, a central board to co-ordinate the activities of the Department of Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Technical Services, Lands, the Land Bank, the Council for the Development of Natural Resources, Town Planning, Bantu Resettlement, Water, as well as of the bodies which provide recreational facilities (so that one can know where to relax)? In other words, every body which has anything to do with the occupation or the cultivation of our land should be gathered together to serve on this Board. Why must our land, this precious property of a nation, be cut up by injudicious road deviations, often only of a temporary nature? Often a vlei belonging to a farmer is cut off or the road goes right through it and destroys it whilst if the road was made with a slight <span class="col_517-518" refersTo="page_275"/>curve this would not happen. Why must a road be made as straight as a ruler when in so doing most valuable land is cut up and wasted?</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Why must we allow profit-seeking agents to sell small-holdings and to exploit the land-hunger of our people? If you look at all the instances which I propose to mention in a moment, you will see what a tremendous sin is being perpetrated against South Africa. I wish to pose a third question: Why do we allow the subdivision and misuse of agricultural land by means of injudicious town-planning? The same thing, the same phenomenon was found in America&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The objective of private selection of public land was the blocking out of economic units for private use. For years no thought was given to the retention of economic sizes and shapes of units for public management. In many areas, therefore, public management is complicated by a crazy quilt pattern of several State, railroad and private ownerships.</block>

<p>There was also no proper planning in this connection in the beginning. One saw only a higgledy-piggledy pattern. I have already quoted the example of Malta. I now wish to mention a few examples in South Africa also. First of all I wish to mention the Native township Tembisa between Jan Smuts Airport and Pretoria. The soil there is deep, most fertile and most productive. It is known as Delmas red Adam&#x2019;s soil. I do not believe that in the whole area there is land which can produce better potatoes and mealies and a greater quantity per morgen. After all, there is a lot of stony ground within the Witwatersrand complex which is unproductive and on which such towns could be laid out without cutting up fertile land which can never again become productive.</p>

<p>All Governments in the past have sinned because we do not have a national planning scheme in South Africa and, because of this, I feel the time has arrived to call a halt in this connection. I mentioned the small-holdings. Around Bloemfontein there are small-holdings which exploit the underground water. Do you realize what it will mean to the farmer and to his livestock if the underground water dries up? What will happen to the Republic of South Africa if we do not call a halt to this system of small-holdings under which all these boreholes are sunk and the underground water is taken away? If one goes from Pretoria to Bronkhorstspruit and further north, one finds a whole series of small-holdings which were sold by agents to make profits. A large number of our officials, driven by land hunger and a longing to return to the land, spent their savings, and what happened? They started building and in some cases they had only reached window height when their money was used up and they had to give it all back to the agent. The next buyer builds up to the roofheight; then his money is finished and he has to give it back to the agent. Some of these small-holdings are sold three or more times. Warnings have already been given in this House. I wish to refer to the speech of the hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) on 22 September 1958, in which he gave a warning and said that people were attracted back to the platteland by unscrupulous people who sell their land as speculators. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a phenomenon which is now manifesting itself and that is the uneconomic subdivision of our land which in turn has the effect that these people become an economic burden on an ever-increasing scale.</block>

<p>This phenomenon is still going on and is becoming worse; it will always go on unless we place the subdivision of land under the national control of an agro-economic planning board. I have already referred to the position in America. During the 1933 depression in America we found a phenomenon opposite to that in South Africa. In America the people fled from the cities back to the country. They believed that each man should produce his daily food for himself, a little bit of milk and vegetables and a little bit of this and that, otherwise they would die. In South Africa one saw the opposite, namely, that people flocked to the cities in large numbers during the depression. This phenomenon made it necessary for Roosevelt to investigate &#x201C;submarginal farming units&#x201D;. He ordered that all necessary steps be taken to see that the land remained in economic units and, where the land was already subdivided, that it be re-consolidated. This was done on the basis of agro-economic details. I hope the day will come when this will also happen in South Africa. This resulted in their starting a new scheme under which the agro-economic potentialities of every piece of land had to be recorded from time to time on the title deeds so that a purchaser could see what the productivity of the land was and so that the State authorities which subsidized purchasers could know at once that if the land was cut up its production potentialities would be interfered with and that accordingly it must not be done.</p>

<p>The same thing happened in England. When England became worried about its food production, it started planning. To-day it costs millions in Europe to buy up small pieces of land and to consolidate them. Let us see what is said in England. In the interesting book by Wibberley, &#x201C;Agriculture and Urban Growth&#x201D;, he makes the following statement, which, as I have said, comes back to what was done in America&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Each year the area under crops, grass and rough grazings in England and Wales is compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries <span class="col_519-520" refersTo="page_276"/>and Food from returns made by farmers. This involves the analysis in England and Wales of approximately 380,000 separate returns filled in by individual occupiers of agricultural holdings of more than one acre in extent. The summarized results are published annually in the agricultural statistics. Information which is broadly similar in character is obtained for Scotland from returns collected by the Department of Agriculture in Edinburgh. The return made by individual farmers each June is made up of 90 headings for individual crops and grass, bare fallow, vegetables and flowers and fruit. Areas, which include field hedges, ditches and headlands, are recorded to the nearest quarter of an acre. Holders of land are required to record all land used for growing food or feed for livestock (including grazing land) as well as flowers and nursery stock for sale&#x201D;.</block>

<p>They use this information, which is registered together with the title deeds of the land, to show its production potentialities and so to prevent the land from being cut up injudiciously. In other words, they obtain the data relating to economic units and then they plan them. They have already produced their planning scheme, their Town and County Planning Act of 1947. So we find that Israel, a small country, are studying the same question and are also collecting information. They do this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Administration&#x2019;s scepticism as to those potentialities brought out by the Royal Commission of 1937 was a challenge to Jewish leadership to stir on preparations for an all-embracing plan of development.</block>

<p>In their developmental plan they first take the economic units into consideration&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Administrative control over the utilization of water is exercised by the water authorities, a branch of the Ministry of Agriculture with a staff of 200 in four divisions.</block>

<p>Then it goes on, and this is the important part&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The planning, design and the supervision of major enterprises and drainage works, including research, as have previously been mentioned, rest with Tahal. The Government holds 52 per cent of its shares. The Jewish Agency and the Jewish National Fund each taking 24 &#x2026; and it is split into four departments.</block>

<p>In other words, they considered it necessary to place their economic unit planning scheme under a utility company in which the Government holds 52 per cent of the shares, so as to ensure that the soil of Israel, which is a small country, will remain productive in the years to come and will continue to feed the people.</p>

<p>So the whole world was cut up, or divided into uneconomic units, or came into the hands of non-occupying concerns and remained unproductive, or combined into areas too great a size. The problem actually became so big that the United Nations circulated a questionnaire to all countries and I want to quote a few questions from this questionnaire. The first question was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Have measures been taken since 1952 to promote the organization of farms of economic size, whether by dividing two large holdings or by combining two small-holdings? If so, describe these measures</block>

<p>Let us see what the countries replied. I want to mention a few of them. We find that in Europe since 20 December 1954, they have passed legislation that amends the 1941 legislation and they have created bodies to effect this consolidation. We find for example that Iceland said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reply from Iceland refers to legislation prohibiting unlimited subdivision of holdings. Reference was made in Chapter 1 to the Udal Land Tenure Act of 1941, permitting any land-holder to make his farm an hereditary freehold which cannot be sold. The Act makes detailed provisions as to the designation of a single heir of a farm in the absence of testamentary designation &#x2026; Legislation pertaining to consolidation of fragmented holdings has a long history in the Netherlands, and the rapid progress of consolidation in recent years led to the enactment of a new law in 1954, supplementary to the Land Consolidation Act of 1938.</block>

<p>That shows that in Europe and in Holland the people are busy consolidating on a larger scale and to consolidate their uneconomic units&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reply of Western Germany refers to the Land Consolidation Act of 1955. amending previous legislation. Under this law large properties can be sub-divided and small properties consolidated to effect a more economic management.</block>

<p>Everybody is concerned about the same thing, economic units neither too big nor too small. Switzerland, one of the countries which sets an example as far as agriculture is concerned, says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Switzerland reports on the progress being made in land consolidation. Exclusive of voluntary schemes, during 1952-54 some 4.900 hectares have been re-allocated at a cost of 8.6 million francs, of which some 6.2 million were contributed by the Federal and Canton Governments.</block>

<p>That is what is being done in this connection. Some countries are still busy with it to-day. I want to mention a few others without taking up the time of the House. I find that each of those countries who has replied has already started planning in order to consolidate uneconomic units and to prevent their coming into existence in future. When we go into the <span class="col_521-522" refersTo="page_277"/>question of the uneconomic units in the Republic of South Africa, we find that there are two enlightening reports from which I could quote extensively, as well as those other hon. members who will take part in this debate. We have the report of the Commission of Inquiry on European occupancy of the rural areas and we have the report of the Study Group for Inquiry into Agricultural Credit. Time does not permit me to quote extensively from these two reports. I merely want to mention a few things. What is regarded in South Africa as an economic unit? I find from the report of the Study Group for Inquiry into Agricultural Credit that the following is regarded as an economic unit: it is a unit where all factors of production are exploited to the utmost, in other words, where the marginal costs of all factors of production are equal to their marginal yield, and then they say that in practice such a unit is seldom encountered and that most farming enterprises fall far short of this ideal. This is actually a theoretical concept of the optimum farming unit, but then we have this important passage &#x201C;without harming the permanent productivity of the soil&#x201D;. In other words, the planning of a farming enterprise should be such that you do not harm the permanent productivity of the soil. I find the following on page 2&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Rational planning of every farming enterprise is essential. If the farmer does not have the knowledge and competency to do this himself, he should enlist the necessary assistance and guidance from elsewhere.</block>

<p>In other words, when they talk about an economic unit in this report, they couple to it the production potential of the farmer, the knowledge of the farmer, and the fact that he should perhaps receive the necessary guidance. Because this economic unit is a relative concept, planning, availability of labour, mechanization, the capital available, the farmer&#x2019;s own managerial ability, etc., constitute a real factor, as is stated in the report. In passing, this report recommends very strongly that there should be a Department of Agricultural Finance. I hope that the Government is considering this already and that it will shortly be established, because such a department will also be able to some extent to prevent the further sub-division of land into uneconomic units. It could also serve on a part-time basis on any central board of land planning that may be established.</p>

<p>In the report of the Commission of Inquiry into European Occupancy of the Rural Areas, we find that where they talk about economic units, we again have this very important factor, namely that we dare not lose sight of the financial aspect. They say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An accurate analysis, however, clearly shows that for 1954 a larger percentage of the area falls in the smaller groups, namely those of less than 100 and from 101 to 500 morgen, than was the case in 1927, and also that the largest farms of 5,001 morgen and more cover a larger portion of the area. The size groups between 501 and 5,000 morgen lost some of their area.</block>

<p>In other words, he warns that there are two features as far as uneconomic units are concerned; they are either too small or too big where you cannot have optimum production. He gives a table on page 23 of the bigger groups and comes to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the data of Tables 24 and 25 are considered jointly, interesting facts emerge. There is definitely an increase in the number of smaller farmers and the land owned by them. In 1927, for instance, 52.5 per cent of the cases occupied 500 morgen or less, and they presented 9.3 per cent of land in White areas. This group rose to 62.2 per cent, in 1954, and they represented 11.2 per cent of that land. These figures undoubtedly point to an increase in the number of small farms.</block>

<p>He then issues a warning and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In many cases, farms have become so small that a number of farmers will be forced off their land in certain areas. Should their farms become the property of other small farmers, resulting in a consolidation of uneconomic units, it would be a sound development; but usually the farmer who is financially strong and who already owns one or more economic units, buys these small farms. Unless a method is found by which small farmers could be assisted in extending their uneconomic farms, and by which large landowners would be discouraged from acquiring still more land, there can be no doubt whatsoever that further depopulation would follow, particularly in certain areas.</block>

<p>What I want to point out clearly is this, Sir. That commission warned us that the depopulation of the platteland was due to two factors. Firstly, that land has been cut up into units that are too small and secondly land that has been consolidated into units that are too big and that cannot be utilized productively.</p>

<p>We already have an agro-economic map of the Republic of South Africa, but that is simply the framework within which we shall have to continue to make analyses and plan. I want to mention something interesting. It is very difficult to get hold of this map. Here I have seven of his books and I am afraid there are many Government departments that are daily sub-dividing farms in South Africa and purchasing land for Lands and for other reasons, who do not even know of the existence of such a map; that there are officials and boards doing this work and who completely ignore it or who do not even know of its existence, whereas it cost a great deal to prepare. This map, which is at least the framework as to where agriculture, stock farming and mixed farming should be practised, <span class="col_523-524" refersTo="page_278"/>is not always followed. How many of the members of the Land Board themselves make use of that data when they assist in the subdivision of farms? How many of them know about it? When it comes to the planning of economic units we shall have to make the necessary surveys from farm to farm and have the details registered with the deeds of transfer and diagrams. I want to illustrate this. I have made an analysis of two pieces of land in the south-eastern Transvaal in respect of their agro-economic production potential as against the marketing possibilities, price structure, transport facilities etc. The one I want to deal with is 220 morgen. According to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the extension officers the unit that land can carry is 45 head of cattle and 330 sheep, otherwise you will be over-stocking it. What is recommended is roughly two parts grazing land and one part agricultural land. Let us analyse the position. Of the 45 cattle you may have 17 cows for the production of milk; eight may be heifer calves over one year; eight may be over two years; four that are not in milk and then your bull. What is your gross revenue from those cattle with an average yield of 7,500 lb. per cow&#x2014;then they have to be very good cows&#x2014;with a butterfat yield of approximately 4 per cent. At 35c per lb. you will receive R1,785 for your total milk production and if you sell eight cattle annually&#x2014;that is calves, etc.&#x2014;you will receive R240. From your cattle alone you will have a total income of R2,025. Of your 330 sheep&#x2014;and here I want the sheep farmers to tell me whether my calculation is wrong&#x2014;100 will be ewes&#x2014;I am now talking about mixed farming&#x2014;150 will be mixed and 80 lambs. You have to allow 7 per cent for losses&#x2014;the 23 that die and the 24 that you kill for domestic use. You can then sell 33 per year at R198. Your gross receipts from wool at present-day prices will be R990. In other words, your income from the sheep will be R1,188, that is, a gross income of R3,230. That is the maximum. I now want to analyse what you can make on a third of those 220 morgen, that is plusminus 80 morgen; what you can make on it if you place one-fifth of it under ley-cropping, one-fifth under legumes, and the remaining three-fifths is divided between cash cropping, crops for harvesting and for fodder. Then you will have 16 morgen under ley cropping, 16 morgen under legumes, 16 morgen fodder, and 32 morgen cash crops, namely mealies. You will not get more than R1,070 for your cash crops. In other words, this farm of 220 morgen, will yield a maximum gross income of R4,383. However, let us analyse what the costs are. If you feed 4 lb. of concentrate to each of your cows every day and you take into account your medicine, licks, your domestic consumption of butter, transport costs of cream, etc. you have to deduct R648 from the income you derive from your cattle. Then you have the costs connected with your sheep such as shearing costs, woolpacks, medicine, licks, purchase of rams, transport costs etc. which run into R234. In addition to that you have your expenditure on your lands; fuel R130, fertilizer R242; seed, maize and oats and legumes R248. Altogether your expenses amount to R1,534. Over and above that you have heavy diverse expenses. Farm labour R600; cropping, harvesting, feed storage, hoeing and other casual labour, R100; bags, harvesting money, threshing, etc. R195. Allow an entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage for that farmer of R1,500 per annum and R521 interest on the farm and livestock; R994 in respect of repairs and depreciation of implements, etc; and you find that your expenses already amount to R3,910 and that your total expenses in connection with this farm which gives you a gross income of R4,338, are R5,444.</p>

<p>I have based this analysis on the strength of practical experience as far as farming is concerned. In other words, these 220 morgen, as far as its agro-economic production potential is concerned, is an uneconomic unit in the Highveld of the south-eastern Transvaal. To illustrate my case I want to take the same piece of land and increase it to 400 morgen. According to the extension officer that farm can carry 82 head of cattle and 600 sheep. The ratio is again two parts grazing veld and one part agriculture. Your 82 head of cattle will give you an annual gross income of R3,705. Your 600 sheep will give you an annual gross income of R2,088. That is the maximum and then your total gross income will be R8,067 and your expenditure in connection with your cattle will be R1,161: your expenditure in connection with your sheep will be R441 and your expenditure in connection with your lands will be R1,182&#x2014;classified exactly as in the case of the 220 morgen&#x2014;and your diverse expenditure, such as labour etc. runs into a further R4,631. Then you have a total expenditure of R7,415 and your gross income is R8,067. In other words, you can make a profit of R652 from this piece of land. Then you have only covered your interest on capital. If you had bought the farm and you must still provide the capital yourself, you will find yourself in a very precarious position.</p>

<p>I have made this analysis in an endeavour to show that when you talk about bigger economic units, you can only do so in the light of the agro-economic production potential of that unit, coupled with the availability of labour, the price structure, and on the other hand the price of products and if you do not do that, you will have no norm to apply. I hope I have proved that there is a yardstick that can be applied. The conclusion I come to is this: Although your profit on 400 morgen is not big, those 400 morgen at least form an economic unit but it is clear that in that area 220 morgen do not form an economic unit on which you can make a living and that you cannot go on like that.</p>

<p>Now I should like to analyse our agro-economic production potential in relation to the price structure of the Maize Board. They show very clearly that this varies in different <span class="col_525-526" refersTo="page_279"/>parts of the country. They have calculated that the production costs in the case of maize amount to R2.41 per bag in the Transvaal Highveld. Your yield there is 10.70 bags per morgen. When you go to the north-western Free State you find that your production costs are less as a result of the fact that you have less trouble with weeds and other circumstances. There your production costs are R1.92 per bag, namely 19s. 1&#x00BD;d. But when you go to the western Transvaal your production costs are even less; there they are R1.64, again because you have less trouble with weeds and because you have a better yield, namely 13.79 bags per morgen. In other words, that agro-economic unit indicates the production potential per morgen, and you must take that into account. Mr. Speaker, let me put it this way: from an investigation conducted in 1949 by the Development of Natural Resources Board, it appeared that in five districts in the central Free State where they go in for stock breeding and agriculture, 40 per cent of the farming units, that is to say 10 per cent of that area, were already under 200 morgen and that did not include smallholding schemes or land situated within urban areas. It was also determined that the smallholdings in the Witwatersrand complex, particularly along the Western Reef, which were undeveloped and consequently unproductive comprised thousands of morgen of agricultural land. The point I wish to make here is this: The greatest number of applications for assistance to the State Advances Recoveries Office come from this area in the Free State; that is the area where the greatest number of farmers get into difficulties, and those are the farmers who all have less than 200 morgen of land. Those units of 200 morgen have become uneconomic as far as they are concerned. You have to consider this all-important factor, Sir, that the farming implements of a farmer are to a great extent unproductive for eleven months out of the twelve. That is frozen capital. Let me give a few examples: a farmer uses a combine, for instance, only for one month or fourteen days; he uses a silo-fodder cutting machine for 20 days, and so I can go on. However, those are expensive implements that lie there&#x2014;frozen capital. All these factors, as far as the production costs of the farmer are concerned, costs which are probably not always calculated correctly, place the farmer in a very unenviable position. In order to appreciate the scope of this problem fully we should not forget the contribution which the farmer makes to the net national income of the Republic of South Africa. This was R90,200,000 in 1939; in 1959 it was R472,600,000. The percentage has remained constant over the years, namely 12 per cent. In other words, farming has kept pace with the national economy. However, I think we should be honest with ourselves, we should face up to the position squarely, and admit that everything is not rosy in the garden as far as our agriculture is concerned, and that in spite of everything that this Government has already had to do. But there were reasons for that. It may be due to the fact that we inherited a great backlog in the agricultural field; it may be due to the fact that with the sub-division of farms there was never any planning with the result that we have farms to-day that are too small, that have been cut up into fragments. Because this essential specialized planning was not done, because this sub-division was not carried out properly beforehand, the Government has already assisted the farmers <i>inter alia</i> as follows&#x2014;and it is necessary that we note this because it accentuates the problem. From 1948 to 1961 the Land Bank granted loans to farmers alone to the tune of R194,926,000; and if you add the seasonal loans of co-operative societies and instalment loans, the Land Bank advanced R2,880,000,000 to the farmers during that period. It says a great deal for the farmers that the Land Bank has advanced them R327,000,000 since 1912 and that up to date the Land Bank has not suffered a penny loss. That indicates the honesty of the farmer in South Africa.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the farmers find themselves in very great difficulties at times the Land Bank has not as yet suffered a penny loss. I now want to deal with the position as it is to-day. During this period the Department of Water Affairs has assisted the farmers to the tune of R1,587,389 in respect of drilling and irrigation works. Since 1956-7 to 1960-1 the Department of Lands has advanced R1,073,619 under Section 53 and an amount of R485,855 under Section 42, and under Section 20 an amount of R8,538,736 has been advanced to the farmers from 1956-7 up to 1960-1, and all those loans have to be repaid. Over the same period we have allocated holdings under Section 23 the purchase price of which amounted to R2,650,180. Likewise under the Department of Soil Conservation loans have been granted to farmers over the same period to the tune of R5,262,108. We have given them seed and fertilizer loans amounting to over R11,000,000 during this period. Since 1958 we have granted stockfeed loans to the tune of over R2,800,000. In other words, since 1956-7 to 1960-1 we have advanced an amount of R320,901,774 in the form of loans alone to the farmers of South Africa in this connection. But these amounts are economically sound; these loans have to be repaid. Why should the farmer of South Africa always be presented to the outside world as a person who continually goes about hat in hand? Why was it necessary for us over the same period to which I have referred to pay the following subsidies: in respect of fertilizer R8,853,110; we had to pay railage rebates on fertilizer to the tune of R14,000,000. Over this period we had to pay an amount of R1,221,000 in the form of subsidies for the conveyance of stock from drought-stricken areas. We had to obtain rebates to the tune of R400,804 from the Railways. We had to obtain rebates from the Railways for the conveyance of stock-feed to drought-stricken districts, firstly, under the Department of Agriculture, R299,707, Railways R599,406. So we continually had to give subsidies <span class="col_527-528" refersTo="page_280"/>to the farmer; soil conservation works R3,354,000 and R1,019,000 for the eradication of noxious weeds; for the combating of pests and plagues, R715,000. In other words, if we take the Departments of Water Affairs and Railways together, we had to give subsidies to the farmers of South Africa, over this same period, to the tune of R41,193,536. Mr. Speaker, that is a great deal of money. People often say that this Government spends too much on the Bantu homelands; on Bantu development, but do we ever take into account these amounts that we spend on agriculture in order to keep the farmer on the farm and to enable him to farm properly and to produce food for South Africa? In this connection I do not want to compare the United Party with the National Party as far as expenditure on agriculture is concerned. I do not want to compare them because the position that obtained under United Party regime is probably not comparable with that of the National Party. For the purposes of this motion, however, I want to ask all parties to regard this as a national task not to make a political football of our agricultural economy, of our land, of our soil, our most precious possession, but that we should analyse the position together and see what can be done to keep the farmer of South Africa soundly established on economic units for all time. I want to ask this question: Will we not repeatedly be obliged to continue to render these services, to give these subsidies and big loans? I am afraid we shall have to do so unless we introduce a proper system of land planning and unless we divide our land into economic units on the basis of such planning, eliminate all the uneconomic units and see to it that we consolidate them on a national basis.</p>

<p>Let me analyse the position in this respect a little further. I find that the following services were necessary: The appointment of a study group to go into all aspects of agricultural credit: a temporary change in policy in the application of the Farmers Assistance Act; the changing of the Land Bank Act, amongst others, to grant loans up to 80 per cent: valuations for hypothecation loans to purchase livestock and implements; emergency loans for the purchase of seed, fertilizer and fuel; emergency loans for drought-stricken areas; quick action on the part of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Technical Services; advice to farmers etc. In spite of all these services we still find that it was necessary for the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board to do the following during that short period of time: In 1959-60 there were 6,512 applications for assistance under the Farmers Assistance Act; and since the granting of that assistance, up to the end of 1960-1, there were a further 603 applications. In other words, there were 7,115 applications for assistance. The debts of these farmers as disclosed under the 1959-60 scheme amounted to R69,723,000. The financial assistance given since 1 April 1959&#x2014;that includes the stockfeed scheme that was taken over by Agriculture&#x2014;amounted to R19,023,074, that is, under the assistance scheme&#x2014;the assistance given at Riet River and the assistance given in the Cape Province. If you add the loans given to save stock, loans in respect of stock-feed, the transport of stock, water etc. and the loans to save crops, loans for the repair of flood damage and loans to farmers in the foot and mouth disease areas, you find that the total amount which the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board had to advance during this period was R24,052,225. Then you still have the number of compromises which the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board had to effect under the scheme in which 350 farmers were involved. I want to state it very clearly that the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board, namely the State Advances Recoveries Office, has taken the lead here and has proved that under a consolidated scheme, if it could possibly be converted into a Department of Agricultural Finance, it would also be able to make its contribution in this respect and prevent the sub-division of farms into uneconomic units because it would be able to issue warnings timeously because of the knowledge that it has already gained in this respect. Mr. Speaker, I want to ask this: What control have we over the sub-division of land, over the injudicious fragmentation of our land? I went through the library and there I found Cape Ordinance No. 33 of 1934, Transvaal Ordinance No. 11 of 1931, as also No. 11 of 1933 and No. 13 of 1934. Those were the only ones in the library, but I know that after the Tomlinson Report the Transvaal decided not to allow land of less than 25 morgen to be sub-divided without the approval of the Administrator. But what does that mean? That is only in respect of town planning. That is only in respect of smallholdings&#x2014;smallholdings which are often the reason why the agriculturist finds himself in an unenviable position, because the smallholder is not the <i>bona fide</i> farmer, and he goes somewhere or other for assistance, assistance which he does not always get with the result that he falls out, and the land lies there unproductive, as it lies from Krugersdorp, Randfontein, as far as Witbank, where there are thousands of such unproductive smallholdings. In addition you have the Water Act. In the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 12 January 1962 provision is made for the board of management at Kakamas to have the right to determine that certain land, namely, certain pieces of land in Gordonia and Kenhardt, should not be further subdivided and cut up into smaller fragments. We also find that in the past no authority has been prepared to put a stop to the sub-division of land by testamentary disposition. In other words, you have this phenomena: A farmer who farms on an uneconomic unit, may injudiciously leave that farm to four or five children, and we have never been prepared to do anything to prevent that land from being cut up into five small uneconomic units. That matter must be put right. I want to put it this way: The divergent legislation of the various provinces relating to the subdivision <span class="col_529-530" refersTo="page_281"/>of land, makes a national attempt to combat this evil quite impossible to-day. As a matter of fact, as I have already said, it is only aimed at protecting urban development. When the Government tried to do so under the Development of Natural Resources Act and the Unbeneficial Occupation of Lands Act it encountered certain problems, and it cannot really be properly applied on a national basis. That again brings me to this all important matter, namely, that we should ensure that it is controlled on a national basis. The biggest crime that we have committed over the past 40 years was that we did not see to it that land was not injudiciously subdivided. There is simply no national control. There is pitiful overlapping and sometimes deplorable disregard by one department of the other department&#x2019;s timeous warning. During the Day of the Covenant festivities I went to the northern Transvaal, and there I saw how some beautiful farms in the Bushveld had been cut up into such small pieces that the farmers were obliged to plough the land and to sow groundnuts. With the first drought that comes along the wind blows the soil away: all you have is water erosion, there is no erosion due to over-stocking, but there is wind erosion on a very large scale as a result of the fact that the land has been cut up into pieces that are too small. The Department of Lands hopes that the Land Board will do the work. The farmers who have been placed on that land are capable and efficient farmers, honest people, whose <i>bona fides</i> can never be doubted, but do they have the technical knowledge, do they have the scientific knowledge, do they know the facts how to determine what the effects of production will be on our agricultural economy before they agree to the sub-division of that land? I want to give an example of this knowledge to which I refer. As a result of the difficult position in which the farmers found themselves we introduced the scheme of hypothecation loans for stock. The Department of Lands set a fine example and said that stock should once again be integrated with farming. But nothing that you do in agriculture stops at that. It forms a chain reaction. What is that chain reaction? That chain reaction is that as a result of that step the Department of Agricultural Economics is at its wits end to-day and does not know how to dispose of the surplus milk and dairy products. This proves to me that when planning our land we should at the same time consider what the economic consequences will be of such sub-division, of those steps that we are taking. I know that the Government intends conducting an investigation. Let me tell you, Sir, that we have this planning over the whole world to-day. I found the following interesting data in the Year Book of Israel&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The planners are now able to classify settlements according to similar or varying regional and local conditions. Objective factors such as soil tests, irrigation possibilities, climatic influence and past farm experience in the area are studied in advance and each settlement in the region is adjusted to the general plan.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The needs of existing settlements which were given inadequate areas when established are included in the general plan and it is adapted to the requirements of defence, communications and civic development in consultation with the security authorities and other official bodies.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize that when it comes to land planning and the sub-division of land into units of an economic size, Israel does not only consult, for example, her Departments of Agricultural Economics, and of Agricultural Technical Services and her Department of Lands, but even her Department of Defence, even her town planning division. In other words, she tackles it on a national basis, because it is something which affects her entire economic structure. That is the reason why we are coming with this planning, Sir, we are coming with it not only to ensure that land is sub-divided into economic units and consolidated, but we are asking that the body that has to do so should have a national board of land planning that will see to it that all factors are taken into account. I know that because of the Government&#x2019;s responsibility towards the Republic, its responsibility towards the various national groups, and particularly towards agriculture, it will conduct this investigation. In conclusion I want to recommend that the terms of reference of the Commission should be such that: (1) Investigation can be instituted into the steps that will be necessary to prevent the further uneconomic sub-division of land; (2) uneconomic units will gradually be consolidated into economic units; (3) a central board of land planning can be appointed; and (4) attention can be given to our agricultural economic structure in respect of entrepreneurs&#x2019; wage, planned mechanization, planning in respect of capital and working capital investment based on agricultural-technical and agricultural-economic advice. I move.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I second. I really feel that I should heartily congratulate the mover of the motion. I do not believe a speech has ever been made in this House containing so many points. He has definitely correlated everything which could be advanced and I want to congratulate him, and I am convinced that the House will accept his motion. The whole country is gratified about it. I must tell him that in my opinion such a commission of inquiry should have been appointed long ago, at the time, for example, when the Marketing Council was established.</p>

<p>But of all the good points he mentioned here I must say the main factor is still the price of the product which is obtained by the farmer. Without a sound price structure one cannot make any unit of land economic. Everything depends on that. Therefore I hope <span class="col_531-532" refersTo="page_282"/>that in future, as was the case in the past, the farmers will bear that in mind when stating their case. I am glad to be able to say that the whole economic structure of South Africa has been built up on the shoulders of the farmer; our industries, mining, and everything else have been built up on our cheap food, and I think the time has arrived when the various industries which are flourishing to-day with the price structure continuing to rise and salaries continuing to increase, will also grant the farmers a reasonable living on the land, and it is because the farmer cannot make a reasonable living that we have all these evils such as soil erosion, the depopulation of the platteland, and that the Government has to spend much money to keep the farmers on the land. These are all signs showing that the economic structure of the farmer is unsound. Therefore I come back to the point that the price received by the farmer for his product is not sufficient to keep him on the land, and when one talks about the economic sub-division of plots, etc., everything turns on the question of what the farmer receives for his product. I hope the time will come when we will have a five-year plan, or an even more extensive plan, to put the farmer on a sound basis. It is true that the Government has performed a miracle in keeping the farmer there. It has spent large sums of money, but why did the Government have to spend these large sums? Because the economic position of the farmer is bad, very bad indeed. What do we find now? We have all these various loans to keep the farmers going. They are not gifts to the farmers; they are loans, and every day the burden resting on the farmers becomes heavier. It does not relieve them of their burden, and if one is still going to interfere with the prices received by the farmer for his products, then eventually the farmer must go under. One cannot produce if one&#x2019;s expenditure is greater than one&#x2019;s income. My hon. friend mentioned a few points which definitely show that it is to a large extent true, and these vagaries of nature, such as droughts, etc. are not taken into consideration sufficiently in fixing prices. One thing is certain, namely that the price of the farmer&#x2019;s product decides whether he can produce economically or not. I think the farmer also has the right to expect to be able to make a decent living on the farm so that he can also educate his children. If one has regard to the income tax paid, one will see that only about 5 per cent of farmers in the country really pay income tax. I am convinced that 75 per cent of the farmers do not even make enough so as to have to pay tax.</p>

<p>Sir, the point is that in the Karoo and those areas there are may uneconomic units which would in fact be economic if the price of agricultural produce was high enough. Therefore I want to discuss how to make those areas economically independent. The one thing is the price structure and the other the water supply, because the droughts in those areas cause severe losses, with the result that many of those farms become uneconomic. Therefore I also want to mention the factor of water to indicate that if one can solve the water problems in certain parts, the farms there will be economic. Plans are now being drawn up to put another 350,000 morgen under irrigation, and now I feel that the Karoo and the farmers who live in areas far distant from that water should also have the right to have economic units and to make their farms economic.</p>

In the course of time these people will definitely become a burden on the State if something is not done to make those areas economic. The sub-division in the arable areas there is very serious, and I should like the board which is being proposed here, although I cannot prescribe to them, to go into all these points and to evolve a scheme based on this motion. But I want to add that it is also wrong if the economic aspect is not properly considered. If they do not do that, this motion will then be useless.</p>

<p>What about the Orange River?</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) rather transgressed the liberties he enjoys under this motion and he used the motion to a great extent to boosting the Government as a farmers&#x2019; government. I would like to remind the hon. member that it is not commissions that we need, but a Government that will have the grit to exercise the powers which have already been provided in the legislation of this country. Are we to wait to be reduced to the standard of mealies as our staple diet? The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) did not actually say that, but that was what he stressed, in his speech, as to what was in store for us. We have legislation to prevent the sub-division of agricultural land, which this motion deals with, and it is on this point that we want to stress the Government&#x2019;s responsibility. But I wish also to move an amendment to remove the harmful section of this motion in which it seeks to delegate provincial responsibilities to the Central Government. I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;units&#x201D;, in the third line, to the end of the motion.</block>

<p>I will speak to this amendment in a moment, but I would like to say first of all that a great deal of our troubles regarding this evil associated with the uneconomic sub-division of land is wrapped up in our evolution as a nation. The uncertainty of prices for primary products and the fluctuation in the natural laws of supply and demand induced the migration from the Cape in the early days, only to be aggravated by the concentration of our population on our farms in the interest of self-defence. I say that the dangers that the agriculturalists suffered in our earlier days aggravated this position of the sub-economic division of farms. They sought to keep their families together in the interest of self-defence. We had the example of the 1820 Settlers, who were concentrated not only on holdings of 100 acres in the interest of self-defence, but also as a buffer against the advancing Native tribes. They did so without any government assistance and without the Land Bank. They sold or gave their farms to each other and adjusted their difficulties, and to-day we find that 99 per cent of the ground allocated to the 1820 Settlers is still occupied and owned by their descendants. You see, Mr. Speaker, we must not always run to the Government to solve our difficulties. But what did the Transvalers do? Whom the 1820 Settlers came to assist? They ran away, taking even some of the 1820 Settlers with them, and they have been a problem in this country ever since Union. During General Hertzog&#x2019;s Government there were commissions on the poor-White question, and most of the poor-Whites were in the Transvaal. Then, there being no government assistance, came the depopulation of the platteland and the drift to the towns. It was a question of self-adjustment. The industrialization of our country gave the people, their sons and their daughters remunerative employment, and they in turn created better markets for our agricultural production. What governments can do is only a palliative, and this Government hides and postpones its obligations by appointing commissions of inquiry at the instigation of motions like this motion of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom. A commission of inquiry will get us nowhere. I would advise the hon. member to rather get down to the source of our troubles on the floor of this House. We have the necessary legislation and the hon. member should concentrate on that legislation and stop making suggestions for the appointment of commissions of inquiry. The Government have all the legislation necessary, but I am afraid that the Government is the greatest culprit itself. How much land does not the Government own? Let it do a little soul-searching. The Government has followed too much the designs of its own heart instead of doing the things it ought to have done. The hon. member quoted Aaron, perhaps I can also quote a little advice of that nature. He quoted two Acts. The Government has the machinery of the Land Bank Act, which the hon. member for Wakkerstroom mentioned; then there is the Marketing Act. Apart from that, the Government have wonderful powers in the Soil Conservation Act. It even has the Unbeneficial Occupation of Farms Act of 1937. I recommend to hon. members opposite to read all the expressed optimism surrounding the passing of that Act. The Government of 1937 were most optimistic that under the Unbeneficial Occupation of Farms Act, land barons would be done away with and the uneconomic sub-division of farms would be controlled as a result of the powers provided under that Act. I am pleased to see the hon. Minister of Lands here to-day. I know he is ready to enter into this debate. He has developed a very fatherly attitude in the control of debates here and we hope for some sound advice from him when he replies. But I regret that he has not the Minister of Water Affairs also here to assist him in providing the alternative, the only alternative which we have as regards the cutting up of our farms into small-holdings. We do not want to reduce our population on the farms. We want to increase that population. We all know that Oliver Goldsmith in &#x201C;The Deserted Village&#x201D; said as regards the value of our rural population, to the stability of the nation, the development of its character, and everything that a strong nation would desire. In fact, Mr. Speaker, we as a nation in this country have developed out of the land. We have now moved into the towns, but we must not forget our foundation&#x2014;the hon. member for Wakkerstroom spoke about the foundation of our nationality. Well, it is in our land. If we are to go back to our land, then there is this cry of &#x201C;water, water, water!&#x201D; for the alluvial soils we have, and then of course if this water is provided the difficulty as regards the <span class="col_535-536" refersTo="page_284"/>uneconomic sub-division of land falls away. The proper conservation of the 6,000,000 acre-ft. of water which, on an average, finds its way annually to the sea from the Orange River &#x2026;</p>

<p>Could I say to the hon. Minister of Lands in regard to the Pongolo Scheme that I hope that the hon. the Minister will exercise his powers to see that in the subdivision of land in the Native areas, he is not creating a poor-Black community. But I will not go any further into that matter. I would have quite a lot to say on irrigation&#x2014;hon. members opposite called on me to say something about the Orange River scheme&#x2014;but I will abide by your ruling which as usual is correct.</p>

<p>I want to come back to my amendment. What I wish to omit in the motion is this passage &#x201C;The desirability of transferring the jurisdiction over the sub-division of all land from the provincial administrations to the Central Government&#x201D;. I want to ask the hon. member for Wakkerstroom whether he suggests that Act No. 10 of 1944 which empowers provincial councils and the Minister of Lands to regulate the division of certain land into small portions and to prohibit such division, that this Act should be repealed? This Act gives such power to provincial councils, and they may prohibit or regulate the division of certain land. It further says that the division of such land can only be made subject to the approval of the Minister of Lands&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall effect any division of such land, unless the Minister of Lands has satisfied himself that the proposed division is not likely to give rise to the application of Section 2 of the Unbeneficial Occupation Farms Act of 1937, and has granted such permission in writing in respect of the proposed division. <br/>Provided that the preceding provisions of this sub-section shall not apply in connection with any land situated in any area excluded from time to time by the Governor-General by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> from the operation of this sub-section while such a proclamation is in force with reference to the area in question.</block>

<p>For the satisfaction of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, I would like to just read the last section of this particular Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Provincial Council of the Transvaal may by ordinance repeal from time to time, and amend the Agricultural Holdings (Transvaal) Registration Act of 1919.</block>

<p>So it does give the Provincial Council of the Transvaal extra powers, and I think that the hon. member, representing as he does the Transvaal, has cast rather a slight on the Provincial Council of the Transvaal in this motion of his.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Act was very highly thought of when introduced into this House, and the hon. A. M. Conroy, the then Minister of Lands, said, as reported in vol. 47 of Hansard, page 263&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The small agricultural holding of to-day is the potential township of to-morrow, and to a certain period they get right into the various towns and big places, and it is for that reason that we propose to give the provincial councils the power to deal with agricultural holdings as well as with the townships.</block>

<p>Then he does go on to stress how essential it is and why these powers should be delegated to the provincial councils. And then General Kemp, who was a previous Minister of Agriculture said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I was Minister of Lands I issued instructions that legislation of this nature should be planned.</block>

<p>That Act was passed and it went through the Committee Stage without any amendment and through the third reading without any discussion. It is an Act which delegates powers to the provincial councils, and we in the Cape Province are very jealous of the powers of local authorities and the provincial administrations. We have been prepared to pay for these privileges. The property owners in the Cape Province pay enormous land taxation to maintain local government like divisional councils and town councils. It is quite common for a farmer to pay &#x00A3;200 a year in road taxation. It is not as though he gets much more than the farmer in the other provinces in respect of work done on the roads. He retains that power of self-government and self-control which we want. I think that is what democratic government means. It does not mean delegating authority to a central Government. We in the Cape Province believe in the decentralization of government. The Province of the Transvaal and its supporters seem to advocate the centralization of government.</p>

<p>A government is very far removed from the individual if it is centralized, for instance, in Pretoria or Cape Town. We like these powers and we feel that the Government has all the powers it needs as regards the unbeneficial occupation of farms and the cutting up of farms into uneconomic units. We have the Unbeneficial Occupation of Farms Act. I do not want to delay the House <span class="col_537-538" refersTo="page_285"/>by reading some of the sections of that Act but they are most enlightening and they give enormous powers to the Government if it only had the grit to exercise them. I do not think that time should be wasted on commissions. Once you appoint a commission where are you? The Press Commission has been going on for years and years.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I said it might even outrival the Press Commission. What a tragedy that would be. A great deal could be done for agriculture with the money that will be spent on a commission when the Government already has the powers. We have had numbers of commissions already, Sir. We had a committee to consider the administration of areas which are becoming urbanized but which are not under local government control. That, of course, gave rise to the Act which gave the Administrator the right to control these particular areas. We have had commissions; we have had reports. And then the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) still asks for a further commission and for a further report when we have all this legislation before us. Take the Soil Conservation Act. That Act gives the Government enormous powers. It can expropriate a farm if it is not properly farmed. What I like about the Soil Conservation Act is that it delegates authority to local committees. Why I am against the second portion of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion is because he wishes to centralize all control in the Government and remove essential powers from our Provincial Councils. We fear. Mr. Speaker, that if this motion were acceded to and if it were recommended to allocate these powers now enjoyed by the Administrator to the Central Government, it may sound the death knell to the Provincial Council system. We have to remember that too. We are jealous of these rights. The Provincial Council system was part of the Union of South Africa; it is fundamental to our ideas of democratic government. For members to come here and to take away the powers of Provincial Councils, bit by bit, as has been done in the past, is something that we do not like.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, may I direct your attention to the second portion of this motion which asks for a commission to go into the question of removing from the provincial administrations the powers they have now and transferring those powers to the Central Government. I submit that the hon. member is dealing with that aspect.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I thank you Mr. Speaker. I think you too realize how jealous we are of the powers of local government. I do hope the Minister will react to the representations I have made. We do not want to kill this motion entirely. As I have said, even the first portion of this motion is quite unnecessary because the Government already has the powers. But we fear any reaction on the part of the Government benches to the second portion of this motion. We feel that the acceptance of that portion of the motion will lead to enormous dissatisfaction especially here in the Cape Province. I know that the Orange Free State and Natal place great importance on local government. But we in the Cape Province feel that we built the foundation of our legislation. Our early Parliament was the mother of the Parliament of our present Republic and, in that early Parliament, we did not only delegate the franchise to a wide section of the community, but we stressed the development of local government. I cannot use a strong enough term to stress the dangers and the reactions that will take place among the people of the Cape Province if the commission is appointed and it induces the Government even to consider further decentralization of the powers of the Provincial Councils.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the liberty you have allowed me in dealing with this motion. I am sorry that more time has not been allocated to us. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom naturally developed his introduction of the motion over a very, very wide field. I should like to apologize on behalf of the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker). He certainly has been led astray by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom gave us, not only what this Government should do, but what the Government has done. He also gave us information as regards the extent of the development in this country. I do appreciate the difficulties that confronted the hon. member for Cradock and I am sorry that he has not been able to make the contribution that he would have liked to make as regards the development of our water resources. That would partially have solved our problem in regard to the sub-economic partitioning of our farms in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to second the amendment. In the first place, I do not think it was necessary for the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) to include the last portion of his motion. If we <span class="col_539-540" refersTo="page_286"/>go back to Act No. 10 of 1944, we find that the Minister already has the power to put a stop to the injudicious sub-division of land. Mr. Speaker, may I just draw your attention to Section 2 of Act 10 of 1944. Let me first say that Section 1 provides for the power to be given to Provincial Councils to determine to what extent ground may be sub-divided. Then we come to Section 2, which says that the Administrator may approve of a sub-division and that land may not be sub-divided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless the Minister of Lands is convinced that the proposed sub-division will not probably lead to the application of Section 2 of the Unbeneficial Occupation of Farms Act (Act No. 29 of 1937), and has given consent in writing to the proposed division.</block>

<p>If we read the Unbeneficial Occupation of Farms Act, we see that what the hon. member for Wakkerstroom aims at here has already been provided for and that the Minister already has those powers. But the Minister in his wisdom realized that the sub-division of land required the necessary local knowledge, otherwise the sub-division of land would result in absolute chaos. Therefore the Minister in his wisdom has delegated these powers granted to him in the following section. He delegated them to the provincial administration. As the position is at present, the Administration has the right to sub-divide to a minimum of 25 morgen in the Cape Province. I think the only province which is an exception is Natal, where it is 50 acres. That is near enough. I therefore cannot see why the last portion of the motion should remain standing, because we already have this Act. All that should be done, if the Minister thinks fit, is for him simply to say that he will again himself assume those powers which he delegated to the provincial administrations. I do not think the Minister will do so. Particularly when we come to deal with small plots, I can draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Tomlinson Commission Report of 1957&#x2014;that is not the same Tomlinson Commission which is referred to so often, although it is the same Dr. Tomlinson&#x2014;dealt with the sub-division of land into plots.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not clever, but I look up things before I speak here. One cannot just get up to talk here without investigating the matter. If we read that report we see that this question of subdivision into small plots was very thoroughly considered by a very able commission at the time. That report is in the hands of the Department and also of the provincial administrations. I think one of the things which emerges from that report is that when one speaks about sub-division into small plots, there has been chaos just because previously there was no planning by local authorities. We also see that this report particularly recommends that when there is further sub-division into plots it should be done according to a pattern and in consultation with the urban authority on the borders of which these plots lie. I think if we want to do something good, we should rather urge that local authorities, from the Provincial Councils down to the ordinary local authorities, should devote more attention to the development of plots so that it will form part of a general pattern. Therefor I am glad to have had the opportunity of seconding the amendment that the last portion of the motion should be deleted.</p>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the whole problem we are discussing here to-day, viz, the question of the unbeneficial sub-division of agricultural land, is closely allied to the one great problem&#x2014;and it will have to be seen in that light from time to time&#x2014;that the size of a plot which is to be determined as an economic plot will depend on the prevailing produce prices. I foresee that we can easily land in the position that when at a certain given time we regard a certain size of plot as being economic in an area, we will find that as prices decrease we will later again have to increase those plots because they will no longer be economic. I want to mention these problems so that we will not lose sight of them. I am one of those who believe that we should always act very cautiously as a community to prevent our land being sub-divided into uneconomic units. That is why our Government, as early as 1957, passed the Unbeneficial Occupation of Farms Act, and provision was made for the Government to intervene if through inheritance the units become increasingly smaller until later they are totally uneconomic. It can then make the land available to as many of the heirs as can make a living on it, but then it must undertake to assist the others to acquire State land in order that they may make a living. But now the position is that in the times in which we are living we cannot abide by that provision and we must again reconsider the whole problem. Therefore I want to support the motion of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins). Let us discuss the matter here, but, Sir, I only hope that we will view it in a broad light. I also want to point out that if we should decide that in future only the Department of Agriculture or a commission or a board should decide what is an economic unit, we could be doing a tremendous injustice. Every farm is different. We cannot just generalize and say this is an economic unit and that is not, no more than we can say that it is an economic unit today and that it will still be economic in ten years&#x2019; time; or that what we to-day regard as an uneconomic unit will not be economic in ten years&#x2019; time. The whole question depends to such a great extent on the farming methods practised on that farm. Take a farm of 200 morgen, as the mover of the motion <span class="col_541-542" refersTo="page_287"/>has done, and if it is farmed in the way he mentioned it is not an economic unit. But if one uses that unit practically as a stable and one produces large quantities of fodder, it can be a very profitable proposition for a more intensive system of farming. So much depends on that. How are we to determine what systems of farming should be followed in a certain area?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is another point I wish to make. I foresee that if we just say that it is an uneconomic unit and the State does not assist in purchasing it by means of Land Bank loans or other assistance, it may happen that numbers of the most progressive and energetic young farmers who usually need the minimum of State assistance may not be able to get assistance. I want to illustrate this. I know of so many young men who perhaps started farming on their father&#x2019;s farms. They cultivated a certain portion of the farm. The boy made progress and was able to purchase a piece of land from a neighbour. Because he did not require much capital he was able to do that. That strengthened his position considerably. That happens daily. That same man is perhaps to-day one of the most prosperous farmers in that district, because he gradually became able to stand on his feet with the minimum of assistance by the State. If we are now to decide that a man cannot be assisted unless his farm is regarded as an economic unit, such a person will never have the opportunity of becoming independent. Sir, there are so many of these cases. Those are the points we have to consider when we discuss this matter. I want to give this matter my support because it is important. But I want to ask that we should approach it in this light, and I hope that if the matter is investigated the investigation will bring these things to light and will prove that we cannot just generalize by saying that this is an uneconomic unit and that is not; here the State will assist and there it will not assist. We have too many of these instances of people who, with the minimum of assistance by the State, can stand on their own feet by starting on a small scale and gradually expanding until they become quite independent.</p>

<p>I think that as the position is to-day, the Minister has the power to decide. Unless I am wrong, he has delegated this power to the provincial administrations, but I think he can withdraw it at any time. If the Minister sees fit to put this power back again into the hands of the Central Government, he can do so. But that does not derogate from the importance of this motion, that this matter which is of such importance should be discussed and that we should do what we can, when granting plots, whether it be done through the Department of Lands or by means of other State assistance, to avoid giving a man a unit which is uneconomic to start off with and which will lead to his failure. But we should not assume that we can just place a prohibition on all fronts at the same time against any assistance or consideration being given to a person who acquires or occupies or cultivates land which does not qualify in terms of that economic standard.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>While listening to the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) who moved the motion, a rather charming fantasy rose before me. I could see him burning the midnight oil and wading through all the works of reference to get the information which he has placed before us this afternoon. I feel a little pained to have to destroy such a lovely fantasy. But the truth is that the hon. member would not have come with this resolution unless he had the backing of the Government. And I presume, Sir, that at a later stage we shall have the hon. the Minister of Lands getting up and accepting the motion in view of the good case that has been put forward and saying that the Government will appoint a commission of inquiry. Because the hon. member would not have come with a motion like this at the beginning of the Session unless that was in fact the position. You will excuse me, Sir, if I address my remarks, through you, mostly to the hon. the Minister. I think that the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) who has just sat down has hit the nail on the head. This question of the subdivision of land is not merely a question of sub-dividing land into pieces of a certain size which can be called economic units. A piece of land is not an economic unit because it is of a cetain size. It is an economic unit because of the calibre of the farmer who is farming it, the amount of capital he can put into it, where it is situated in relation to markets and what its soil fertility, amplitude of water or otherwise, and so forth, is. Those are the things that make it economic. So you can have a piece of land which is far removed from markets, very fertile, but without, for example, water and it may not be economic. Similarly you get other pieces of land which have failed to be economic in the sense that they can give a good living to the farmer, but another farmer comes along and makes a good living there under precisely the same conditions. It has nothing to do with the number of acres involved but who farms it and what it is used for. We have had plenty of cases in this country where there has been a shift of emphasis in regard to our marketing. You get people who bind themselves together in a co-operative and work hard and eventually create a market for produce which can be raised in that area, and through intensive farming they make relatively small areas of land highly productive. Then of course you have vast areas farmed under totally different conditions which on the face of it might appear to be uneconomic, because either the farmer mortgages it up to the hilt or after a time he starts to sub-divide to keep himself going. These are the issues which have to be taken into account when dealing with a motion like this. The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) made it clear what our amendment was. We think this motion should be in two pieces. The amendment is to delete the words <span class="col_543-544" refersTo="page_288"/>after &#x201C;units&#x201D; in the third line of the English Order Paper, and to stop there. May I say that we support the motion up to that point, because we believe that a commission of inquiry could go into all these matters. In other words, it would not be limited in its terms of reference to merely dealing with the acreages comprising an economic unit, but all these incidental matters which make for a viable economy and for productive units, they should all be taken into account.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the portion of the motion which we suggest should be omitted. As the motion stands, I think what it means is that the central control over all sub-division of land should vest in the Government and that such powers as the provinces have should be taken away from them. Those powers include the power to confer on municipalities the right to sub-divide land, and in the Cape also to divisional councils. I hope the Government will not heed that plea by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, but that they will accept our amendment. The subdivision of land in regard to the layout of townships and matters of that kind, which are the particular powers that come under the provincial administrations to-day, are neither matters which can be learnt overnight, nor have they grown up overnight. They are the result of years and years of experience. All the provinces to-day have special departments dealing with the sub-division of land by the townships board, etc. and as the hon. member for Albany pointed out, in a speech which he quoted, a previous Minister of Lands said that so often the sub-division of land into smallholdings led to urban development. So it is not only the sub-division but the urban development that goes with it which should be taken into account and the provincial administrations have by experience qualified themselves to deal with that sort of thing. I would mention in connection with my own province of Natal the recent work of the Regional Planning Commission, the survey of the Tugela basin, a monumental work which took all possible factors into account, like the sub-division and the best use of land. All these things stem from a vast experience, and unless the Government proposes to take over town planning and all that goes with it, like the sub-division of land for purposes of the municipalities, and grafts that on to the Department of Lands, I can see only trouble and difficulty from the Government taking over any of those powers. I suggest that we leave that part of it alone and let the Government rather put its own house in order. We support the first part of the motion, but I think the hon. member for Wakkerstroom rather contradicted himself badly because for the greater part of an hour he set out to prove the need for a commission of inquiry and he quoted a lot of facts and figures which must have taken a great deal of research. That was to prove the need for a commission of inquiry, but into what? Into the Government&#x2019;s exercise of these powers? And having done that, he said that we should take away the power of the provinces to control the sub-division of land. He proposes to take away the power of the provinces to sub-divide land when in fact there is no complaint about it at all, and he proposes to hand that power over to the Government which he has been criticizing for an hour or more. That is most illogical. If he had asked for an inquiry into the sub-division of land by the provinces and then suggested that it should be handed over, the Government having done all things well and there being no word of criticism against it, I could have understood it. But the reverse is the position. He criticized the Government and said there is really no complaint against the provinces, except that they made a road through a farm here and there, and that may or may not be the case because the national roads have nothing to do with the provinces, and then he says the Government should take over these powers.</p>

<p>I want to come on to another point. Where this sub-division of land into uneconomic units is concerned, I wonder how far we as a country are being committed to a type of population which is on the farms&#x2014;they are called farmers because they own farms&#x2014;but who cannot keep their heads above water and struggle and struggle until eventually they break down and go to the towns. But we keep these families and there are hundreds of them. I do not know that they are good farmers initially, but when once farms have been allotted and the Government is satisfied that those farms are capable of providing a living for the ordinary hardworking farmer, what protection then does the farmer get to see that his goods are sold at a living wage for him so as to give him a chance to make that farm an economic unit? You see, Sir, all these matters are linked up with this question of the sub-division of land and it seems to me that even with the help given to settlers, technical advice, so often these people have not enough capital to really get started or they do not use their capital to the best advantage, or there are inadequate markets and those farms are then classed as uneconomic units. They are probably not uneconomic units, but as long as it is the policy of the State to put farmers on this land without providing it with an adequate market so that the farmer has something to aim at and knows that if he works hard he will make a living on the land, until something like that is guaranteed I fail to see how simply an investigation into the area of the farms will get us anywhere. The investigation should be so wide in its terms of reference that all the surrounding circumstances are taken into account and what we should aim at is not just the economic sub-division of land but its sub-division under circumstances which will enable a normal farmer to make a living. We do not want to see the drift to the towns, but that is something I do not want to go into now. The fact is that the sub-economic farms is the reason why so many people go to the towns.</p>

<p><span class="col_545-546" refersTo="page_289"/>On the question of the smallholdings, I want to point out that we must remember that this affects the rating provisions in our municipalities in all four Provinces; as far as I know, as far as smallholdings are concerned, and for whatever reason&#x2014;generally for reasons of public health&#x2014;such areas are incorporated in the local authority area and become subject to rates, and they are given the benefit of a special rate, an agricultural rate. But those smallholdings in many cases are farmed by people who are not really making their living out of it. They are in close proximity to a good market because they are inside the municipality. They pay rates to the municipality which are usually lower than the normal rate and they are able to produce a quantity of produce and get that on to a good market quickly and easily in competition with farmers from further afield who have to make their living from agriculture. I know that from time to time this matter has been investigated by the provincial administrations. As soon as a smallholding becomes uneconomic, the owner has the opportunity of going to the townships board and cutting up his property. That is where the provincial administrations come in, because they can deal with matters of that kind. We do not want to see a large number of smallholdings simply thrown on the market because they are sub-economic from the point of view of the farmer making a living. It is not in the best interest of our economy to do so, but at the same time we do not want them to be used as an unequal competitor in the market against the genuine farmer who makes his living out of it. So I say that we support the first part of the motion. We hope the Minister will appoint a commission with very wide terms of reference. so wide that when the commission reports back again it will be able in respect, broadly speaking, of the various areas of land and the different farming conditions in the Republic, to say that for this type of farming in this area, at that distance from the market and with the water available, such and such an area will be an economic unit and the hardworking farmer with adequate capital, which they can determine if they like, ought to be able to make a reasonable living on it. Then some good will have been done, but anything falling short of that will result in that report being put into the same pigeonhole as all the other reports. It would have failed in its primary purpose, and that is to present the correct picture to a young man who wants to go farming in his own country and who wants to know the conditions under which, if he works hard, he can make a living. He cannot always do that in his own neighbourhood of which he has experience. He often has to go away and farm under other conditions. Such a survey would be of enormous assistance to them, let alone to people who come in from elsewhere, and it would be of incalculable value. Therefore we support the first half of the motion and I ask the Minister to accept our amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins), who introduced this interesting motion, used numerous quotations from the report of a commission appointed by President Roosevelt in America; but in the book from which he quoted or in another book, there is a preface written by President Roosevelt in which he states that the history of every nation is ultimately written according to the use that it makes of its soil. These are very interesting words and if one accepts them in their widest sense&#x2014;the use it makes of the soil it has&#x2014;then the motion must certainly be classified under this heading, because the use or abuse and the economy of the soil are all things falling within this sphere. I welcome this debate which has taken place to-day because this debate has proved that this is not an easy subject and that there is no obvious solution for these problems but that it is a matter which will require much study and one in connection with which it will be necessary to ascertain what has been done in other countries. I welcome this discussion, which I found interesting. It also made us realize that hon. members are serious about this subject and that the legislation we had and the means, that we applied in the past were ineffectual and offered no solution. A number of inquiries have already been instituted. There was the report by the late Dr. du Toit on the depopulation of the platteland and there was the Tomlinson Report on small-holdings; and there were various persons who gave this matter their attention and made considerable contributions.</p>

<p>It really falls within the powers of the provinces only to place restrictions on the subdivision of land. As far as their powers are concerned they did not primarily use them to ensure that agricultural farms remaind economic units. They were more concerned with the question of the so-called plots or smallholdings in the vicinity of our large cities and which had become a serious problem to us and more especially to them. In so far as the powers granted to them affect the problem, their contribution was almost nil. I do not blame them for this. They were given these powers for purposes other than the imposition of restrictions on the sub-division of agricultural farms. They were more concerned with the small-holdings which caused many evils in the vicinity of the large cities.</p>

<p>The kernel of this problem lies in the fact that we in South Africa are undergoing a transition from one form of agriculture to another form. We have always applied extensive farming methods in this country and with our increased population to-day we are switching over to intensive farming, but we are still inclined to think in terms of extensive farming. The debate that has taken place here to-day proves that hon. members are beginning to realize that we have entered a new era as far as our agriculture is concerned; and that while we are still practising and will continue to practise extensive farming, the accent must in future be placed on the problems of intensive <span class="col_547-548" refersTo="page_290"/>farming and everything connected with it. We are going through the growing-pains of the transition from the one to the other and we have to start giving our attention to the new situation as we find it in South Africa.</p>

<p>The actual subject here is the sub-division of farms, the economic size of farms, and that is linked up with many other things such as the fertility of the soil. The hon. member over there has said that one should determine the fertility of the soil; but it cannot be determined at this stage that a holding will be an economic one in ten year&#x2019;s time because one does not know what use will be made of the land. I have seen cases where the fertility of soil has been improved but I have also seen many instances where it has been destroyed. I have seen uneconomic farms become economic ones, but I have seen far too many uneconomic units where the farmer has exploited his soil and has not put back what he extracted from it with the result that the farm lost its fertility. We saw what happened in the North-Eastern Free State a few years ago as a result of circumstances concerning which I shall perhaps have a few words to say later on, where the fertility of the soil was lost and where we now have to try to build it up again. We saw how 20 years ago as a result of injudicious farming in what is to-day one of our most prosperous wheat districts there was enormous economic retrogression. They then started to grow lupins as a rotational crop and we know how the whole of the Swartland was lifted out of what was virtually an economic depression into a state of prosperity. These are small farms where intensive farming should be practised but the farmers tried to apply extensive methods with the result that the fertility declined. It involved a lengthy process to build up the fertility again and to make the Swartland what it is today.</p>

<p>Much has also been said, especially by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) concerning the question of produce prices. The hon. member for Cradock also spoke on this subject. This is also a very important subject. Prices rose after the war and people thought that they could farm on smaller pieces of land since prices had risen in relation to the cost of production. Later, however, prices fell or the cost of production rose and then they discovered that the farms were becoming uneconomical, that the fertility of the soil had decreased. A farm which had perhaps been economic ten years before, became uneconomic because it was too small and because wrong methods were applied.</p>

<p>Much has also been said here about a matter which also affect Provincial Councils, and that this question of agents who buy up farms around the cities and who then entice poor innocent people to buy small plots of ground there. &#x201C;Be a farmer, and do your work in town&#x201D;, the advertisements read. The gullible people do not know better and think they are going to have a prosperous farming project together with their town job. However, they neglect their job in town and the farm is not big enough to provide them with a livelihood. That was the problem of the Provincial Councils. But there is another matter which has not been mentioned to-day but which is to a large extent responsible for the small-holdings and that is our custom in respect of testamentary disposition. We follow the Roman Dutch Law and where a man dies intestate, the children inherit equally under Roman Dutch Law. In other countries where the law of <i>primo genitur</i> (first-born) applies, the eldest son inherits the entire property. Few of our people die intestate; but where a Will is drawn up, it is done in accordance with the law of the land, because the law is simply the crystallized custom which later on becomes law, and in our country a parent often feels that he is doing the children an injustice if he does not allow them all to inherit equally. Well it would be less of an injustice if the parent tried to give the younger children an education and then chase them out of the home and told them to go and work, leaving the land to one son, than it would be if he left his land to all of them with the result that they all have an uneconomic piece of land. I wanted to have a map prepared to show hon. members here to-day but I thought it would be contrary to the spirit of Parliament&#x2014;to illustrate a case on the Marico River in the Transvaal where there was a fairly large farm with a piece of riparian land. The original owners wanted to leave it to their children and each child was to receive a small piece of riparian land because it could be placed under irrigation. The boundaries of the farm extended 5,000 yards from the river and to-day there are about 25 owners, each of whom has a piece of land with a 40 yards river-frontage. Some of the farms are no more than 50 yards wide and these small strips of land extended over a distance of 5,000 yards, which creates a ridiculous situation. This is the result of our system of testamentary disposition, of what we look upon as our duty but what is not always our duty. That is one of the main reasons for the sub-division of our farms into uneconomic small-holdings.</p>

<p>There is only one justification for the subdivision of farms and that is to raise the productivity of the farm. If the production can be increased then there is a justification for smaller farms. The productivity can be raised through improved marketing, as already mentioned, but also by growing better products and increasing the productivity of the soil. In this connection I have to state two facts: In the case of some of our most important products in South Africa our yeild is exceptionally low. The second fact is that the Department of Agriculture has since its inception done an enormous amount of work in order to make up that leeway. At a show which I opened last year, I gave the production figure per morgen in respect of maize and wheat in South Africa, in comparison with most of the maize- and wheat-producing countries of the world. I am not going to repeat those figures <span class="col_549-550" refersTo="page_291"/>to-day; I am rather ashamed of them. We do not find ourselves in the best of company, in fact, we find ourselves in rather poor company. From time to time we see that prizes are awarded, particularly in the maize areas to farmers who have been able to obtain the highest yield of maize on an economic piece of land, and we find that the yield that is actually obtained is altogether disproportionate to the average yield of maize in South Africa. In the case of wheat the difference is not so marked because I think the wheat farmers are generally more advanced in the methods they apply. The difference between the good and the weaker farmer in the wheat belt is not as great as the difference is between the good and the poor maize farmer. But the figures at our disposal clearly prove that by adopting intensive farming methods instead of continuing to apply extensive methods on a small piece of land, we can push up the production of maize in South Africa enormously, to mention only one example. The attention which was given to this matter in the past was given chiefly in terms of thinking of the size of the land. This has been mentioned by various members&#x2014;by the hon. member over there, by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and also by the mover of the motion of the very well-reasoned speech made by him. They pointed out that one should not think in terms of the size of the land. We now go to the Provincial Councils and suggest that we grant them the power to say that farms shall not be smaller than 25 morgen or smaller than 50 morgen.</p>

<p>Secondly, they say that the value of the land must serve as a yardstick. I can mention many instances where the size of the land has nothing to do with its productivity and nothing at all with the value of the land. Perhaps I may be permitted to quote a few examples that hon. members may find interesting. Mr. Willie Rood, who for many years was a member of Parliament and later became a Member of the Central Land Board, told me that the first time he went there, land along the Olifants River in the district of Vanrhynsdorp was being valued. The man&#x2019;s farm had been divided into two portions 20 years previously. The one portion was valued at R400 per morgan and the rest of his farm at 25 cents per morgan. To-day the land valued at 25 cents per morgen has a valuation of perhaps R2 per morgen, but it is not worth R2. The land which was valued at R400 per morgen is now valued at R800 or R1,000 per morgen, and that is based on the productivity of the soil. Here in Constantia an aunt of mine had a piece of land which she let to Coloured people who cultivated flowers. There was one old Coloured woman, a Mrs. de Mink, who cultivated flowers. She had 1&#x00BC;morgen on which she farmed and when she died two years ago, she left a young nephew a Cadillac motor-car and R10,000 in cash, apart from other legacies; and this from 1&#x00BC; morgen of land. One can go into the North-Western Cape and give a man 1,000 morgen there but he will never own a Cadillac motor-car.</p>

<p>Nor will he be able to leave R10,000. Here in the Cape Flats we have pieces of dune land which are suitable for the cultivation of vegetables. This dune land is not worth more than R2 per morgen. You may have a farm of 200 morgen there of which four morgen may be suitable for the cultivation of garden produce and on which the man can make a decent living, but the remaining 196 morgen may be completely worthless to him. You may have two adjoining farms, one having six morgen of garden soil and the other consisting of 200 morgen. The one of six morgen is worth much more than the one of 200 morgen which may have only four morgen of garden soil. But out of those four or six morgen the owner can make a living. I came across an instance where a man applied for a piece of land in the Eastern Free State under Section 20 of the Land Settlement Act. The Land Board reported to me that this piece of land was not an economic unit and that they could not buy it for him because he would not be able to make a living there. I said to them that I found this rather peculiar because the applicant was a young man working in the Post Office who had saved some money to enable him to attend an agricultural college, where he came first in the two-year course. He returned to the Post Office and later went back to another agricultural college for a six-months course. I pointed out to them that it was unlikely that the man would be talking non-sense, that he should know what he was going to do with the farm. When I asked them with what he intended to farm, they made inquiries and ascertained that it was his intention to take up bee-farming. The land was. situated in the bushveld and he wanted to take up bee-farming, for which he would not require a large piece of land or a great deal of capital and the fertility of the soil was of no importance. I then allotted this land to him and asked the Board to let me know what this man&#x2019;s income was during the next two years. The first year his income was R1,600. The second year his income exceeded R4,000. That was his gross income. I do not know what his net income was. That was his income on a plot of land on which any agricultural expert will tell you it is impossible to make a living, unless he takes into consideration the purpose for which the land is to be used. Take the case of your poultry farmer. Many of your noultry farmers do not buy expensive land. They purchase land here on the Cape Flats which they can obtain for R2, R4, R6 or R8 per morgen. All they need is space for the fowls. They do not practise agriculture; they go in for poultry farming. I mention this to show that the value of the land has nothing to do with the success or otherwise of the farming project. There are other factors also <span class="col_551-552" refersTo="page_292"/>which have to be taken into consideration. I was very impressed once when I was in England in the grain-producing districts. I asked the owners of the farms what their average wheat yield was. They told me that their average wheat yield there was 60 bags per bag of seed in a bad year, and 80 bags per bag of seed in a good year. The average yield in our good districts here is only 15 to 25 bags.</p>

<p>Per morgen. We are talking about South Africa now. In the wheat-producing districts in England production ranges from 60 to 80 bags per bag of seed, and here it ranges from 15 to 25 bags per bag of seed. If you find land here in South Africa on which you can produce 15 to 25 bags per bag of seed, you have to pay anything from R60 to R80, or even more, per morgen.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>Well, let us say R120 per morgen. Do you know what the price was of the land in England which produced 60 to 80 bags per bag of seed? It was R60 per acre, that is to say, R116 per morgen. Why the difference? Because there are other factors which come into the picture, mainly the high price one has to pay for labour. One cannot therefore consider the value of the land only; one has to take these other circumstances into account. In a big country like South Africa conditions vary greatly. There are large areas like the maize complex in which conditions are more or less the same everywhere, but in the agricultural areas particularly conditions vary not only from district to district and from farm to farm but even on the same farm. A certain piece of land may be worth a great deal whereas the adjoining piece may be worthless. In my younger days I was a Land Bank assessor in the Stellenbosch district. Land which in those days was valued by us at approximately R300 per morgen is worth about R1,000 to-day. But I remember that I valued certain sections of a farm at R300 per morgen and other sections of the same farm at R1 per morgen. I valued it at R1 per morgen even though it was not worth R1. I could not very well have valued it at less than R1, but for the purposes of production it was not worth R1.</p>

<p>The point I want to emphasize here is that we do not want centralized control because local conditions both as far as the land, the climate, the type of farming which the man wants to practise and the character of the person are concerned, have to be taken into account. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) has told us a few very interesting things as to what happens in other countries. I was in Holland a few years ago where they have a system which I doubt whether our farmers in South Africa would be prepared to accept, because no farmer in Holland is free to sell his land, and if he is allowed to sell his land he and the purchaser are precluded from determining the price of that land; everything is arranged for him. The authorities decide to whom he may sell his land, and the reason why this is done is that he is not allowed to sell that land to a person who already owns economic land. He can only sell it to a person who is in more or less the same position in which he is. The authorities guard against inflation of land prices, because if there is one country where there is a great risk of inflation of agricultural land prices it is Holland, the reason being that there are so many cities in Holland, and that these cities are continually expanding with the industrial development taking place there. Here in South Africa, when a city starts developing, all the agricultural land in the immediate vicinity of that city is sold at inflated prices. It is bought up at a price far above its agricultural value, because it is bought with the object of cutting it up into township plots later on. It is a lock-up investment. Then I also want to say that when prices start rising in the peri-urban areas, this has an effect on the price of land situated far from the cities. One finds that in Holland cities do not stretch over a distance of ten miles; they end suddenly at a particular street; in other words, one finds a city extending up to a street and agricultural land just across the street. The owner of land adjacent to the city is not allowed to sell his land to a person in that city who wishes to establish a factory without prior permission from the proper authorities, and if he sells it he cannot sell it at an increased price; he can only sell that land at its agricultural value. Another reason why they impose a limit on the price one can get for one&#x2019;s land is the question of subsidies, because in most European countries&#x2014;in England, Holland, Switzerland in particular, and to a lesser extent in France but there too&#x2014;farmers are kept going by subsidies paid on their products; and they say that if one allows the price of land to rise, then subsidies will have to rise as well. It is only be keeping the prices of land under control that one can keep subsidies in check to a certain extent. The price of land should be kept within such limits that the farmer is able to make a living out of it, bearing in mind the price he paid for that land. There are many areas in South Africa to-day where it is virtually impossible for a man to buy a farm; he has to inherit one, because the price of land is uneconomically high, and if he buys a small farm, it is not very long before he forms a pressure group to approach the Government with a request for subsidies on the products he produces because he has paid too much for the land. The third thing mentioned by the hon. member to which this body has to give attention is the question of consolidation&#x2014;the question of isolated pieces of land, the question of people who own a piece of land here and a piece of land there&#x2014;so that in the result everyone can have an economic small-holding. But what I have mentioned here only goes to show the drastic powers <span class="col_553-554" refersTo="page_293"/>that the authorities in Holland have. In England they also have drastic powers, particularly with regard to the letting of land. That is not our problem. We in South Africa will only be able to solve this problem if we take fairly drastic powers, and I doubt very much whether our farmers would be ready to accept these drastic powers at the moment, because we are a lot of independent people here in South Africa. We are like those Cannon islanders to whom I referred the other day. They do not readily agree to restrictions being imposed on them; they would rather have subsidies than restrictions. We shall have to train our farmers through our farmers&#x2019; associations to accept that in the future restrictions which they consider drastic will have to be imposed on them in the interests of the future of farming in South Africa.</p>

<p>Reference has also been made here to our settlement policy. When settlement was started along the Orange River&#x2014;I am talking about close settlements under irrigation&#x2014;it was started in times of depression, first at Kakamas and later on along the Orange River under the Government scheme. It was started in a period of depression caused by low prices and drought. Small farms were carved out there which according to our standards to-day are still too small, but at that time it was felt that the persons concerned could make a better living there than they had been making before. But in terms of the standard of living that we concede to people to-day, they remain uneconomic small-holdings even though the people there do make a living. Because there is one thing which we have always opposed in land settlement in this country, and that is &#x201C;peasant&#x201D; farming, small-scale farming. the type of farming in which a farmer gets very little cash. He practically lives on what he derives from his small plot of ground. He is unable to improve his position or that of his children. He comes to be regarded as falling within a class and if a person is born into that class he and his descendants always remain in that class. We want to avoid that in South Africa. That is why we have gradually switched over to the policy that all the land that we allot through the Department of Lands under Section 20, under which we acquire land, under Section 23, or in the case of small farms that we allot under settlements, must be economic allotments. Our aim has always been to give people economic smallholdings, small-holdings which will not make them rich, but on which they can make a reasonable living and provide for those of their children for whom there is no land by giving them the necessary education. Our policy is that a person must be settled only on an economic small-holding. Under Section 20 the applicant may even select his own piece of land and we then purchase it for him and give him a certain period within which to pay it off. I reject many proposed purchases of land under Section 20 every year because the land the person wants us to purchase for him does not in our opinion constitute an economic small-holding. I admit that mistakes do occur. It is often the farmer&#x2019;s own fault that the mistake is made, because we cannot judge the character of the farmer; we can only judge the land. People apply from far and wide. They bring testimonials, often from Members of Parliament, to show what good people they are. We give land to such a person and later on we discover that he is not the right type.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is the direction in which we are heading, and that is why I say that as far as these things are concerned and especially as far as the last point is concerned, one cannot have centralized control; or let me rather put it this way: One can have centralized control but the actual decisions must be made locally. In Holland where they have this system, they have their local committees in every district and these local committees go into every case. They would have gone into the case of old Mrs. de Mink who cultivated flowers in Constantia and found that her small-holding, with the methods she used, was an economic one even though it was only1&#x00BC; morgen. They would have gone into the case of the young man I mentioned who bought an uneconomic piece of land in the Eastern Transvaal through the Department, the young man who farmed with bees, and they would have said, &#x201C;If you want to farm with bees you do not need land; you only need space&#x201D;. They would be able to go into the prospects of the people who often come and ask us for ten morgen of land on the Cape Flats, land which has no agricultural value whatever but on which they want to farm with poultry. If people want to farm there with poultry, the farm is an economic one to them. Not only that, but they will go into the character of the person in order to determine whether he will in fact make a success of farming on that piece of land. May I just tell this story to the House? I was once asked by a bank to value a farm in the Stellenbosch district. There were three people who had applied. The bank had acquired the farm in an insolvent estate and three people had applied to the bank for this land. I then had to go and value this land because the applicants wanted bonds. I came back with three different valuations, a valuation for A, a valuation for B and a valuation for C. The bank manager then said to me, &#x201C;But you cannot value land in that way&#x201D;. I pointed out to him that the land must be valued in that way because the success of a farming venture dependended not only on the intrinsic value of the land, that it depended both on the land and the calibre of the man who was going to farm on it; that one could therefore lend so much to A but much less to B and that one&#x2019;s money would still be much safer with A than it would be with B. Well, all this can be done locally. I do not want to bind myself to everything that I have said here; these are only my ideas in the light of the experience gained by me but I do want to say that the Government proposes to go into this matter. We shall decide what is the best way to obtain the necessary information and we shall <span class="col_555-556" refersTo="page_294"/>then consider the steps to be taken. It may be a commission or it may be a committee of officials and of other authorities with whom we are going to co-operate but we are going to go into this matter and decide in the near future what to do. We are not going to shelve this matter.</p>

<p>We shall have to decide first what the terms of reference are to be, whichever body investigates this matter. Briefly, however, these are the main things which have to be investigated in connection with this problem: The first is the determination of an economic farming unit, particularly the question as to how and by whom it should be determined. My feeling is that to a large extent it should be determined locally, with a central organization which really has its points of contacts everywhere. We shall have to determine what steps should be taken to obviate further sub-division of farms into uneconomic units and then we shall have to determine what steps should be taken to consolidate existing uneconomic holdings and what financial implications are involved. That goes without saying. I just want to say that we are giving our serious attention to this matter. We have no objection to the motion as it is worded. As far as the amendment is concerned, I just want to say that we have no intention of interfering with the domestic affairs of the municipalities; we have nothing to do with that. We are dealing here with agricultural land, land used for farming purposes, not urban properties.</p>

<p>If the amendment had asked that we should not interfere with municipal affairs, it would have been a different matter because we are not going to interfere with municipal affairs. But the question is whether the position is covered by these powers that we gave the Provincial Councils in an attempt to obviate the subdivision of land into uneconomic units. For the purpose of this discussion those powers mean nothing because they do not think in those terms; they only think in terms of plots in the peri-urban areas. They do not think in terms of farming miles away from the large cities, nor is that their function; it is our function, and I feel therefore that the amendment is not necessary. I do not think hon. members need have any fear that we are going to interfere with powers which the Provincial Councils have in connection with cities and towns. We are not interested in that; we are only interested in farming, and if it can be shown that the Provincial Councils are able to do it, very well then, but that is the problem that we want to solve and if the Provincial Councils, because of the nature of their constitution and the work that they have to do&#x2014;because they have nothing to do with farming really&#x2014;ought not to have this aspect under their control, then it should not be placed in their hands. We shall go into this matter judiciously and decide what in our opinion is the best thing to do in this connection.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side are particularly gratified because the hon. the Minister made the statement he did make this afternoon, viz. that the Government is in earnest in seeing to it that agricultural land in South Africa will not be further subdivided. I think we can accept his statement as well that it is not the intention of the Government in any way to try to interfere with the powers of the provincial authorities. It is for that reason particularly that I think the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) was so wrong in including the last portion of his motion, because the sting was really in the tail, and it is for that reason that we on this side have moved an amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Lands has made a very interesting speech. He proved that he is quite <i>au fait</i> with this problem of the subdivision of agricultural land in South Africa, and we can see that the representations made by hon. members opposite and also by the hon. members for Albany (Mr. Bowker) and South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) have fallen on fertile soil. It is no longer necessary for us to tell the hon. the Minister why it is essential that such a commission of inquiry should be appointed. When a person like the hon. member for Wakkerstroom comes to this House with such a motion, one immediately realizes that the hon. member must have made a thorough study of the scope of the problem, as his speech also proves. One does not ask for a commission of inquiry unless such a problem actually exists. We know from reports received by us a year or two ago that there is indeed a problem in regard to this question of the sub-division of land. Reasonable grounds exist for the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, but before one does anything of this kind one would like first to have a thorough investigation. The commission which investigated the depopulation of the platteland and which published its report a year or so ago did in fact contain a chapter dealing with farms which are becoming smaller in South Africa. It is not a problem which has just recently arisen, but one which has existed for many years already. Shortly after Union the farms in South Africa began getting smaller. I just want to quote one paragraph from this report of the commission in regard to the depopulation of the platteland, paragraph 195, or rather part of it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The increase in the total acreage of farms smaller than 100 morgen was from 563,000 morgen in 1927 to 951,000 morgen in 1954.</block>

<p>In other words, there was a tremendous increase in the number of farms of less than 100 morgen. If a farm becomes smaller, it does not of course mean that its fertility immediately decreases, but in this work by <span class="col_557-558" refersTo="page_295"/>Grosskopf about the impoverishment of people on the platteland and the desertion of farms, he tells us on page 112&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whilst unexpected catastrophes sometimes also broke the richer farmers, the capacity of the small landowner to withstand them is generally much weaker.</block>

<p>As the unit becomes smaller, one can also to a certain extent expect a reduction in the fertility or the carrying capacity of the soil, and when disaster strikes it is that poor man who is affected every time. Therefore these farms which are diminishing in size definitely constitute a problem in South Africa. The commission of inquiry in regard to the depopulation of the platteland (the hon. the Minister referred to an experiment they had made) mentioned in the report that a poll was taken in the Marico district by the Department of Agriculture, and what did they find? The report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eventually attention was concentrated on 17 farms where the problem of sub-division was most marked. <br/>These 17 farms, which originally had an average size of 2,590 morgen per farm, have now been sub-divided into plots averaging 13.3 morgen.</block>

<p>Originally these farms on an average were 2,500 morgen, and now they are approximately 13.3 morgen. Then they say further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One farm of 4,967 morgen, for example, has 60 shareholders, although it is a completely arid farm.</block>

<p>Therefore the problem exists. But it was not the object of this commission to study the problem of farms becoming smaller. They just pointed out in passing that the fact that farms in South Africa were decreasing in size was also a reason for the depopulation of the platteland.</p>

<p>Why is land sub-divided? The hon. the Minister himself mentioned two reasons. He says that it is mainly due to the system of inheritance we have in South Africa. That is quite correct. One can quote many examples of people who have made a reasonable living on a farm with three or four sons. Then the man leaves the land to his four sons and it is sub-divided amongst them, and in the end not one of them is able to make a decent living on the land. The result is that those people go to the cities. This system of inheritance with its resultant sub-division of land has therefore in fact had the effect that many of our people in the platteland have gone to the cities.</p>

<p>I also want to mention a second reason. I and is also sub-divided by the speculator, the man who buys up a large piece of land and then hopes to make a big profit by subdividing it into smaller farms. And in the third place the State cannot wash its hands in innocence either. We have made the same mistake in the past, of granting land to people without making a proper survey and without ascertaining what the carrying capacity or the fertility of such land was. No attempt was made, at least in many cases, to ascertain whether it would be able to afford a decent living. The result was that people were settled on land, at settlements and other places, when those plots were not suitable for the purpose and could not afford a decent living. I had the example about a year ago of a man who acquired a piece of land in the Kalahari, just above Upington, probably in the constituency of the hon. member for Gordonia. This man was very keen on farming. He obtained a farm, but when there was a slight drought he had to return and continue with his work of boring for water in the Williston district. It was impossible for him to make a living there. If ground has to be sub-divided the State should remember that farm or plot should have reserve resources. A farm should have reserves. One should not be able to take everything out of it all at once. In other words, if one wants to have grass leys, if one wants to rest certain parts of the farm, if one wants to apply soil conservation methods or grazing methods, that man must be able, if difficulties arise, to surmount those troubles because his farm is an economic unit which enables him to cope with the difficulty. I feel very strongly on this point. So many farms give a man a decent living, but as soon as there is the slightest set-back he must either incur heavy debt in order to overcome his difficulties or he must leave the farm&#x2014;not because of his own fault but because that soil did not have the reserves necessary to enable him to apply sound farming methods.</p>

<p>It surprised me that the hon. member for Wakkerstroom asked that a stop should be put to the jurisdiction of the provincial authorities in regard to these matters. As the hon. the Minister himself said, they have no jurisdiction in respect of agricultural land. That is something quite different.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member used the argument that he knows of a place somewhere on the Rand where a Native township was established on very fertile Delmas soil. It worries me just as much as it does the hon. member when such things are done, but will it be prevented if the matter is taken out of the hands of the provincial administrations? Of course not. That development to which the hon. member referred took place under the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. Surely a Native township like that cannot be established without the approval of that Department. Therefore the hon. member will not prevent it by taking this power away from the provincial administrations. I can appreciate that there should be consultation between the Central Government, the provincial authorities and the local authorities. But surely he cannot advance this as a reason for taking it away from the Provincial Councils. How does the hon. member know that a central board such as he suggests will not set to work in the same way? It will simply depend on the measure of consultation <span class="col_559-560" refersTo="page_296"/>existing between the Government Department concerned and the local authority.</p>

<p>I say that the sub-division of land leads to numerous evils, and one of the most important is this&#x2014;one cannot even call it an evil, but to a certain extent it leads to malpractices, and it even results in the fact that a man who buys the land cannot make a decent living on it because in the first place he pays too much for that land. Just let me read what the report says about this in paragraph 222 on page 26. They took certain farms as examples, representing three different systems of farming, viz. crop farming, mixed farming and stock farming exclusively, and then they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In regard to all three systems it appears that the farmers with the smallest farms&#x2014;uneconomic units&#x2014;paid by far the highest price per morgen for them. It also appears that the farmers with the smallest farms have by far the highest burden of debt per morgen. The Commission is of the opinion that the widespread tendency to divide land into plots and so-called agricultural plots is an important contributory factor to the inflationary land prices in certain areas.</block>

<p>I just want to give these figures: On farm units of under 200 morgen the total debt per morgen was &#x00A3;14.6; from 200 to 599 morgen it was &#x00A3;12.4, and from 600 to 999 morgen the debt was &#x00A3;7.7. But just note the investment per morgen. In regard to units under 200 morgen the permanent investment was &#x00A3;41, but from 200 to 599 morgen it was &#x00A3;33 per morgen, much less. Therefore the smaller the land, the more expensive it is for the man and the higher the burden of debt and his permanent investment.</p>

<p>If one takes the total debt per morgen, one finds that under 200 morgen it is &#x00A3;10.9 per morgen, and from 200 to about 600 morgen it is only &#x00A3;9.4. The smaller the land the greater the total debt and the greater the investment. I therefore say that it is an evil in this respect alone to sub-divide the land to such an extent that it later becomes uneconomic. Sub-division of land also results in a tremendous increase in production costs. We know how in recent years mechanization has begun to play a large role in agriculture. The man with 20 morgen, perhaps on a settlement, needs precisely the same amount of machinery as the man who has 40 morgen, but the man who has 40 morgen can farm more advantageously than the man who has 20 morgen.</p>

<p>But what is more, the man who has a too small piece of land often has to exploit the soil in order to make a decent living. Often he also has to do something else in order to supplement his income, and that leads to further inefficiency. They perhaps put a non-White on that land, or someone who is there only temporarily, who does not farm properly, and in that way they make absolutely nothing from the land. Sub-division also results in the soil structure, the fertility of the soil, being destroyed. Monoculture and exploitational methods are applied, and what is more, because the land is too small it becomes impossible for the man to introduce the animal factor properly, and in agriculture, even though we plough and sow, even though we apply sound agricultural methods, the animal factor should play its role. It is necessary to ensure the man a decent living, but it cannot be done because he lacks the space. He is forced to rely only on cash crops, and we know that if we produce cash crops alone that is the fastest and surest way of destroying the fertility of the soil. We also know that man cannot really afford to apply soil and water conservation. And these are only the obvious difficulties.</p>

<p>What is more, however, are the social consequences flowing from the fact that the farms are becoming smaller in South Africa. I want to conclude by quoting what the report says about the impoverishment of the people on Page 27&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As soon as the units become too small and people cannot make a decent living, we find these people deteriorating morally, culturally and in the sphere of education.</block>

<p>Therefore if there is one reason why I think that steps should be taken to prevent our land being further sub-divided, it is particularly this result, apart from other material advantages which will flow from increasing the landholdings&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As soon as the land becomes too small impoverishment sets in, which in turn is followed by a lower standard of living, and social deterioration with its concomitant evils, as well as cultural and educational deterioration.</block>

<p>I regard that as one of the strongest reasons why we should prevent our land from being sub-divided further.</p>

<speech by="#heystek">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>It is a great pity that during the discussion of this very interesting and essential motion introduced by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom many of our members were forced to sit on Select Committees, both on this and on that side of the House. Now unfortunately many hon. members are absent again. When as the result of the subdivision of land, uneconomic sub-division, the winter winds blow over that land and the summer sun bakes it and the floodwaters wash away the topsoil, then in spite of the application of fertilizer isolated plants will be dotted as sparsely on that land as hon. members are now sitting in this House, and I must say this, although the hon. member has also disappeared now: If this now were a field which had to be reaped and the knife of the reaper had cut me down, just see how far that machine would have to go to get to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) over there at the back. We would not have the honour of going through the drum together, and even less could we expect to land in the same bag.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we must think carefully about our soil so that we will be jealous of every square foot of the soil of this Republic of South Africa. If the 14,000,000 inhabitants <span class="col_561-562" refersTo="page_297"/>of this country each destroyed one square foot of agricultural land, several economic farms would have been destroyed, and if each of them protected and built up one square foot, we would have a few more farms on which farmers could make a living. We must be jealous of every square foot of our soil, just as the producer of gold is jealous of every fine ounce of that precious metal which he smelts and does not waste a single drop. In the same way we must guard over our soil. It is a basic requirement that the fertility of our soil should remain unimpaired and that it should be improved. Just consider how a tree which has been debarked withers and dies. It is the same when as the result of the uneconomic sub-division of land we debark the soil (I want to make that analogy). I cannot imagine anything more awful than a piece of land which has been trodden out and washed away, whereas formerly there were grassy pastures and trees to beautify the land and bubbling brooks, whereas now it lies bare under the torrid rays of the summer sun as the result of the uneconomic sub-division of that land. I can imagine only one thing worse, and that is to skin an animal alive and then to chase it into the veld, which is on an equal footing with the sin we commit towards our soil when we do not conserve it. Our arable land and our pastures are our most important natural resources and we should not forget that in comparison with other countries our production potential on an average is only eight to ten bags per morgen as compared with 20 in other countries, and then we still have the uncertainty of our climate which makes our production so vulnerable. It is equally important to remember that our arable land comprises only 10 per cent of our total agricultural land, and we must preserve and build it up. There is a disquieting decrease in the fertility of our soil. The reasons must be diagnosed and solutions must be found, and one cause of it is the existing uneconomic sub-division of our land. We know that the development of rotational systems as the basis for the maintenance and the increased fertility of our soil is receiving the serious attention of the Government. Furthermore, also fertilization and the breeding of new varieties, the planting of grasses and the eradication of weeds, etc. is enjoying the attention of the various departments. In regard to our grazing, our stock farming industry is based on our grazing, and most of our wool, mutton and beef and dairy products are produced on the veld, and we must remember that 85 per cent of our land will always be pasture. It is therefore vitally important that we should use our grazing properly and maintain it and that its destruction as the result of uneconomic sub-division should be combated.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the yield of milk per cow in South Africa is 250 gallons, in New Zealand it is 475, and in England 720 gallons. From this it appears that it is not always the size of the farm which counts, but that on smaller farms the production can be increased by intensive and judicious cultivation. The results of the research done should be brought to the notice of our farmers immediately, and that is the task of our extension officers, and you, Sir, will allow me to say that at present there is one extension officer for every 900 farmers, whereas it is estimated that the ratio should be one for every 400.</p>

<p>But there is another matter which should be mentioned, namely that every year 2,500 to 3,000 new farmers start farming, and only 15 per cent of them receive agricultural education either at an agricultural high school, an agricultural college or a university, and that affects the low production of our soil, because there is no agricultural education available for these new farmers.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that throughout the years the uneconomic sub-division of land has taken place on a large scale in the Republic of South Africa. That was due in the first instance to inheritance. I do not want to expand on this, because the hon. the Minister has already mentioned it. Then there is the splitting up of farms purchased by people with capital who cut them up into plots. They then sell these plots at a high profit to poor, land-hungry people. I want to state here that this is a contemptible practice, i.e. land speculation by persons who have no love for the soil and who regard the soil as an ordinary commercial commodity. Sub-division is also due to the fact that the owners of farms close to the towns, as we have just heard, cut up their farms into 10-morgen plots, when they were still allowed to do so, and then sold the plots to people who thought they could farm there without any knowledge and who considered that their income could be augmented by doing casual jobs in the towns. Hence the unsightly picture of poor houses with rusty roofs and grey clay walls round about our towns and cities in the Republic. In the fourth place, it is the result of injudicious sub-division of agricultural land by the State in order to assist as many farmers as possible to acquire plots, and this applies to large units for extensive farming as well as to small units on the settlements where intensive farming under irrigation is practised. The result is that to-day thousands of farmers in the Republic are struggling to make a living, and ironically enough the position is aggravated by private loans and Land Bank loans and State advances for seed, fertilizer and fuel&#x2014;all attempts and schemes aimed at keeping farmers with a shortage of capital on their feet, but as the result of the uneconomic subdivision of the land these schemes have for a long time not been attaining their object. So much for the small plots.</p>

<p>The second and equally important factor is the farmer. We know of successful farmers who resigned their jobs and who to-day are independent farmers, but we know others who also did so but after two or three years came back to ask the Government for assistance. There are farm boys who could be capable and successful farmers but who exchange that opportunity for cash wages in the <span class="col_563-564" refersTo="page_298"/>cities. Care should be taken to see that the plot is an economic unit before a farmer is placed on it. I am now talking particularly about farmers who get their land from the State. If such a farmer then after thee years (so economic must the soil be) proves that he cannot make a success of farming&#x2014;apart of course from the vagaries of nature with which he was afflicted and over which he had no control&#x2014;then we must take drastic steps to remove that farmer so that he can make room for the right type of farmer. We must make so sure of the plots that the farmer alone will be to some extent the unknown factor and not the plot. The plot must be a known factor when it is awarded to the farmer, and in order to cope as far as possible with the last point, namely that the farmer is an unknown factor, the farmers should be selected carefully and scientifically before plots are granted to them.</p>

<p>Now we know more or less what the problem is and what the solution will be. The commission which has been asked for should be appointed, and on their recommendation uneconomic plots should be consolidated. And I want to say something practical: They must be consolidated into fully-fledged economic units, irrespective of what it costs the State, e.g., to establish closer settlements and to supply the plots with houses, dams, canals, fencing and curing sheds, etc., because this and successive generations cannot eternally be expected to suffer as the result of a big mistake which was made in the past and for which they were not responsible. Drastically to remedy these mistakes may cost hundreds of thousands of rand, but eventually, when we have made these farmers independent people on economic units, millions of rand will have been saved. Direct cash losses can be prevented and eliminated. To use an old Dutch adage, it is a sour apple to bite into, and it will cost a lot. The Department of Lands admits that there are numerous cases of uneconomic sub-division, which we also admit, and together we shrug our shoulders and ask: What should we do? It seems so difficult and so impossible now to declare as uneconomic units which years ago we declared to be economic, and to do it on such a large scale as is necessary to-day throughout the length and breadth of the Republic of South Africa. It seems somewhat irresponsible and it appears to be an admission of mistakes made and of a wrong policy having been applied in the past, but we are not here to make recriminations and to reproach each other, we are here to remedy the defects. I want to put it this way: we are not looking for mistakes in order to criticize in a derogatory fashion; the mistakes are as obvious as the cracks in a wall and these are the mistakes which are cried out aloud by the inhabitants of these uneconomic units, and also by the unbalanced agricultural economy, in spite of the present and past gigantic agricultural financing schemes.</p>

<p>Nor should we forget the psychological aspect of this matter. If a weak farmer goes down it pays to fit him in somewhere in the community and to give him work, but if as the result of this uneconomic sub-division of land a potentially good farmer lands in difficulty, we have destroyed a soul, we have destroyed an ideal, we have broken a human being, and that is nothing less than a tragedy. We know that all the so-called uneconomic units are not uneconomic. With the necessary planning and soil conservation many of them can be proved to be economic. Dr. Tomlinson said on one occasion at Nylstroom last year that the so-called sour &#x201C;Waterberg bushveld&#x201D;, properly planned, would be able to carry no less than 1,000,000 more head of cattle.</p>

<p>With my knowledge of Waterberg, with its three main agricultural regions, I should like to state the size of the economic units in the various regions approximately as follows: The Springbok flats, for cash crops, together with the addition of the cattle factor, 400 morgen, and there are many of them which are 150 morgen in size. The sour bushveld, for mixed farming, i.e. cattle farming, dry land farming, as well as farming under irrigation, from 1,000 to 2,000 morgen, but some of them are only 300 morgen in size. The sweet bushveld, exclusively for cattle farming, from 3,000 to 4,000 morgen, but there are some farms which are only 500 morgen. What the hon. member for Wakkerstroom said applied to the sweet bushveld. One cannot farm with cattle on a farm of 500 morgen. The trees and the grazing are being eradicated in order to plant peanuts. A proper survey will therefore bring to light, Mr. Speaker, that the sub-division of land in the Waterberg district is completely uneconomic.</p>

<p>But actually, throughout the whole of my speech, I bore in mind, if the hon. the Minister of Lands is here, the Sterkrivier settlement. There we have uneconomic units of 20 morgen of scheduled land, poor soil, soil which becomes waterlogged easily, stony soil, sandy soil and clay soil. The Department has in its possession a memorandum I drafted two years ago. I now have a new one which was drawn up by interested parties. The two memoranda are in close agreement with each other, but I shall discuss the matter with the Department personally at a later stage.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, if this Commission is appointed, I hope that also that area, the Sterkrivier settlement, will occupy a prominent place in the itinerary of such a commission. Here I have a pack of letters I have received from Waterberg since this motion of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom was published in the Press. They all say the same thing: If the Commission is appointed, we would like to interview it; we are trying to live on uneconomic units. I have a whole parcel of letters. The flood-gates have been opened. Therefore I am glad to hear from the hon. the Minister that the Government will give serious consideration to this matter. At this stage I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>As usual, it is necessary to ask the House for an advance to cover Government expenditure during the first few months of the new year before the usual Appropriation Bill is passed. It is estimated that for the three months April, May and June an amount of R210,000,000 will be required, R176,000,000 for revenue services, R6,000,000 for Bantu education and R28,000,000 for loan services. Hon. members will know that only those services which have been approved of by Parliament will be covered by this measure. Any new services envisaged must wait until the Appropriation Bill is passed. In my Budget speech, which I intend delivering on Wednesday, 21 March, I shall review the financial position for the current financial year, as well as the prospects for the coming year. I do not intend anticipating my Budget speech but I should like to make use of this opportunity to mention a few matters of general interest.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the last session of Parliament, our economic position with regard to the outside world was definitely difficult. The Reserve Bank&#x2019;s gold and foreign currency had sunk to the low level of R142,000,000 and we were compelled, <i>inter alia,</i> to institute control over the repatriation of the income from shares sold in South Africa by non-residents. This and other measures adopted by the Government were immediately effective. Furthermore, the Government, soon after the end of the session, was successful in obtaining loan facilities, the so-called &#x201C;stand-by credit&#x201D;, to an amount of $75,000,000 or R54,000,000 from the International Monetary Fund, which did much to create confidence in our ability to surmount our difficulties. Later on in the year the reserves were strengthened by certain overseas loans obtained by the Reserve Bank and certain private undertakings. When I attended the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Bank in Vienna in September last year, our position had already improved considerably. I was therefore able to have discussions with various overseas bankers in an atmosphere of confidence. As the result of these consultations, various new foreign loans were arranged. Firstly, a loan of $10,000,000 or R7.1 million was obtained from an important Italian bank, the Banca Commerciala Italiana. The loan was for a period of three years at a rate of interest of 51 per cent. Shortly thereafter a loan was obtained from a prominent German bank, the Deutsche Bank. The amount was 40,000,000 German marks, or R7.1 million, the rate of interest was 5&#x00BD; per cent and the term two years, but it can be extended for a third year. These two loans are very important because they are the first loans the Government has obtained in Italy and Germany, and I am particularly gratified that we were able to open these new sources of finance. In both cases other banks, apart from those through which the loan was arranged, also participated in the loan, so that we have now initiated broad financial relations with important institutions in both those countries. We also obtained two loans from the World Bank&#x2014;$11,000,000 (R7.9 million) for railway development and $14,000,000 (R10,000,000) for the Electricity Supply Commission for the development of power under a Government guarantee. Both loans are repayable over a period of ten years and the rate of interest is the rate presently being charged by the Bank on all its loans, namely 5&#x00BE; per cent. Hitherto we have not drawn on these two loans. Finally, we have succeeded in renewing our revolving credit of $40,000,000 (R28.6 million) with a group of American banks for a further period of two years from 23 January. This loan has now been continuing for at least ten years. At first it was $20,000,000, but two years ago it was increased to $40,000,000, and it has always regularly been renewed when the period expired. We have now again renewed it for a further period of two years from 23 January. The rate of interest remains unchanged at 5&#x215C; per cent. The Reserve Bank repaid $10,000,000 of this loan in December last year, so that only $30,000,000 is at present outstanding in foreign exchange. In other words, there is still $10,000,000 which we can draw if necessary.</p>

<p>The improvement in our foreign reserves&#x2014;which of course can only to a slight degree be ascribed to these loans&#x2014;still continues and last Friday the gold and foreign exchange of the Reserve Bank stood at R314,000,000, i.e. R172,000,000 or 121 per cent higher than it was less than eight months ago. The Reserve Bank has already repaid the short-term foreign loans it obtained when our position was difficult, and I think the time has arrived for the Government to reduce its short-term foreign obligations. At the end of 1960 and the beginning of 1961 we drew R27,000,000 in foreign exchange from the International Monetary Fund&#x2014;the so-called gold-tranche. We shall repay this amount within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>In July 1961 we obtained the right to draw a further R54,000,000 from the Fund&#x2014;the so-called &#x201C;stand-by&#x201D; for the first and second <span class="col_567-568" refersTo="page_300"/>credit-tranches. We did not make use of this right, and we are now going to inform the Fund that we are relinquishing our right in respect of half of that amount. We still reserve the right in respect of the first credit-tranche, viz. R.27,000,000. But we are now informing them that we are now relinquishing the second credit-tranche.</p>

<p>The fact that our position has improved so rapidly that we are able to take these steps is significant proof to the outside world, as well as to our own people, of the inherent power and stability of our economy.</p>

<p>During the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in September last, the problem of international liquidity received much attention. Practically all the discussions in the meeting of the Fund were concerned with that. Suggestions were considered for a system of additional credits which would then be provided by some of the countries which were in a very favourable position to do so, countries like France, Germany, Italy, Holland, etc. Suggestions were considered for a system of additional credits, apart from the normal fund credits which the more important industrial countries give each other in times of emergency, and these suggestions have since been incorporated in a formal agreement. I expressed the opinion, and I abide by it, that all these schemes are merely patchwork and that the only fundamental solution is to increase the price of gold. All these measures being adopted may perhaps bring about a better distribution of international liquidity, but they cannot result in an increase in the globular amount of international liquidity. Possibly because this opinion was not really discussed at that meeting it did not receive much support there, but still there were certain prominent economists who supported our view. The fact that many people abroad believe that an increase in the price of gold is eventually inevitable is also proved by the increased demand for gold coinage for purposes of hoarding.</p>

<p>The Government has now been approached, also by financial circles abroad, to agree to South African gold coins also being sold overseas. I do not know whether it will be possible to build up a large trade in these coins, but I think it is worth while testing the market. I have consequently agreed in principle that a small consignment of South African gold coins, namely R2 pieces, should be exported. If the experiment is successful&#x2014;and I sincerely hope it will be&#x2014;larger amounts can be sold abroad later. We have the necessary minting facilities in South Africa to do it on a much bigger scale than this experimental consignment. One thing is sure&#x2014;and here we also have the proof of it&#x2014;namely, that the ordinary man in Brussels or in Beirut or Bombay still has greater confidence in gold than in any other currency, had I believe that his confidence will not be misplaced.</p>

<p>Normally the main emphasis in a debate like this would fall on financial matters, but I do not think that it will be taken amiss if the Opposition on this occasion concentrate on an issue before the people of South Africa, which far transcends in importance any of the financial suggestions or plans which the hon. the Minister of Finance may make at the moment. I was of course pleased, all of us were pleased, to hear about the strong position in which South Africa finds herself as far as foreign reserves are concerned; but we should not forget, and the Minister should not forget, that the problem with which we have to deal here is a problem of confidence in South Africa. As long as South African shares are quoted on the foreign exchanges at a price below that which obtains at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, something is amiss. As long as it is necessary for the Government to prohibit the repatriation of shares, after all the assurances that have come from this Government and from previous governments that such a ban would never be necessary, we South Africans must take stock of ourselves and ask what is wrong. We must ask why there is not the confidence in this country which it so richly deserves in every respect except in respect of the Government which controls it at the moment. Sir, I believe, and I think all of us share the belief, that the lack of confidence in South Africa is directly due to the difficulties that we have in this country in solving our race problems. The Government has recently through the Prime Minister announced a new plan which they hope will contribute to the solution of our race problems, the plan which was discussed less than a fortnight ago but which could not then be completely examined in the time available to us.</p>

<p>There is something massively tragic in the approach of the Government to this question, in the belief of the Government that they can ignore the facts as they exist in South Africa and create a world of their own in a vacuum and apply solutions to actual problems in theory completely unrelated to the facts as they exist in this country. Indeed, they remind one in many ways of Napoleon when he entered Moscow and believed that at last he was on the eve of the final conquest of all Europe; how little did he realize then that in his immediate future there lay the retreat from Moscow, more than the decimation of his army, Elba and the death of an exile on St. Helena. One is reminded of Hitler, whom you will recall danced a jig before Paris, believing that at last the conquest of Britain was assured and that his thousand years empire could not fail. But perhaps more poignantly and more tragically and perhaps even more aptly one is reminded of the famous words of Mr. Churchill, who on one famous occasion said that he had not been elected to become Prime Minister of Great Britain to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire. Only a few years later his Government was restored to power after an eclipse of five years, and indeed and in fact had to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire. Sir, it is because we <span class="col_569-570" refersTo="page_301"/>believe a similar tragedy threatens South Africa under the present Government, with the same lack of appreciation of reality, that we would like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill unless and until the Government undertakes to withdraw its plans for liquidating the Republic and for undermining the bastions of Western civilization in Southern Africa.&#x201D;.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>What the Government is seeking to achieve with this new plan is partly a solution of our internal race problem, a race problem which, of course, is very difficult because it is bedevilled by so many factors beyond our control, chief of which is the emergence to the rank of a first-rate power of communist Russia, the fact that China and half of Europe have become communist and that they play a tremendous part in the determination of the foreign and colonial policies of all the nations of the world. Our problem is not only a problem of finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> between people of different races, it is also a problem of urgently re-adjusting the relationship between peoples who in the past were cast in the role of the ruler race or the dominant race, and of the subject race, the conquered race. Our friends opposite believe that they have all the time in the world slowly and gradually to evolve a solution on the lines of what they call apartheid. Indeed many of us can recall the late Dr. Malan, the then leader of that party, who was Prime Minister at the time, telling us in this House that territorial separation was nothing more than an ideal which was impracticable and that no government would try to achieve it, but an idea according to which they could test whatever action they were undertaking in relation to the problem of the moment. Now suddenly it is no longer an ideal; suddenly it has become a matter of urgent practical importance for the present Government to attempt territorial separation immediately. There are only two reasons for that, and one is that in the present Prime Minister we have found a political leader who believes that it is possible. I will say no more. But it has also become urgent for another reason. I believe that other reason can only be an urgent need, of which the Government has become conscious, to appease world opinion. We have reason to believe that the announcement by the Prime Minister on Tuesday was not only an attempt to find a solution for our race problems in South Africa but something much more; it was also a kite flown on the South West African issue. It was to determine what international reaction would be to a Transkei plan in order to transfer that plan to South West Africa and to set about the partitioning of South West Africa by taking away Ovamboland and giving it to the Ovambos in the hope that part of South West Africa would then become secure and safe for the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But what happened? The matter of real interest in the announcement made by the Prime Minister on the first Tuesday of this Session was: What would the international reaction be to that plan? I think it is now long enough to form some judgment, and I think the judgment of every impartial South African must be that the plan fell completely flat, that it was an utter flop as far as the world was concerned. Sir, I do not rejoice in that; nobody rejoices in that. Any South African who has the interests of this country at heart would like to see an improved image of South Africa in the outside world. We know that a great deal of money was spent on buying space in the overseas Press to announce this plan; we know of all the elaborate preparations made to give it an unprecedented publicity start in the world, but they have all failed. We must ask ourselves why they failed. Surely it had some elements in it which were imaginative, which were bold, which should have seized the imagination of people interested in this problem anywhere in the world. Why then did it fall flat? There is only one answer possible. It fell flat because it was defeated by a blast of counter-propaganda from Government agencies and from Government supporters in the Republic of South Africa. I want to give a few examples lest hon. members opposite should doubt this. I am thinking of the counter-propaganda that arose from the refusal of Government supporters in the Municipality of Pretoria to allow Japanese swimmers, who are officially recognized as White people, to swim in the Hillcrest Swimming Bath. I think of the blast of counter-propaganda that has been coming for some time, out of the heresy trial of Prof. Albert Geyser in Pretoria, a trial which is not concerned with heresy; it is a trial concerned with race relations in the first instance. I think thirdly of the tremendous counterpropaganda against the Prime Minister that arose from the arrest on a charge of immorality of Mr. and Mrs. Singh, a properly married couple. We may argue that those two people knew what the law was when they went to another territory to get married; that they should not have come back; that they knew what their position would be. But we should also realize that as far as the outside world is concerned, they were legally married. In the sight of God they were married. But they were arrested and they have been tried on this charge at a time when the Prime Minister was making a supreme effort to improve the image of South Africa throughout the world. All I can say is that the Prime Minister has our sympathy and our pity for the followers he has in South Africa.</p>

<p>That brings us to a definition of the real problem that faces South Africa. It is not a <span class="col_571-572" refersTo="page_302"/>problem of a hostile foreign or English Press; it is not a problem of rebellious aborigines in this country; nor is it a problem of a Government faced by blind enmity based on some racial consideration. All these apologies have come from Nationalist Party supporters in the past. No, fundamentally it is a problem that arises from the past encouragement of hatred and prejudice and fear by the propaganda of the present Government Party for its own political ends. They are not succeeding in re-educating their followers in the Pretoria Municipality or in the Department of Justice fast enough to appreciate the winds of change which are tearing like a hurricane through the ranks of the Cabinet. That is the problem, and until they have the courage to stand up before the people of South Africa and to set an example of contrition by saying, &#x201C;I have sinned, forgive me; let us adopt new attitudes in South Africa&#x201D;, the Prime Minister is wasting the money of the taxpayer by buying space in London newspapers for policy announcements in the face of the things that happen behind his back amongst his own followers.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s plan of giving the Transkei self-government will not succeed because the Prime Minister, even in that plan is making concessions to that prejudice and that fear of which he is one of the chief authors in South Africa. The Transkei plan is not an attempt to solve the race problem in South Africa by tackling it at its roots, which is the poverty of the majority of the people in this country. It is not a plan to develop these people and to create a situation for them where they too will feel they have a stake in the security and in the safety and in the progress of the South African state. It is still a plan to attempt a form of separation. But what form of separation? There was a time when we were told that there would be apartheid &#x201C;op elke gebied in die Suid-Afrikaanse lewe&#x201D; (that there would be separation at every level of South African life); that there would be physical separation, that there would be economic separation. What has now happened is that at last the Government is realizing that type of separation is impossible, that there cannot be economic separation, that there is in fact what they have denied so eloquently and so vehemently in the past, namely, economic integration in South Africa, and now they attempt the last and the most futile bluff of all&#x2014;to create political separation, although there is integration in every other respect in the life of South Africa. With the best will in the world, with the greatest determination, which the Prime Minister does not show, with the greatest will to make sacrifices, a will which has never existed in the Nationalist Party, it will still be impossible truly to separate the Black people and the White people in this country.</p>

<p>Look at the problem that faces us. It has been examined for us and for the Government by the Government&#x2019;s own experts. We know, for example, that before you can rehabilitate the Transkei and make it a viable unit on its own, it is necessary to remove urgently 2,000,000 people from agriculture in that area.</p>

<p>From the Native reserves over the hole of South Africa&#x2014;I am sorry&#x2014;to make them viable units. Employment must be found for 300,000 breadwinners, heads of families, in activities which are not known in that area at present; inactivities which we have been told should be created in the form of industrial development on the borders of the reserves. What progress has been made with this? The Leader of the Opposition told us the other day of ten industries which have been appproved in principle; I would be surprised if they gave employment to 1,000 Natives. Although the Deputy Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development took part in the previous debate, we waited in vain for revelations about the spectacular development necessary in the development of border industries. We were not told a single thing. Nothing more seems to be happening. But supposing the Government could be successful, which they are not, in spectacularly changing and diverting the economic development of South Africa from the present industrial areas to the borders of the Native territories, think of the problems that would remain for those people who remain in these territories. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration told us proudly&#x2014;and he should be proud because it is a great achievement&#x2014;that, through Government education and Government stimulation, grain production in the reserves has increased by 25 per cent under the administration of this Government, and we, on this side, say congratulations. But does the Minister realize the size of the problem he is dealing with? if the Transkei had to feed itself, it would have to double its agricultural production, and if we were to take half the population of the Transkei away from agriculture and put them in secondary and tertiary activities, it means that each farmer in the Transkei would have quadrupled his production of food. And after eight years the Minister is able to announce an increase of only 25 per cent. Sir, it is a tremendous problem. What we have at the moment is an attempt by the Government to salve its conscience, and, as I have said, to create a different image in the world by allowing political developments in these areas, especially in the Transkei, to outstrip the economic development and so to escape from the responsibility which is squarely on the shoulders of this Government. We have been told at last, eight years after the report of the Tomlinson Commission, about the five-year plan for the development of these areas; that R114,000,000 will be spent in five years. It sounds good, but I want to say at once that if you look at that R114,000,000 against the background of the problems the Government have set themselves, namely to divert <span class="col_573-574" refersTo="page_303"/>population increases from the existing White areas of South Africa and encourage those increases in the Native reserves, then I say it is a paltry sum, especially if you take into consideration the fact that of the R114,000,000 no less than R75,949,500 will be spent on housing alone, to build 90,150 houses in 33 villages. Excellent, Sir, and it will create employment in the building industry, but what happens when the people occupy those houses? What are they going to do to earn a living? They cannot go on building houses forever. Or is the Minister running the risk at the present rate of development, at the present rate of capital investment, of building slums at the rate of R79,000,000 every five years?</p>

<p>Sir, if you look at the Transkei this sum becomes even more paltry. Of this R114,000,000 a mere R18,900,000 in five years will go to the Transkei and R14,100,000 to the Ciskei. How many new occupations will be created for the Native people in those areas as a result of this pitifully small investment? Sir, if we look at the experience to which my Leader referred, the experience of the Venoni plan in Italy, you find it is true that in a development area you first have to provide certain essential basic services like housing, roads, irrigation and transport. But then you also have to accept, Sir, that they found in Italy that, for the first five years or so, you do not create new permanent jobs, and that the only jobs you create arise out of the implementation of the plan, and not out of the fruits of the plan, which means that, according to this five-year plan, new industrial and new tertiary and secondary activities will not be created in that area for several years. It will be laying the foundations, I hope, for future development. Now we should ask ourselves: Have we the time, have we the time with this pitifully small investment, at this tardy rate to tackle this problem, this ideal of the hon. the Prime Minister, of separate development&#x2014;at this slow walking pace?</p>

<p>What we immediately need in South Africa is not a minimum investment to further an impossible ideal of separation of the races. The need in South Africa is for massive investment in creative activity all over South Africa, and. Sir, investment in those areas where it will be most effective and have the quickest results. What we need in South Africa to-day is not apartheid in the sense of the Nationalist Party. We need human progress. What we need is a declaration of war against poverty, against human misery. If we could only get half the determination which the hon. the Prime Minister evinces for this impossible ideological scheme, for the practical need of improving the livelihood of our people by developing South Africa all over, we could achieve something.</p>

<p>What have the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government announced? Some 90 per cent of the available investment capital in South Africa under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s plan will still be invested in what is known as the &#x201C;White area of South Africa&#x201D; and most of the employment will be created in the White areas of South Africa, and there will be an insatiable demand, in terms of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s thinking, for more labour in the White areas of South Africa. We shall have to let them come&#x2014;because we will not get the immigration we would like to see&#x2014;from the Bantu areas, from the Transkei and the Ciskei and from Zululand and Vendaland, wherever labour is available. Now we talk of apartheid and the hon. the Prime Minister creates political institutions for non-existing separate races in South Africa. But the development of South Africa will still be concentrated in the White areas, and more and more Black labour will be needed in the White areas. If the hon. the Prime Minister shakes his head, he will have an opportunity in this debate to do a simple thing which will convince all of us, and that is to prove that in the next five years instead of investing R114,000,000 in the Native areas, we will invest more capital in the Native areas than in the White areas and so ensure that more opportunities for employment and for development will be created in those areas, so that they will be able to support more of the Native population of South Africa than the White areas of South Africa. Otherwise he cannot overcome the final and decisive criticism of all these schemes that for selfish reasons they are not prepared to make the sacrifices which a true policy of apartheid will demand, and that for selfish reasons they will continue to pour the investment capital available into the White areas of South Africa, even if it means a demand, which will be inescapable, for Black labour in the White areas of South Africa That is the problem the Prime Minister faces. That is the answer he must give us if we want to believe that he means to achieve something apart from the figment of political separation in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, apart from the fact that there was no favourable reaction in the world, to speak of. to this plan, it is also significant that there was no favourable reaction anywhere in South Africa from the Natives who have no vested interest in the government of separate areas. Not a single detribalized Native in South Africa had a word to say in favour of the plan. It was condemned. Is not the other weakness in the suggestion of the Prime Minister the fact that it ignores that more than half of the Native people of South Africa are not living in the Transkei, or in any other Bantu area? They are living in the White areas because we want them there and we need them there and we cannot dispense with them there. What is their future to be? Strange that the hon. the Prime Minister, very superficially <span class="col_575-576" refersTo="page_304"/>and I think very half-heartedly without perhaps realizing what he was doing, also had to come to the conclusion, that for them some federal device is necessary, because I see in the last issue of the <i>Cape Argus</i>&#x2014;I do not know whether it is completely official&#x2014;a publication of the proposed constitution for the Transkei, and there I see that the chiefs, that is to say the appointed members of the Transkeian legislative authority, will be far in the majority; there will be 27 elected by universal franchise; and then on a federal basis almost, there will be a fixed number of Natives in the Bantu Authority to represent the detribalized or urbanized Natives of the Transkei&#x2014;which is as near as the federal concept will find favour with the hon. the Prime Minister. But there is this difference that they will exercise their political rights in the Transkei where they have no interests whatsoever, except perhaps an interest to create agitation there, trying to use the forum and the platform of the Transkeian Legislative body in order to agitate for the amelioration of their lot here in the White area where their interests are and where their destiny lies.</p>

<p>The difficulty experienced by the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government is that they look upon themselves as the Government of a colonial power. That is the analogy that is at the root of their thinking: A White Government in South Africa which is the Government of a colonial power with a colonial problem, and that they can divest themselves of that problem by giving to the colonies self-government, on the precedent of Britain and France and Holland. But what they forget is that if they are a colonial power, they are the only colonial power in the world rooted in their own colonies. Because whether they like it or not, we White people are in South Africa and we have to live together with non-White people for all eternity.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, our problem, even if we establish these areas, will remain impossible because of the millions of Natives that will remain in the Republic of South Africa, and we shall find, Sir, that to get the goodwill of these independent Bantustans will probably be impossible as long as there is a feeling amongst the Africans living in South Africa that their own people are subject to injustices outside the reserves. Look at the problems Great Britain has at the moment! There is a country setting an example in the emancipation of its colonial peoples. But because it still shares part of the responsibilities of certain areas, like the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland their entire relationship with all the other territories is being bedevilled. The United Kingdom still has to seek a solution against the will of most White Rhodesians for the problems in Rhodesia because the problem of the Black people in that territory is affecting its relations with the Black people in other areas. How does the hon. the Prime Minister think he will escape that position? If he emancipates the Transkei and Zululand, and that is about all he could emancipate, the problem remains of the detribalized Natives working in our factories, in our industries, in our mines, on our farms. Does he think that he has found a solution for the problems as long as those people have not defined political rights which will assist them in the area where they have their being, where they live, where they earn their living? Sir, unless we symbolize the interdependence of the races in South Africa by accepting the fact that there will have to be a link between us at the top, in the same Parliament, we shall never find a solution&#x2014;not in South Africa, where we are so interdependent that separation has become finally impossible. If the hon. the Prime Minister would only realize that, if he would only accept this inescapable fact, he might still go down in history as the man who saved South Africa at a time of real crisis in its existence. But if he does not accept that, if he continues on the path he has embarked upon, we will find that he, or succeeding Prime Ministers will be in a South Africa surrounded by a number of small states who, although they should be our friends theoretically, will be in fact hostile to the Republic of South Africa. They will be hostile because firstly they will be poor, and they will constantly be reminded of their poverty by the contrast in the Republic of South Africa, where there will be wealth which their own people, represented in their own Parliament, will still as migrant labourers be helping to create for the Republic of South Africa. And, secondly, because in the nature of things they will be concerned about the fate of those workers outside their own areas, their own subjects, working in the White areas, but who according to the Nationalist Government will never, never enjoy any rights whatsoever in the Republic of South Africa. Thirdly, because they will, immediately they become independent, also become subject to influences which will be hostile to the Republic of South Africa, influences such as militant African nationalism to which the hon. the Prime Minister is giving special outlets in the future South Africa. There is the further danger that they will fall under the influence of the communist agitators of this world. I can remember when we debated the Bill for the Suppression of Communism in this House. I can remember that I gave several quotations from the speeches of Stalin and other communist leaders where they laid it down as one of the fundamental methods of Communism that Communism should seek to achieve its objects by exploiting the aspirations and the grievances of under-privileged people under colonial powers Under the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy, unless he puts the horse before the cart, and tackles the economic problems before the political problem, he will create the ideal situation for communist exploitation of the grievances and aspirations of the Natives in the Transkei and in the other Bantustans surrounding South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_577-578" refersTo="page_305"/>Mr. Speaker, the choice is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s. On the course he has set South Africa, he will be remembered in the history of South Africa&#x2014;if anything is remembered about South Africa&#x2014;as the man who liquidated the Republic which he helped to establish. Having established the Republic of South Africa, he forthwith set about destroying it for all time. And he will be remembered as the man who broke down and destroyed in South Africa the very principles, the very hopes upon which civilized Western living for the people of this country can be based.</p>

<p>Listening to the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), one thing emerged quite clearly, namely that as far as his speech is concerned he is not only opposed to all forms of apartheid, all forms of separation, all forms of differentiation because he condemns them all, but by implication we must also accept that quite the reverse is now the policy of his party. There is only one alternative. He does not talk about degrees now, but all attempts ever made by this Government to differentiate in any way are opposed by him, and by implication he now opposes the whole principle.</p>

<p>Then he goes further, and now his great argument is this, that the Transkeian Territory, which is now on its way towards self-government, cannot possibly obtain that self-rule because the Transkei has not developed far enough economically to be viable. Therefore we cannot give it to the Transkei now. Now I want to put this question to him: What about the 25 countries in Africa which have received their independence within the last three or four years? How many of them are economically viable or independent? But that has never been regarded as a reason for not giving them self-rule. If Britain does it, then it is perfectly all right. I want to ask the hon. member what the position of Basutoland is? Is Basutoland more economically viable than the Transkei? What is the position of Bechuanaland? What is the position of Togoland and of the Cameroons? So one can mention them one after another.</p>

<p>More than that hon. member knows, and in any case I know as much about Basutoland as he does. But the hon. member for Yeoville has said that we are dealing with a serious problem here; the most serious problem of the hon. member for South Coast is whether he should march again. Practically none of the African States which have obtained their political freedom, and complete political freedom, with a few exceptions, are economically self-supporting or viable. All of them must receive assistance from outside. But in regard to all those countries which gave them their freedom, not a single one paused to say. We cannot give it to them because economically they are not yet strong enough. They were given their political self-government, and thereafter attempts have to be made to make these countries economically independent.</p>

<p>In Africa, and here in the Republic of South Africa, there are only two alternatives, and we must choose one of those alternatives. It is whether we are eventually to have either a White government or a Black government. History has proved that a mixed government is impossible. It is not necessary to go into the reasons for that. History has proved it. The French tried to have a mixed government in Indo-China, the British tried it in India and Ceylon, and the Hollanders tried it in the East. But we need not go so far afield. We need only look beyond our own borders to see what has happened in Africa, in Ghana, and in Nigeria. Now it will perhaps be said that these were predominantly Black countries, or completely Black. But that was not the case in Kenya and in Tanganyika, and it is not the case in Rhodesia, and we already see the direction in which those countries have gone or are going, and it is evident that government by Black and by White are irreconcileable. One must choose one or the other, and South Africa will have to choose one or the other, whether it should have a Black or a White government. But we shall never have a mixed government here, because history has shown us that it cannot be done in Africa. It simply does not work.</p>

<p>What is now the alternative suggested by the Opposition? Their alternative is something about which they have had a lot to say&#x2014;White leadership.</p>

<p>White leadership with justice, and to that is now coupled partnership. I do not know whether they themselves still believe in White leadership. History in the rest of Africa and in the East has proved that these people do not want White leadership. They themselves want to be the leaders in those countries. If one now looks at partnership, which they suggest, &#x201C;partnership with White leadership&#x201D;, what do we find? They want to give the Bantu in our areas a say in the government of the country. They want to give them representation in our Parliament. Is their idea acceptable to the non-Whites? Is it acceptable to them to be the junior partner, whereas numerically they are the majority shareholder? That is not acceptable to them. It was not acceptable to the rest of Africa. Was it acceptable in Kenya? Is it acceptable in Rhodesia? No. It is not so much that they want partnership with the non-Whites. What the Opposition is really looking for is a sort of appeasement, a concession, and by means of that concession we are supposed to get peace. A policy of appeasement! A policy whereby every time the wolves come too near to the sled, one of the horses is cut <span class="col_579-580" refersTo="page_306"/>loose and given to the wolves in order to satisfy them.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not the horse, it is the concession of giving them representation in this House. That is the horse. That is the first horse given to them, the nine representatives suggested by the Opposition, and with <i>every</i> concession one makes, one weakens oneself and strengthens one&#x2019;s opponent. That is the policy of the Opposition. They concede the principle, and once having conceded the principle, the conflict is no longer over the principle but only in terms of numbers, and then it will be impossible for the Whites to say, as they suggest: We give you a certain number of members and limit you to that number, and that number will never be increased. You can no longer do so because you have now conceded the principle. Now the conflict will no longer be over the principle of non-White representation in this House, but only over the numbers of non-Whites, and where you have conceded the principle that they can rule together with us, pressure will be exerted upon us to make more and more concessions. The policy of making concessions is a slippery road, and having once embarked on that road one finds that it becomes increasingly slippery, and every concession one makes weakens one&#x2019;s position and strengthens that of the people to whom one is making the concession and their demands become increasingly greater. Do. hon. members want to tell us that the Bantu in the Republic of South Africa will be satisfied with the proposal of the Opposition to give them nine representatives? Of course not. They will say: We have broken down the dam wall, we have broken down the principle, and the principle has now been recognized that we should have representation in this House. And then they will make more and more demands because their position has already been strengthened, and further concessions will increasingly have to be made. I visited Kenya in 1950 and hten the British officials and the White Members of Parliament told us with great self-satisfaction that there were now four non-White Members of Parliament, two Natives, one Indian and one Arab, and then they said that the non-Whites in Kenya would now be satisfied. They said that they would retain White leadership and work in partnership with them, because their legitimate claims had been complied with&#x2014;White leadership with justice. That was ten years ago, and when that break-through had been made there were demands for increasingly more non-White representation in that Parliament because they said that if the principle was correct that they should have representation, then they should have representation in proportion to their numbers. And in ten years&#x2019; time the Government of Kenya changed from a White government to a Black government after that principle had been conceded. Now the Opposition wants to concede that principle; they want to give representation to the Bantu in this Parliament, and once that principle is conceded the conflict will just be in regard to numbers, and the demands of the non-Whites will become irresistible and nobody will be able to withstand them. The only solution is that South Africa should be divided in such a way that on the one side we will have parts of South Africa which are governed by the Whites, and on the other side parts governed by the Blacks. One cannot let them govern together. It is no use saying we can. Then it becomes a parrot-cry. Then one shuts one&#x2019;s eyes to what is happening in the rest of Africa. If one scrutinizes it carefully, one sees how impossible it is to have partnership and joint government. If this concession is made in South Africa, the road we will follow will be precisely the same road followed by the White man in Kenya and which he is now following in Northern Rhodesia and other parts of Africa. The United Party knows it but have not the courage to admit it. They know that the concessions they propose to make must inevitably bring us to that road. There is no other possibility. The only alternative by which the White man can maintain his position in South Africa in future is to do what this Government is doing, namely to say that in certain areas the Black man can govern alone, but in the rest of South Africa the White man will rule and rule alone. They cannot rule together. Once one begins to make concessions one has to make them increasingly. The only way is to have separation and to do so now whilst there is still time to do it. and to try to implement it honestly, and not to make speeches here which incite the rest of the world against South Africa, the type of speech which to-morrow will be quoted against South Africa at UN. They know that we shall have to follow to the end the course we have now adopted: we cannot turn back. All the fuss made by them will not assist in taking South Africa back along that road again. We have now chosen that road once and for all. There is only one way in which South Africa can be forced from the standpoint it has now adopted, not by the present Opposition, because if they come into power to-morrow they will have to continue carrying out the policy we have now laid down; but the only way in which it can be done is through military intervention from outside. There are people who want to do that. Speeches like the one the hon. member has just made encourage those people who want to persuade other countries to use military force against South Africa. Therefore I say that the speech made by the hon. member is a speech made in a lost cause in so far as politics in South Africa is concerned. But in his lost cause he is prepared, just like Hitler, to see the whole country destroyed because he cannot get his own way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there was a time when the hon. the Minister of Lands was a disciple of the late Dr. Malan, Dr. Malan who said at one time when he was talking <span class="col_581-582" refersTo="page_307"/>to the Canadian Prime Minister, I think, that the future of the Native in South Africa would lie in the development of the reserves on certain lines and end up probably on a federal basis. In those days, Sir, we looked upon the hon. the Minister of Lands as a chip of the old block. I regret to say that he seems to have chipped off the old block completely and he is now simply a chip of the granite wall and he repeated in this House this afternoon the fundamental mistake which is made by the Nationalist Party every day. There is only one alternative to Government policy, according to hon. members on the Government benches, and that is &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. That is what is being drummed into the voters of this country. Not so long ago the Minister of Lands vaguely had other ideas but they did not last very long and he is now one of the most outspoken exponents or apostles of this idea that it is either &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; or else the policy of the present Prime Minister. I think not only is he wrong there, but he is also wrong in quoting so many other parts of the world as proving that close co-operation between White and non-White is impossible. I think the fallacy of his argument lies in the fact that in every case that he quoted, the objection on the part of the non-Whites was not so much to co-operate with the Whites as to co-operate with the foreigners. In other words, the controlling power was a foreign power and that basically was their objection to co-operating with them. Here the position is different, Mr. Speaker. The Native does not look upon us as a foreign power&#x2014;not yet anyway; he may in a few years in the Transkei, but for the present moment he does not. He regards us as part and parcel of southern Africa. And I do not concede for one moment that close co-operation between White and Black is impossible, quite apart from being desirable. A few years ago in discussing the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s report, the hon. the Minister of Finance remarked that we must try apartheid and that if it did not work we could try something else. He cannot say that to-day, Sir. The Minister of Lands has trumpeted out the fact that there was no turning back from the path on which South Africa has been set by this Government. Because in his opinion there is no turning back everyone of us is supposed to toe the line and fall in behind the Government and say &#x201C;what a marvellous scheme this is&#x201D;. We cannot accept that and we won&#x2019;t accept it.</p>

<p>Before I go on to support this amendment I should just like to say a word to the Minister of Finance. As my hon. friend said this is primarily intended to be a financial debate and I think that is the reason why this amendment is justified. The hon. the Minister of Finance made one or two interesting points in his statement but he failed to make one or two other points in which we would have been still more interested. He told us that the time had now arrived to reduce the short-term foreign loan position abroad. We are very glad to hear that. We have been pointing out for years that short-term borrowing for long-term financing is not desirable if it can be avoided. The hon. the Minister said that the time had come to reduce some of the short-term borrowings &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have never done so. The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) is quite wrong. I never did that. Short-term borrowing overseas, carried to excess, is unsound. Whereas it is true that we have repaid R27,500,000 to the International Monetary Fund, we must remember that half of that represents the loans from the German and Italian banks. So the position is not quite as good as it appears on the face of it, but we are glad to see that it has been repaid all the same. The hon. the Minister also referred to his proposal to manufacture a few two-rand gold pieces for export. I am not quite clear what there is to be gained by minting a smaller or larger number of two-rand gold pieces, except as collectors&#x2019; pieces of course. I speak subject to correction, of course, and I shall be glad if the Minister, when he replies, would elaborate a little further because if the experiment is a success&#x2014;and I do not know what he will regard as a success&#x2014;he said he might expand it. I should like to know what the advantage is to be gained from minting two-rand gold pieces and shipping them abroad as compared with shipping gold in bar form. And, Sir, if we were capable of doing that and if we could afford to do that for other countries, would the Minister consider starting at home? If we are going to set an example to the rest of the world as to some advantage of gold coinage, I would suggest that the place to start would be South Africa. I am sure we will all rejoice seeing a golden coin again which we can carry about instead of these horrible notes with which we have been loaded for so many years.</p>

<p>One point that the hon. the Minister did not refer to is this. He referred to the satisfactory way in which our foreign reserves had risen from R142,000,000 to R314,000,000 and I think it is reasonable to suppose that the position will continue to improve. But what we want to know is how long has the country got to remain in the strait-jacket to allow the exchange reserves to go on increasing. At what stage is the Minister going to let up on the capital restrictions and on import control? Because, of course, we have reached the position through taking the most drastic measures last year, as the Minister himself said. We have actually for the past eight months been living on a siege economy with the greatest restrictions on our financial transactions. Nobody, certainly not the hon. the Minister, would like to have that position from <span class="col_583-584" refersTo="page_308"/>choice. With the improvement that has taken place and is taking place, I think the time is very near when the hon. the Minister should give us some indication as to how he can start relaxing these controls which quite obviously when they are relaxed, will have to be relaxed with the greatest care and with great prudence because there is a heaped-up log of import requirements and there is also a heaped-up log of selling orders which, the moment he relaxes these restrictions, will tend to be put into force. I can see that the Minister has a problem therefore, but at the same time it is one which he will have to face in the near future, the problem of relaxing these controls in order to bring us back to normal once again in our currency arrangements and in our import arrangements as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has moved an amendment. I have hopes that the present member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) will get to his feet and support the hon. member for Yeoville before this debate is over.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>Do I look that sort of man?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>No perhaps the hon. member does not look that kind of man. But I think any member of normal intelligence will have been impressed by the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville and I am not without hope that he may get support from the other side of the House, if not to-day, then in time to come. Sir, this amendment is opportune because the financial aspect of it is so important. There is no more important aspect in my opinion of this colonial development policy than the financial one. The hon. Minister of Lands referred to Basutoland but it is quite clear from the statements that have been made, that the relationship between the Transkei and the State President is going to be exactly the same as the relationship between the Queen and the High Commission Territories. In other words, if that is not colonialism, I just do not know what is. So we are not exaggerating when we say that this is a colonial development policy of the Prime Minister. It is important, Sir, to discuss this question because we have so often appealed to the hon. the Minister of Finance in recent years for some light, some information, some indication as to where the financial implications of the Government&#x2019;s Bantustan policy were going to lead us. We have appealed in vain. He has either ignored our appeals or fobbed them off. He reminds me, Sir, of an ex-colleague of ours in Parliament who was asked one day why he did not make sure of his facts before he talked. The gentleman said &#x201C;What, spoil a good story by worrying about the facts! Not bloody likely&#x201D;. He was quoting Bernard Shaw, Mr. Speaker. The hon. the Minister obviously did not want to spoil the good story which the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Development had worked out. But surely at this stage the Minister of Finance should be in a position to give us some indication of what is involved in this plan. Our amendment talks about the &#x201C;liquidation of the Republic&#x201D;. And that is a very serious charge to make. &#x201C;Liquidation&#x201D; means the disposal of your assets, going out of business, getting rid of your assets, movable or immovable. The point is that this Government, the Prime Minister in particular, is not threatening to liquidate his own assets or to go out of business on his own&#x2014;if he were doing that, of course, he would have had the full support of this side of the House&#x2014;but it is the people&#x2019;s assets that he is threatening to liquidate. The Republic inherited from the Union a going concern, a well-knit unit, on which we have built for 50/60 years a growing, sound, strong economy. And in the plans produced by the Prime Minister that unit is to be destroyed. The Government&#x2019;s primary object is to train Africans in civilized ways, to help the African to develop the land that has been reserved for him in every way. That is the immediate task of which everybody in this House approves, Sir. We all approve of it. But as to how it is to be done, there we differ and we differ quite fundamentally; and as far as I can see, irreconcilably. These immediate political proposals that we have had before us for the last week or two, affect the Transkei immediately. But if you want to take an objective view of the position, you must take the whole scheme into consideration because very heavy expenditure is going to be incurred in other parts of the country concurrently with what is envisaged as far as the Transkei is concerned. The Government&#x2019;s plan involves, as we know, the creation of certain independent Bantu states which are to be financed from capital account and from current account too, largely by the White taxpayer. If you look at it objectively it is a colossal task bearing in mind and having regard to the means that are at our disposal. The other day the Minister of Finance talked about the possibility of obtaining a loan from the I.D.A. Whatever much he gets from the I.D.A. or anybody else, it is the White taxpayer who will have to repay it. So it does not seem to me that it matters very much where he gets the money, because it does not matter whom we have to repay, it has to be repaid. Especially since this Government is specifically excluding private capital and private enterprise from these reserves and particularly when you realize that what is envisaged so far is a socialized state, a State-owned State, run by a large bureaucracy. The statements that have been made as to the draft constitution and the set-up which is envisaged, have shocked me, Sir, from the point of view of the enormous number of staff which is clearly envisaged that will be required to run it. Indeed, a very large proportion of the cost of this particular plan will be devoted to paying public servants in large numbers, Black and White, those public servants who will be trying to put this plan into force. But, of course, that is something which you always find when you <span class="col_585-586" refersTo="page_309"/>start dabbling in state socialism to any extent. The Government is proposing a five-year capital expenditure of R114,000,000, of which the Transkei and the Ciskei will only get, I think, R24,000,000 or a little more. The question is what is that going to achieve in a country like the Transkei over five years bearing in mind, as my hon. friend said, that the majority of that money is going to be spent on housing? The hon. the Minister, when he interjected the other day, talked about the building of roads. As I read his figures, his revised figures, he proposes to build 2.671 miles of road at a cost of some R1,200 per mile. I do not know how you can build a road at that cost, unless you build it with slave labour, which is quite possible of course, but even then &#x2026;</p>

<p>I hope I shall never sink so low as to have to travel on a road that cost R1,200 per mile to build. I only mentioned it to indicate the necessity for the hon. the Minister of Finance to have the most careful scrutiny at these estimates that have been put up with great enthusiasm, with great sincerity by these Government Departments. He has got to find the money for this five-year capital plan just for the capital items mentioned in the scheme by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. He has also got to find annual subsidies. The hon. the Prime Minister talked about a million or two for the Transkei, but do not forget there are six or seven other territories that will also require subsidies as they get a little further along, to the same extent presumably. We are going to pay the cost of the whole public service of the Transkei according to reports which I gather are official, including education, for the present time until the resources of the Transkei can be established. I think we can establish pretty well what they are at the present moment, Mr. Speaker. In fact it means that for an indefinite period we are going to have to pay, in addition to the capital expenditure, in addition to the annual subsidies, the cost of the whole of the Public Service. I should like to know who is going to decide on the size of that Public Service? There is going to be a Public Service Commission, presumably of Black and White combined, or else Black with a White adviser. I think it is a very dangerous undertaking on the part of the Minister of Finance to say that he is prepared to foot the bill for the Public Service of the Transkei for an indefinite period without having made a very close investigation as to what it is going to involve, we know what our own Public Service costs us to-day compared with ten or 20 years ago.</p>

<p>I did not suggest slave labour. I said that I did not see how they could build roads for R1,200 a mile unless they used slave labour. However, I seem to be getting support from the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). I thought I might before long. In addition to these costs, Sir, we have the cost of the present Bantu departments, the hon. Minister for Bantu Administration and Development and the Minister of Bantu Education. In addition we have the costs of the Native Trust and of the land which is still to be bought and we have had no estimates before us as to what all this is going to cost the White taxpayer of this country. So, Sir, in addition to this vast and unknown cost, this leap in the dark, this step which according to the Minister of Lands, is going to ensure the future of South Africa, what assets are going to be disposed of in dividing up the country in pursuit of this plan? In the first place large portions of territory, of course, most valuable and capable of enormous development, if they are developed in the right way and if the right people are given an opportunity to take part in that development. Large sums of capital will be involved, the spending of which will be controlled in due course by foreign governments&#x2014;not by this House. There will be control of our labour supply. Mr. Speaker how can anybody contemplate the control of our labour supply falling into the hands of foreign governments? It just beats me that anybody can think of such a thing, but that is what is going to happen. Also in this liquidation we will dispose of a great asset, namely our strategic position; the advantage of having one country to defend. The question will arise whether it will be possible to defend the South African Republic? Because if you are going to have a Department of Defence and a Minister of Defence you must postulate that it is possible or conceivable that the defence forces of this country will be required for defence purposes. That being so, when you think of the enormous land boundaries that we are going to create for ourselves it seems that we are sacrificing a comparatively strong defensive position by undertaking this carving up of the country and we are sacrificing a very precious asset. You have this further point, of course, Sir: Will the non-White majority who will still be living in the Republic not become Fifth Columnists acting on behalf of foreign countries on our borders? Goodwill is another asset which is largely being sacrificed already of course and as long as this Government maintains the line that the <span class="col_587-588" refersTo="page_310"/>non-Whites in the Republic are not going to have political rights in any circumstances, that goodwill will never be restored to us.</p>

<p>We are being called upon to dispose of vital assets of our country, and the question arises what is there to put on the credit side? Having done all this, where shall we be? Surely, Sir, we shall simply be a smaller multi-racial country with the non-White majority in it, denuded of priceless assets which we are being asked to hand over in pursuit of the Government&#x2019;s policy, faced with precisely the same problems that we have now in regard to race relations, problems that will be infinitely accentuated by having these new states on our borders, states that will inevitably fight for further rights for the non-Whites inside the Republic. They must; and nothing will stop them. If you look at the position in which we are in to-day, Sir, if you look at the problems which we are facing, if you look at the proposals which the Government puts forward, you must come to the conclusion that the schemes of the Government, all this grandiose scheming, all this elaborate window-dressing for overseas consumption, are no solution at all. If they did offer a solution, if they did offer a smaller White South Africa, if they did offer the resumption of normal relations with the rest of the world, if they did offer the White man in South Africa a secure, prosperous and happy future, there would be a great deal to be said for them. But, Sir, as they stand to-day before us&#x2014;and of course the great danger is that once you start off on this path goodness knows where it is going to lead you and how difficult it will be to retract&#x2014;I am afraid there is nothing to be said for them. When you look at the position to-day, the solution which the Government is offering, and you realize that, having carried out all their plans, and having made all the sacrifices that the country is asked to make, and having faced all the problems which will arise, the exact position we are in to-day will be facing us still, and nothing will have been solved. That being so, I believe this amendment is thoroughly justified, and I have pleasure in supporting it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia has excelled himself to-day. In this House he is one of the people who always poses as a great South African, but, in fact, he is the leader of the fifth column in this country.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, but he creates the impression that there is a fifth column in this country, and he lends a semblance of truth to that impression by the speech he has just made. I say that for this reason. He creates the impression that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is prepared to use slave labour whilst making roads. I ask whether he is not ashamed of himself, because he knows, and we know, and we know he knows, that those words of his will still be quoted to-day at UN by our enemies, by Ethiopia, Liberia and Ghana, who would like to hear those things to say them also; and why does he say it? He says it just because he has a terrific hatred for the National Party and the course it is now adopting, because he now sees that the bottom is falling out of the United Party. That has been evident to us for a long time, because we know the United Party has just existed as an anti-Republican party, and now that they can no longer do so, he starts this type of agitation in order to keep it going in that way. We, on this side, will remember it, and we shall tell the people outside that the hon. member for Constantia said that this party was prepared to make use of slave labour in the Transkei.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>He did not say so.</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>He did. He said: &#x201C;I can quite imagine that he will do so.&#x201D; I heard it clearly, and my ears did not deceive me. Those words of the hon. member for Constantia will echo right throughout South Africa for a long time to come. To think that we. on this side, who have done nothing else for the Black people than to try to uplift them and to put them on the road to civilization with the assistance of what they have and what we can give them&#x2014;to think that he should come here in this the greatest forum in the country, and that he should tell the world that this is what we have done, is a scandal, whilst he is one of the White people who are supposed to have assisted in doing so.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member accused the hon. the Minister of Lands of having changed his ideas and his basis every time&#x2014;he shifts his ground. But the hon. member for Constantia is the last one to do so. You will remember, Sir, that at that conference in Bloemfontein there were a number of progressives who objected to the motion moved by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that they should purchase no more land for the Bantu, and the men who issued the statement included the hon. member for Constantia, who was the leader of that group. He was the senior man to have drafted that objection, but what did he do? He shifted his ground. He abandoned his friends and left the then hon. member for Maitland and other hon. members in the lurch. But now he says that the Minister of Lands is inconsistent and changes his point of view every time.</p>

<p>I am rather sorry for the hon. member for Constantia. He tried to remedy a bad case good, but only succeeded in making it still worse. If only he had confined himself to finances, I would have liked to reply to him, but when I see how half-heartedly and with how much hesitation he tried to discuss finances, I just want to say two things.</p>

<p><span class="col_589-590" refersTo="page_311"/>If we borrow money abroad, whether it is a short-term or long-term loan, it depends on the effective rate of interest whether it is economic or not. If the hon. member says that the rate of interest is too high, we can argue about it. If he argues that import control should be lifted and that the Minister of Finance should consider doing so, we can discuss it on its merits. But I want to do what he has done. I do not want to discuss finances. I want to discuss this matter of the Transkei. In any case it is something near to the hearts of all of us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia, and also the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) make the most extravagant statements. They talk about liquidating the Republic and handing over the whole Government to the Black people there. He frightens us with many predictions of what will happen. He is the modern Cassandra in this country. He asks what assets will be divided.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, is he not being rather precipitate? Would it not be better for him to pose those questions when we come to deal with those points? Would it not be better and more fruitful for him to ask whether this thing can work or not? You will have noted that the Opposition, both in the motion of censure and again to-day, are not discussing the merits of the Government&#x2019;s plan, but simply say it will not work, and then they recount all kinds of impossible evils which will befall us. Why should we not face the facts? I also want to tell him that we will not spoil a good story by failing to have regard to the facts. But that is what the United Party does. They are making a bad story still worse by not facing the facts.</p>

<p>What are the facts? The facts are these, and I do not think anyone will quarrel with this. The hon. members for Yeoville and Constantia also said so. The facts are that we are all concerned about the future of South Africa in the light of modern world opinion and the demands made of us by our own people and by people abroad; and when I say &#x201C;our own people&#x201D;, I mean everybody living in this country. The basic problem which we all recognize is to find a system of government which will give us order, peace and good government, for those of us who are Whites, as well as those who are not. When I speak about the non-Whites I mean the Brown people, the Yellow people and the Blacks. The hon. member for Constantia knows that this is the crucial problem, but he avoids it during his entire speech. I would like to know to whom he proposes to leave it. But when we have that particular problem and we can solve it in such a way that we have order and peace and good government, we can have every confidence that the outside world will assist us to solve our problems by providing the finances and the help. We should not try first to obtain the finance and then think that we can buy peace and order and good Government. Order comes from within, from the people themselves, and not from without. If they think that we intend buying it in such a manner, they should not think that we are like the United Party which continually puts the cart before the horse. Mr. Speaker, forgive me for again stressing the obvious, namely that we have four types of people in one political entity, and that we must ensure peace, order and good government.</p>

<p>But those four types of people are not all the same. They are of different races. They have different standards of value and their behaviour is conditioned by their values. When we put them all together in one Parliament, it means that, in the usual way that a Parliament functions, we will have to argue with people and convince people who have no common ground with us. We shall have to try to get agreement between the various cultures which cannot and have no wish to mingle, and even when perhaps they can mingle, they do so only with the greatest difficulty I am referring to ourselves and to the Coloureds.</p>

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Constantia and remembering the debates we had in the past, I agree with the hon. the Minister of Lands who said that there are only two courses. We must either have a mixture or races in this House, or else we must arrange things in such a way that there is no mixture. The Minister of Lands said that there were good reasons why a mixed Parliament would not work. He said he did not want to discuss those reasons, but I think it is very necessary for us to do so, because I think the public and the country ought to know why we are adopting this course; and if our thinking is right in principle and we act accordingly there can also be nothing wrong with the result, taking into consideration the variations in human reactions. If we should go in the direction of having a multi-racial Parliament such as the United Party eventually envisages and the Progressive Party envisages in the near future, we would be steering towards a revolution because the conditions requisite for the proper functioning of Parliament as we know it will be absent. I want to state those conditions here because they are important, because if the conditions requisite for the success of that Parliament are not present it simply means that this Parliament <i>qua</i> Parliament cannot function, and I think it is necessary that we should face these facts.</p>

<p>I want to put the first condition to the hon. member for Constantia and I hope he will ponder and digest it. The first is that there must be a particular link, a particular unity, between those who are ruled and those who rule. This link or unity must be based on a similarity of outlook and interests, in a common belief in those things which are important. That is the first requirement. I cannot put it better than a British statesman did. He said that for a Parliament to function properly and successfully, &#x201C;there must be that kind of unity which allows the people or the Members of Parliament to bicker&#x201D;. There must be such unity that people can differ with <span class="col_591-592" refersTo="page_312"/>impunity. That means that one can argue about various points of view, but at the back of one&#x2019;s mind one knows that there is a fundamental factor which will not allow one of the disputing parties to go so far as to upset the apple-cart and cause an irrevocable break. We have had it in this Parliament. We have had here both Afrikaans and English-speaking people, and sometimes we have argued I am sorry the hon. member for South Coast is not here now, but since I have been in this House I have seen him at least five times mentally packing his bags and leaving the country. We still know how we wanted to march and how he wanted Natal to split off, and there are many people like him, but it never happened, and it speaks volumes for their community of outlook with us and their common interests with us and the set of values we have in common. Because they did not endanger the Union; they merely threatened to do so. I can go into this matter still more deeply, but I will leave it to history to explain it. The first prerequisite is that there must be an inherent unity of conviction and of values and interests. That is the simple truth. The community sticks together because it knows that there are always other interests more vital than the one about which it is quarrelling. When we look at South Africa we find that this unity does not exist. It so happens that we have been thrown to-together in this political unit, but we are not the same people. The Whites themselves are not homogeneous. The Blacks are homogeneous only as far as their colour is concerned. Then we still have the Indians. We often think they are homogeneous, but they are a group speaking five languages. The Coloureds speak two languages. And then there are the values. Let us be under no delusions. We know that we have one set of values, but we also know that our non-White citizens&#x2014;and here I refer to all three of the other groups&#x2014;do not have the same set of values. I do not want to be misunderstood. I say we do not subscribe to the same values. I do not want it to sound complicated. If we just look at the precepts existing for the Whites in regard to how they should treat their women, and what disapproval is expressed by the White community if one of us disobeys those precepts, and compare it with the precepts existing for the Bantu in regard to how he should treat his women, then I do not want to say that he treats them badly or well, but he treats them different, in terms of his convictions. If we treat our women like the Bantu treats his we will be blamed.</p>

<p>I can mention something more personal. I can mention the way in which the White people treat their possessions, their immovable property. Just consider the way in which we Whites care for our property. I am not thinking of the soil, but of an urban property. Remember what Sophiatown looked like whilst it was in the hands of people who had other ideas. They did not mind renting a small space the size of a blanket every night to somebody who wanted to sleep there. That was their way of life. If we look at other parts of Africa we find precisely the same thing. It is a question of values. I could expatiate on this point further, but I think I have illustrated what I mean.</p>

<p>The second prerequisite for the proper functioning of a Parliament is that Parliament should have a certain background. In that state there should be a sort of equality between the people who are governed, equality in the sense that they should be able to compete with each other in the open market, in life. If I may put it even more simply for the benefit of the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), I want to say that there should be such a state of affairs that m theory there is equality between the people who compete in the open market. If in respect of this prerequisite we look at what exists in our own country, we find that we have many under-privileged people. If we were to allow them to compete in the open market we shall have a large, poor group who are not able to do so. We see that every day. Some of our Bantu who have risen in the world and who have attended university tried to compete in this community, and just see what deadly competition they had from the Whites. We find under-developed people who are not able to compete in the free market. I say that a Parliament can only function properly when one has the situation in the country that the people living there can freely compete with each other in the open market for the benefits which are available, more or less on an equal footing. We know that this is impossible, because the development is lacking, and also the economic status of these people. It just so happens that this is the position, but it is a fact which we should face, and which the Opposition refuses to face.</p>

<p>The third prerequisite for the proper functioning of a Parliament is that the political activities should centre around the individual. He must be the pivot, his person and his interests, around which the whole Government revolves. If you want a big word for it, it must be an atomistic community. These are the only three prerequisites for the proper functioning of a Parliament, and where they were lacking such a Parliament has always failed. As soon as the individual and his interests are no longer the axis around which Government turns, other elements come to the fore, and if that element happens to be one of race, the whole State is built on sand, because other considerations come into play when any matter is being argued. In this country to a large extent we have that very situation. We have various racial groups and if we allow them to send their representatives to Parliament, as is evidently being suggested, we will find that in that Parliament the members of this racial group will stand together, and every measure under discussion will be judged in the light not of how it will affect the individual and his interests, but how it will affect the racial group. When that happens it means that the racial group, because blood is thicker than water, judges this measure in the <span class="col_593-594" refersTo="page_313"/>light of how it will affect that group. Then questions of self-preservation come to the fore, and when that happens it is the only thing which counts, and it is for that group itself to decide what is important and what is not. In such a situation we simply cannot think that we will ever have a successful multi-racial Parliament, because we do not have the unity necessary for it; we do not have that all-embracing community of interests, and what we have is really the racial groups which do not become parliamentary parties but racial parties.</p>

<p>We have had this in this Parliament. Although we all have the same culture and we all belong to the same race, the language groups crystallized out, and there was a time when they said that the National Party was the party for the Afrikaners, and from this side we said that the United Party was just the party for the English-speaking people. But because we have greater common interests and the same traditions and history, we did succeed in making reasonable progress, even though it was in fits and starts. But when there are other additional elements it will be quite a different matter. Therefore the National Party puts it this way: Let there be parts of the country ruled by the Black people. Then at least there will be a certain homogeneity, and we will at least have the prerequisite which is necessary for that area to develop peace, order and good government for itself. Whether this is done by the Blacks or by the Whites makes no difference, as long as one has peace, order and good government. It is on this point that I should like to see the Opposition meeting us, but what do they do? They revile us for being nothing else but colonialists, and what proof do they adduce for it? The proof they adduce is that the State President will, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Bantu Government, be in precisely the same position as the Queen was <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Union when it was still a colony.</p>

<p>The hon. member was not here when the hon. member for Constantia spoke, or if he was he must have been asleep. The advantage of the Government&#x2019;s plan is that it will protect also the hon. member for Yeoville and our English-speaking friends because they also happen to be White.</p>

<p>I do not know whether they really know what their position is in this country. If I were English-speaking, the future would cause met great concern, not because the National Party or the Afrikaners will oppress them, but just because the numbers are what they are. I do not know whether the Opposition realizes that when we count the Afrikaans-speaking people in the country&#x2014;and then I include the Coloureds, because they speak Afrikaans&#x2014;20 per cent of the population is Afrikaans-speaking. But does the hon. member for Yeoville know what the next biggest group is? Not the English-speaking people. The Xhosas are the next language group, with 19.6 per cent. The Afrikaans language group is the largest, and then come the Xhosas, and does the hon. member for Yeoville know what is the next biggest group? Then come the Zulu group with 17 per cent, and only then the English-speaking group. They comprise only 9 per cent of the total population, and then I include the English-speaking Coloureds and Bantu also in that group. When analysing the home language statistics and counting the people whose home language is English, White, Black, Brown and Yellow, they constitute only 9 per cent of the population. Therefore they have an opportunity in this way to survive, because the Afrikaans-speaking group grants them all the equality they want.</p>

<p>But there is still another significant fact. We know that a mixture such as suggested by the Progressive Party and the United Party will be a failure, and therefore we want to avoid it. If we avoid it in the way proposed by us, we have one great advantage which the hon. member for Yeoville has never considered yet, because he is in any case backward in his thinking. I will tell hon. members what we will have. We will have a more spontaneous obedience to the law, because the rules made then will be made by that group for itself, and not by one group for another group.</p>

<p>It is one of the inherent defects in the South African set-up that the White group makes the laws for the Black group, and the Black group and the Yellow group and the Brown group must simply conform, whether they want to or not. But when we arrange matters so that they do it for themselves, it is obvious that there will be a more spontaneous regard for the law.</p>

<p>There is another thing also. In this House we had group representation of Natives. That was something evolved by our former statesmen with the best will in the world and probably with the greatest good faith. But there has never been a greater failure than this type of representation for Natives. Why? Because the responsibility for government could never in this situation have landed on their shoulders. And that is my great objection to the federation plan of hon. members opposite. They simply will not be able to place the responsibility where it belongs. What is the result of that? One of the Natives&#x2019; representatives could make all kinds of promises here. She could promise that the ewes would all have triplets this year and she would never have to implement that promise. She could promise that the cows would grow golden horns in a certain year, without giving effect to it. One can make the wildest statements, but one will never be given the responsibility of making them facts. If we have a situation where the Whites will always set the pace, whether in terms of a policy of apartheid or in terms of the policy of leadership with differentiation and justice, we cannot carry on unless we place the responsibility on the person who makes wild statements to do what he says. That is essential. We see no chance of doing <span class="col_595-596" refersTo="page_314"/>it here because we know that if we place the responsibility in the hands of the non-Whites, within a very short time there will be nothing left for the Whites, and then we will be in the same position, that as a minority group we will become nothing else but a group of agitators. But when we draw the line, as the hon. the Prime Minister now suggests, we place the responsibility where it ought to be, and if the hon. member for Yeoville now starts ridiculing how great this responsibility will be and what its scope will be, he must just continue to do so, but the point is that we shall give as much as it is possible for them to accept at the time. That is the crucial point. The crucial point is not the goodwill or the capital of this country, but the capacity of the non-Whites of the Transkei to make use of the opportunities we provide for them.</p>

<p>I now come to another point and I would like hon. members opposite to reply to it. When we come to the administration of justice, what difficulties have we there? We are being reviled for applying our &#x201C;White man&#x2019;s justice&#x201D;. If one reads the overseas newspapers, one sees that the Opposition is being quoted as the people who want to create the impression that the White man&#x2019;s justice is being applied in South Africa. In a certain sense that is correct; it is correct. It is true that is so because it is the White policeman who arrests the criminal, it is a White prosecutor who prosecutes him, it is a White magistrate or Judge who tries the case and gives judgment, and it is a White constable who takes the prisoner back to the cells and it is a White warder who receives him, and the prison in which he serves his sentence is under White management. The White man is treated the same way.</p>

<p>But when we have such a situation I can well imagine the people who fall under it having objections to it, and if I were to say that this is the White man&#x2019;s justice it can be objected to. But when we have the situation, as we will now have in the Transkei, where it is a Black man who arrests the criminal, a Black man who prosecutes him and a Black man who sentences him and a Black man who looks after him when he serves his sentence, that reproach cannot be made.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville always reminds me of a mad bee in a reed, because he makes his own &#x201C;zoom-zoom-zoom&#x201D;. I should very much like to reply to that question when one day the point arises, and I am quite prepared to reply to it, but I do not intend allowing myself to be diverted. The administration of justice will be put in a much better perspective and there will be much more appreciation on the part of the people who must live under it and for whom it is designed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) was very concerned about the finances. This is again an instance where he makes a certain prognosis, a certain prediction, as to what will happen, and then he says, &#x201C;Oh, but that will be wrong&#x201D;, and then he wants to know what we are going to do. Let us first hear what the people of the Transkei want; let us first find out how much they think they can cope with. I would be the last person to ignore the defects in connection with this very point, but I can give the hon. member a point about which he has not thought yet. It is an inherent defect in any system of government if the people who spend the money do not find it for themselves. We are compelled to face that problem. But remember that it will not be a constitutional relationship but an international relationship which we will have. If they are afraid that the Transkei will become an independent state, well, we are not afraid of it. If the Transkei thinks it can do it, let them try. If they think they cannot, then their relationship with us is based on an agreement. If hon. members of the Opposition want to say that the Bantu will not honour an agreement, they are free to do so. I am prepared to accept that if we make an agreement with the Transkei in regard to certain matters, that agreement will be kept. But supposing it does not happen, then we still do not have a constitutional relationship. If there is then agitation, that agitation will be in that foreign country, but if it is a constitutional relationship the agitation is in one own&#x2019;s country and then it means that one has a pressure group in one own&#x2019;s country which wants to compel one to do things one does not wish to do. There is a very great difference between the two. Shall I repeat it for the edification of the hon. member for Constantia, or does he understand it?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia to-day excelled himself in the wrong direction. We shall always remember his reference to slave labour. I have told hon. members that this multi-racial Parliament which is being recommended will not work. I have told hon. members that the federal concept favoured by the Opposition is one which presupposes a kind of agreement which does not exist. I have stated the prerequisites for the proper functioning of a Parliament. Those prerequisites are absent and therefore a multi-racial Parliament will fail. I have stated the principle adopted by us, and I hope that hon. members of the Opposition will attack me or reply on this principle.</p>

<p>I have withdrawn it. What more does the hon. member want? Because the hon. member for Yeoville is against splitting up the Republic into these various parts, the hon. the Minister of Lands now suggests that the hon. member for Yeoville stands for complete intermingling, socially, economically and politically, which, of course, is quite untrue. Then he says that the only two courses open are complete integration, socially, politically and economically, or to chase the various races into their separate kraals. He knows that there is a third way, and that is our policy of a race federation. He knows that for some centuries Blacks, Coloureds, Whites and Malays lived in the old Cape Colony where there was a natural separation and very little social intermingling and very little inter-marriage over something like 200 years. Sir, I will deal later on in my speech with his remarks about the irrevocability of the Government&#x2019;s policy. First of all I would just like to say this about the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze). The hon. member can never make a speech without being personal. To hide his weak case he tries to introduce a red herring. He referred to what the hon. member for Constantia had said. Sir, I listened very carefully to the hon. member for Constantia. He never said that slave labour would be used. He said that the roads could not be built for &#x00A3;600 a mile except by slave labour. In other words, he made it quite clear &#x2026; [Interjections.] Sir, I am making the speech now.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the amendment which I support. Tuesday, 23 January 1962, will go in our history as the turning point in the destiny of our White civilization and Western civilization here, unless the people (in their wisdom) can in time put this Government out of power, and reverse the policy of turning this country into one multiracial Republic and seven Bantu states, which states will eventually turn against the Republic once they achieve full independence and have made their alliances with communists and other countries hostile to us. That is what will happen unless there is a reversal of policy. The whole of the Republic will be split up, and the seven Bantustans will in the end become hostile to us&#x2014;and I will prove that before I sit down. I want to place on record my views and prognostications as to what the policy of this Government will lead to. I want the future generation to know that this side of the House again and again warned the Government of the outcome of their policy of expediency. Sir, I say &#x201C;a policy of expendiency&#x201D; advisedly, because the whole apartheid policy was started in the first instance simply and selfishly to gain power and not from conviction, not from any high principles or ideals. There is no easier way to beat the emotional drum than to work on colour prejudice, and so the &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; cry was raised and became their political slogan. It served its dishonest purpose; and they gained power in 1948. But, as in a revolution, it is difficult later to get rid of the false cries or slogans, or the dubious friends who helped the winner to power. When Dr. Malan and Mr. Havenga, realizing the danger that apartheid could bring about if pushed too far, tried to back-pedal a bit, the wild young men behind them discarded and jettisoned the two elderly leaders. The Nationalist Party having been driven into a corner by their own propaganda and policies, the present Prime Minister thought that he could buy time and stave off world criticism for 50-odd years by this Bantustan bluff. In the poker player&#x2019;s parlance, his opponent has asked to see his hand; his bluff has been called. He had miscalculated the tempo of the times, and within a couple, instead of 50 years, his never-never theories suddenly became an immediate issue and he could not put the genie, which he had so thoughtlessly released, back into the bottle which he, with a cynical disregard for facts, had uncorked. Anybody who has read the Arabian Nights knows that the sailor released the genie out of pity, but this has been done entirely for political expediency, and now it cannot be put back into the bottle. Sir, I used the word &#x201C;bluff&#x201D; in no way frivolously because we have had a former Secretary for Native Affairs, Dr. Eiselen, telling the world that there was no question of ever giving these Bantustans independence. The same has been said by several Nationalist speakers during the last general election. And yet the Prime Minister has used the word &#x201C;commonwealth&#x201D; in connection with these Bantustans. Sir, what does &#x201C;commonwealth&#x201D; connote? It is accepted to mean one thing <span class="col_599-600" refersTo="page_316"/>only under the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which was put into the Statute of Westminster, and that is that &#x201C;all are equal in status, none subordinate to the other&#x201D;. In other words, the Prime Minister has told the world that in this &#x201C;commonwealth&#x201D; the Bantustans are to be equal in status to the Republic (as the Dominions were to Britain), none subordinate to the other. He went further and talked about full sovereign independence; whilst the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development waxed eloquently over what was to be given to the Bantustans; they were going to have their own police and their own Public Service and heaven knows what not. He zoomed into the stratosphere of improbabilities on the same subject, to such an extent that no one could follow him or even take him seriously But the <i>Cape Times</i> of 1 February delivered a cold douche, because it reported that&#x2014;I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Mr. C. B. Young, Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development, made it clear to Chiefs and Headmen in the Transkei yesterday that there would be no full independence for the territory.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Here we have the head of the Department telling us that there is going to be no full independence for this territory, and yet the Prime Minister has told us that there is going to be a commonwealth: that the Bantustans are going to have sovereign independence, and that they are all going to be equal in status.</p>

<p>Sir, that is the background of the position which we are now faced with, and I want to put on record what I foresee will happen. Quite possibly all will go fairly smoothly for a few years whilst Government-supporting Bantu Chiefs, Headmen and other leaders of these areas hold power; for it means position, power, influence and income to them whilst the situation holds. But sooner or later the appetite for power and income will spread to others; and once there is universal suffrage in, say, the Transkei, the demagogue, as my hon. friend here has warned us, will rise. The Bantu is a great orator and rabble-rouser and he will realize that his only hope of gaining the plums of office and getting those privileges and that income is by ousting the Chiefs and Headmen who support the Government. In other words, he will start agitating against his own privileged class, the Chiefs and the Headmen; he will look upon them as stooges. That can only be achieved if he can beat the drums of race-hatred of Whites and class-hatred of the Bantu Chiefs, leaders and privileged classes. He will follow the example of all African leaders north of the Limpopo and will rouse the emotions of the Black proletariate by (1) appealing to the anti-White sentiments against the treatment of the Bantu in the White area; (2) against rule by tribal Chiefs and a privileged class of Bantu who support the Government at the present moment; in fact he will act just as the working class in Britain did firstly after the Reform Bill became law and later against the powers and privileges of the House of Lords; (3) he will demand to have control of Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs at present held by the Republic. Obviously the ultimate ruler of the Bantustans will be the demagogue and agitator who promises the African the world. He will open the door to financial help from Communist countries, as against any help he might get from the Republic. To him public enemy No. I will be the Republic of South Africa. He will not be our friend, because he cannot stir up the emotions of the people if he is our friend. Sir, more powerful nations than we are will be able to outbid us in financial help for the development of these territories, and once they have done that, those territories will fall under the influence of those outside powers, particularly the Communist. The Transkei will try and join up with Basutoland, which will soon be self-governing, for it will bring them closer to a liberal-minded Britain and Commonwealth, and at the same time Basutoland will thereby get an outlet to the sea, and no longer be a completely surrounded enclaved, dominated economically by the Republic. We know that as Basutoland is at the present moment, we could strangle her economically if we wanted to; but if she joins up with the Transkei she will have an outlet to the sea. Sir, nothing that we can do will be right, for it will not be in the demagogue&#x2019;s interest to admit that anything we do is in the interest of the Transkei or its rights. If we were the angel Gabriel himself we would not be able to do anything right, just as the Nationalists of the old Union days also used the cry that nothing Britain could do was right. Britain had given South Africa her independence but everything she did was wrong. They, the Nationalists, said they were suppressed and dominated by the very country that had made them a self-governing state. In short, the Bantu politician, take a leaf out of the Nationalist Party book, will agitate against the Republic just as the Nationalist Party organized and agitated against Britain and the Commonwealth connection. You will remember, Sir, that for years and years our position was likened to that of a baboon tied to a pole; we were told that we had sovereign independence but that we&#x2014;the Union&#x2014;were still a baboon tied to a pole&#x2014;Britain. In other words, the Bantu politician will act towards our Republic as the Nationalist Party did towards Britain, using the same arguments of being oppressed, as the Nationalists did up to 1948. But there will be this great difference in an appeal to the world. Prior to 1940/45 colonies and colonial powers were still respectable and fashionable. They were said to be leading their Black brethren to great civilization progress and Christianity&#x2014;possible by way of the garden path. To-day, however, colonialism, the hon. member for Yeoville has said, is completely out of fashion. It is worse: it is now regarded as reactionary, evil and decadent; and it has become a swear-word. Just as Communism became a swear-word to hon. gentlemen opposite. What is more: colonialism today <span class="col_601-602" refersTo="page_317"/>is repudiated by the very great powers that owned most of the colonies only five years ago. But with this knowledge the present Government is attempting to create colonies (subject to them) on our very borders. Whereas the metropolitan colonial powers were at least separated by thousands of miles of sea. If these colonies of ours become a mess such as the Congo, then we will have them right on our borders, as my two colleagues have mentioned earlier on this afternoon. Sir, mighty world powers like France and Britain, or smaller powers like Belgium and Holland, have admitted that they cannot hold the position in the face of world anti-colonialism; yet our Government of all the talents&#x2014;blind to history, and deaf to what is going on around them at the moment in the outside world&#x2014;are starting to create colonies at this late stage when the entire world is anti-colonial. It really is pathetic. Now let us take it at its possible best. Let us try to see what the position will be like if the very best happened. If the Secretary for Native Affairs is right, then these Bantustans are never going to have independence. Suppose these seven Bantustan colonies on our borders accept our rule and our friendship after they have self-government. What must happen? With all the goodwill in the world and the wish to rehabilitate the reserves, all previous governments and this Government have failed to do so. With all the skill of a dedicated Department of Native Affairs and with all the know-how, the economic wealth and the money poured into it, we have failed to make the Bantu a lover or protector of the land on which he lives. By nature, he is a nomad; he comes in, grazes the land and then wants to move on. History has shown that he has never really been a lover of the land. He is not like the Chinaman or the Indian who revere the land and who can keep a family going on half an acre. It is not in the Bantu&#x2019;s nature to protect his land. Wherever he has been he has overstocked in and caused erosion, and to a large extent destroyed the land. Yet the Government proposes to hand over the management of land and agriculture to Bantu control without White supervision; the Whites are to be there only as advisors; they will really be the civil servants of the Black Government. They will not have the power to carry out decisions arrived at by them. What are now the reserves may well be deserts in 20 years&#x2019; time. The areas will be more overcrowded than ever by natural increase, and yet more and more people are to be pushed in into them. We find that Xhosas from all over the country are being sent back to the reserves, together with their women. Many of these Zhosas have never been in the reserves before. I know from my own experience of many people who have been sent there, people who were not born there and whose ancestors never lived there. The result will be that we will have seven over-populated, poverty-stricken, extremely vociferous colonies on our borders clamouring for more rights, working up grievances about the treatment of the Bantus in the White Republic, and being safely able to do so from a forum in their own areas. They will be speaking as Transkeian people in the Transkei and will be able to say what they like, with a world hostile to us, as their audience. They will not have to put up wireless stations to broadcast; they will have the wireless networks of the world doing all the broadcasting for them, and they will have the Press of the whole world on their side. The people they will be agitating about will not be republican subjects, but citizens of free Bantu nations living on our borders. They will be discussing the rights and disabilities of their&#x2014;not our&#x2014;subjects, because the Bantu living in our areas are, according to the Prime Minister, to be Transkeian subjects; I am talking now about the Xhosa.</p>

<p>As has been pointed out earlier in this Session, many wars have been started by aggressors claiming that the minorities of their people were being ill-used by the governments of the countries in which they have to live. Sudeten-land in 1939 will suffice as one example. Mighty Germany went in there and risked a world war to protect, as she claimed, her citizens living under the Czechoslovakian government, although the Czechoslovakian government in the last 15 years before the war had done all they could to try to meet the wishes of the Sudeten Germans. Germany&#x2019;s real reason was, however, merely to raise race prejudice. Another example was Servia in 1914 which triggered off a world war. One could go on indefinitely giving examples, but with this great difference, and it is a difference which I want to emphasize: The Bantu will not have to attempt to succour their brethren, the Transkeian citizens, living in the Republic. UNO and the world outside will take up the challenge for them; as they are doing to-day against us with all this unfair criticism of South Africa that we see to-day. Let the Government realize two things now. This move for Bantustan will not gain the goodwill of the world. The fact is, as the hon. member for Yeoville put it very clearly, that with all its news value, it has scarcely been reported abroad. Twice as much publicity has been given to the case of Mrs. Singh, a White woman, who married an Indian, as that given to the whole of the great announcement of the creation of a self-governing Bantustan. Nor will it get the friendship and goodwill of the Bantu. The reverse will be the outcome. Let me give an example: Britain after her unjust and unprovoked attack on the two republics in 1899, tried to do all she could to gain the goodwill and the friendship of the people she had defeated.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I warned the hon. member last Session that it is a great mistake to hark back to the indiscretions of your youth by reminding us of his female acquaintances of those days. It is not only biological, it is pathological. The hon. member should see a psychiatrist. It is bordering <span class="col_603-604" refersTo="page_318"/>on senility when he continues to hark back to his misspent youth.</p>

<p>Sir, that was the position. Britain did all she could to try and gain the goodwill of those two republics which she had unprovokedly and unjustly attacked; and her own people (the common men in the street) revolted against the government and threw them out, and a Liberal Party came into power. It poured money into the country and in a very short while gave the Republics back their independence and made them a sovereign independent state. Their generals became the rulers of the Union. I ask the House whether that healed the wounds, whether that in any way softened the resentment? No; the bitterness and hate increased with the passing of the years: the Boer War is still being fought to-day by the hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The Government by its handling of the Bantu as a person has created a resentment that will be remembered for centuries to come. I will just give one example of what I mean when I speak of personal treatment. It is a case I happen to know about personally. There was a Xhosa girl born in Kimberley, whose father and grandfather and great-grandfather had always been in the White area, never in a reserve. She came down to work as a servant on a farm next to mine. She was 14; and at the age of 18 she got married to a Bantu who had been born and had been living legally in the Cape. He was working there. When she had three children and was pregnant again, she was told to go to the Transkei where she had never been, where her ancestors had never been and where she has not got a friend or knew anybody. What was the result? She even had to go there and be separated from her husband or otherwise her husband had to chuck his job and go and live in the Transkei. This is a typical case of present Government policy. Will the Bantu ever forget or forgive it? Sir, Britain with her great power then was negotiating (with the two republics that she had beaten) from strength. Our Government to-day is negotiating from weakness, due to world pressure brought on the Government. Sir, it is on record that I begged the hon. the Prime Minister years ago to negotiate whilst he could negotiate from strength and not from weakness, the very thing which is happening to-day as a result of world pressure. But what irritates me is that my country, which I am so extremely proud of, is being made ridiculous in the eyes of the world by the present Prime Minister.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, very much more than yours. You should go and vote in Germany whom you backed during the war. The hon. the Prime Minister says that the Xhosas living in the White area, in the Republic, will be allowed to vote in the Transkei as in the Republic he is just a temporary visitor. When challenged on this, he said: Just as the Italian seasonal worker who goes and works in France, has not got a vote in France but has to go back to Italy if he wants to vote, so the Xhosa living in the White area will be merely a temporary sojourner. In other words, the Transkei is his homeland. Now the obvious question I want to ask and which the world is going to ask: Was that Italian born in France? Was his father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather born in France? If so, would he not have been a French citizen even though from Italian stock? Would he not have a vote in France? He would not have become naturalized as an Italian if he wished to vote in Italy. And if the Transkei has control over external affairs, the Transkeian Government will say to the Xhosa born in the White area: Yau can&#x2019;t come and vote here, you must be naturalized here first before you can become a citizen of the Transkei. I want to ask this question: What if the Xhosa who, say, is born in Kimberley, whose ancestors for generations have never been in a reserve, much less in the Transkei? How can the Transkei be his homeland? Will the hon. the Prime Minister tell me of any country in the world where a man can be declared a foreigner in the land of his birth? How can a Xhosa who is born in Kimberley be declared a foreigner in the Republic? He cannot even be deported out of this country. Sir, it is just blatant, unmitigated, arrant nonsense; it is just damn silly. I regret that the Prime Minister of my country is making us all the laughing stock of the world. The point is: Will the Bantu swallow this? Will any single person, outside an inmate of a lunatic asylum, in the outside world (that the Prime Minister is so anxious to impress) accept this Alice-in-Wonderland theory or statement? The whole thing is childish. To say that a man is a foreigner in the land in which he was born and if he wants to vote, he has to go to another country where he has never been, is the height of absurdity. What to me is so deplorable is that the hon. the Prime Minister having finally decided to carry out this mad-hatter tea party-scheme in theory, called a general election two-and-a-half years before it was due and that he made no attempt to take the people into his confidence as to the issues at stake, or told them what they were voting for. It is true he made vague references to Bantustans which were going to be created, and so on, and so forth, but the public were never told &#x201C;This is the issue you vote on&#x201D;. Sir, he wanted the full five years to put into practice what was merely a vague theory before the public then, so that the decision and action would at the end of five years be irrevocable; and the omelette which he had mixed could never be unscrambled. That the hon. the Minister of Lands made quite clear this afternoon was the intention. He said &#x201C;Now you can never go back on that&#x201D;. But the Prime Minister wanted a full five years to make it absolutely irrevocable, and that is why he went to the country but did not tell the public that he was going to the country for that purpose.</p>

<p>Yes, and we were told that we were lying, that we were talking nonsense. Ministers and one member after the other opposite said that there was no question of taking such a step. They denied it all the time. The fact is that the whole thing was little better than a political confidence trick played on a trusting people who were under the impression that the hon. the Prime Minister wanted a vote of confidence in respect of his declaration of a republic, and a vote of confidence on having taken us out of the Commonwealth. Everybody thought that the hon. the Prime Minister had forced the election to make the people answer this question: &#x201C;Are you satisfied with a republic and my actions in taking the country out of the Commonwealth?&#x201D; And thousands of English-speaking people, who were not Nationalists, voted for that because they said the Prime Minister had no other course open to him after what had happened at the Imperial Conference but to withdraw his application to remain in the Commonwealth. Surely it would have been more politically honest to have taken the public fully into his confidence; and my contention is fully borne out by the hon. the Minister of Lands. He has made it clear that there was a sort of conspiracy, that this thing was done to get five years so as to make this step irrevocable and so that no government, who came into power, could change it. Surrounded by what were largely professional politicians&#x2014;I am not using that term in a derogatory sense at all&#x2014;and a submissive party, the Prime Minister has forced an irrevocable policy through, which commits South Africa to a course much more far-reaching than the declaration of a republic. Because, if the people wish, they can (without too great an upset) go back to a monarchy, but, as my hon. friend pointed out here, if once this Bantustan theory is put through, you can only go back either by force of arms or by a war of conquest. There is no going back on it once you have given Bantustans their freedom. Yet, the lesser decision, the declaration of a republic, was submitted to a referendum to test public opinion. But to embark on an irrevocable step without consulting the people, I say was a betrayal by the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government of South Africa and its people.</p>

<p>I withdraw it. For the sake of political expediency and to gain time before the world showdown against his form of apartheid has brought us to our knees, he has jeopardized the very existence of our Western civilization. It is on record that during the last six years I have said that the party sitting opposite was the greatest enemy of Western civilization, and that is proving to be true to-day. If ever South Africa, our Western civilization (or our White South Africa) is destroyed, they will be the Government responsible for it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me say that it makes me sad to see so many Afrikaners opposite, many of them bearing great names, whose forebears played a great and noble role in our history and our country; ancestors who spoke their minds and who preferred poverty and hardship and even death to surrendering their principles and their right to speak their minds, or their right to independence; ancestors who showed an admiring world at the turn of the century that they would fight to the last ditch for their independence&#x2014;it makes me sad to see the descendants of those men sitting here, and not one of them prepared to stand up against the Prime Minister and fight for the right of South Africa. That to me is very sad. Sir, we are not a spiteful or a vengeful party on this side of the House. We will be able to forgive them, but our children and their children and their children&#x2019;s children and the history of South Africa will never forgive them for being accomplices; and not daring to risk their job or a seat, or ministership, because they fear to oppose the Prime Minister. They have not got the guts to stand up and say that this is going to destroy South Africa and risk the consequences. That is what the country will never forgive them for.</p>

Mitchell), who sits on the same side of the House as that hon. member and who complained here a few days ago that the Prime Minister in fact repeatedly referred to it, but that the people did not believe the Prime Minister. But he (Mr. Mitchell) believed the Prime Minister all these years. That is in direct conflict with what the hon. member for Green Point now says, that the people were never informed.</p>

<p>There is another point I want to clear up. The hon. member spoke about a difference which is alleged to exist between the Secretary for Bantu Administration, Mr. Young, and the standpoint of the hon. the Prime Minister. He quoted Mr. Young as having said that full independence would not be given to the Transkei, and that the Prime Minister spoke here as if the Transkei would become fully independent. Cannot the hon. member understand that there is a process of development and that it takes time, and that they will not immediately be given full independence in all respects. Mr. Young was quite correct there, that the Prime Minister was equally correct when he said that South Africa could eventually become a Commonwealth of Nations, like Britain, and that if they eventually obtained their independence we could create such a Commonwealth. There is no contradiction between these two gentlemen. It is just a disparity of time. I hope the hon. member&#x2019;s mind has now been set at rest in regard to these matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the dominant phenomenon in world politics to-day is the deterioration in the position of power of the White man. I we look at the world as it was 500 years ago, we find that in the year 1400 the Western European was practically fenced in in Western Europe and controlled only about one-tenth of the surface of the earth. At that stage the White man was surrounded by unchartered seas and was not in a position where he could hold a position of power in the world, but could only govern himself. But as the result of his energy and initiative and perseverance, his intellectual and reasoning ability, the White man evolved various means which assisted him to develop, such as the compass, gunpowder, etc., and as the result of these inventions the White man in the years which followed spread his wings wide in all directions and conquered one continent after the other. In the next 500 years we had the extension of the authority of the White man throughout the world, a development which was bigger than during the previous 4,000 years. One country after the other was discovered and colonized, and in every one of these territories the White man hoisted his flag and assumed control, and if we look at the world as it was in 1900 we find the White man controlling nine-tenths of the world. There was phenomenal growth and expansion, and the position remained like that for a number of years. And everywhere the White man went he came into contact with the Natives of the particular country where he settled. The Natives of the various countries and continents differed from each other, but they were all undeveloped nations which at that time did not know civilization and did not have the perseverance and the energy revealed by the Whites. The contact with the Whites and their civilization did not only uplift the Native races one after another, but also increasingly civilized them, in the sense that eventually they took an interest in the same things in which the White people were interested. The various White nations in the various countries acted differently. In certain of these areas the White man cruelly exterminated the Black man or the Native on a large scale. In other countries the White man, as the result of his own philosophy of life, treated these people differently and gave them an opportunity to develop, and in that way the White man strengthened his position in the world and extended his power.</p>

<p>But in recent years there was a change in this sphere and. as I said in the beginning, the predominant phenomenon in international politics to-day is that the White man is being forced to retreat from his position of power to an inferior position in the world. In the first place the non-Whites in the various countries gradually began to develop and awaken and make demands, because as the result of the development of industries, etc., they also became economically stronger in their own countries and eventually reached such an economic level that they began making further demands in the economic sphere, and also in <span class="col_609-610" refersTo="page_321"/>the social sphere started making higher demands for themselves and for their race. Eventually the non-Whites in the various countries began asking for political rights of self-government and to decide their own fate. It is this last standpoint particularly which to-day dominates world politics and gives it a clear form. For many years, not only in South Africa but in all the colonies, the non-Whites stood, cap in hand, and asked what the will of their master was, whether it was the American or the Australian or the Hollander in Indonesia. He was the master and the non-White had to bow to his will. In all those countries there were doors with the inscription. &#x201C;No Admittance to Non-Whites&#x201D;. In all those countries there were spheres from which they were debarred. Discrimination was applied everywhere on the basis of race or colour. During recent years the position has changed to such an extent that the Whites gradually had to get out of those countries and return to Western Europe, where they stemmed from 500 years ago. In every case the Whites had to get out, it happened under conditions where they tried to establish a multi-racial state together with the non-Whites, with a multi-racial Parliament, to rule jointly. In Indonesia, to begin with, there were 500 Whites and 1,500,000 halfbreeds or people of mixed blood, and thirdly, there were 40,000,000 members of the indigenous races. The ratio in Indonesia between Whites and non-Whites was much worse than it is here. Nevertheless this 500,000 Whites in Indonesia could form a stable Government there for more than 300 years and bring economic development to the country, and there was food for all and a living standard on which they could all make a living. This position continued until there was interference by the Dutch Government, which had continued to rule Indonesia as a colony, and the Dutch Government decided to pass legislation in order to give the non-Whites there the vote together with the Whites. Therefore a multiracial state worked well for centuries when the Whites alone ruled, but the moment this multi-racial state was converted into a state with a multi-racial Parliament Indonesia also had its problems. The next step was that the non-Whites obtained the majority in Parliament and Sukarno became President, and immediately thereafter he assumed the attitude adopted by all non-White races, as I shall prove in a moment, that he did not want to rule in co-operation with the Whites, but alone. The result was that the Hollanders had to return to Holland by sea and by air. Fortunately for them they had a fatherland to which they could return and the Dutch Queen welcomed them back to Holland. But that was the course which was clearly followed in Indonesia also. The moment a multi-racial Parliament was established, the Whites had to get out. The same course was followed in various other countries which I will not enumerate.</p>

<p>Gradually the Whites were ousted from all the countries in which they were entrenched. One can mention India. Indo-China and even Ghana, and eventually we can come to Kenya and the Congo. We are faced at the moment with the question as to what is going to happen in Kenya and in the Federation just north of us. It seems as if the White man, who for years made progress and took that part of the world under his wings, is being ousted and will have to go back to Western Europe from where he came originally.</p>

<p>If the hon. member will have the patience to wait for the second part of my speech, I will contrast colonialism with the position we have here. It also appears very clearly from the attitude of world statesmen to-day. I briefly want to quote Chester Bowles, who at the moment occupies a fairly important position in the American Government and who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The West can no longer command; in future it can only try to persuade.</block>

<p>That is undoubtedly the position we find in world politics to-day.</p>

<p>Now I specifically want to come back to South Africa and its problems, and I want to analyse the position here carefully and then deal with the solution we are trying to find, as embodied in the policies of the various parties. I want to say at once that in South Africa three things must be stated and accepted as facts. The first fact I want to state is that the Black man (I am now talking of the area known as the Republic of South Africa south of the Limpopo) who lives in this area is here permanently and will remain here, and also regards this as his only fatherland, that he has nowhere else to go, and that we should not think that he will leave here to-morrow. We must accept the fact that they are here and will remain here. Together with that we must accept that he is inspired and encouraged by something he has in common with every other nation, viz., a feeling of nationalism and a national awakening which makes the Black man, like any other, want to be the master of his own fate. He wants to rule his own affairs and will use all his energy to get to the stage where he can do so. We must further accept that this nationalism burns like a flame in the hearts of every nation, and that it drives them to action and deeds, and that unless those ambitions are satisfied by evolution they will be satisfied by revolution. I want to use the metaphor of a boiler under which there is a fire, and unless there is an escape valve by means of which these people can give expression to their feelings, that boiler will burst. Nobody can by means of discrimination or in any other way try to keep countries or nations down by means of artificial legislation. But I want to state a second standpoint. The first is that the Black man is and will remain here.</p>

<p><span class="col_611-612" refersTo="page_322"/>My second standpoint is that the White man is in South Africa and, in spite of world opinion and what might happen outside, he will remain here.</p>

<p>In spite of all the attempts which are made by the Opposition. If one has a quick look at these territories, and I want to do so in this part of my speech, with the picture I have sketched of world powers which have spread their wings across the world, one sees that they settled themselves in and colonized various areas.</p>

<p>I come now to the matter referred to by the hon. member a moment ago in his question. They colonized various territories and lived there. Certain of these territories were accepted by the world as White man&#x2019;s country, in spite of the earlier colonization. The U.S.A. is to-day regarded by the whole world as a White man&#x2019;s country. Nobody who talks about Americans and says &#x201C;America for the Americans&#x201D; means America for the Redskins who were the original inhabitants there. The second area so accepted is Australia. Nobody to-day speaks about &#x201C;Australia for the Australians&#x201D;, meaning thereby the original inhabitants. Nobody talks about &#x201C;New Zealand for the New Zealanders&#x201D; while thinking of the Maoris. But when they speak about &#x201C;Africa for the Africans&#x201D;, they mean the Black man, and the White man is immediately eliminated. Sir, my standpoint is very clear, that America, Australia and New Zealand in the eyes of the world, although they are colonized areas just like the Republic of South Africa, are regarded as White countries and as the permanent home of White people. But South Africa is measured with a different yardstick. We are measured by the same yardstick as the colonies in Africa, in India and the East Indian islands. We are regarded as being colonial territory, and therefore they regard the Whites here not as permanent inhabitants but as sojourners who came here to make money, who came to seek their fortunes here and who now have to leave Africa.</p>

<p>As usual, the Opposition is again differing amongst themselves and I do not want to be diverted by that. Sir, I want to come to my third standpoint, that the White man is here and the Black man also, and both are here permanently. Now I state my third standpoint. It is that the world outside with the pressure it exerts as if its conscience worries it as the result of its centuries of oppression&#x2014;the world outside, UN and the Black man&#x2014;demand the franchise and self-rule for the Black man also in the Republic of South Africa. Let us recognize this fact. In other words, the world demands one man, one vote, irrespective of race or colour. We have had the experience in the Congo and various other places that when they do so they are prepared to enforce it even by force of arms. Therefore I say we are faced with a situation in South Africa, the simple situation that there are Whites here as well as Blacks, and the world demands one man, one vote. If we are to concede to the demand for one man, one vote, we can do so in two ways. Either we can make concessions to world opinion and thereby relieve the pressure on South Africa to a certain extent, and work out our own destiny better if we give it to them separately in their own areas, or we can grant one man, one vote in the whole area jointly and thereby be directly faced with one thing only, viz. the domination of the Black man over the White man, and then we will be following precisely the same course that was adopted in Indonesia, the Congo and all the other places. Then world opinion said South Africa is a colony, and if the Blacks are in the majority the Whites must bow to them. It is quite clear that the Blacks do not want to govern in co-operation or partnership with the Whites. That is quite clear and last year already I used the quotation here, and I want to use it again because evidently it made no impression then. I again want to quote what Dr. Nkrumah said. He is generally known or accepted as the spokesman for Black nationalism in Africa, Black nationalism which has really developed into Black imperialism, because they do not want only what is their own but also what is the other man&#x2019;s. I want to quote what Dr. Nkrumah said when opening the PanAfrican Conference in Accra in December 1959. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This decade is the decade of African independence. We welcome into our midst people of all other races, other nations, other communities who desire to live amongst us in peace and equality. But they must respect us and our rights &#x2026;</block>

<p>And just see what rights he demands for himself!&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our right as the majority to rule and to rule alone &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want to repeat that because it is underlined&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To rule and to rule alone.</block>

<p>And then he still has the brutality to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_613-614" refersTo="page_323"/>That, as our Western friends have taught us to understand it, is the essence of democracy.</block>

<p>And therefore the whole of his Opposition is in prison to-day. Now, Mr. Speaker, the spokesman for those nations says that the Black man has the right to rule and to rule alone. It is not only Nkrumah who says it. I want to come to the next spokesman for Black nationalism, who adopted precisely the same standpoint. He is Tom Mboya of Kenya, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Civilized or not, ignorant or literate, rich or poor, we deserve a Government of our own choice &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he refers specifically to us and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even in Central and South Africa it is not a question of will we win; we come here to ask ourselves how and when we will win, in the shortest possible time.</block>

<p>He goes further and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kenya, Tanganyika. Nyasaland, the Rhodesias and the Union of South Africa, like Ghana or Nigeria, are African countries, not White settlers&#x2019; property.</block>

<p>That is precisely the ideas which concern the point put to me a moment ago by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus these territories must be ruled by the African people.</block>

<p>Then he states very clearly that the theories expressed at the moment, of partnership and multi-racialism&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; are essentially devices to deflect the African from his rightful goal of governing his own country in his own way.</block>

<p>I now want to deal particularly with the standpoint of hon. members opposite in regard to race federation, but that has already been covered by the arguments I have advanced. The United Party&#x2019;s federation policy was propounded after the date of this statement, but if on that date the announcement had already been made that they had a racial federation in mind, then I am sure that Tom Mboya would have added it to his list as another one of the theories which are only intended to deflect them from their final object, namely to govern Africa in their own way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the light of all these facts, I want to contrast the choices facing the Republic of South Africa and the White man here; in the light of the fact that there are Black people here and that they will always be here, that there are Whites and that they will always be here, that the conscience of the outside world is pricking it and making it demand that the Black man in the world should not be uplifted and be given the same rights as the Whites. I say it is quite probably because their consciences are pricking them because throughout the centuries they exploited the Black man for their own advantage. But in any case, these demands are now being made. How can we comply with them? Let me begin by discussing the federation policy of the United Party as we now understand it or as we infer what it is from all the vague statements made. I particularly have in mind the statement made in that regard by the Leader of the Opposition in reply to the speech of the Prime Minister in the motion of censure debate. I am thinking of the United Party policy as expounded at that stage. Now I immediately want to set out from the standpoint that the United Party also now adopts the attitude that the Bantu homelands should be developed as the homelands of the Black man. I do not think that is being denied any longer. The year before last it was still being denied, but it is now also their policy that those areas should be developed as the homelands of the Black man, that the Black man should also have a say there in his own government, and that they are also prepared to give a Parliament to the Black man there on a federal basis, as it will develop through the years, with a Black government, a Black cabinet and whichever Black government they choose. I think it is clear if I state it this way. If it is not, I would like hon. members opposite to deny it immediately.</p>

<p>Their next standpoint is that after all these Black states have been established and the various policies have been implemented there, they will be Black self-governing states in their own areas, precisely what we now want to give them. Then we come to the question of what we want to retain as White South Africa, where we want to give the say only to the White man because we are fully justified in doing so, because we demand for the Whites precisely what we are prepared to give to the Blacks in their own area. I say that what we regard here as White South Africa and what we want to rule as a White Government is called by them a multi-racial South Africa in which they once again want to give all the inhabitants representation on this same basis, namely to the urbanized Native, to the Coloured and to the Indian, and also for the White man. In other words, one has the seven&#x2014;I do not know precisely how many&#x2014;Black parliaments and one has a mixed multi-racial parliament for this area we call the White area and which they call the multi-racial area.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to deal with the mixed area and I want to ask the United Party at once if they stand by the idea of no discrimination. They must bear in mind that they may not discriminate on the grounds of race or colour, because their intention is also to satisfy world opinion to such an extent that they will improve South Africa&#x2019;s name&#x2014;the so-called &#x201C;image&#x201D;. In order to create this new &#x201C;image&#x201D; only one thing is demanded and that is that there should be no discrimination on grounds of race or colour; and if they want <span class="col_615-616" refersTo="page_324"/>to create this new &#x201C;image&#x201D; they will have to put it in this way. If I remember correctly, that is how they put it through the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The Coloureds are to be represented in Parliament by Whites at this stage, but their representatives may also be Coloureds; there is no objection to that according to United Party policy. I accept that the Indians will be represented on the same basis after they have been consulted. As far as the Bantu are concerned the Leader of the Opposition states quite clearly that at this stage they will have the vote on a separate roll and will be represented here by Whites. I want to put it clearly to hon. members by coming back to the analogy of the steam kettle which I used just now. The Black man&#x2019;s National feeling says to him, &#x201C;I want to have control&#x201D;. That is the fire burning underneath the steam kettle. As soon as this fire of demands made by the Bantu becomes strong enough, then Sir de Viliers Graaff and his party say the lid must be lifted and a little steam let out, and then it is put back again. At this stage, as the result of pressure, they are given a few White representatives in Parliament. But the steam kettle is still standing on the same fire. It is still just as hot and it is boiling and within a few minutes or moments or, in politics, within a few months or years, the gauge will again move to danger point. The Black man is not going to be satisfied with four representatives or eight, whatever the number may be. He will at once say, &#x201C;You are discriminating against me on the ground of colour; I am going to call in the world organizations: I am going to call upon the United Nations Organization to help me. There is no &#x2018;new image&#x2019; because you are discriminating on the grounds of race and colour; you are just as inhuman as the National Party, because there are 3,000,000 Whites and 6,000,000 Bantu, and you are allowing me eight representatives in Parliament as against 160 for the Whites.&#x201D; That is discrimination! Immediately the lid will be lifted once more and a second little bit of steam will have to be let out. The number will increase or double to the extent that the Black man makes his demands, in order to avoid economic boycotts or strikes, or calls for help from outside. Then the next stage will arrive and he will say, &#x201C;Why must I be represented by Whites? Is that not also discrimination on the grounds of race and colour? Why can the Whites be represented by their own people? They say that the Coloureds are going to be represented by their own people; why cannot I, as a Bantu, also be represented by my own people?&#x201D; And then once more the kettle will be at bursting point; a little steam will have to be let out, otherwise the whole situation will explode. If this does not come about by evolution, then we will have a revolution and an explosion. The next question which then arises immediately is this: All right, pressure has been exterted and there are now Black representatives in Parliament instead of Whites. And as far as the mixed area is concerned in the end, this system of the United Party&#x2019;s must inevitably result in a Black majority in this Parliament because of their superiority in numbers. I want hon. members on the other side to deny this when they rise to speak again and to prove that is not so. Having arrived at this result, I come to the next question and to the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy and to this super-Parliament. We will have five or six Black Parliaments; we will have a multi-racial Parliament here in which the Black man will eventually have a majority, and then there will be a super-body above all these Parliaments, the federal Parliament which will have to guard the Republic of South Africa and in this federal Parliament each of the little Parliaments will have a few members, as well as a few members in the multi-racial Parliament.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about the federal parliament of the United Party. With regard to this super-parliament, I once again wish to ask whether the Transkei and those places will send White representatives? What Whites will they send here? We will arrive at the stage where we shall have this federal, this all overshadowing federal parliament to government the Republic of South Africa and in it the Black man will not only have a tremendous say, but will also eventually have a majority. The following questions arise involuntarily: In all the other states in Africa in which the Black man will eventually have a majority and in every country where a multiracial state has been created with a multi-racial parliament to govern it, the moment he obtains a majority, he rules alone. As Nkrumah said, &#x201C;We want to rule and rule alone&#x201D;. That is the demand they are now making in Rhodesia: that is the demand which they did make in Kenya, in the Congo and in Indonesia. Why would all these countries drive out the White man in this way, but why would it not happen in South Africa under a United Party Government? Or perhaps I should say United Party Opposition, because the Black man will be in the majority. Is the Opposition so naive as to believe that things in South Africa will be different from what is happening in other countries? I want to deal with the second question. All these scare-stories which were brought up here this afternoon by the hon. member for Yeoville, the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) and other members, that these states will be able to come into contact with communist countries, that they will obtain communist capital, that they will link up with Basutoland, that they will link up with Ghana, and all the treaties mentioned to us which the Transkei will be able to enter into if they obtain self-government&#x2014;all these things and a hundredfold more will occur if this super-parliament falls into the hands of the Blacks, and the whole of the Republic of South Africa will be exposed to those demands and dangers, and not only the <span class="col_617-618" refersTo="page_325"/>Transkei. In other words, the difference is that the worst that can happen under our policy is that we will have a hostile neighbour. But what must happen under their policy in the normal course of events is that we shall have an adder in our bosom.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, the people will not allow us to give South Africa away. The electorate will return us at every election to maintain our policy in the interests of the safety of the Whites. The hon. member need not worry about that. I want to put it clearly. I say that the United Party with its policy that the Black man should attain his ideals in the White Parliament, in the White areas&#x2014;let me rather put it this way: The Black man wants to have control and to achieve his aspirations; he wants political rights. We say: Very well; we recognize that wish; we recognize that inborn ideal in every man and in every nation and we say to the Black man, &#x201C;We are creating these opportunities for you in your own area.&#x201D; The Opposition says, &#x201C;We are creating these opportunities in their own areas for these people&#x201D;. But for those living in our areas, they are in fact creating the opportunities and channels for them to obtain and exercise political rights in this area. In other words, they inspire that man and give him all the power and support in his own area to become stronger and stronger and eventually to achieve his aspirations here to the full. In the way they are putting it they are encouraging him to take over South Africa and to rule it himself. I wish to put it quite plainly, Mr. Speaker, and I should like to put it this way: I challenge the hon. Opposition and any hon. member of the Opposition to name one multi-racial country in the world, which is being governed multi-racially, where there is peace and order. There is not one. The situation is quite clear. There are many multi-racial countries, but once you have a multi-racial government, you find one group dominating the other, and eventually the minority group must yield or leave &#x2026; [Interjections.] I say that the United Party by propagating this policy and by starting with concessions in order to give the Black man an opening in the White man&#x2019;s area and the White man&#x2019;s Parliament and by allowing him to live a full political life among the Whites, is creating for itself a ladder which it will have to climb step by step. It will be forced up that ladder step by step. The first step will not be dangerous. It will be a few White representatives for the Blacks. That will not be dangerous. But it will never be able to turn around and descend the ladder. It will have to climb right to the top where, in a democratic state, the Black man by virtue of his majority will inevitably form the government, with a Black parliament and a Black prime minister and a Black state; and the highest position which a White man will be able to attain will be that of Leader of the Opposition of a minority group in a multi-racial parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few moments which I still have at my disposal, I wish to state our policy. It has been explained clearly by the hon. the Prime Minister so that it is not necessary for me to deal with it at length. But I want to apply the same tests to our policy. We recognize that there are White people and Black people in South Africa and that the Black man wants to govern himself. We say that we recognize this constellation and we share South Africa; instead of a horizontal line, where we give people above the line the vote and thus encourage them to achieve their aspirations in our own area, we draw a vertical line. We divide South Africa into two parts&#x2014;rather a divided South Africa where the Whites have control over a part of it than an undivided South Africa that we hand over to the Black man in a bloodless war. We divide South Africa vertically if it is necessary, also territorially if necessary; and we meet the demands of the world and the ideals and the aims of the Black man and we say to him: &#x201C;You can achieve your aspirations, you can rule completely; your nationalism can awaken fully and grow in your area which is your fatherland.&#x201D; With a policy such as this, I am prepared to appear before any court in the world and say that it is fair. And I say to the Whites in White South Africa that they can demand for themselves precisely what they grant to others. Therefore, I demand that the Black man should have no political rights at all in this area, because this is the White man&#x2019;s country and here he alone will rule. When that is the position, I feel that we will arrive at a stage where South Africa with her unique problems and unique position will be able to hold up her head politically and that the Whites on this Continent will have a foothold here. Because history will show, Mr. Speaker, that in spite of the fact that the Western powers are courting the Black states in order to keep them away from the communists, the Republic of South Africa will in the end be the only reliable ally of and will provide the only foothold for the Western nations in the whole of Africa when the rest have turned communist.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I thank you for the opportunity of allowing me to break parliamentary ice and in doing so, possibly to cool down the heat that has been generated in this House during the last few hours. In doing so, I also want to take advantake of the opportunity of bringing to the <span class="col_619-620" refersTo="page_326"/>attention of this House and of the hon. the Ministers, a matter which is of direct and immediate concern to my constituents and possibly, Sir, one of the main reasons, if not the only reason, why they deemed it advisable to send me to this House to make representations on their behalf. I refer to the position that has arisen on the East Rand as a result of the marginal mines that are situated in our area, and the resultant effect that they are likely to have on the population in that area. I think it is necessary that we should all accept joint responsibility for the position that has arisen, to realize the gravity with which that area now has to face its future. I feel that it would be wrong of me if I had to run away from my responsibility in this regard and not discuss these matters quite frankly and openly with the hon. the Prime Minister and his Minister, because to close the stable door after the horse has bolted is of very little use to us and of very little use, if any, to the country as a whole.</p>

<p>It is estimated that every White worker in industry requires expenditure of at least &#x00A3;10,000 in capital equipment to keep him in his job. This amount is made up of his house, lights, water, streets and the other amenities that are provided such as hospitals, schools and so on. On the East Rand that money has already been expended and represents the cumulative capital of decades of work by the ordinary man in the street, the working man whose welfare all of us, I am sure, have very much at heart. It was gold, and gold alone, that brought the people to the Witwatersrand&#x2014;and as the gold diminishes so the general level of prosperity in that area, and throughout the country, will be threatened. Not only, as I say, the prosperity of that area, but also the prosperity of the whole country, because as we all know, gold is an export industry and South Africa will be forced to replace it with other export industries in the future. On the East Rand we have all the facilities available, and there are all the weighty advantages for the establishment of a substantial industrial development. But, Sir, a dangerous position has been allowed to develop. I do not put any blame on anybody&#x2019;s shoulders in this regard. As I said before, we all have to accept joint responsibility for the situation that has developed, but we must realize that something has to be done in the immediate future in order to provide for the huge population that will be affected. In our area at the moment, in the towns on the East Rand, there are approximately 600,000 to 700,000 persons. Over &#x00A3;700,00,000 have been invested in commercial buildings, industry, housing, electricity, water supplies, sewerage and so on. in order to build up what we have on the East Rand at the moment. My question to the hon. the Prime Minister and the Ministers concerned, is, what is to be the fate of this huge capital investment? In the mines at Springs there are approximately 5,500 Europeans in employment and approximately 46,000 Bantu with a total annual wage bill of roughly R19,000,000. Industry on the other hand, employs approximately 3,300 Whites and 9,500 Bantu with a total wage bill of R9,500,000. It will, therefore, be seen that industry only contributes approximately one half of what the mines bring in, in wages. I think it will also be interesting for this House to know that in the area from Boksburg to Nigel 41 per cent of the people gainfully employed in that area&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;gainfully employed&#x201D;&#x2014;are working in the gold mines in that area. Forty-one per cent of the persons gainfully employed in that area are to-day working in the gold mines, and we owe them a responsibility to give them a substitute when the marginal mines in that area close down. An examination of the position shows that the whole area is heavily dependent on gold mining. Whilst I appreciate that some of those areas have been fortunate enough to make provision for a fairly substantial pro rata proportion of their mining population to be employed in industry, I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs to the fact that as the mines close down, the industries which are to-day giving employment to those people in that area, will find themselves badly penalized, in that they themselves&#x2014;that is the industries&#x2014;are dependent on the mines which are now in existence. I refer to such industries as the heavy engineering industry and its complementary industries. As the mines have to close down, so these industries find themselves badly placed and prejudiced, and they have to suffer. If it is asked of me what can be done in this matter, to get some practical reactions, I want to say firstly, that every assistance has to be given to those areas in order to enable them to establish further industrial townships. Here I feel the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration can assist us considerably in facilitating the early establishment of these industrial areas by not insisting, as has been the practice in the past, that three acres for Native housing should be available whenever one acre of industrial ground is established. We find that the position in our areas is that we cannot find such a substantial area of land for Bantu location purposes to enable us to establish industrial townships. I feel the Minister of Bantu Administration can possibly assist considerably in that regard, by alleviating the position to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>In April 1958 a round-table conference which was convened by the then Minister of Mines in order to go into this question, and which conference consisted of representatives of the Gold Producers&#x2019; Committee, the trade unions concerned and the Government, made certain very valuable suggestions. I feel that amongst those suggestions was something of great value to the marginal mines in our area, and although nearly three years have elapsed since that time, we would like to suggest that some of those recommendations of that round-table conference should now become applicable to the marginal mines. It is suggested by this conference that the marginal mines could be given relief amounting to a saving of about 2s. 3d. a ton milled in an average working cost <span class="col_621-622" refersTo="page_327"/>of 30s. 8d. a ton&#x2014;in other words, a saving of approximately 7&#x00BD; per cent per ton milled. It then went on to suggest that when a mine reaches the marginal stage it should apply to the Government to go into a &#x201C;classified&#x201D; list, when it becomes eligible for relief. When a mine should be so classified, or for how long it should remain so, would be determined by the Government Mining Engineer in consultation with the mine-owners and the other people concerned. The report which was drawn up by this conference, then goes on to point out that farmers receive special relief in times of drought, and suggests that the same principle might be applied to the marginal mines. I sincerely, but earnestly, commend this recommendation for the consideration of the Minister and of the House, because a precedent has already been established in this regard, that where relief is required by the farming community, the Government has made it available. We feel that relief is certainly required for our industry at the moment. It can be done, and I suggest there is another precedent in this regard in England, where they have been confronted with similar problems in regard to coal-mining, and they have declared certain areas to be &#x201C;betterment areas&#x201D; and special concessions were made to them. I feel that we can with justification do the same in regard to the position that has now arisen on the East Rand, where urgent action is justified.</p>

<p>What other practical measures can we take? Reference has been made to the fact that our country is now going over to the production of small arms and ammunition for defence purposes. May I suggest to the hon. the Minister of Defence that he can assist us considerably on the East Rand, by giving consideration to the establishment of such an ammunition factory there, with the consequent employment it can create for many skilled people there. The hon. the Minister of Mines, on 27 July 1958, made the following comment when replying to the hon. member for Geduld, and here I would like to pay tribute to the work the hon. member for Geduld has done in his constituency&#x2014;which overflows into mine&#x2014;in regard to industrial development and the conscientious and thorough manner in which he has tried to assist the position in that area. But in reply the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our policy is to establish key industries only, with the emphasis on key industries, like iron and petrol and oil, etc. I can assure the East Rand that I and my Department have done our utmost and if the municipalities assist us as they should do I am sure that we will be able to save the East Rand.</block>

<p>We very much appreciate those comments of the Minister, and feel sure that he will do everything he can to assist us in that regard. But I would like to ask him to apply these remarks of his where he says that he wants to establish industries like iron, petrol and oil. and to assist us in that regard and to consider the establishment of a third &#x201C;Iscor&#x201D; in the hinterland of the Far East Transvaal. Furthermore to take his suggestion in regard to petrol a stage further. Cannot a second &#x201C;Sasol&#x201D; be established on the Far East Rand? Because there you have unlimited supplies of cheap coal, and it lends itself ideally to the establishment of a new petrol factory. It is also in close proximity to Lourenco Marques and Witbank and there are no bottle-necks which will impede rail, or even road, traffic.</p>

<p>Then may I also ask whether the hon. the Minister of Transport will not play his role by immediately proceeding with the establishment of the suggested Welgedacht Railway Workshops which was on the Estimates some years ago, and which for reasons unknown to us, and which I must say has caused very much concern on the East Rand, has been held in abeyance and may not be proceeded with. The Railway workshops would bring considerable employment to skilled artisans. A further extension of the marshalling yards at Welgedacht will also assist us and it will bring a great deal of optimism to that area. We were privileged a few days ago to witness a very fine exhibition of films by the hon. the Minister of Information, which were certainly a credit to his Department and which I feel will be a credit to South Africa if viewed overseas. May I suggest to him that he give consideration to the possibility of getting a sound film made in colour of the East Rand and its potentialities, and have that exhibited overseas and also in this country, where I think the people should be enlightened as to the facilities available on the East Rand in order to assist us in attracting industries to that area.</p>

<p>With these brief comments at this particular stage I feel, however, that I would be lacking in my responsibility and not prepared to face the important issue which is one of the greatest handicaps to our area, if I did not make reference to the fact that industrialists are very much perturbed at the competition that they are likely to have in the industries which are going to be established in the border area. Whilst knowing the position and appreciating the need for decentralization&#x2014;an aspect I do not want to go into at this stage&#x2014;I do, however, want to make suggestions to the hon. the Prime Minister and the members of his Cabinet that if an unfavourable position is going to arise on the East Rand, as some people believe it will, that inducements similar to those now being made available to industrialists wishing to establish themselves in the border areas, should be made available to industrialists to establish themselves on the East Rand. If you make available only six out of the ten inducements and concessions which are made available to industrialists in the borders areas, you will overcome the problem of establishing industries on the East Rand. The worrying thought at the moment&#x2014;and I say it with all due responsibility&#x2014;is where are these new industries going to be established? In Brakpan, Boksburg, in Benoni <span class="col_623-624" refersTo="page_328"/>or in the Bundu? Whilst not considering myself, even in my weaker moments, to be a pessimist, I do feel that this is one of the matters where the Prime Minister and the members of his Cabinet can assist us. Whilst I have made reference to this one worrying aspect facing the East Rand at the moment, I feel I had to do so, because not to do so, would be like trying to play Hamlet without the prince. We hope to find a Prince Charming in the person of the hon. the Prime Minister and his Cabinet who in the same determined and bold manner in which he has applied himself recently to another national emergency could help us to bring optimism and a ray of hope to the East Rand.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to convey my hearty congratulations to the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) on his maiden speech but I must say at once that while he was speaking and I realized that my turn was approaching, I felt as though my senses had ceased to function and I could not properly follow everything that he said, but superficially it sounded like a very good speech to me and I wish to congratulate him and express the hope that his contributions in this House in the future will always be fruitful.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to a matter about which considerable concern has been expressed recently and that is the demographic position of the White man in the Cape. In recent times it has been pointed out repeatedly that as far as the numerical strength of the White man is concerned, his position in this part of the Republic is not a very happy one. It has been pointed out that during the period 1911-1960 the number of Whites in the Cape did not even double whereas it trebled in the Transvaal during the same period. Attention has also been drawn to the fact that as far as the density of population in the rural areas of the Cape is concerned the position of the Whites has been deteriorating to a disturbing extent. In 1911 the position in the Cape was that the density was about one person per square mile. This position deteriorated until in 1950 it was only .8 of a person per square mile. During the same period it increased in the Transvaal from 1.6 to 2.1 persons per square mile. It has also been pointed out that here in the heart of the Western Cape, one of our most important industrial areas, the White man finds that as far as the general composition of the population is concerned, his position is deteriorating to a disturbing extent. It has been pointed out that according to the latest census there is not a single town in the Cape where the Whites are still in the majority. All our towns, without exception, are becoming either Black or Brown. All those who are concerned about the future pattern in this province have been thinking deeply and seriously about this position in recent times. Analyses have been made to determine the cause of this phenomenon. Profound and far-reaching discussions have been held to ascertain what we can do to alleviate the situation. In this important debate the hon. the Minister of Lands, among others, made one important observation. In a moment of great wisdom he observed that in this part of the Republic the White man has never learned to ask for enough. In other words, much of the stagnation with which we have to cope is really due to one of the commendable characteristics of the Whites in this part of the country.</p>

<p>I should like to ask for something here today. I want to forget that independent spirit, that fine quality of our people, and I want to ask for something. I do it humbly but nevertheless with great expectations. I want to give my attention more specifically to the development of our West Coast. I want to ask for something on behalf of a certain complex along our West Coast, that is, the areas around Langebaan, Saldanha and Vredenburg, as far as Elands Bay and a little deeper into the interior of the country. Mr. Speaker, I want to ask impartially for five things to which I want the Government to give its immediate attention because if the five things for which I ask are given the energetic attention of the Government, I have no doubt that White initiative and numbers will be given a fresh impetus in those areas.</p>

<p>I should like to start at once with the first thing for which I want to ask and that is the extension of the West Coast road from Melkbosstrand to Saldanha Bay. The activities along the West Coast, beginning at Cape Town, have never terminated at Melkbos. On the contrary, the most important activities along the West Coast are to be found in this very complex that I have mentioned and from the point of view of defence it is absolutely essential that this road should be completed as soon as possible. I want to express the hope that the Government will bring pressure to bear upon the Provincial Administration to complete this road.</p>

<p>But it is not primarily because of its importance from the point of view of defence that I raise this matter. I feel that if this West Coast road can be completed it will give a fresh impetus to our very important tourist traffic in this vicinity, which in turn could give a new stimulus to this area. You may ask me, Mr. Speaker, what there is to interest a tourist on this colourless West Coast? I would point out that one of the most beautiful sea lakes in our country is to be found on the West Coast near Langebaan. This can be a stimulus as well as a challenge. It is a new paradise in developing our new water sports. But at the moment there is very little activity on this beautiful part of the coast. The only activity is that oyster shells are being removed from an old seabed to be ground up for poultry food. The tourist can also come and see one of the only two whaling stations in our country, where about 1,500 whales are processed annually. Here you can come and see how up to two tons of oil are sometimes extracted from the head of one whale. In this area one can come and see the beautiful buildings of the military academy and the Naval Gymnasium erected by my honoured predecessor <span class="col_625-626" refersTo="page_329"/>in 1951. In that year this institution began with about 44 trainees. This year the number that can be accommodated there is no less than 600. One can go there and see the harvest that the sea produces each year. Last year more than 532,000 tons of fish were processed in this area. The tourist can come and see the beautiful vista of flowers in this vicinity. With all due respect to my colleague from Namaqualand, people drive hundreds of miles every year to Namaqualand over bad roads to see the flowers. There are beautiful flowers there, but the most beautiful flowers imaginable are to be seen between Vredenburg and Elands Bay. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) has had a motion placed on the Order Paper dealing with the extermination of the seal. I do not know whether that motion of his will be accepted, but I would like to invite him to this region and derive pleasure from seeing thousands of glistening seals disporting themselves like children in the water. It is a beautiful sight, something to be seen by the tourist, and I would like to ask the Government, therefore, to exert pressure to bring about the completion of this West Coast road as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The second thing I ask for is the extension and development of the Saldanha harbour. It is an historical fact that if in the early years there had been water in the vicinity of Saldanha, Cape Town would never have developed at the foot of Table Mountain, the settlement would have developed at Saldanha, one of the best and most natural harbours on our coast. But is it not tragic that this gift of nature lies there comparatively unproductive? I would ask the Government in all modesty, therefore, to carry out further investigations into the further development of this natural harbour immediately. However. I admit at once that it can be argued that there is insufficient water for further development. That brings me to my next point, the third thing that I want to ask for and that is the further development of the Berg River in this area. It is a fact that every year thousands of gallons of water run through this region into the sea from the Berg River, and it is precisely because of this characteristic of not asking for enough that the Berg River&#x2019;s potential has never been fully developed. Accordingly I ask that the preliminary investigations which have already been carried out in connection with the building of a dam at Misverstand should be followed up and that this dam should be completed at this strategic place, which is indeed the only place where the water of the Berg River can be put to productive use. I predict that if the water can be dammed here a new industrial area can develop here. All the potentialities are there but it will have to be developed, and developed primarily with an eye to further industrial development in this area and not principally as an agricultural project.</p>

<p>Fourthly, I wish to ask that the old problem of the silting up of the mouth of the Berg River should receive earnest attention. This causes great inconvenience to the progressive fishing communities of Velddrift and Laaiplek, because of the new, bigger fishing boats which are being used and the fact that the river is subject to seasonal changes and tidal fluctuations which push the water 46 miles up the river. The University of Stellenbosch is at present engaged in investigating possible solutions of this problem. At the moment assistance is also being rendered by one of the French scientists. I simply want to ask that, if it can be proved that this river mouth can indeed be opened, the Government for its part will give every possible financial assistance.</p>

<p>Fifthly, I want to ask for further scientific and technical assistance for our fishing industry on the West Coast, the life artery of this area. It is a fact that the fishing industry is an important force in our economy and this force can assert itself even more strongly in the future. But on the other hand it is just as true that the possibility exists that this important industry will in the near future no longer be able to make its presence felt. If we think of what happened to the sardine shoals of California and of the appearance of Russian fishing boats in our fishing waters, if we think of the possible appearance of Ghanaian boats in our waters, and if we bear in mind that the much-discussed 12-mile limit is not necessarily a solution, because particularly the biggest shoals of fish are not necessarily to be found within the 12-mile limit but mostly beyond it, then this cannot to be looked to as the solution. Moreover, when we think that these foreign boats can fish throughout the year in these waters and that seasonal limits do not help us in this respect it seems that there is just one solution open to us and that is greater and better modernization of our fishing industry. There is unlimited scope in this respect. Therefore I ask the Government to give us greater technical and scientific assistance in order to modernize our fishing industry. I readily admit that since 1944, with the establishment of the Fisheries Development Corporation, the State has done a very great deal to assist our fishing industry, but the new challenges that face us make it essential that we devote fresh attention to our fishing industry in this region.</p>

<p>Having put forward these five requests, I leave it at that. I have not even come to the important diamond industry a little higher up the West Coast, but if the Government gives its sympathetic attention and also its active attention to the five things I have asked for, namely, the building of the West Coast road and its completion, the further extention of this, the most natural harbour on our coast, the building of a storage dam at Misverstand, the opening of the mouth of the Berg River and better and more extensive scientific assistance to our fishing industry, I maintain that it will give White initiative and White numbers in this area new vitality and fresh impetus.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is perhaps a little incongruous that one so young in parliamentary speaking as I am, should have the honour to congratulate the last two hon. members who spoke in this debate on their maiden speeches. Bearing in mind the trepidation which was no doubt apparent when I made my maiden speech, one cannot but admire the calm detachment, the happy choice of phrase, and the depth of intellect shown in the maiden speeches of those two hon. members. I think all hon. members will agree that they have set a high standard for those who follow them and that this hon. House will be blessed in its proceedings if the remainder of the maiden speeches achieve the high standard set by those two hon. members.</p>

<p>Sir, I have listened with great interest to a number of speeches made on the subject of the establishment of separate Bantu states which was outlined in the speech earlier by the hon. the Prime Minister. They were delivered with an air of detachment, they were delivered after a great deal of thought, but hon. members will forgive me if I speak on this subject with rather more feeling and considerably less detachment than has been exhibited so far by hon. members opposite. Because, Mr. Speaker, I represent Zululand. I come from Zululand. My forebears come from Zululand. Have hon. members opposite ever looked at a map which shows the position in Zululand and indeed in Natal of the Black and White areas? Have hon. members opposite ever given a moment&#x2019;s thought as to what, in terms of humanity, effect the implementation of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy will have on the people living there? It is all very well for those who are remote from the scene of those events, for those whose families will not be touched by the implementation of this policy, to stand up and argue from lofty motives and with great sincerity, how this is a solution to the problems which beset us. But, Mr. Speaker, before we accept that argument, let us analyse closely the practical effect it will have on the people I represent and compare the disruptions which will affect their lives and which will attend them as a result of this policy with what it will achieve in the sense of righting our troubles at the present time. Most hon. members opposite come from farming stock. The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) who has just interrupted is probably a farmer himself. I have no doubt that his roots are deep in the soil of this country, as were those of his forbears. I hope he has the same respect for a well-developed farm and for good farming folk that I have. How many hon. members opposite have ever been to Zululand? How many hon. members opposite have ever left the tarred road if they have ever been to Zululand? How many hon. members opposite realize that the greater part of Zululand was developed within a generation? I know of an old gentleman in Zululand&#x2014;and there are a number of them&#x2014;who something over 40 years ago went up there with an ox wagon and not much else by way of capital. He only had the oxen, the wagon and his own enterprise. And what happened? He was given a bare piece of land and to-day that bare piece of land is a flourishing farm with fine crops of sugar, with fat cattle, with a fine homestead, with nicely laid-out gardens; all built up by the enterprise of one man in Zululand within living memory during the last generation. Do hon. members opposite realize what it took to achieve that end in terms of ordinary human living? Do hon. members opposite realize that to achieve that end the person I speak of went through floods, droughts, locusts &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member says they have all been through it, but as has so rightly been pointed out, the hon. member is not going to have his whole future disrupted by these events. The gentleman to whom I have just referred happens to be my father. Do hon. members opposite realize why I speak with something less than detachment on this subject?</p>

<p>Now. Sir, what is the practical effect going to be of what the hon. the Prime Minister proposes? Has it struck hon. members that those who are to be displaced, those who are to have their land realized, those who are to be the subject of negotiations with some future government of the Bantu State for the purpose of consolidating it into economic units, are the people who are living on the eastern seaboard of this country and who consist almost exclusively of persons who do not support the policies of this Government? What has not been apparent in any speech so far made in this House by hon. members opposite, is that they appreciate the effect this will have, in terms of common humanity, on the people involved, both Black and White. Do hon. members realize that this realignment will affect not only Zululand, which is a constituency in which I am particularly interested, but virtually the whole of Natal? It is said that the actual realignment of the land is to be left for the future; that there is to be negotiations with the governments concerned as to what the actual boundaries will be and that things will remain as they are to-day and that the reserves will become independent states, but with their existing boundaries, until such time as the changes can be made. That presupposes, Sir, that there is no set plan at the present time. I do not believe it, Mr. Speaker. I do not believe that there is no set plan at the present time. It is quite inconsistent with what I have seen and read of the hon. the Prime Minister, that sort of thing should be left to chance. I am quite convinced that there is a plan at the present time, a blue print, which will indicate who is going to be displaced and who is not going to be displaced in Natal and the Eastern Province, but it will not be made public.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because there will be an <span class="col_629-630" refersTo="page_331"/>absolute outcry, not merely from the Blacks and Whites in Natal and in Zululand but from many of the Government&#x2019;s own supporters of the present time. Hon. members opposite dispute that. Let us look at the facts for a moment. I see the hon. the Minister of Lands is in the House at the present time. Why are we building a dam at Pongola costing some R25,000,000 or more if we do not know whether it is going to be in a Black or White area? Why have we built a Zulu university at Felixtown, right down in the southernmost part of Zululand, on the edge of a White area, if we do not know whether it is going to be in a Black State or a White State? Mind you, Sir, if the great bulk of the country&#x2019;s inhabitants can live outside it, I suppose there is no reason as to why its principal seat of learning should also be in a foreign country. Why, Sir, are we building a dam at Hluhluwe at a cost of some R600,000 if we do not know whether it is going to be in a Black or White area? No Government&#x2014;and I credit this Government with that much foresight&#x2014;will embark on public expenditure in a place such as Zululand which is a patch-work quilt of Black and White areas, unless it has a pretty shrewd idea of where the Black parts are going to be and where the White parts are going to be. Why are we not told these things, Sir? Why are the people of this country, and the people of those parts of the country in particular, not taken into the confidence of this Government so that they can order their affairs in advance? Is it thought for a moment that in Umtata in the Transkei the present White owners of land are going to be adequately compensated for what they have had up till now? The only utterance we had in that regard since I have been in this House, came from the hon. the Minister of Transport who said &#x201C;that will be adequately catered for.&#x201D; But, Sir, who is going to buy land in Umtata to-day? Those values have already started to decline. That must be so in the ordinary event of things. Those values have already started to decline and when compensation is paid, do not tell me it is going to be anti-dated as far as values are concerned to the time immediately preceding the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. That is one small centre; what price the bulk of the farming community in Natal and Zululand? What price their farms? Who is going to indulge in wholesale economic development when one does not know, according to the hon. the Prime Minister, whether one&#x2019;s land was going to be one&#x2019;s own in ten years&#x2019; time, whether the farm one has at present one is able to develop for the sake of one&#x2019;s children? Mr. Speaker, it is time these things were brought down to the level of the human being who is going to be affected. Let us not have so much of this airiness about this; let us not have so much of this argument as to whether or not this system will work; let us appreciate the fact that there are people in this country, good people, good South Africans, with their roots in the soil as strongly as hon. members opposite, who are going to be pushed about like pawns on a chessboard as a result of this scheme. It cannot be implemented otherwise and that is implicit in everything that has so far been said by hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>I have tried to give the House some indication of the strength of feeling which emanates from those of us who are very intimately affected by this. There are others. There is the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) whose family has been established there in farming as long as mine has at the other end of Natal. There are a great many other people who feel as strongly about this as I do. But now, is it all worth while? I am inclined to say to hon. members opposite: Very well, one section of the community can be asked to make this sacrifice if it is going to solve the problem. You can ask your fellow-compatriots to make sacrifices if you believe it is going to solve the problem. No matter how bad it may be, even if it is only one section of the population which is going to be asked to make that sacrifice, it is worth it if it will solve the difficulties we presently labour under. But Mr. Speaker, let us analyse for one moment this fantastic conception which is to the effect that you will satisfy absolutely the majority of non-Whites who are still going to live in South Africa by giving them votes in the Transkei. There are going to be elections, I take it. The detribalized non-Whites in South Africa are going to elect nine representatives to the parliament in the Transkei. There is going to be an election campaign. The candidates standing for those seats are going to campaign in Sophiatown, in Nyanga, in Langa and in those other places to be elected to the parliament in the Transkei. What do hon. members opposite imagine they are going to talk about? Are they going to talk about the cost of buying wives at Umtata; are they going to talk about land tenure in the Transkei? Are they going to talk about the building of roads in the Transkei? They are going to talk about the disability under which the people in White South Africa suffer, otherwise they will not get a vote.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister realizes that fact, and that is quite apparent in the constitution that has been drafted because they are given only nine elected representatives in a House consisting of 150. He realizes the danger which those people will be towards his tribal hierarchy in the Transkei. What do hon. members think those people are going to do <i>vis-a-vis</i> their tribal chiefs in the Transkei? There is going to be a division of opinion between the elected representatives from the towns, the townees, that is, the sophisticated, the emancipated non-European, and the nominated tribal chiefs nominated by hon. members opposite. And the nine representatives representing the detribalized Natives will not be satisfied until they have the majority in the Transkeian Parliament. And having achieved the majority in that parliament they will then bring pressure to bear on the situation in this country. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the serious and sincere arguments advanced by the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder), who is unfortunately not here at the moment. He argued quite frankly and with evident sincerity from a rather lofty standpoint&#x2014;he can do so because he is not intimately affected&#x2014;on how this was a solution to our problems. He said&#x2014;and his phrase was quite a telling one in regard to the other parts of the world where there has been this inter-play between Black and White&#x2014;&#x201C;die witman is uitgeskakel.&#x201D; That is a telling phrase because that is exactly what is going to be done to the &#x201C;witman&#x201D; in Zululand and Natal. Every argument my learned friend used to support the motion that they had been unfairly done by is valid as far as my constituency is concerned. But he went on and he made a great point of the fact that there had always been this conflict in the parliamentary field between Black and White, and he dealt with most of the colonial nations and their dependencies and he said that no non-European would be satisfied until he had the majority in the domestic Parliament and that being so you could not keep control. There is one factor he overlooked and it is an argument we can now use against hon. members opposite because they have used it for so long against our critics from overseas. The argument is this: No other country in the world is like South Africa; no other country in the world has a permanent established White population; no other country in the world which is faced with this problem has a White population which is sufficiently strong to stand up for itself, which has been associated so long with the non-European and, apart from a few agitators, by and large has the respect of the non-European; no other country in the world is faced with the situation where you have a White population having the respect of its non-Europeans, who can take the non-Europeans with it provided they are treated properly. That, Sir, is the big difference between South Africa and the various states which the hon. member has mentioned. We are still in control of this country; the Government opposite controls the affairs in this country. This country has been controlled by the White man for 300 years. We have always had a majority of non-Europeans. Why this constant preoccupation with votes such as the Progressive Party has? Why limit your attention, so far as devising a solution is concerned, merely to the question of votes? Do hon. members opposite imagine that when the 30,000 non-Europeans marched on this House last year, if the Prime Minister had stood up and said: &#x201C;I will give you votes in the Transkei&#x201D; they would have said &#x201C;three cheers for the Nationalist Party&#x201D;? The reason why those people marched was partly as a result of political agitation. I think most of us will concede that. But that agitation had the effect that they were able to be led by the person who did it, because they were not satisfied in the field of jobs, housing, transport, having their families living with them. [Interjections.] Most of the hon. members opposite are either employers of labour in the industrial sphere or on their farms. When hon. members opposite have problems with their non-European labourers, is it because they want votes? No, it is because some domestic issue which affects them intimately needs to be put right. And hon. members solve that problem by dealing with that domestic issue as a father does with his family. Do hon. members opposite not realize that it is those issues that require to be solved and it is the solving of those issues that will enable us to continue in control in this country as we have always been. Hon. members opposite are going the same way as the Progressive Party are going in that they place such a great emphasis on the vote. But that gets nobody anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I began by saying that this policy would be worth while if it solved the problems which beset us. It is no good hon. members getting up and saying that black is white. No matter how sincere the argument may be, no matter how vigorous they be in their arguments, if the thing can be demonstrated to be patently unworkable, if it is quite patently no answer at all, no matter how often they repeat it, it won&#x2019;t help. And that is why the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech has had the damp reaction overseas it has had at the present time. May I say this, that I think that when hon. members opposite go back to their constituencies and raise this issue on its merits, as those of us on this side of the House did at the election&#x2014;which, of course, they will not believe&#x2014;they will find that the reaction amongst a great many of their supporters will be as damp as that accorded the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech abroad.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that I cannot follow the hon. member for Zululand <span class="col_633-634" refersTo="page_333"/>(Mr. Cadman) in this serious and important debate. Instead of doing that, I want to take you to the calm plains of South West Africa, where we are now so badly stricken by pests. When I was faced with the choice of standing for election to this House or remaining in the Legislative Assembly, there was one decisive factor, and that is that no matter how important the work of the Legislative Assembly there is, the future of South West Africa will in the last instance be decided by this Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. And irrespective of the political and international aspect of South West Africa&#x2019;s relationship with the Republic, there is the other factor that, except in certain instances, South West Africa is entirely dependent on South Africa in many respects, for example in the case of forestry, defence, the police force, aviation, etc., to mention but a few, and also veterinary services. I want to avail mayself of this opportunity to thank the Government for the valuable services rendered by Onderstepoort when we had the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in South West Africa. Especially do I want to thank the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services for his personal endeavours in this connection.</p>

<p>I want to testify personally that not only the Whites, but also the non-Whites, except for a very small number, do realize the value of the connection with South Africa. Since I am now speaking here for the first time as the representative of a South West constituency, I should not like to confine myself to local matters only. I should like to deal with the position of South West Africa in relation to the United Nations Organization, but for understandable reasons I cannot do so. As you know, a case has been brought against South Africa in the International Court, and no matter what people here or outside this country may do, I intend to observe the <i>sub judice</i> rule. This rule is acknowledged by the courts of all civilized countries and it is observed by the Press; people in public life also abide by it in their public speeches. Consequently I do not want to deal with that aspect. From Press reports in connection with the recent session of UNO it appears, however, that nowithstanding protests by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, members of the Afro-Asiatic countries in their speeches still dealt specifically with these matters which constitute the dispute between ourselves and Liberia and Ethiopia and in connection with which we have been taken to the International Court In connection with UNO I also want to express thanks to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of South West Africa, and to assure him that we in South West appreciate it very much that he stated our case so strongly at the United Nations. We also want to thank the hon. the Prime Minister for this assurance that he will not leave South West Africa in the lurch. I also want to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the hon. the Prime Minister for appointing a Deputy Minister for South West Africa Affairs. That gives us direct access to the Cabinet. Then, Mr. Speaker, I want to put forward this request to members of this hon. House that in all their deliberations, especially where South West Africa is concerned, they should consider the population of South West Africa as their fellow-South Africans, fellow-South Africans whose interests and aspirations are to co-operate in future with the Government of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. du P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to the hon. member for Omaruru (Mr. Frank) on his maiden speech. He made a constructive contribution, and the House therefore listened to him with great attention. Since the Omaruru constituency wanted to elect a Nationalist, I may as well congratulate the constituency also on the fact that they elected him.</p>

<p>When the hon. the Prime Minister spoke last week in the opening debate of this Session, he made certain statements with which one can either agree or disagree, but in respect of which nobody can remain cold and indifferent. I myself, Mr. Speaker, have been on the floor of this House for 12 years, and I also sat in the Press gallery for a few years. During this period I have seen every Prime Minister in action, with the exception of Gen. Botha, and I must say that in various respects the speech which the hon. the Prime Minister made last Tuesday is one of the most remarkable that I have ever heard. Its remarkableness does not lie, however, in the announcement as to what is going to happen to the Transkei, because the Transkei, as long as I can remember, has always had a distinctive political personality. The remarkableness of this speech lies in the words and the propositions with which the Prime Minister sought to justify his announcement. If what he said, and if what the President said in his speech in opening Parliament, a speech which the hon. the Prime Minister asked us to to read in conjunction with his speech on Tuesday, is to be regarded and accepted according to the true meaning of words, then in actual fact the hon. the Prime Minister on Tuesday last announced more far-reaching policy changes for his party than those announced by any Prime Minister over a long period of years, as far as I can remember. I mean that in a friendly sense, of course, because I have always believed that the further and the sooner the Prime Minister can get away from the old attitudes adopted by his party and the Government in the past, the better it will be for South Africa and for all of us. Firstly, according to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s words, we have now at last reached the position where the Government openly admits that White domination has become untenable and must be rejected as a slogan, as a policy and as a principle. For years members of the Government party thumped on election tables and preached raw White domination. As a member of the Government party at that time I always strongly <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_334"/>opposed it, and members on the other side will recall what dire trouble I had with the party leadership because I urged the rejection of the principle of White domination and its substitution by a policy of striving for White survival, which is at least permissible and can be justified on moral grounds.</p>

<p>I can only say that I am thankful that at last we have come to the turning point, although for the greater part it is still just a promise, the complete fulfilment of which probably still lies quite a long way ahead. Secondly the hon. the Prime Minister has now accepted that discrimination on the ground of race or colour only is no longer defensible and that we must get away from it. As to the method by which it is to be done, there is still a great difference of opinion, but these differences in method are not of primary importance; what is of primary importance is the fact that if one atrributes their usual meaning to his words, he now admits that discrimination on the ground of race or colour only has become untenable and irreconcilable with the principle of Western Government. And let the hon. the Prime Minister have no doubt on this score that he will be required, in season and out of season, to implement what he has now started to preach.</p>

<p>There has been a further shifting of emphasis and of policy on the part of the Prime Minister. Last year he started to paint pictures for the Coloureds and Indians of different States within the same State, and in an incomprehensible way he started talking about full political rights for these people, just as full as for the Whites, in separate Parliaments which would operate, the one with the other, in the same area. The hon. the Prime Minister must have noticed that his colleagues in the Cabinet, his newspapers and his candidates shied away from this during the election; nobody was anxious to propagate this message and to explain away the inexplicable part of it. That is why the hon. the Prime Minister, quite courageously, has now abandoned the idea of doing away with the representatives of the Coloureds, as he did in 1959 with the Natives&#x2019; representatives. Mr. Speaker, his intention to abolish them was never in doubt. His speeches in this House on 10 and 11 April of last year left no doubt as to his line of thinking, and even as recently as after the election in October last year, he stated pertinently that this Parliament must be representative of Whites only. I am not interested in making a debating point out of this. The fact is that on Tuesday the Prime Minister promised that this Parliament would continue to remain representative of the Coloureds also as long as he had anything to do with it. In other words this Parliament remains the Parliament of the Coloureds, just as it is the Parliament of the Whites, and clearly the myth that this Parliament is the White man&#x2019;s Parliament now falls away. The White man and the Coloured rule together here and exercise joint control, each through his own representation, however unsatisfactory the nature of that representation may be to the Coloureds at the moment. The apex of the Coloured&#x2019;s political pyramid is and remains in this Parliament therefore, and because this fact can no longer be argued away, the hon. the Prime Minister, when he spoke on Tuesday, did not repeat the pretence of full political rights and control for the Coloureds and Indians in states and Parliaments at the same level as this Parliament. Outside this Parliament they will now only get what he described on Tuesday as &#x201C;maximum opportunities of self-government&#x201D;, that is to say, as much self-government as may be possible in the limited local sphere.</p>

<p>In the last instance, the hon. the Prime Minister has now also admitted candidly in word and in deed that South Africa&#x2019;s position in the community of nations has become so critical that we can no longer continue on the old political paths. The old challenging attitude has disappeared. The Prime Minister now concedes that although no country can allow itself to be dictated to from outside, sensible government does require that world opinion and world revolutions, particularly those affecting human relationships cannot be ignored with impunity. But there is one thing that must be clear to this Government and that is that the Prime Minister and his Government must bear the main responsibility for the critical position in which South Africa finds herself internationally. For example, it is becoming clearer every day what a disaster our expulsion from the Commonwealth was. It was a disaster not because the Commonwealth is such an indispensible organization but as a result of the implication that it contained, and that is that even an old and comparatively conservative alliance such as the Commonwealth was no longer prepared to have the political company of this Government of ours, and, as we predicted, the Commonwealth&#x2019;s example is now being followed relentlessly and systematically by one international organization after another. Just a week or two ago the doors to the International Tele-Communications meeting in Dakar were barred to our delegation, and knowing what lay in store for it at the forthcoming meeting of the C.C.T.A., the Government timeously decided to follow the energetic policy of staying at home. Mr. Speaker, our complete compulsion from the world community has now clearly become just a matter of time under the present Government. This country is paying for the Government it has and it is paying dearly.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister does his best to try to create the impression that the difficulty really is that we have to contend with one inexorable demand made upon us on all sides and by everybody, and that is to concede the principle of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. As a matter of fact, this has become the main theme of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s internal propaganda nowadays, but it is irreconcilable with facts. The simple truth is that there are really few countries in the world where the principle <span class="col_637-638" refersTo="page_335"/>of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; is fully observed. I do not deny that there are leaders who deliberately make the most impossible demands. In politics one will always get this sort of strategy, but at the time of our expulsion from the Commonwealth and thereafter, no such demand was made upon us by Britain; no such demand was made upon us by New Zealand; no such demand was made upon us by Australia, and Canada made no such demand upon us. Canada&#x2019;s Prime Minister said, &#x201C;Give the Natives four representatives in your Parliament and I shall be satisfied.&#x201D; America has not demand this; France has made no demand of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. The leaders of the West have never demanded that South Africa should follow the system of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. And, after all, it is the friendship of these people that we are seeking, not in the first place the friendship of Russia and of the Afro-Asian states. But even amongst them we had the case of Malaya whose Prime Minister openly admitted that in his own country he did not have the system of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;, and that if we in South Africa gave only ten representatives of the non-Whites a seat in Parliament, he would be satisfied with our continued membership of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, I know of no public statement in which anyone of the other countries of the Commonwealth has made such a demand upon us as the only price for our continued membership. No, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s propaganda is in conflict with the actual facts. The principle of &#x201C;the full vote for every person&#x201D; has never been put forward as an inexorable demand by the democracies, and every reasonable person admits that in the existing circumstances South Africa cannot accept such a thing. But a country can be governed by the elite and still bear a democratic character if that elite acts in such a way and administers the country in such a way that there is a proper recognition of the interests and wishes and feelings of the rest of the population. And, Mr. Speaker, it is in this connection unfortunately that this Government failed and did the harm to our country that brought us to the brink of the precipice. Aggressive White domination was loudly proclaimed from the roof-tops. For years all the emphasis was placed on White interests only. The small degree of joint control that the non-Whites had, in quite an indirect way, in the administration of this country, was gradually and systematically curtailed and destroyed. One vested right after another was unilaterally and unnecessarily removed. And to crown everything one injustice after another was perpetrated in the name of apartheid against the non-Whites. To the detriment of all of us, the Government always refused to realize that if you humiliate a person and discriminate against him with punitive measures, purely on the ground of his colour, you hurt the dignity of every person of colour in the world. In other words, discrimination of this nature could never remain a domestic matter because it affects every person in the world and the whole of mankind.</p>

<p>My time is limited, but I shall reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question, because I know what his question is. The charge is often made against me that I supported many of these apartheid measures. No one denies that the Government&#x2019;s programme of apartheid also had and still has its positive aspects, and those I naturally supported. But as far as the negative and ugly aspects of apartheid is concerned, I accepted as most according to the way in which the parliamentary system works, those measures which I as an individual had no power to prevent or change. My enthusiasm in the sphere of separate development was always confined to one thing only, and that is the imaginative development of the Bantu areas in accordance with the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission &#x2026;</p>

<p>Although I ceasely advocated that policy, I received very little support in my time neither from the caucus of the National Party or from the hon. member over there. In any event, I always said that apartheid should not be viewed as a principle but as a method, a method which should be changed as and when it became necessary and as the circumstances made that course desirable. The hon. the Minister of Finance underlined this and described the policy of apartheid as nothing more than an experiment; and an experiment is something which may or may not succeed and which should continually be revised in the light of experience. But unfortunately the Government&#x2019;s party made almost a sacred principle out of apartheid; they introduced it in season and out of season and tried to maintain it at every possible and impossible level of human <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_336"/>relationships. The result of that is that we are experiencing one international crisis after another, as we have again experienced now as a result of the stupidity of the leaders of the National Party in the City Council of Pretoria in regard to the Japanese swimmers and as a result of the harmful decision made every now and then by the Minister of Community Development in regard to golf tournaments. It is in this field of policy that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s greatest test is going to lie&#x2014;not in connection with the Transkei, but in this field of policy. Because in point of fact the kernel of our troubles, internally and abroad, lies in all these unnecessary apartheid laws and in all the harmful practices associated with it and the bad relationships that it causes in our every-day life. The Government tries to create the impression that its limited action in the Transkei will ward off the danger in which we find ourselves, and I think it is necessary that the public should be disillusioned in that regard as soon as possible. The positive steps that we shall have to take go much further than the 1,250,000 Xhosas of the Transkei. Well, it is quite a fair request on the part of the Government that those who criticize should also be prepared to state their own positive attitude, and as one who has criticized and who strongly criticizes the Government, I am prepared to do so.</p>

<p>First of all I believe that all apartheid legislation and regulations should be thoroughly revised, and I believe that this can best be done by a commission consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament. This, and not the question of franchise, should receive preference over everything else. The object of it should be to remove from the Statute Book as soon as possible those measures which are unjust, which are humiliating to the non-Whites, which cause them hardships on the ground of colour and which only poison race relationships without solving a single problem. I concede that our circumstances are not such that we can do everything fully overnight, but the ideal should be stated and recognized that compulsory legal State discrimination in everyday relationships, compulsory legal discrimination on the ground of colour&#x2014;not on the ground of merit or on the ground of education or health or anything else, but on the ground of colour alone&#x2014;should disappear as soon as possible. I do not say that because I have supposedly swung to the Left. I raised this matter in this House last year already. Throughout the election campaign I enunciated the same view, when organized gangs did not prevent me from speaking. I said everywhere, and I repeat it here this evening, that compulsory apartheid here in South Africa causes the same trouble that is caused by compulsory integration in the South of America. It is the element of legal, State compulsion and the accompanying criminal penalties which cause all the hatred and tension here, just as they cause hatred and tension in the South of America. I believe that the policy that we ought to follow is to reject both, namely compulsory apartheid and compulsory integration. The trend that we should follow is one of natural human relationships. Race relationships should as far as possible be governed by custom, by individual preference and natural conduct. Compulsory apartheid as a means of regulating human relationships is simply not a success. The problem is not how to live separately but how to live together. To mention just one example, surely there is no merit or logic in the proposition that the place of entry into a Government building should be determined according to the colour of a person&#x2019;s skin. If he wants to buy a stamp, the non-White has to enter here and the White man there, but if he wants to buy clothing, if he wants to buy clothing at a shop belonging to a Nationalist Member of Parliament, then there are not two different entrances, one for him and one for the White man. There are Members of Parliament over there who have shops and who do not follow the policy of their own Government by seeing to it that they have different entrances for Whites and non-Whites.</p>

<p>There are two members over there from South West Africa, and one of them already has one foot in the Cabinet. Mr. Speaker, this Government is the only Government in Southern Africa which forces this humiliating practice upon people, to mention just one of many examples. There is a multitude of other unnecessary things that we ought to get rid of. The furthest that the State ought to go in regulating race relationships, is to allow facilities to people and to groups of people to follow their conventional way of living. Just as the individual ought to be free to follow his own way of living in his home and in his circle of friends, so a group of people, any association or any corporation of people, ought to be free to arrange their facilities according to their own taste and their own way of living. For example, a sports corporation controlling a swimming bath should be free to reserve it for Whites if it wishes to do so, just as it ought to be free to reserve it for non-Whites if it wishes to do so. The same should apply to school associations controlling the education of children, and to housing corporations controlling estates and residential areas. Everyone should be free to reserve what is his, either for Whites or for non-Whites; and I believe that this is the pattern according to which race relationships will have to be regulated in South Africa in the future if we want peace and quiet here and if we are to have any hope of living together on a decent basis with the nations of the rest of the world: No compulsory apartheid and no compulsory integration. I believe that the State should stop interfering in private relationships between people. Civil organizations will more and more have to take the place of State organizations, the State acting only as advisor and as the body which grants financial assistance.</p>

<p><span class="col_641-642" refersTo="page_337"/>The hon. the Prime Minister has ventured to subscribe to the ideal that discrimination on the ground of race or colour alone should be done away with. We all welcome this great forward step, but until such time as it becomes clear that the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government are striving to achieve this everywhere, and with expedition and sincerity, no confidence can be placed in this Government.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the first step in the direction of positive policy which I think should receive priority if we want to restore our position in the world. The second is an honest review of the position of the Coloured and Indian minorities in our country, and especially that of the Coloureds. Mr. Speaker, if the Government Party sincerely believe in the feasibility of its policy for the Bantu, if it sincerely believes that it will be able to carry out its policy for the Bantu in such a way that the Natives are satisfied politically without affecting the political position of the White man, if it really believes that it will be able to carry it out in this way, then the hon. the Prime Minister has reduced the whole problem of political relations in South Africa to a matter of 3,000,000 Whites as against two minority groups, that is, 1,500,000 Coloureds and 500,000 Indians. Mr. Speaker, as compared with the Whites, the Coloureds and South Africans of Indian descent remain positive minorities, not majorities, and there can be no question of their being a threat therefore, fore. One can argue that the numerically superior Bantu are a political threat, but one cannot say that a minority of 1,500,000 Coloureds represents a threat to the position and the survival of the White man. The Government should tell us now whether it believes in its policy. Does it believe that it will satisfy the Bantu politically on a separate basis? I think it believes that it will. Then the Whites who number 3,000,000 will only have against them two small minorities, a Coloured minority and a minority consisting of South African Indians. A denial of reasonable rights to them therefore can be based only on unreasonable prejudice and aversion to colour and on a desire to dominate, all of which it should be possible to surmount in a civilized community if the State wishes to provide leadership. I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister pertinently: Is he going to treat the Coloureds who are so close to the White man and many of whom are descendants of the White man, who have leaders of high quality, and who are a minority group and are accordingly no threat to the survival of the White man and who as far as numbers are concerned are not even half as strong as the White man, is he going to treat them more badly and offer them less than he is offering the tribal Bantu of the Transkei? Is he going to be so unreasonable, so unfair and is he going to deviate so much morally? Is he going to show less courage in respect of the Coloureds than in respect of the problem of the Bantu? Mr. Speaker, in South Africa, there is room only for big thinking and fearless action. The Coloureds cannot obtain a separate territory, nor a separate Parliament and therefore cannot have separate freedom. The realization of their highest political aspirations will have to take place within the framework of this parliamentary machinery, and we now wait for the hon. the Prime Minister to show great courage and to abandon any idea of political puppetry for the Coloureds, which will not stand the test of time, and to grant them direct representation in Parliament by their own people.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Prime Minister can sit down with Coloureds in another place across the road and consult there with them about political affairs, then they might just as well sit here with him, and with us all, and consult with us here about political affairs. There is no difference in principle. There is no difference in principle whether a part of Parliament sits with the Council for Coloured Affairs or whether a part of the Council sits here. Why cannot there be direct Coloured Representation here? If the hon. the Prime Minister is not prepared to do this, then no value can be attached to his verbal rejection of White supremacy. As a second positive step, therefore I ask for full political association of the Coloured minority with the White majority.</p>

<p>Lastly, the White man&#x2019;s dilemma in South Africa is that he really wants to be fair to the Bantu, but that he is scared to death, and perhaps has reason to be afraid that his political rights will be engulfed by the numerically superior Bantu. Because we must accept that as time goes by, we shall have an ever-increasing class of civilized Bantu from whom political rights cannot be withheld in the long run; and it is obvious that if we can find a way by which the whole or a large part of the Bantu majority can be politically satisfied in a manner which will not affect the political position of the Whites, that way will have to be followed with all the risks which may be attached to it. For there is simply no policy that can be devised which from the White&#x2019;s point of view is not laden with risks, whatever one may call it. It is for this reason that I have followed the SABRA direction from the time of my entry into Parliament, that I have accepted the salient features of the Tomlinson report and continually pleaded for the speedy and largescale social, economic and constitutional development of the existing Bantu areas, in other words, for the natural development of a system which had already started with Rhodes.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has now proposed a step which is in this direction and builds on it and which will have a twofold effect, and that is to grant political advancement to a part of the Bantu majority in the country, a part consisting of 1,250,000, without directly affecting the political position of the White man, and in this way to open for a part of the Bantu the necessary avenues for political training; and secondly, to lessen the political pressure of the Bantu on the White man to some extent. The overall problem is <span class="col_643-644" refersTo="page_338"/>not solved by this, or even nearly solved, but I admit that it is being relieved and diminished. I cannot, therefore, oppose the general outline of the plan for the Transkei. I cannot oppose what I have propagated for a long time. I do not bind myself regarding the details of the Transkeian plan. One will have to see it in its entirety and study it when it has been put before us in writing. In any case, one would first of all have to take note of the wishes, desires and aspirations of the Xhosas in the Transkei. As far as the ultimate object of full independence and the Prime Minister&#x2019;s idea of a premiers&#x2019; conference as the only political link between us and those areas, are concerned, these are things which cannot come overnight and for this reason I do not wish to make it the main feature of the debate. Personally I have always propagated the development of a confederation of states and communities in which the emphasis will fall on co-operation as regards common economic factors and other matters of common interest such as security, but below that, a degree of sovereignity for the co-operating units that will not result in pushing out the White man and making him politically powerless as far as his own people are concerned. I still think that this is the direction which should be followed and which should be encouraged in respect of the Transkei. The federal direction is the most flexible system. It has a wide variety of possibilities. Every federation in the world is different from the others, and it is interesting that even Dr. Malan had the federal direction in mind and said so positively in a letter which he wrote to the Reverend Piersma in America regarding his policy. Anyway, I believe that it is not the Prime Minister, but the success or otherwise which will be achieved by the first steps towards self government which will determine the ultimate pattern.</p>

<p>One of the most important implications of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s proposals is that he and his party now recognize and accept the South African Native who is on the bottom rung of the ladder, as worthy of political rights and as politically mature. The Government has always been very critical of the granting of self-government to Africans and African states before they are ripe for it. Its willingness and hastiness to grant democratic self-government to the Natives of the reserves clearly implies that it now regards the South African Native as politically mature. This is a definite advance as far as the Government is concerned. But the result of this is going to be that from now on and immediately there will be tremendous pressure from all non-Whites who are more developed for the granting of political rights to them, and the Prime Minister will have no moral argument with which to oppose it; and it will come especially from the Coloureds and the Indians and those Bantu who were born and grew up outside the reserves and who are settled here permanently.</p>

<p>Generaly speaking, I approve of the first steps which are contemplated for the Transkei. The real test for us here and overseas will not lie in the handling of the reserves, will not lie in the Transkei or any of the other reserves. The real test for us will lie in the handling of the population groups outside the Bantu areas and the compatibility of our legislation dealing with human relationships. That is the field in which we shall have to make adjustments and in which we shall have to make sacrifices if there are to be sacrifices. In a country such as South Africa with all its enormous problems there is no place for small thinking or for small solutions. We shall have to think big and take big chances and have less fear for the future if we want to get anywhere, and because there are so very few signs to me that the Government is prepared to think big and act big in the field in which our real problems lie. I propose, when the House divides, whatever the terms of the amendment may be, to declare my explicit lack of confidence in the Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I think there is only one person in this House who can be congratulated and that is the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), because the hon. member for Houghton is also making an experiment, she is experimenting with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). Hitherto the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has made an experimental existence in politics. In the past he experimented with the United Party, then he thought it would be wise to return to the National Party and to experiment there, then he wanted to become a prophet but the prophet of those days misread the signs of the times; he read the signs of the time to mean that we had reached a turning point, that South Africa was about to divert from the direction as indicated by the National Party and that he would be the first person to come forward as the new leader along the new road. He then made another experiment and that experiment was in the direction of the United Party and now he tells us that he is experimenting back to Rhodes. He is back with Rhodes to-day and will conduct his experiment towards the Progressive Party from that point. It is clear, therefore, that the only person who can pat herself on the back this evening is the absent hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout who has just sat down presented us with a very wonderful policy, a Utopian policy, the old Smuts policy of <i>laisser-faire.</i> That is the policy under which you govern a country without legislation. No legislation to bring about apartheid, nor any legislation to bring about segregation. That is the Utopian land that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout holds out to us. I do not think the House is very interested in the weight which that hon. member carries in the political life of our country to-day. I do not know whether he himself knows what his political weight is, but it is <span class="col_645-646" refersTo="page_339"/>only a matter of time before he goes over to the Progressive Party as prominent members of his party have already done. Hon. members opposite have reason to regret that they have allowed themselves during the recent election to be taken by the arm by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>So far not a single word has been said in this debate about economic issues. I do not want to go against the trend of the debate by talking about financial matters because we may still have one or two speeches on that subject. In passing, however, I just want to point out that there was a good message as far as confidence in South Africa is concerned, in the message of the hon. the Minister of Finance. The fact did not pass unnoticed that this country has strong foreign exchange reserves in spite of all the predictions from that side of the House, and more countries are prepared to-day to lend money to South Africa and that there are even foreigners today who want to own Republican gold sovereigns. But it is interesting to note that those hon. members opposite who have spoken so far are only interested in those gold sovereigns.</p>

<p>This debate has been coupled to the important speech which the hon. the Prime Minister made in this House a few days ago. On that occasion the hon. the Prime Minister stated that we were living in very serious times and that difficult problems were besetting us. He added that whatever we wanted to do during this period, we would have to follow a difficult road and that we would also encounter administrative and other difficulties along that road. He said, however, that the solving of those problems was a challenge to us. It was in that spirit that he presented the problem to us to-day as he saw it. He said that in these times we should take note of world tendencies and also that whatever we wanted to do, we would have to do hurriedly. We should bear in mind the fact that since the last war we have been confronted with a new demand, that was a political demand and not a demand for the upliftment of the smaller countries in the economic field. This is the political demand to which the Prime Minister coupled his speech. I am sorry that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) had to carry on with the debate to-day. He spoke in a superficial manner which is not worthy of this House and in present-day times, definitely not worthy of South Africa. He made the remark that the hon. the Prime Minister had been forced to &#x201C;appease world opinion&#x201D;. He also referred sneeringly to the attempts that the Government was trying to make these days to present South Africa&#x2019;s case in the best possible light to the world outside considering the times in which we were living. This spirit of defeatism which this hon. member revealed to-day is really based on an acceptance of the inevitable. You ask yourself why hon. members opposite argue the way they have argued to-day and you look for a motive. I think the motive should be sought in the fact that they no longer have any faith in themselves and that they no longer believe that anything can happen to save South Africa. Their defeatism rests on the inevitable&#x2014;nothing that can be done will save us. I make bold to say that they no longer voice the opinion of their constituents. Last year the voters had an opportunity of giving judgment. Nor do they talk with a view to the interests of South Africa, but they talk with a view to the world outside. They are hoping that things will turn against us and that they will be able to step forward and say that they have been the champions against the Government and that they have already cleared the road for themselves. I accuse them of this that their attitude is one of defeatism, or that they no longer have any faith and that they do not want to do anything to help this side of the House to govern the country. We take exception to that because by doing that they do an injustice to South Africa.</p>

<p>These remarks by the hon. member and his attempt to belittle everything that the Government intends doing, reveal to me the direction all their speeches will take in future debates&#x2014;this belittling of the steps announced by the Government to develop the Transkei. It is interesting to note that it was that side of the House that told us in the past <i>ad nauseum</i> that this Government did not intend spending what the Tomlinson Commission recommended in its report should be spent. How often were we not told that it was not the Government&#x2019;s intention to spend the R200,000,000 which the Tomlinson Commission recommended? And when it appeared from the plans of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development that it was intended to spend R114,000,000 over the next five years, what happened then? Then the hon. member for Yeoville belittled it. And what does the hon. member for Constantia do&#x2014;I am tempted to say the Jeremiah of Constantia? He immediately complains and asks: &#x201C;How can you spend that seeing that the White people of this country have to pay for it?&#x201D; We must not lose sight of this fact, Mr. Speaker, that the money to be spent in the Bantu areas will have a cumulative effect. Anybody who knows anything about economic and financial matters, knows that when you spend R10 that is not the end of the story, but that the R10 you have spent acts as a snowball and creates more money. The amount of R114,000,000 that is proposed to be spent on the Bantu homelands is not the only thing that this Government is going to do. That is simply an instalment. It is also obvious that when you spend money on such an undeveloped area like the Transkei, you cannot spend faster than the absorptive capacity of that area. You cannot pour endless amounts of money into such an area without taking into account the fact that there must be a structure&#x2014;an infra-structure, a basic structure&#x2014;to regulate and organize the community. Once you have that the necessary <span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_340"/>production factors have to be present before further investment will be possible. When hon. members opposite come forward and refer sneeringly to the R114,000,000, they do not realize to what extent capital investment in under-developed areas initiates further economic activity.</p>

<p>Hon. members launched a further attack on the plan of the Government. They said that many Bantu were to-day living in White areas and not in the Bantu areas and that they have, therefore, severed all ties with their homelands. In the first place we deny this suggestion that all the Bantu who live outside the Bantu areas to-day are detribalized people, people who have no contact with those areas or who have no desire to return to them. I maintain that the majority of those Bantu whom hon. members opposite describe as detribalized, are not detribalized. I admit that a very small percentage of them may perhaps be detribalized Bantu but the majority of them recognize their tribal ties, are proud of them and maintain them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has referred to Rhodesia as an example of what will happen if the Government implemented its plans. He held out Rhodesia as an example of what could happen if the Government&#x2019;s policy were implemented. But what is being done in Rhodesia, Mr. Speaker, is United Party policy and not National Party policy. But they have a federation there, an attempt to create a political unit, just as the United Party is trying to create in South Africa; a federation that has failed. The legislation that hon. members opposite want to have repealed does not exist in Rhodesia&#x2014;with pitiful consequences to the White man. Do they not read their newspapers and do they not know what is happening there? Do they not know that the White people in Rhodesia are terrified today and are counting the years that they will still be allowed to live there? Surely that is not National Party policy? Surely that is not a policy whereby the White people live on one side enjoying their rights, and the Bantu on the other side enjoying their rights. Can we quote a better example than precisely the Federation of Rhodesia to prove that the policy of hon. members is proving to be a failure?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also objected to the fact that we wanted to give the Bantu political rights. By doing so the hon. member has proved that he has made a quick change of course because hon. members opposite were the people who told us in the past that they did not want to be socially uplifted or that they did not want assistance in the economic field, but the vote. Hon. members told us <i>ad nauseum</i> that nothing we did would help, because we did not want to give political rights to the non-Whites. Do they deny that they said that? Do they deny that in the past their strongest attack against us was that we did not want to make political concessions to the non-Whites. But now that the Government gives political rights to the Bantu but in their own areas and not in the White area, it is no longer any good. The hon. member for Yeoville now tells us that what the Bantu really needs is to be socially uplifted. He continued and mentioned a number of problems all of an administrative nature, problems that could be replied to had time permitted it.</p>

I want to tell the hon. member that he need not worry. We know that it is a difficult road. The Prime Minister admitted that. We know that it is a road that will create administrative difficulties&#x2014;he also admitted that. It is, however, not impossible to travel along that road. I may tell hon. members that one fool can ask more questions than two wise men can answer in ten years. If hon. members opposite allege that this demand is not a political demand, they are making a very big mistake. Do they not know that the word &#x201C;Uhuru&#x201D; is already echoing throughout the whole world? And do they not know that &#x201C;Uhuru&#x201D; does not mean minor political rights, but the political vote?

<p>Another hon. member has in the meantime also raised his voice, namely, the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). He wanted to know what would happen if the Bantu in the Bantu areas had their own army. But surely what his party wants is one big conglomeration; they want everybody to sit together in one big federal Parliament.

<p>That too, but it is not so much a question as to what they are going to make of him but that he will become that in their race federation. I want to ask the hon. member for Durban (Point) how safe he would feel with a Black man as Commander-General and with all the keys of the magazines in his hands? Can he tell me what they are going to do with the Bantu in their proposed federation as far as these things are concerned? The hon. member for Constantia objects to the White man having to develop the Bantu areas. If that is their attitude, I want to ask them: this &#x201C;How sincere have you been all these years?&#x201D; They could not have been sincere all these years when they talked about the development of the Bantu areas with us. However, only this afternoon the hon. member for Yeoville adopted an attitude which conflicted with that adopted by the hon. member for Constantia. The hon. member for Constantia objected while the hon. member for Yeoville complained that too little was being done. We know that those two hon. members both hope to become members of their federal Cabinet if their party should ever come into power again&#x2014;it is still a shadow cabinet, although it is more shadow than cabinet. If it should happen that the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Constantia sit together, it would probably be the hon. member for Constantia who would refuse to provide the capital for the development of the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s plan to give independence to the Transkei is not a new one. I am also saying this to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It is not a new plan, it is already an old plan. It will not avail hon. members to say much about it this evening because the voters of this country have already given judgment on that.</p>

<p>Nor did they listen when the hon. the Prime Minister said that we would become a Republic. The hon. member for Yeoville asked the Prime Minister whether we were to become a Republic and the Prime Minister replied &#x201C;yes, and when I say we will become it soon, it will be soon&#x201D;. The same thing happened in the case of the Bantu areas. Had they paid more attention they would have realized that was not a new statement of policy but an old policy and that the announcement was simply a question of timing. The voters of the country have already decided on that as part of the broad programme of the National Party. The voters are acquainted with this plan; it is a logical plan and the voters of the country, and the Bantu and the world outside knew that it was coming. The difficulty is this, however, Mr. Speaker, that the party opposite does not relish the fact that the majority of the Bantu, excluding the small group of agitators with whom that party is in touch, accept it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the important fact is that what the hon. the Prime Minister announced here, is not a new policy; it is an old policy and a logical consequence of what we want to do and what we shall do. The Transkei is the first but not the last. It is not my intention to make an announcement but it follows logically. In due course we shall judge as things develop administratively. What has been announced, is not only in conformity with the policy of our party, but also with the judgment given by the voters. Most important of all, however, is that it is in conformity with what the Bantu himself wants and with the moral standpoint that the world outside expects, and if hon. members opposite say that they do not know that, we shall know that they have always been living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise, and that they will never see the light. This cry of Africa, this cry of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; is to-day being granted and carried out. Moreover, it is this Government that is carrying it out with this difference that the vote is being given to the man who is entitled to it in his own area, instead of converting the whole South Africa into a federal state, as that party wishes to do. Hon. members opposite are also incapable of reading the signs of the times. They can neither take the Federation of Rhodesia as an example, nor the rest of Africa. Fortunately the voters of South Africa are much better informed than hon. members opposite. The voters know what all this is about and as long as the National Party carries out its policy as announced, so long will it remain in power and hon. members opposite should realize to-day already that they are doomed to sit in the opposition benches until they are old.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as a new member of this House I appreciate the opportunity to take part in this debate. I want to express a few thoughts in connection with the amount of R6,000,000 which appears in the Part Appropriation for Bantu education. It is certainly possible to conduct a very interesting debate on the way in which this money is to be spent, for example, or on the nature of the education provided for the Bantu, etc. As a new member, however, it will be more proper for me to start with a statement with which this house will agree to a large extent. The proposition I want to put forward is this: Judging by the statistic available in connection with Bantu education, it is clear that the Bantu children certainly have a strong desire to obtain education, even under the most difficult circumstances. As long ago as 1940 there were 464,000 Bantu children at school. During the course of the next ten years, i.e. until 1950, this number increased to 757,000&#x2014;an increase therefore of almost 61 per cent during a period of ten years. The position is, even more interesting as regards the next ten years. The percentage increase did not remain constant, but almost doubled itself. According to the latest information made available by the Department of Bantu Education there were 1,608,000 Bantu children at school in March 1961. This represents an increase of approximately 120 per cent. This progress in the field of Bantu education is reflected equally convincingly in the expenditure on this item. In 1940 for example this expenditure was R2,000,000; 20 years later it was more than R20,000,000. In addition the number of schools doubled from 3,800 in 1940 to 7,700 in 1960. These figures are ample proof to me that the Bantu child is most anxious to obtain education, so anxious in fact that the Department of Bantu Education is finding it very difficult to keep ahead with the provision of education facilities.</p>

<p>I am one of those people who believe that this phenomenon, this growth, should not be feared by the Whites but should rather be welcomed. After all education is the basis on which civilization rests, and we as Whites&#x2014;the so-called bearers of Western civilization&#x2014;should be grateful that it is possible for us to bring civilization to the Bantu in this way. There is also another aspect of this matter, however, and that is that the Whites feel obliged, on account of their peculiar position in our country, to compare the progress in the field of education by the Bantu with the progress of their own people in that field&#x2014;not in a spirit of apprehension, but rather to use such a comparison as a stimulus as an incentive to them to prepare themselves to reach the highest level in the educational sphere. What we must not forget is that the Whites are in this peculiar position, a position which demands the utmost from them in all spheres of life, including the educational sphere, if they want to safeguard their position in our country. I believe&#x2014;and I may be wrong&#x2014;that we cannot safeguard our position by means of protective laws. Even colour policies cannot in the long run ensure that safety for us. It may be possible to safeguard our position through the quality of the guidance that we give the non-Whites.</p>

<p>When I look at the education figures in respect of the Whites, I doubt whether in the field of education we are preparing ourselves in such a manner that we will be able to give that guidance, and, what is more important, whether the quality of that guidance will be worthy of emulation, To me it is a disquieting fact that 27 per cent of our youth does not go further than std. VI or VII and that they leave school at the age of 16-17 years without any compulsion and in many cases without any desire to study further. The question that occurs to me is whether these people&#x2014;more than one quarter of our future population&#x2014;are capable of taking their place in society, a society which we know is daily becoming more and more complex and organized. <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_343"/>Are they capable of forming an opinion or to come to final decisions with regard to our complex social, economic and political problems?</p>

<p>Let me quote some further figures. The Department of Education informs me that the 51,000 who were in Std. VI in 1956 only 20,000 passed the matriculation examination, i.e. only 39 per cent. It may be said that this compares favourably with other Western countries. I am the first to admit that and to say that I am pleased that is so. Nevertheless it is my firm belief that the Whites in South Africa cannot compare their position with that of other Western countries; their responsibility is so much greater and the problem which they have to solve is so much more difficult. Others may say that if 39 per cent of our youths matriculate and some of them obtain university degrees, we should be able to keep our nation on the right road. I believe that the strength of the nation lies in the strength of the individual, and unless we as Whites succeed in getting a greater percentage of our youth to obtain higher education, I do not think that in the long run we shall be able to discharge our responsibility.</p>

<p>I remember that Dr. G. D. Scholtz, who I think is known to all in this House published a book called &#x201C;Gevaar uit die Ooste&#x201D; (Danger from the East). In the preface to this book he states that he wrote it with the sole object of trying to rid the South African nation of the fatal blight of self-complacency into which it had fallen. I believe that this self-complacency may be one of the reasons why we as Whites do not make better progress in the field of education. If in fact the reason why we are not making the necessary progress is self-complacency, I do not think that the Whites of our country need have any doubt as to their ultimate end. Dr. Scholtz says very clearly in this book that if the historian of the future is asked to write about the South African nation (if that nation is to disappear) that historian&#x2019;s task will not be difficult at all; he will only have to record that the South African nation disappeared because it had no knowledge of the world in which it lived. That knowledge and the power which it will bring, are available in our schools and our universities, and whether the fate referred to by Dr. Scholtz will befall us, will depend, I think, firstly on the earnestness with which we view the question of education, and secondly whether we as a nation, whilst doing our duty to the Bantu, recognize our duty to ourselves in the first place and secondly whether we discharge that duty.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>While I have the privilege of congratulating the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) on his maiden speech in this House this evening, I want to say to him in the first place that the quality of his speech earned the respectful attention of every member of this House. I can assure the hon. member that the subject which he proached here, the education of the child, is one which is certainly close to the heart of every sincere South African, and if the hon. member continues to deliver speeches of the quality which he made here this evening and continues to plead for the education of our children, I can assure him that he will go very far in this House.</p>

<p>When I rose here this evening, knowing that as a newcomer and as a back-bencher I would have to make my maiden speech, I was gripped by the realization that the whole House was sinking into silence to listen with a very critical ear to the first speech of the member for Brakpan. Although I have had a good deal of advice from members here in recent days and even from you, Mr. Speaker, when you spoke to me about this maiden speech of mine, I have to disappoint you unfortunately, because you said to me in your office, &#x201C;the best thing to do is to talk about the subject which is nearest to your heart.&#x201D; Well, if I were to speak this evening on the subject which is nearest to my heart, you would most certainly rule me out of order. Even one of the reporters said to me, &#x201C;You are a backbencher, but would you not like to make frontpage news?&#x201D; My reply was, &#x201C;My friend, that is the desire of every politician.&#x201D; He then said to me, &#x201C;My advice to you is this: &#x201C;The moment the Leader of the Opposition sits down after his speech on his motion of censure, get up and let Mr. Speaker see you.&#x201D; But I have even disappointed him, and I am going to follow the golden rule of steering clear of politics this evening.</p>

<p>It is a great honour for me to represent the Brakpan constituency, because Brakpan is one of those towns which has certainly produced most members of Parliament. In this House we have persons who started their political career in Brakpan. We have the Minister of Labour, Mr. Trollip, and the Minister of Justice, Adv. Vorster. In 1948 these two members were still at each other&#x2019;s throats; they then belonged to different parties but to-day the Minister of Labour sits only two benches away from the Minister of Justice but on the same side of the House. We also have here the Deputy Minister of Labour, who also began his political career in Brakpan. Similarly we have the hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) and, last but not least, the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), who also began his political career in Brakpan. Mr. Speaker, although Brakpan is rich in members of Parliament, it has been equally rich and progressive over the past 60 years. Sixty years ago the East Rand was a sparsely populated area where we still found the wildbok, the crane, the bustard and even the stately secretary-bird, together with the peaceful calm of the flats. That has now made room for the din of the never-ending city noises. Within the past 40 years no less than 20 of the biggest gold mines on the East Rand have sprung up overnight in this area of more than 400 square miles. Four of the most prosperous and progressive towns, Benoni, Brakpan, Springs and Nigel, with a population <span class="col_655-656" refersTo="page_344"/>of more than a quarter of a million people, have sprung up around these gold mines. At one stage the gold mines of the East Rand produced no less than three-quarters of the annual profits of the Transvaal. You will realize therefore, Mr. Speaker, that the East Rand has made its contribution over and over again to the development and progress of South Africa. And to-day, after having sacrificed everything for 60 years for the progress of South Africa, after this enormous boom in the growth and the progress of the East Rand after the establishment of these beautiful cities there, we get the disturbing news from the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs that in the year 1970 no less than 13 of these mines will no longer be producing gold. I personally am very pleased and grateful that the Deputy Minister has told us in very clear terms what the position is going to be on the East Rand. He did not come along with honeyed words to reassure us but he very pertinently brought to the notice of the authorities the problem that will face the East Rand. The closing of these mines is nobody&#x2019;s fault. It is not the Government&#x2019;s fault, nor is it the fault of the mine magnates or of the local authorities. What is happening is something which is perfectly natural. There is no more gold which can be mined on a remunerative basis. We were all fully aware of that fact. We knew that this time would arrive but we did not know precisely when. That means that in the year 1970 employment will have to be found at least 6,900 Whites and about 56,000 non-Whites, and we on the East Rand will have to make ends meet without an annual income of almost R40,000,000. At the moment these mines are still producing one-tenth of the annual total yield of our gold mines in South Africa, and that means too that the national income from gold will be reduced by one-tenth. We realize that a large number of these 6,900 Whites will be able to work in other mines, but I want to put forward a plead here this evening particularly for that large number of mineworkers who will not be able to find other employment. Sixty per cent or more of these mine-workers have already given more than ten to 20 years of the best part of their lives to those mines. All those who are familiar with the mining industry know that when a mine-worker has worked underground and is no longer able to work there because he suffers from a chest complaint or some associated disease, he is always given employment above ground. Almost 60 per cent of these 6,900 people will now be deprived of employment. These are people who were responsible citizens of this country and who discharged their obligations. They bought houses for themselves and they were respected citizens of our towns, but what do we find now? They will no longer be able to get the employment which they formerly obtained above ground and they will become nothing but poor Whites, whereas formerly they were respected people. Here I want to put forward a plead to the Prime Minister and to the members of the Cabinet. I do not want to urge that these mines should be kept going for a longer period, because I do not believe in keeping something going artificially, but I do urge that the time has arrived when local authorities should realize their responsibilities. They knew that this time would come and they did everything in their power to cope with this great problem, which can be described as a unique problem in the history of South Africa, because never before in the history of South Africa have we been told so suddenly that so many mines are to be closed and that it will affect so many people. I would therefore urge, since these people are going to be unemployed, since they cannot obtain employment in another field, and since they have made their contribution to the progress of this country, that the Government, within the framework of the policy of the National Party, should immediately take steps to see that there is employment for them eventually. Although the town councils of the East Rand are endeavouring in their own individual way to solve this problem by attracting industries to their towns, and although they are doing everything in their power, I find that this problem is so great that time is running against them and that they will not be able to solve this problem timeously. I would suggest therefore that the Government, in co-operation with the provincial administration and the local authorities of the East Rand and private initiative, should see to it that a large tract of land is released for industrial development and that individual town councils should not continue to try to solve this problem in their own way, but that joint action should be taken and that the Government should lay down a quota of White workers as against non-White workers who can enter that area; that we give relief to those people within the pattern and the framework of the policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>I want to say this here this evening. A very dark and sombre cloud hangs over the constituents of Brakpan. But I am as convinced as I am of the fact that I am standing here this evening that this Government will not leave those people in the lurch, because when the picture has looked at their worst it has always come to the aid of the workers who stood by it loyally. I would urge that the time has come to help those people of the East Rand, because when they were in a position to do so they helped South Africa and made the sacrifices that they were called upon to make.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to congratulate the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout), who has just made his maiden speech, on a most welcome and outstanding contribution to this debate. I am sure that with defenders such as the hon. members for Brakpan and Springs (Mr. Taurog), whom we heard earlier this afternoon, the East Rand is well represented and protected in this House and that its interests will be well <span class="col_657-658" refersTo="page_345"/>cared for, and that it will be proud of the contributions of their members. I may mention, with some feeling of sympathy, that viewed topographically, the hon. member who has just spoken is well on the way towards following the space occupied by his predecessor, the former member for Brakpan, and I wish him well in his years in this House.</p>

<p>I would also like to congratulate the hon. member for Maitland on his maiden contribution, and I am sure that, as in the case of the member who has just sat down, the House will agree that we have just listened to two maiden speeches which promise well for the future of the debates in this House.</p>

<p>What a pity, though, that some of the speeches from the other side of the House should have been on the side of the demolition squad which is busy breaking up this country of ours! We have seen the red herring dragged over the trail over and over tonight. What struck me was the tragic gullibility which has led people to fall for this nonsense of the philosophy of extremes, the philosophy that something must be either all black or all white, nothing half-way, that there is nothing in between the two extremes of policy, between total separation and one man, one vote. Man after man has stood up and indicated that he has swallowed that bait&#x2014;not really bait but something which has been indoctrinated into the people of South Africa year after year. We were asked by the hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) what we would do if the Bantu in the reserves, as we develop them economically and socially, made demands on the Government for one man, one vote. I will give him the answer. The answer, Sir, is that we on this side, as a Government, will do what is in the interest of South Africa and will not bow and scrape before the demands of every irresponsible political agitator. Because all we have had tonight and for the last two weeks is a surrender by the Government before the demands of extremist agitators. We have been told that South Africa must be dismembered, fragmented, broken up and destroyed, because if we do not do it we will not satisfy the Bantu political agitators. I want to say loudly and clearly that we on this side are not interested in political agitators. We have seen the activities of White political agitators in the past. We have seen the effect they had when this country was brought to the point of civil war through White political agitation, but this side of the House knew its duty. It did not panic and hold up its hands in despair because there was trouble to be faced. So, again, if Black political agitation should bring difficulties, this side of the House will have the courage to face them.</p>

<p>But what we have had from the Government is surrender to the demands of extremism, &#x201C;die hendsop-beleid&#x201D;, the policy of the white flag, inability to stand up to the problems which the life of this country forces a responsible Government to face up to. The hon. member for Soutpansberg asked what would happen if a Bantu under the race federation plan of the United Party should rise to the top and become chief of staff and even Minister of Defence? Does he not realize that what he is doing is to create seven armies with seven Ministers of Defence and seven chiefs of staff, but what he is doing beyond that is to enable those Ministers of Defence and those chiefs of staff to negotiate with states hostile to South Africa in order to provide them with the weapons and the arms and the training which can be used for the destruction of the last remnants of civilization which this Government is prepared to leave in this country. They are prepared to give to these potentially hostile bases from which any enemy of South Africa could operate virtually the whole of our Eastern sea-board, control of the major port of South Africa, control of our whole northern and north-western boundary, and then that Minister is concerned that we might have a Black chief of staff! We have said clearly and unequivocally that the policy of the United Party is that the leadership of the civilized, responsible group in South Africa, the White group, shall be maintained for as far as we can see ahead. That has been said clearly and without any attempt at evasion. But this hon. member stands for a policy which is prepared to place that leadership in jeopardy, and his only answer is: Yes, but your policy is more dangerous. And his only reason for that is that we have not dotted the i&#x2019;s and crossed the t&#x2019;s of the final, ultimate, long-term details of our plan. I think I have a fair authority dealing with the problem of race relations in South Africa, dealing with the issue of the relationship between White and non-White and harmonious relations between the various groups. Only two years ago we had a new vision, a nightmare in our political life, but it was headed: &#x201C;Nuwe visie in kleurbeleid&#x201D;. We were told then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">En die uiteindelike verhouding, daarvoor is geen presiese patroon nou moontlik of wenslik nie. Dit sal onderling bepaal moet word wanneer die tyd daarvoor aanbreek.</block>

<p>Not only is it not possible, but it is undesirable at this stage to try to give the exact pattern of what will happen in a generation or in 50 years. That was three years ago and the very thing that this Government warned about, the impossibility of dotting the i&#x2019;s and crossing the t&#x2019;s, the thing they said should not be done, to try to sketch the pattern of the long-term future, is what the Prime Minister did exactly three years later. I should like to know what has happened in the three years since that announcement of the new vision was made, this new vision which could not be taken to its logical conclusion, and the statement made in this House two weeks ago. Has the situation within South Africa changed so much? Yes, Sir, what has happened is that the Government has realized its complete <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_346"/>inability to deal with the problems facing it and so, in their panic, they have had to try to create some new vision to distract the attention of the people from their own failures. What has happened is that through indoctrination in the Press, which has swallowed this philosophy that a thing must be either one extreme or the other, the Government hopes that it has created an electorate whose reaction to the announcement of Bantu independence will be one of complete shellshock. What they did not realize is that although the immediate reaction is one of shellshock, and people have not yet started to realize the implications of this scheme, slowly it will come through to the thinking of all the people of South Africa that this plan announced in this House two weeks ago means the destruction of everything we have struggled to build up in this country. It means the destruction of the peace and the stability which it should be the object of this Government to build up, and of the progress; but what is more, it is the destruction of the very civilized standards which this Government claims it wants to protect. The Government is gambling all these fundamental issues in the one hope that it has so indoctrinated the people of South Africa that they will be so shocked by this announcement that they will not be able to realize its true and complete implications; that they will not realize that it is a camouflage for the failure of this Government to govern a multi-racial state in peace. [Interjections.] The hon. member who makes so much noise should perhaps go and talk to the little Yellow men with whom the Government is so friendly these days and ask them to give his Government some help in formulating a plan for decent race relations. They are the friends. Let them go and take some tips of how to get harmonious race relations. But I want to congratulate the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker). Last Session he knew only three words, &#x201C;Mau Mau&#x201D;, &#x201C;Haw-Haw&#x201D; and &#x201C;Lumumba&#x201D;. This year he has learned a new word. I congratulate him and hope his vocabulary will still grow.</p>

<p>Despite the propaganda and Radio South Africa trying to put the last nails into the coffin of free and independent thought in South Africa, it will become increasingly clear that this Government has put up the white flag. This announcement is a clear admission that it cannot and is not even prepared to try to govern the whole of South Africa and therefore it must surrender whole sections of the country to the rule of foreign, independent states. But I do not believe that the people of South Africa have so little faith in their ability as this Government has. The people of this country will still succeed in creating a pattern for harmonious co-existence without destroying either civilized standards, as the Progressive Party wishes to do, or the whole Republic of South Africa, as the Government wishes to do.</p>

<p>I want to deal this evening with the reasons why, looking from the other side of the fence, this will become obvious to the people of South Africa. What does this plan mean in practice? Fortunately I do not need to generalize. We have clear standards to go by, but I want to give just one indication of what it means, one indication of the complete reversal of policy and the complete panic and the complete overturning of the whole thinking of the Nationalist Party which is involved in this plan. This Minister&#x2019;s own Secretary for Bantu Affairs said, according to the <i>Burger</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die voorgestelde Bantoestans sal nooit onafhanklike self-besturende gebiede word nie, al ontwikkel hulle ook hoe ver.</block>

<p>That was said by Dr. Eiselen, Secretary for Bantu Administration, in 1959. The Secretary said himself that these states would not develop to full independence, but now the Government says they will develop to full independence. Just to illustrate, I wanted to quote from the Transkeian Territorial Authority, which has a photo of the first Bantu Parliament, and when I showed this to a Nationalist audience, the book was ripped from my hands, torn up and trampled on, and it was called &#x201C;vuil Sap-propaganda&#x201D;. Our Government was never going to do this, but it is this Government which through the Prime Minister has announced that it is handing over control of the Transkei. I have taken the trouble to analyse the debates over the last three years since its inception, from its first session, of the Transkeian Territorial Authority, and this is what I find.</p>

<p>In its first session in 1959 I want to quote the issues and the attitude displayed by that authority towards governmental responsibility in South Africa. I start at the beginning. The first resolution on the agenda was a demand to extend the dipping interval. The second was that members of stock sale committees should be paid for attending committee meetings. The next was to remove the restriction concerning the introduction of cattle into the district. The next was to relax the restrictive regulations regarding the importation of slaughter stock; to relax the regulation governing the control of East Coast fever; to extend the dipping interval; to relax the law relating to stock limitation; to refrain from prosecuting stock owners for failure to produce spleens; that livestock officers should be requested not to castrate bull calves, and finally one positive resolution that all stock should be kraaled at night. So it goes on, page after page. On Page 2 there is a demand for the annexation of adjoining land to the Transkei; that the Glen Grey district be incorporated in the Transkei; that traders and mission stations be limited to one acre; to get rid of the holdings of the White settlers; that the land be re-allocated &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from><span class="col_661-662" refersTo="page_347"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>My point is that every resolution which this authority passed aimed at either removing a necessary restriction or at getting rid of the White man, or paying more to the chief and headmen in control of this authority. I can go on. Let us look under Bantu self-government. They demand full self-government. Resolution 88 demands more money, 89 more money, all for the chiefs; 99, more power, 91, more power, 92, more money, 81, more money, 82, no auditing of their accounts, 85, more money, 86, wants control of money, 84, refers to the title of Bantu authorities, and 86 is the control of money. That was their first session, but go on to the next session and you have the same pattern: Removal of restrictions and controls, getting rid of the White man, replacing the White man in all Government departments; getting rid of White drivers on the transport buses and White inspectors, and as soon as you get to administration, more money for the chiefs, more power for them, and for three years running, arms to the chiefs to protect themselves; and each year, running like a pattern through these resolutions, there are three basic issues, the demand for more power, the removal of White authority and control, the handing over of control to the Bantu, and right throughout, more privileges, more rights and more powers to the chiefs and also the demand for powers to protect themselves through the issue of arms. If you study this for last year, the resolutions are these: 88, the supply of firearms to chiefs; 89, increased wages; 90, supply of firearms to Native constables; 92, the improvement of scales and salaries for chiefs; 93, the payment of subsistence and transport allowance, and so it goes on&#x2014;the control of money, power, arms, and the removal of White control. If one wants to read the minutes, and they are verbatim, and we find that throughout there is a condemnation of the Bantu authorities system by the chiefs.</p>
