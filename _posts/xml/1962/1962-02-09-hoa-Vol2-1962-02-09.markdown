<li>Dr. B. G. Gaigher&#x2014;industrial adviser to the Department of Commerce and Industries.</li></ul></li>

<li>(ii) <i>The mission to the Far East and Australasia:</i>

<ul>

<li>The late Dr. F. J. du Toit (leader)&#x2014;industrialist;</li>

<li>Mr. I. G. Flemming (who assumed the leadership of this mission after Dr. du Toit&#x2019;s death in Bangkok)&#x2014;industrialist;</li>

<li>Mr. F. W. Waring&#x2014;businessman (commerce); and</li>

<li>Mr. J. Berry&#x2014;businessman (commerce and industry); and</li>

<li>Mr. J. L. Pretorius&#x2014;economist; Department of Commerce and Industries.</li></ul>

<p>With the exception of the three officers of the Department of Commerce and Industries, the members of the missions were not selected by virtue of their association with, or membership of, any particular organization or body.</p>

<p>Extensive knowledge and experience of industrial, financial and commercial matters and prominence in the public life of our country, were the criteria which were observed in the selection of the members of the trade missions. The gentlemen whom I have mentioned fully satisfied these requirements, and were eminently qualified to serve South Africa in a representative capacity of this nature.</p></li>

<p>In this connection I may mention that the reports of the three missions, containing full particulars in respect of the tours, were published by the Department of Commerce and Industries during the second half of 1961.</p></li>

</ol></li></ol></li>

<li>(4) (a) No; (b) no. The recommendations made by the trade missions are. however, receiving the attention of the Departments of Commerce and Industries and of Foreign Affairs. The remainder of this part of the question falls away.</li>

<li><p>(5) As a result of the discussions initiated by the members of the missions and the publicity which was given to these visits, interest in South Africa has been stimulated with a consequent increase in inquiries in respect of South African products.</p>

<p>The hon. member will nevertheless appreciate that it is impossible to make a categorical statement in regard to the increase of South Africa&#x2019;s exports as a direct result of the efforts of the missions. It might, however, be pointed out that South Africa&#x2019;s exports were buoyant throughout 1961 and that total exports, excluding gold, increased to R942.2 million during that year compared with R884.5 million during 1960. To a certain extent the increase in the value of exports can, I believe, be attributed to the efforts of the three missions.</p></li>

<li>(1) Whether the Government has contributed towards the cost of shark research; if so (a) to what extent and (b) to which organizations have contributions been made;</li>

<li>(2) whether any assistance additional to the amount provided for in the estimates for 1961-62 is contemplated; if so, what amount; and</li>

<li>(3) what progress has been made in regard to shark research.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes, Provision has been made on the vote Commerce and Industries for the payment of an amount of R20,000 during the 1961-2 financial year to an approved body on the basis of R1 for every R1 received from other sources;

<ol>

<li>(a) no drawings have as yet been made against the provision; and</li>

<li>(b) the approved body to whom payments are to be made is the AntiShark Research Association Ltd., on whose board the C.S.I.R., the Natal Coast Safety Bathing Association, the S.A. Association for Marine Biological Research, the Argus Printing and Publishing Co., and the Action Committee for Anti-Shark Research are represented;</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) a similar provision for an amount of R20,000 is contemplated for the 1962-3 financial year; and</li>

<li>(3) in 1958-9 a team of C.S.I.R. scientists under Dr. J. P. A. Lochner, head of the Acoustics Division of the National Physical Research Laboratory, carried out field experiments on sharks in the St. Lucia estuary, Natal. Two facts were immediately patent:

<ol>

<li>(i) to be successful further experimentation, under controlled laboratory conditions, which would be costly to create would have to be carried out; and</li>

<li>(ii) the possibility existed that a successful electrical shark barrier could be developed.</li>

</ol></li></ol>

<p>Subsequently, Drs. Lochner and D. Davies (Director of the Oceanographic Research Institute, Durban, which is jointly responsible with the C.S.I.R. for anti-shark research in South Africa) paid <span class="col_845-846" refersTo="page_439"/>visits overseas to gather all available information on anti-shark research. These visits were considered essential as familiarity with the lines of shark research overseas could bring about a valuable supplementation of ideas, as well as avoid unnecessary duplication of research. The most recent of these visits, which took place in August 1961 included attendance at the Tenth Pacific Science Congress, Honolulu.</p>

<p>Before research can begin on an intensive scale, two special shark tanks on the premises of the Oceanographic Research Institute have to be completed. One tank is ready, while the second is under construction. Electrical gear required for these experiments is being built up in the National Physical Research Laboratory.</p>

<p>The lack of adequate facilities has not held up research entirely. Dr. Davies has actively conducted biological studies of the sharks which frequent the Natal coast, identifying the species responsible for most of the attacks. He has done important work on the bacteria in sharks&#x2019; mouths, and how these affect the condition of a victim immediately after the attack.</p>

<p>At its last meeting the Scientific Steering Committee, which is responsible for the execution of the shark research programme, approved an intensive research schedule, which makes provision, for:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) further biological studies, including additional surveys of sharks in the Natal region, determination of species responsible for attacks on humans and possible factors which provoke attacks, such as sea temperatures, turbidity, time and salinity;</li>

<li>(ii) reaction studies on sharks, including the establishment of facilities for carrying out reaction studies (such as the experimental tanks), the conditioning of sharks to temperature, electrical, sound and light stimuli and a study of their reactions to these stimuli; and</li>

<li>(iii) instrumentation and physical studies, which include the development of suitable equipment for temperature recording, sound generating, measuring, lighting, shock, electrical pulse, electrical measuring, etc., as well as the development of experimental electrical barriers and the testing of the reaction of humans to electrical stimuli.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_the_interior" to="#hopewell">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<p>(1) and (2) The total cost of the Commission of Inquiry into the Press to date only partly includes the salary of the Chairman of the Commission. The reason why the Chairman&#x2019;s salary is not included <i>in toto</i> in the cost of the Commission, is because his salary is only debited against the provision for expenditure in connection with the Commission when it is found necessary from time to time to appoint a substitute on the Bench. An amount of R32,350 has thus far been debited as the Chairman&#x2019;s salary against the provision for expenditure in connection with the_ Commission, whilst an amount of R34,148 has been so debited as travelling and subsistence allowances paid to the Chairman.</p>

<li><p>(2) From 1 December 1961, the local wholesale price of butter has been reduced with 5 cent per lb. to 27.5 cent per lb. (partly with the aid of a higher subsidy) and in the case of cheese it has been reduced with 1.5 cent per lb. to 24 cent per lb. Butter is also being made available by the Dairy Control Board at special reduced prices to the Bantu, Welfare Organizations and Industries.</p>

<p>The Meat Control Board has made arrangements by which approximately 117,000 sheep carcases are available to suppliers to the mines at special reduced prices.</p>

<p>The Egg Control Board&#x2019;s attempts to make eggs available to the Bantu at reduced prices, were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>In the case of crushing groundnuts the local selling prices were reduced over the past nine years, from R120 per short ton to R102.50 per short ton.</p>

<p>Apart from the abovementioned arrangements, it was for the following reasons found impracticable to reduce the local prices:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) The demand for foodstuffs is inelastic and only if prices are drastically reduced it would have any noticeable effect on the demand.</li>

<li>(ii) The industries in question, cannot afford such a reduction of prices on the total production (here it should be borne in mind that in so far as the export of agricultural produce is concerned, most countries, importing as well as export countries, maintain producer prices which are in the case of most products far above the net export prices&#x2014;the latter prices are often mere dumping prices).</li>

<li>(iii) If the local surpluses should be sold to certain groups of consumers at specially reduced prices, it would be impossible to prevent that these sales replace part of the normal demand and the surplusses will consequently still exist.</li></ol></li></ol>

</ol></question>

<answer by="#minister_of_the_interior" to="#malan">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. Many paragraphs and sections of chapters, especially those relating to historical and background material, are repeated in the Year Book year after year. It was deemed unnecessary to repeat in the Year Book year after year certain descriptive sections and certain tables in respect of which no new data is available. The Year Book became too voluminous and was curtailed for economic reasons.</li>

<li>(2) No. It is still endeavoured to indicate the latest development in the Republic in the Year Book. The duplication of information is, however, now being eliminated.</li>

<li>(3) Many of the statistical tables were omitted from the latest Year Book No. 30, because they were duplications of tables that appeared in previous Year Books. Important statistical tables over a series of years and which contain more data, appeared in a recent publication of the Bureau of Census and Statistics, namely, &#x201C;Union Statistics for Fifty Years: 1910-1960&#x201D;. Important statistical tables will in future again be incorporated in the Year Book, or in publications which will be similar to the <span class="col_857-858" refersTo="page_445"/>publication &#x201C;Union Statistics for Fifty Years: 1910-1960&#x201D;.</li>

<li>(5) Year Book No. 29 for 1956-7 was released on the 30 June 1958. No edition of the Year Book was published for the years 1958-9, because much of the data that would have been incorporated in this Year Book, was incorporated in the publication &#x201C;Union Statistics for Fifty Years: 1910-1960&#x201D;.

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that the Government should consider the advisability of giving greater attention to the needs and interests of the white collar employee and salaried workers in general by&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) easing the burden of higher living costs and spiralling prices;</li>

<li>(b) introducing a contributory national pension scheme;</li>

<li>(c) considering making paid annual leave a right and not merely a privilege; and</li>

<li>(d) recognizing the encouragement of a stable and prosperous middle-class to be essential for the achievement of good government and sound progress.</li>

</ol>

<p>In moving this motion, I think it is necessary that we should try to avoid any misunderstanding that arises from the use of the term &#x201C;white collar worker&#x201D;, especially from the Afrikaans translation of that term; that Afrikaans translation in this case is &#x201C;werkers wat nie hande-arbeid doen nie&#x201D;. I suppose that is the correct translation, strictly speaking, but had I been consulted about the translation, I would have suggested something different, not a negative translation. Because the purpose of this resolution is certainly not to exclude any group of workers from the benefits that we suggest should accrue to the working people of South Africa. The purpose of this resolution is to draw the attention of the House and the Ministers concerned to the plight of a great many of the people employed in South African industries, trade and commerce, and to draw particular attention to the plight of the white collar salary workers who, Sir, in many, many cases are in a very difficult position. They are to a large extent a vast army of unknowns, who have no dramatic platform, no trade unions to fight for them, no representative bodies, no vociferous newspapers to support <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_446"/>them. Because they do their job steadily day after day, nobody notices them, nobody remembers them. They are caught in a no-man&#x2019;s land between trades and professions. They are not part of the prohibitiveness of commerce, although commerce could not exist without them. There is nobody to fight for them except us, and they may not fight for themselves, the immemorial right of an employee to withhold his services&#x2014;they do not strike, Sir, and if they were to strike, there would be a public outcry about their lack of social consicence, about their lack of responsibility and about their ingratitude. Indeed, Sir, I may say, one of the major tests of the social conscience of any state is the care and the solicitude it shows for its white collar workers.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to assure you that this resolution was not moved here merely for the sake of having a resolution on the Order Paper. Many of these people have real trouble to-day. Only this morning in my newspaper I read of the plight of a certain section of the white collar workers in South Africa, and those are the people employed by the Government in the South African Post Office, and I want to read to you this short newspaper report as a background to our discussions&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The patience of members of the Postal and Telegraph Association of South Africa is exhausted and they are becoming more restless each day, because of the delay of the authorities in coming to a decision about salary improvement requests, states the <i>Herald,</i> official journal of the association. <br/>In an editorial article the journal states that &#x201C;four months ago the association interviewed the Public Service Commission and pressed for salary improvements for members of the association and in that time it had been able to pacify its members&#x2019; restlessness with assurances that their salary claim was receiving priority treatment. <br/>Had it not been for the intervention of our office-bearers throughout the country, there would have been chaos in our postal and telegraph communications over the festive season. Our patience is running out fast, our members are becoming more and more restless each day, and our ability to hold them in check does have limits. <br/>The association is not contemplating calling upon its members to withhold their goodwill as was recently done so effectively overseas, but we find it increasingly more difficult each day to convince them that they are receiving a square deal&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That was published after this motion of mine was placed on the Order Paper. It is striking confirmation that the time has come that Parliament and the Government should give attention to the problems of the white-collar worker.</p>

<p>The other question that I think I should meet immediately, because it will come sooner or later, is: Does my motion cover all races in South Africa? I want to say at once that it covers all races as far as that is practicable. The situation in South Africa, whether we like it or not, is that certainly a large section of our Native race is still in a primitive stage of tribal development, and it becomes extremely difficult to apply measures of social security to those people in the same way that you can apply them to the White people and the Coloured people and the Asiatic people and the detribalized Natives. I think this problem was adequately examined and dealt with as long ago as 1944 by the Social and Economic Planning Council of those days which published a report &#x201C;Union Government No. 14 of the year 1944&#x201D; on social security and in paragraphs 129 to 135, they dealt with this problem of the horizontal coverage that can be given to the people of South Africa by such measures, and there they make certain suggestions, which I think are valid even to-day and have been applied in certain respects. We know, for example, that workman&#x2019;s compensation applies to urbanized Natives, with some income test. This commission also made the interesting observation that these social security measures should not apply to those Natives who still have a holding in the reserves, even if they work in the cities, because then the protection offered to them in their old age and in case of sickness or if any of the viccisitudes of life strike them, derives from their tribal customs and their would be protection for them because of the fact that they still have a holding in the reserves. But I think, Sir, that we in South Africa should very seriously consider extending, wherever possible, our social security measures (about which I shall say more in a minute) to all races in South Africa according to our ability to do so and in accordance with the needs that exist.</p>

<p>Sir, my motion speaks in the first instance about the cost of living, and I think we should have a look at what has been happening especially to our people of fixed income in South Africa in recent years. In this connection I am very grateful to the Department of Economics of the University of Stellenbosch who annually publish a most valuable survey of contemporary economic conditions, and some of the figures I am going to give you now will come from the latest report of the University of Stellenbosch. It is interesting to see from the tables contained in the first introductory portion of this report what has been happening to the money and the value of the money of the ordinary salaried man and the wage-earner. We find that from June 1947 to June 1960 our net national income rose from R1,494,000,000 to R4,478,000,000 in 1960, a tremendous increase which every South African must be proud of. But in the same period the <i>per capita</i> income of the South African citizen rose from R166 to R218.6. This means that, while our net national income trebled, the <i>per capita</i> income of the people, the real income, only increased by one-third.</p>

<p>It seems to me that for the benefit of the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) I should put this in a different way. Sir, the table which this Department of Economics gives is based on the figures supplied by our own Department of Census and Statistics, on page 7, and they point out that from June 1952 to June 1960 the average increase in the cost of living in South Africa was 2.8 per cent per year, but in that same period the average <i>per capita</i> income only increased by 1.4 per cent, the real income. I think even the hon. member for Krugersdorp will understand that means that the cost of living in South Africa in the period I mentioned has been increasing twice as fast as the net <i>per capita</i> income of the average worker. And if we take into consideration that this is the average income and that it is not equally distributed amongst all sections of the population, and for the reason that I have given that most of the white-collar workers are either not organized or else organized in associations which for ethical and reasons of public interest do not indulge in high pressure collective bargaining and threats of strikes, you will appreciate that this 1.4 per cent increase in the <i>per capita</i> income has perhaps benefited them less than any other section of our community. I think these figures warn us to be very cautious about making easy, facile and superficial comparisons. It is not my purpose to talk politics this morning, but to illustrate the dangers inherent in such superficial comparisons, I want to remind you of certain propaganda that my hon. friends opposite like to make during elections. They take a man, say with an income of R2,000 a year and they say: Now look, in 1948 he paid so much in income-tax, but to-day, under the Nationalist Party, in 1960 or 1961, he pays no income-tax at all.</p>

<p>Good old Nationalist Party! But what dishonest propaganda from such good people! Because the question that one should ask is: After a man of a &#x00A3;1,000 income in 1948 had been taxed and after a man with a R2,000 income in 1961 had paid no income-tax, what could he buy with the money that he had left? The simple answer is that in 1948 he could buy almost three times as much with his money as he could in 1961. That is the test. I do hope that in this debate, in trying to weaken the impact of the argument in favour of the workers of South Africa, we will not be given a long list of figures showing the improvements that have been made since 1948 without relating them &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I am not afraid. All I ask is to make fair comparisons. I am as eager as any member in this House to advertise to the world what an enlightened community we South Africans are in looking after our people. All I ask is that when making these comparisons, we should not create wrong impressions, we should not be lulled by such false comparisons into a false sense of contentment, into smug feeling that all is well with the people in South Africa who have a fixed income. In making those comparisons, we should be just. Hon. members should deflate the figures to adjust them to the increase in population and to the decrease in the value of money. &#x201C;The Economist&#x201D; has calculated that the Rand if it was worth 10s. in 1948, is only worth 65 cents to-day. I think we can determine for ourselves what is the lot of these people to-day if we try to find some criterion to determine how they are managing on their present incomes. I have tried to find such a criterion, and I think the best one I could find was to try and find out how they manage with their debts. Can they live within their income? Are they in trouble? I want to say with regret that the hon. the Minister of Justice finds it too much trouble to assist the people of South Africa in determining that small fact, because I do believe that the best criterion of what is happening to our people is to look at the number of summonses that are issued in South Africa for debt. That tells you whether the people are managing or not. I have some figures here. The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) some years ago, (you will find the figures in Vol. 99 of <i>Hansard,</i> Col. 332) asked the Minister of Justice how many summonses for debt were issued in the Union during each of the years 1947 to 1958. The Minister gave the figures quite easily for the years 1952 to 1958. The others he said were not available. And we find that in 1952 throughout South Africa, 287,887 summonses were issued for debts. That is bad enough. But you know that by 1958 that figure had almost doubled to 483,930 summonses for debts! Sir, on 26 May 1961, the same member asked the hon. the Minister for later information. It was refused then and the excuse was that it was too much work to give the figures for that year. The year before it was not too much to take the figures out for eight years And then, although the Minister was warned on 26 May 1961, that these figures were of value to some members of Parliament who were concerned about the lot of the ordinary man and woman in South Africa, and that these figures were important to us, when he was again asked the same question on 27 June 1961, he again refused. This morning, my friend the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) asked the Minister for the latest figures, after the Minister had had indications from two members of Parliament that they considered this to be in the interests of the people of South Africa, and again the hon. the Minister of Justice refused to give those figures. Why? It may mean too much work for the Minister, but it is difficult to understand why it should be too much work to-day whereas it did not mean too much work three years ago. According to newspaper reports at the end of last year the issue of <span class="col_863-864" refersTo="page_448"/>summons in Johannesburg and Pretoria had broken all records in the 12 months before October 1961. The estimate is that for the whole of South Africa they far exceeded half a million. These were summonses for debt, Sir, more than half a million in one year.</p>

<p>What is the reason?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. member what the reason is. The reason is that people have not got enough money to live like decent people. We must remember, Mr. Speaker, that for every person who is summonsed for debt, there is probably another one who has received a letter of demand from an attorney and who has gone and offered so much per month and has had his offer accepted. Others again borrow money to pay their debts so that summonses will not be issued against them. I think it is safe to say that twice the number of people who are summonsed, are in some financial trouble, have difficulty in making ends meet. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that.</p>

<p>When that is the situation, Sir, one must ask oneself what provision can such people who are in financial trouble make&#x2014;unless they live frugally and below the standards that are accepted in South Africa as decent living&#x2014;for the exigencies of life. In order to understand that I think we should have a look at the social security measures that exist in South Africa to-day. We find, Sir, that the State makes available to the people, all subject to a means test, the following social security benefits: Old-age pensions, pensions for the blind, invalidity allowances, mothers&#x2019; grants, maintenance grants for children in certain circumstances. In addition, in industry and trade, subject to supervision by legislation of this House, people are insured against unemployment, they are protected against occupational disability and diseases, they receive maternity grants and in certain circumstances they receive a limited sick pay. What is interesting to me, Sir, is that everyone of these measures, with one exception, existed in South Africa in 1948. The exception is the sick pay benefit under our unemployment insurance scheme. All the others were introduced in South Africa between the years 1910 to 1924 or between the years 1933 to 1943. The one new social security measure which was introduced into this country by a Nationalist Party Government was old age pension at the rate of &#x00A3;1 10s. 0d. per month, which was good at the time; I am not arguing about that.</p>

<p>I want to suggest to a Government with such a record, in contrast with other governments of this country, that the time has come to give some attention to an extension of the social security system available to the people of South Africa. I do not say that they should not concentrate upon idealogical measures. I do not think they should but I understand that they cannot help it, because their survival as a political party depends on that. But the survival of many ordinary people depends upon their giving their attention to other matters as well. I am suggesting that the time has come that they should start. I am not suggesting that they have done nothing. They have done a great deal to improve the benefits and to patch up measures and legislation and schemes introduced by other governments. There have been some remarkable improvements, but not a single new scheme was introduced by them except the one that I have mentioned. And, Sir, there are things urgently necessary as I shall show.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I draw your attention to the fact that while we are discussing the lot of our salaried and wage-earning people of this country there is not a single full-fledged Minister of the Cabinet in this House.</p>

<p>When I ask what provision can these people make, these people who are burdened by debt and who are struggling to make ends meet in a country which is apparently prosperous, then I ask which are the two major difficulties in that direction for which he has to make provision? What provision should every man be able to make out of his earnings for the protection of himself and his family apart from those social services which I have mentioned? I think the House will agree with me that there are two things that demand priority from every husband, from every mother, who earns money and that is provision for his or her old age and provision for the cost of medical expenses which may hit any family to a degree for which nobody can make normal provision. This question of the care of our old people has been discussed in this House on private members&#x2019; days every year, I think, over the last 10 years. Mr. Pocock, the then member for Sunnyside; for many years made this his special province.</p>

<p>The last thing I wanted to do when I started my speech was to bring politics into the subject. But I want to repeat, Sir, that I would be failing in my duty if I did not draw the attention of this House to the indifference on the part of the Cabinet towards this matter. As much as I want to avoid politics, I want to know where is the Minister of Labour, where is the Minister of Social Welfare, where is the Minister <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_449"/>of Finance. Any one of them should at least have given some impression of interest on the part of the Government in the fate of the ordinary workers of South Africa. Where are they? There are only 19 members of a Government of over 100 members in the House at the moment. I may say this, Sir, that if this were a political debate, if we were discussing Bantustans or something like that, the serried ranks would have filled every seat on the other side.</p>

<p>At the moment we pay a maximum old age pension of R23 per month subject to a means test of R180 per year. In the circumstances of to-day, with the cost of living as high as it is, this is totally inadequate. But it becomes even more paltry and even more useless, when you consider that this is still subject to a means test. Although the Social and Economic Planning Council reported in 1944 that once our national income reached &#x00A3;1,000,000,000 per annum, the means test would be unnecessary, the means test still exists in spite of the fact that our national income has reached a figure of over R2,000,000,000 per annum. It is a degrading system; it is a system which means unnecessary administrative work; it is a system which penalizes the thrifty and the decent citizen in South Africa. It has often struck me that if a married couple work hard all their life and put all their available savings into a house so that when they are old and can no longer work, they will be assured of a roof over their heads, they cannot get an old age pension if that house&#x2019;s value is above the means test. But the spendthrift, the person who takes no care for his own future, can get the maximum pension. I think that is anti-social and unwise. It can only be justified when the State cannot afford to do better.</p>

<p>I will answer that. I have answered that question before. Mr. Pocock has answered that before but I shall answer it again. What we suggest, Sir, is that there should be, in the first instance, a contributory national pension scheme which will assure all South Africans of a pension when they reach the age of, say, 65. In addition, and subject to a means test&#x2014;because we are not one of the wealthiest nations in the world&#x2014;there should be a supplementary pension paid to people who require it to meet their needs.</p>

<p>I now want to make a further suggestion. The Government is a cautious institution. I want to suggest to the Government that they should start on the right course immediately this year.</p>

<p>Shall I for the benefit of that hon. member repeat the list of social security measures that were introduced into this House by governments other than the Nationalist Party, by the old South African Party Government and by the old United Party Government? Shall I repeat that with the exception of the old age pension, and with the exception of sick pay under the Unemployment Insurance Act, they have not introduced a single new measure for the people of South Africa? How dare the hon. member ask me a question like that? I want to ask the Nationalist Party that if they must leave the minimum number of members to listen to this debate, to leave members who know something about this subject.</p>

<p>The suggestion I want to make seriously, Sir, is that instead of reducing the pension to-day on the &#x00A3; for &#x00A3; system as the man&#x2019;s income starts to exceed the means test, the Social Economic and Planning Council suggested that for every &#x00A3; of income that exceeded the means test, the pension should be reduced by 17s. 6d. I want to suggest to the Government; they can start with that. I hope this suggestion will be conveyed to members of the Cabinet. Other members on this side will go into greater detail in regard to a national contributory pension scheme. We feel that is priority number one; that is the greatest need which the people of South Africa have to-day, especially as it is becoming more and more difficult for people to save money out of their income under a Government who has frozen cost-of-living allowances from 1948 to 1953 and from 1953 to to-day. The other thing is that we feel that something special should be done to assist families to meet unexpected and abnormal medical expenses.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has on more than one occasion pleaded for that; he has had motions on the Order Paper about that and spoken to them. I understand that this question is being investigated by some committee or some commission but I want to express the hope that something will be done about this urgently. Our information from existing medical aid societies is that 72 per cent of the people of South Africa, excluding the Natives, are not covered against medical expenses. We all know that the cost of medical treatment and the specialization in the practise of medicine, place a tremendous burden on the ordinary man in the street.</p>

I do not want to expand on this except to say that what we suggest is not a medical benefit scheme where the right to choose his own doctor is taken away from the patient, nor do we suggest a State medical scheme under which all the doctors become civil servants&#x2014;we do not want to have more people in the unfortunate situation of the civil servants&#x2014;we <span class="col_867-868" refersTo="page_450"/>suggest a medical aid scheme subsidized by the Government &#x2026;</p>

<p>If I may now summarize let me say this: Official statistics show that the cost of living is rising twice as fast as the <i>per capita</i> income of our people. Many of our people find their income rising more slowly than the increase every year in the cost of living. Our people are in debt; they find it difficult to make ends meet far more than ever in the history of South Africa. This is proved by the number of summonses that are issued for debt in this country. We hope that the machinery available to the State to adjust incomes and salaries will be employed even faster than they are to-day, although we are grateful for the improvement that there has been in the administration of the Wage Act. We hope and ask the Government&#x2014;we are not pleading on our knees&#x2014;but we ask the Government in the name of the citizens of South Africa as of right, that in the light of modern development throughout the world, our South African citizens should also enjoy protection against the unforeseen events of life of which medical expenses and old age are the most important.</p>

<p>I second the motion that has been moved by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) and in doing so I should like to associate myself with the view that he expressed that it was a great pity that members of the Cabinet who are directly concerned with these vital matters affecting the white-collar worker and salaried employee, such as the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, should not be present in the House to hear this debate. However, we do have in the House the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Defence who has just entered the Chamber. In regard to the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs he would have heard from the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville of the plight which is facing many of our ordinary salaried workers,&#x2014;the man in the street, and that plight can be attributed to a great extent to the slowing-down of the development of South Africa and the development of our economy. So I do hope that the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs who intends to participate in this debate, will give us some indication as to what plans the Government might have to bring about that necessary expanding economy which in turn will bring about greater prosperity and raise the living standard of a large number of our community, indeed of all members of our community. During the past few years when the tempo of that development has slowed down, we have seen an increase in unemployment, we have seen the great financial struggle that has taken place by the ordinary man in the street. The natural resources of our country should be developed and exploited to the full and because they are not exploited in that fashion we have not had that expanding economy which creates new opportunities and a greater future for all our citizens. In this regard, with that position developing, particularly over the past few years, we find that numerous people experience various hardships. It was disappointing that the hon. the Minister of Justice was unable to supply the figures showing the number of summonses for debt that have been issued during the past few years. Therefore, the only alternative that we have in ascertaining those figures is to piece together the information that we have obtained from other sources. The hon. member for Yeoville mentioned the figures for the Witwatersrand and other parts of the country. The figures that I have been able to obtain pertain to Durban where for the year ending 28 December 1961, 51,076 summonses for debt were issued compared with 46,819 for the year 1960. So you can see from these figures, Sir, that there is a steady increase in the issue of summonses for debt. And this is an indication and a barometer to show the difficulties with which people are faced to-day due to living standards and the high cost of living. In regard to the high and increasing costs of the necessities of life, such as food, shelter and clothing &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) is perhaps not aware of the high incidence of malnutrition that exists in South Africa to-day. It is obvious, Mr. Speaker, that the member for Cradock does not suffer from any malnutrition. But I can assure the hon. member that if he were to visit some of our hospitals and see the advanced stage of malnutrition and the diseases that are caused through that malnutrition, he will realize that it is invariably due to the lack of sufficient food protein and due to the fact that with the increased cost of living, people have to save in one or other direction and it is a great pity when that economy has to be made in regard to food. While these people are suffering from malnutrition the hon. member for Cradock might be interested to hear that only last year in the <i>Farmers&#x2019; Weekly</i> of 31 May 1961 a statement appeared to the effect that according to Dr. F. K. Mitchell, Medical Officer of Health of the Cape Divisional Council, skimmed milk was dumped in Table Bay at the rate of 2,300 gallons per day. The reason given was that it was uneconomical to market this valuable foodstuff. Here, Sir, we have the scandalous situation where people are suffering from malnutrition and a vitally important food that will assist in combating that malnutrition, is dumped because they are concentrating on other ideological issues instead of concentrating on issues which so vitally affect the health of our nation.</p>

<p>The question of the present-day living standards and the position of our salaried <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_451"/>workers is such that due to the burden of the high cost of living, they are often unable to make provision for their old age. They are unable to look forward to a period of security, financial security, during that period when they will be unable to work. It is for this reason that a certain section of our community is indeed suffering to-day. They are the people who thought they had made sufficient provision for the latter years of their life by means of life or endowment policies or capital investments. Some of these people who retired perhaps ten years ago and who thought they could live comfortably and maintain their normal standard of living on &#x00A3;35 or &#x00A3;40 per month, find that with the decrease in the purchasing power of their money, they now have continually to lower their standard of living. They are living on a fixed rate of income. They do not enjoy the benefits which those people who are in employment enjoy, such as reviewed cost of living allowances and normal pay increases, to meet that rising cost. To these people in particular the present burden of the high cost of living is becoming considerable, indeed, in some instances almost unbearable. These people then have to move from premises that they may have had for many years perhaps and change their entire standard of living to meet the reduced standard of living that they are called upon to face. These people look forward to the Government to come forward with some plan and to give its attention to these vital matters concerning the increase in the cost of living and the burden that they are called upon to shoulder. Invariably there are other persons who, perhaps for economic reasons, have been displaced in their form of employment, who are over the age of 45 years of age, have a great deal of difficulty in finding other employment. I want to say, particularly to members of the Government who advocate private pension schemes, that one of the difficulties that exist is that these people are not accepted on the staff on a full-time basis and that they are therefore unable to join such a pension scheme. Therefore when the time does come when they are unable to continue their employment they are faced with severe hardship of having to maintain themselves on an old age pension, if they are so qualified. On the other hand, a person who has made provision for his old age through insurance policies or through the accumulation of capital, finds that because of that accumulation of capital, he is disqualified from drawing an old age pension so as to supplement the ordinary income that he is receiving. I feel that this discrimination on those economic grounds is most unfair in present day circumstances.</p>

<p>The question of a contributory national pension scheme which is part of the subject matter of this motion, is one which members on this side of the House have put forward on almost an annual basis. I and my party feel so strongly about this matter that it may be that this issue will be placed before this House on every possible occasion. Because we sincerely believe that it will go a long way towards the solution of our problem, the problem of old age. The position to-day is that people try to eke out a living on their old age pension, and we as public representatives know that as public representatives we receive appeals over and over again from persons who do not qualify for a pension for certain reasons, or from people who receive reduced pensions for some reason or other. These people have great difficulty to exist on those hopelessly inadequate pensions. Not so long ago a survey was made in Durban where they toured various areas where aged persons were living and the revelations of that report shocked a number of people to such an extent that they formed an organization to assist and help those aged people who were living in drab conditions in backrooms throughout the city. I think it is of the utmost importance that pending the introduction of a contributory pension scheme, the present position in regard to old age pensions should be reviewed. I think there is not a single member in this House who would dare to suggest that the present old age pension is sufficient. Therefore it is hoped that when the time comes pressure will be brought to bear on the Minister of Finance to do something to increase the pensions that are being paid to-day. Because, Sir, the inadequacy of these pensions is something which requires the urgent attention of the present Government. We realize that in terms of the estimates each year, considerable sums have been and are being voted for old age pensions and other social security measures. The current estimates for the year ending March 1962, reflect an amount of something in the region of R43,000,000. As the number of old age persons increases year by year so will that figure increase considerably. Realizing that increased pensions will bring about a greater drain on our finances, we think that should be supplemented by a contributory national pension scheme. The question of the increasing number of aged persons each year was brought to our notice in 1959, when the Secretary for Education announced that a survey was to be made in regard to 3,000 aged persons, wherein it was stated that the percentage of persons over 60 years of age in 1910 was 4 per cent, and now it is 10 per cent of the entire population. On to-day&#x2019;s figures it would mean that approximately 300,000 persons are over 60 years of age, and by the time we reach the turn of the century we will have about 700,000 persons over 60 years of age. So you can see, Sir, that this is a very real problem, when we consider the increasing number of persons who, due to the advances in medical science, have had the span of life extended. Only recently a medical man stated in a lecture in America that the span of life has been extended ten years over the past 20 years. Whereas to-day it is 70 years, It used to be 60 twenty years ago, and in the beginning of the century it was only 47 years. So with this ever increasing problem, urgent attention must be given to the entire problem of our aged.</p>

<p>Other matters which should receive the attention of the Government to alleviate the <span class="col_871-872" refersTo="page_452"/>hardship suffered by the aged is in regard to accommodation. I mentioned earlier people living in such drab conditions that more funds should be made available for sub-economic schemes to provide cottages and flats for the aged.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Did you say sub-economic?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Invariably we see large sums of money being voted for housing for other racial groups and we do not object to that, but I feel that some consideration should be given to the development of more sub-economic housing, flats and dwellings, for the aged; it is true that there are a large number of old-age homes and welfare and charitable organizations which do a magnificent job of work in this regard, but the available accommodation is always inadequate. I know of institutions in my own constituency which have long waiting-lists of over 200 people for the homes for aged women. In addition, there is a large number of elderly people who have a great deal of pride and are not prepared to live in such homes, but who would be prepared to do so if they could live independently in flats or cottages.</p>

<p>The whole question of pensions to-day turns round the application of the means test and that is subject to the most severe criticism of our present system. If we look at the means test to-day which undoubtedly discriminates against thrifty people, we find that the ceiling set by the means test for free income or means is far too low and is not realistic. If a person is earning R180 per annum, he qualifies for the full pension, but it is proportionally reduced for every R12 per annum in excess of R180 per annum by R12 being deducted from the basic pension. Therefore the minimum pension that can be received is R12 per month and it also means that the maximum income allowed is R312 per annum, which is R26 per month. So if any applicant receives an income in excess of R26 a month, he does not qualify at all for a pension. I am indeed sorry that the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare is not here.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Where are all the Ministers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Because this is a matter which disqualifies a large number of the aged from obtaining a pension. It is those people who are suffering most hardship through the increasing cost of living, those who just fail to qualify for a pension as the result of the means test. They are people who have not been fortunate enough to be members of a pension fund. They are the white-collar employees of yesterday, who are suffering increasingly through the high cost of living and spiralling prices. The whole application of the means test, particularly in regard to free income, requires immediate review by the Government. The Government should also investigate the possibility of raising the amount allowed in regard to home ownership, the valuation of a maximum of R2,400. Up to that figure the applicant is entitled to the full pension, but thereafter deductions are made up to a certain amount and then he is disqualified for a pension. For the basis of that calculation I think the Government should give immediate attention to raising that amount. It must also consider the fact that a large number of municipalities have revalued properties which will adversely affect applicants in future, by that ceiling not having been raised accordingly.</p>

<p>The whole question of the means test has been discussed for many years. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) referred to the year 1944, when there was a Select Committee on Social Security under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and of which the Minister of Finance was also a member. It was strongly recommended that the means test should be reviewed. On page 19 of that report they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In pursuing the objective of encouraging the individual to provide for himself, the Committee drew attention to the fact that the more rigid the means test according to which the pension is determined, the less obviously is the inducement to save and to continue earning.</block>

<p>Also in 1944 when great progress was made in regard to giving attention to social security measures, the South African National Conference on Post-War Planning and Welfare Work was held in Johannesburg, and at that conference the effects and defects of the means test were fully discussed, and the conference resolved that the means test should be abolished gradually in respect of old-age pensions. So this matter has been receiving attention for many years and I think the time has come for action to be taken so as to bring about a relaxation of the means test, and when a contributory pensions scheme is introduced to abolish the means test; because with the introduction of a contributory pension scheme we suggest that it will be possible to abolish the means test entirely in the case of people of 70 years and over. The administration of the present means test must cost a considerable amount of money. We all know that when we approach the Department in regard to any matter, huge files are produced. These files involve expensive administration and continual adjustment. When there are financial changes in the position of the pensioner, adjustments have to be made. We know that sometimes it is found that over-payments have been made and those over-payments have to be refunded to the Department with retrospective effect, which often results in severe hardship to the person who has been receiving a pension, thinking in all good faith that it was the correct pension, but who then finds that a mistake has been made and that he has to refund a certain amount. Sometimes the Department wishes that amount to be refunded <span class="col_873-874" refersTo="page_453"/>in a lump sum, but in most cases they are sympathetic and it is deducted on a monthly basis, but that also results in hardship to these people who are struggling with the high cost of living. So it is obvious that the retention of the means test involves costly administration and therefore the argument that is sometimes used against the introduction of a contributory pension scheme that the cost of administration will be very high can be negatived by the fact that we would be obviating the enormous administrative costs involved in the application of the means test.</p>

<p>The whole question of introducing a contributory pension scheme has been mentioned in this House already by numerous speakers in the past. They have given details of the scheme and therefore I do not intend to go into the details again. However, briefly the contributory pension scheme in principle will mean that people will contribute towards a pension fund which will supplement present-day pensions and by doing so they will have the right to claim a pension when they reach a certain age, 60 years in the case of women and 65 for men. But from the age of 60 to 70, the applications should be subject to a limited form of means test, because there are many persons of that age who can still work and contribute towards the economic development of the country. But no means test should be applied to a person over 70 years of age. We also believe that the present pension should be increased to an amount of R25 per month, plus an amount of R15 per month to be derived from the contributory pension fund, thereby making a pension of R40 per month, which will be more in line with present-day costs of living. So the introduction of this scheme will mean a pension of R40 a month for all people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>For all people? Even the rich?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, for all people over 70 years of age. We believe there should be a limited form of means test for people between 60 and 70, but the amount of pension to be paid to those people should also, provided they qualify, be R40 a month; but for those over 70 there will be no means test and they will receive a pension of R40 a month.</p>

<p>The question is then raised how this is to be financed. The scheme suggested by the former member for Sunnyside (Mr. Pocock) quoted figures based on the population ratios of that time, whereby the contributions would vary from 30 cents a week from employees under 21 years of age, and after 21 years of age a varying contribution of not more than R1 a week after 30 years of age. Naturally these figures, in view of the present-day ratio of population, are not accurate, but they do give a basis on which a scheme could be established. Naturally it would require thorough investigation by actuaries to see what effect this would have and to see whether it is actuarially sound.</p>

<p>In passing, I might mention that other countries have introduced such schemes like Britain, and there are other schemes such as in New Zealand where they have an all-embracing social security scheme. I have been fortunate enough to see the figures in regard to the New Zealand scheme, where the Government pays from the consolidated revenue fund something like &#x00A3;15,000,000 per annum towards that fund and the contributions received by way of deductions total &#x00A3;30,000,000 for that year, but that includes all the benefits granted under the social security scheme, which goes very much further than the scheme we are suggesting here.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<p>We believe that in the beginning this scheme will be applicable only to the Whites, but as time progresses and the scheme proves successful we can consider extending it to the non-Whites. This contributory pension scheme, we believe, will do a great deal towards relieving the present hardships being experienced by old people who are unable to provide for their old age and those who have made provision but who are sometimes disqualified from receiving a pension. It would become a right and not a privilege for these people to draw an adequate pension.</p>

<p>Therefore I hope that the House will give careful consideration to this motion and that the Government will pay attention to these very urgent problems which are facing our people. I believe the time is passed that we can merely sit back and watch people struggling under these present-day conditions. The time has come for action and we urge the Government to take that action.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened to two speakers this morning and I want to deal first with the pleasant part before I have to deal of necessity <span class="col_875-876" refersTo="page_454"/>with the unpleasant part. I should like to say a word or two first therefore about the remarks made by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield).</p>

<p>The hon. member really made a contribution to the debate this morning. He made a very discerning speech, portions of which one can certainly agree with. His remarks on the means test were listened to with great sympathy, also by members on this side of the House. He referred to old people who have used their savings to buy a house and who are now precluded from receiving a pension. The Government views the position of these people with sympathy. Those elderly people who have passed the age of 45 or 55 and who find difficulty in obtaining employment with the result that they are unable to build up a pension for themselves, have our sympathy. There is also the problem of the provision of housing for the aged. I want to say at once in connection with his speech that the Government is definitely not unsympathetic towards the interests of the workers in South Africa.</p>

<p>But now we come to the unpleasant part of the debate, and that is the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<p>In making that speech he did the workers a disservice. All he did was to strike some hard blows against the workers. We have several new members in this House and I think they realize this morning why the hon. member has had to go from one constituency to another in recent years. First it was Alberton then Vereeniging and now it is Yeoville. They also saw the reason why the hon. member&#x2019;s party is going downhill so rapidly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Are you helping the workers now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I am helping them, because I want to save them from a United Party Government.</p>

<p>I want to express my regret at the fact that the hon. member has made a political issue out of this important matter. He started talking about election propaganda. I just want to remind him of the fact that there is no election in the offing; we have just had an election. When a Government has been in power for 14 years it is only to be expected that certain people will be dissatisfied, but they cannot even get those people to vote for their party. After 14 years the number of people who vote for this Government is still increasing. The hon. member has been in this House a long time and should know better, but he comes along with this distasteful remark about members of the Cabinet who are not present. He knows as well as I do that in the interests of this country it is essential to hold Cabinet meetings during sessions of this House. He knows that was also the case while they were in power, but he refers to this in spite of the fact that the leader of his party is not in his seat. Of all the United Party frontbenchers he is the only one in his seat. That is an impression which is being created throughout the country and it is one which is not in keeping with the dignity of this House. The Ministers are attending Cabinet meetings in the interests of the country. The hon. member knows as well as I do that the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, who is here now, has been instructed to put all important matters before the Ministers. I think it is cheap propaganda and nothing else.</p>

<p>I now want to come to another aspect of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, and that is the incorrect information which he gave to the House. He says that the means test in respect of old-age pensions is R180. That is not true and the hon. member should know it. The means test is R324. The hon. member has juggled with figures which, he says, he got from the University of Stellenbosch, but he has extracted from those figures only a half-truth. He reminds me of the person who was in the employ of a certain Department. He had to submit a report about 100 forestry workers who were employed somewhere. There were two women who had to keep house and cook for them, and then one of them got married to one of the forestry workers. This person then reported that 50 per cent of the women had married 1 per cent of the men. I want to warn the hon. member to be careful with his figures. One can easily juggle with figures as he did here this morning.</p>

<p>But he has come here with another argument, and that is the number of summonses which is supposedly increasing at present in South Africa. That is so, but after all that is not the whole truth. Why does he not tell the House that in those same years, when there was an increase in the number of summonses, private savings in South Africa also increased tremendously? And why does he not state that there has been a marked change in our people&#x2019;s way of living in recent years? We know that the hire-purchase system is a very great factor in these summonses. We know that luxuries to-day form a much greater part of our people&#x2019;s possessions and their way of living than they did previously. But now he makes one small point and he tells the House a half-truth by giving only the figure for summonses. He has definitely not rendered the worker a service. We in South Africa are too enlightened and too well informed to allow ourselves to be impressed by this speech. On the contrary, I think the only thing we can say about the hon. member&#x2019;s speech is that it has perhaps served one useful purpose: it at least offers one the opportunity of trying, on the basis of facts and investigations and experience elsewhere and on the basis of sober, practical hints, to render the workers and pensioners a service by continuing this debate.</p>

<p>I should like to ask myself in the first place, since we are dealing with employees in South Africa: What are the important considerations to any worker when he thinks of himself and <span class="col_877-878" refersTo="page_455"/>his family and his future? What are the important considerations that we have to bear in mind and which the Government must consider when we deal with the interests of our workers? The first is that there must be sufficient opportunities for employment. The second is that the wage must be remunerative, at least to such an extent that a reasonable standard of living can be maintained. The third is that the ratio between earnings and the cost of living must be such that a good standard can be maintained; the fourth is that there must be a reasonable measure of provision for old-age.</p>

<p>In regard to opportunities for employment I want to say that there is no unemployment in South Africa, and that particularly in respect of those persons to whom the hon. member&#x2019;s motion specifically refers, there is no unemployment whatsoever in South Africa. For those who can do office work there is no unemployment whatsoever. Everyone of them can find employment. As a matter of fact there is a great shortage. This position in South Africa can be attributed to one great truth, and that is the development that has taken place in this country as the result of and thanks to the sober and stable Government that we have in this country, and as a result of the faith which not only internal entrepreneurs but also foreign investors have in South Africa. The hon. member for Umbilo asked what the Government was going to do to encourage and promote further opportunities for employment and development. I do not wish to reply to his question, but I went to refer him to the State President&#x2019;s address at the opening of Parliament. The whole plan for the future is set out in that address.</p>

<p>But I want to mention a second thing, and that is if we think of opportunities for employment in South Africa and compare them with those in other countries, South Africa is in a very good position. In America there is unemployment to the extent of 8 per cent of the population. In South Africa it has not even reached the international figure of 2&#x00BD; per cent. And we must not forget that this Government is up against a problem with which other governments do not have to contend. In other countries all the work which is done by the Black man in this country is done by Whites, but in spite of this there is work for practically everybody here.</p>

<p>The second thing is that the wage must be sufficient for a reasonable existence. That is the position with regard to earnings in South Africa to-day, and I also say, not as the result of any study I have made of it because I have not had the time to do so, but after general observation even in the U.S.A., that the standard of living of the average person in South Africa is even higher than that in America.</p>

<p>Yes, Whites, and the standard of living of the Black man in South Africa is higher than that of any Black man in any other part of the world. Nowhere else in the world does one find people with such sparkling health as the Zulus of his own province. To tell the truth, the hon. member is typical of the condition of the Black man.</p>

<p>But now we must ask ourselves, for this motion deals with it, what the Government&#x2019;s role is in connection with the earnings of our workers in the future, and the reply to that is that the Government is not responsible for all the workers, but that the Government can only set an example in respect of those people in its employ, that is the people in the Public Service. And what is the position in the Public Service? During the past ten years the Government has annually brought about improvements in the Public Service amounting to R21,600,000. And the hon. member for Yeoville has the audacity to speak of &#x201C;the unfortunate position of the civil servant&#x201D;. I repeat that we are not at the moment discussing either whether it is sufficient or whether there is room for improvement; I just wish to remove the false impression created by the hon. member for Yeoville. While that is the overall figure I should like to mention just a few figures in connection with specific spheres of employment in South Africa to show how the Government has set an example to all employers in this country. In the Department of Health the following average percentage increments were granted, and these apply to all scales of medical personnel: In 1951 there was an increase of 11 per cent, in 1953 of 17 per cent, in 1955 of 8 per cent, in 1958 of 22 per cent and in 1960 of 8 per cent. I do not wish to create a false impression, and I wish to add that the relatively high increments in 1953 and 1958 are due to the partial and later on the general consolidation of cost-of-living allowances, but the fact remains that here we have a striking example of what has been done. Let us look at the Department of Prisons. I shall give three examples only: A chief warder started at R900 &#x00D7; 50 &#x00D7; 1,000 in 1948; to-day it is R1,400 &#x00D7; 100 &#x00D7; 1,800 &#x00D7; 100 &#x00D7; 2,040. In 1948 a warder started at R400 with increments of R40, rising to R800. To-day it is R720 &#x00D7; 60 &#x00D7; 900 &#x00D7; 100 &#x00D7; 1,700. In 1948 a Grade I wardress started at R680 &#x00D7; 40 &#x00D7; 800; to-day her scale is R1,200 &#x00D7; 60 &#x00D7; 1,400 &#x00D7; 60 &#x00D7; 1,600. Let me give one more example&#x2014;our police service.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that his money is worth half as much. Half-an-hour ago we heard from the hon. member for Yeoville that to-day the Rand is worth 60-odd cents. I think he said 65 cents. Well, 65 cents is by no means half. It is this kind of loose talk which made them lose the election; it is this kind of story that the hon. member spreads in the Bushveld. The hon. member for Yeoville has told us that to-day R1 is worth 65 cents&#x2014;not 50 cents. In 1948 a head constable earned R1,000 and his maximum was R1,200. To-day he gets R1,700 with a maximum of R2,160. A first grade sergeant started at R900 rising to R1,000; to-day he starts at R1,400 rising to R2,040; in 1948 a constable got R400 with a maximum of R800; to-day he starts at R720 with a maximum of R1,700.</p>

The hon. member for Yeoville produced a list here and stated that all these things were done during the r&#x00E9;gime of the United Party and that nothing new has been done by this Government.

<p>One can see that all this is new to the hon. member. Overseas visitors to this country express surprise at the high standard which is maintained in South Africa. I repeat that I am not arguing that there is no room for improvement; what I am doing is to remove the false impression created by hon. members on the other side. The Government set this example in the Public Service that in 1956 a scheme was instituted whereby public servants, who would not otherwise be able to build or buy a house, are now able to get a 100 per cent loan. Secondly, since 1956 the Government has been granting medical assistance to public servants by subsidizing their Medical Aid Associations, and last year the subsidy amounted to R240,000. Thirdly, when cost-of-living allowances were consolidated a great improvement was brought about with regard to the pension privileges of public servants. Fourthly, widows&#x2019; pensions have been increased. A holiday savings bonus has been instituted, and fifthly, there is also a Public Service bursary scheme to enable public servants to receive academic training. Several hundreds of bursaries are awarded annually. I have mentioned these things just to substantiate my statement that wherever the Government is able to set an example, it sets a fine and thorough example, and secondly, as a result of these favourable working conditions which it creates in the Public Service and for those who work for it, other employers are also obliged to grant to their employees privileges which are equal to or better than those given by the Government.</p>

<p>I do not wish to dwell at length on the cost of living; I simply wish to state the fact that the cost of living in South Africa is among the lowest in the whole world, and secondly that generally speaking the increases in both salaries and pensions in South Africa have more than made up for the rise in cost of living during recent years. I shall let the House have the figures later on to prove this, but I should think that the hon. the Minister will give the House authoritative figures in this connection.</p>

<p>Now I come to the suggestion that a contributory national pension scheme should be established in South Africa. I want to say at once that it has always been and still is the policy of this Government not to introduce a contributory national pension scheme in South Africa, and for that reason I wish to reject the proposal of the hon. member for Yeoville, and in doing so I wish to tell him at the same time what the policy of this Government is with regard to pensions. The policy is as follows: We accept and subscribe to the principle that during the working life of the individual provision should be made for his old age; secondly, we accept the principle of contributory schemes; thirdly, we accept the proposition that contributions should be on a bilateral basis from employers and employees, and fourthly, that it must not be in the form of one national pension scheme. By encouraging the establishment of funds connected with the circle of employment of the individual and by the establishment of Government machinery we wish to encourage private pension schemes and ensure that proper control is exercized over the assets of pension funds and, that the interests of the pensioner are protected, and furthermore, that this system is supplemented by the social pensions for those in need of assistance. That is the attitude of the Government and of this side of the House. But now the hon. member will want <span class="col_881-882" refersTo="page_457"/>to know why we reject a contributory national pension scheme. The first reason is that the expenditure connected with such a scheme would be much too high and the State cannot afford it, for the simple reason that as soon as there is such a contributory national pension scheme, the Treasury would have to make its contribution and the burden of that contribution would be much greater than the burden at present resting on the Government with regard to social and other pensions, and that would mean one thing only&#x2014;much higher taxation. I know that hon. members opposite would welcome nothing more than to see that the Government is forced to increase taxation. That would not save them.</p>

<p>I do not know what the Budget proposals are going to be but let me say this in connection with taxation in South Africa. We in South Africa, in comparison with the rest of the world and having regard to he responsibilities of the White man here at the southern tip of Africa, are paying much too little taxation. I repeat that I do not know at all what the intentions of the Government are; we are not consulted on these matters, but one thing is very clear to me, and that is that the taxpayer in South Africa is better off than the taxpayer in any other part of the world. Perhaps his position is too good if one takes into consideration our responsibilities here at the southern tip of Africa.</p>

<p>With regard to the contribution of the State in respect of a contributory national pension scheme, I also wish to refer to this report from which the hon. member read extracts to us, the report of the Commission of which the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) was chairman.

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) has read it too; the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) has read it as well, and the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) has read it too, but I cannot expect him to say that what the hon. member for Yeoville has said is not true. The Treasury was asked to estimate the costs, and now I shall tell you, Sir, what their finding was, from that report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The actuary estimated that the initial liability for such a fund would be &#x00A3;276,000,000.</block>

<p>No, I am sorry, that does not come from that report. But the United Party then appointed a departmental committee to go into this matter. They then also specially examined this aspect of persons who were already 60 years of age at the time or who would pay in contributions for only a few years and then get a pension in the event of a national pension scheme being introduced. They came to the conclusion that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To put this Fund on a sound basis in respect of these two aspects, the Fund would require a contribution from the Treasury to the amount of &#x00A3;12,800,000 per annum for the next 40 years.</block>

<p>In other words, to begin with, &#x00A3;276,000,000 and then, in respect of these two groups of people alone, that is, those who no longer contributed and those who would pay in for a few years only, the State would have to pay in &#x00A3;12.800,000 per annum for a period of 40 years. That is stated in the report. But the then United Party Government took a decision in the matter, and that decision was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government, after full consideration of the matter, have reluctantly come to the conclusion that they would not at this stage sponsor the introduction of old-age pensions as of right. They feel, quite apart from the consideration that many thousands of persons need no state-assisted protection in their old age, and the fact that the introduction of a compulsory contributory scheme, including old-age pensions, would give rise to many difficulties as regards the adjustment of existing State and private pension and provident funds, that the progressive increase in expenditure would be so considerable that the country should not lightly undertake a contractual obligation of this order.</block>

<p>That is their finding: &#x201C;The Government after careful consideration have reluctantly come to the conclusion &#x2026;&#x201D;If the speeches made here <span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_458"/>this morning on the question of a national pension scheme are not propaganda, what is propaganda?</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Let me read out just one more conclusion arrived at by the old United Party Government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such a scheme would be altogether disproportionate to the value of the service to the community.</block>

<p>That is the important point. The Commission to which the hon. member referred also came to the following finding, with which I wish to conclude&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This, it is true, will mean that the expenditure by the State and by the citizens will be more than doubled.</block>

<p>On the score of cost I do not think that the Government can consider a matter of this nature at this stage. But a second point is that the collection of contributions and the administration of such a scheme would cause endless problems in South Africa. I do not think that we have the necessary officials to administer such a scheme.</p>

<p>But now there is a third point. The hon. member has dragged politics into this matter, and I now want to refer to another illogical argument on his part or rather show how the Opposition adopts one attitude one moment and a different attitude the next moment. When they plead for a contributory national pension scheme, there is one basic requirement without which you cannot have the scheme, and that is that there must be a population register. What is the attitude of the United Party? They opposed the population register. They are still saying that we are carrying passes. What was the finding of that very Commission of which the hon. the member for Constantia was chairman in 1944? They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In terms of the code &#x2026;</block>

<p>This refers to the code for the introduction of a national pension scheme&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the entire population over the age of 16 years must be registered or else this scheme cannot work.</block>

<p>And then they also found&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A registration system is essential. This will be an immense task, but if the basic principle of a contributory national pension scheme is to be retained, the Board cannot see any other way out.</block>

<p>Let me quote the hon. member for Constantia again. What does he find in this connection? He calls this thing by its name, and this, Sir, is the party which says that there must not be a population register in South Africa. They now come and ask for a national pension scheme, knowing that a population register is one of the basic requirements of such a scheme. I want to quote the hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Having regard to the fact that a number of departments will have to administer the scheme, there is need for some kind of central registration, providing a basic number for every person.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville is also required to carry a number now. Do you know what he is asking the House? He is saying to the House, &#x201C;Give us a national pension scheme in terms of which I shall be required to carry a pass.&#x201D; The hon. member for Constantia says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the extensive registration that will be essential for the social security scheme, the Government should consider the desirability of providing a national population register. It is essential that the Government should give its attention to the question of registration referred to above without delay.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I leave it at that. I do not want to go into that aspect, but let me just point out that the two hon. members contradicted each other. This is an issue which will have to be decided in their caucus. The hon. member for Yeoville says that this is a matter which affects everyone&#x2014;White and non-White &#x2014;and he used the words, &#x201C;Whites, Coloureds and Blacks&#x2014;everybody&#x201D;. The hon. member for Umbilo said very clearly in reply to a question by the hon. member for Prinshof that it would be only Whites to begin with&#x2014;in the interim. How long that &#x201C;interim&#x201D; period will be, we do not know. The hon. member for Houghton was obviously very disappointed with the reply. Perhaps I should not say it, but when one thinks of the election campaign now in progress in Durban the hon. member should be pleased.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a last reason why there cannot be a national pension scheme in South Africa, and that is that the whole world is making the mistake of wanting to fight Communism with Comumnism&#x2019;s own tactics. You cannot fight Communism with Socialism and the introduction of a national pension scheme in South Africa would be nothing but a socialistic system in South Africa. Let us accept the proposition once and for all in South Africa that Socialism must have no place in the future of South Africa and that it should have no place here. If there is one thing which will save this country, whether it concerns pensions or whether it concerns medical services or anything else, it is that we in South Africa should maintain private initiative, that it should always remain the backbone of South <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_459"/>Africa, and that we must not destroy it with a socialistic scheme such as this. I feel very strongly on this matter.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why we in South Africa are opposed to a national pension scheme is that it is a socialistic system which would destroy the individuality of our people.</p>

<p>There is a last point which I want to mention, and that is that during the past years pensions in South Africa have been increased considerably. The impression created here, namely that the Government is unsympathetic, because allegedly there are no Ministers present, is not correct. The Government does not give attention to the position of the pensioner sometimes only; the Government gives its attention to it every year. Let me give the House the figures. In respect of all pensions there was an increase of R4,500,000 in 1952; an increase of R4,550,000 in 1953; an increase of R2,700,000 in 1954; an increase of R5,820,000 in 1955; an increase of R5.400.000 in 1956; an increase of R4,000,000 in 1959; in 1960 an increase of R3,306,000, and an increase of approximately R4,500,000 in 1961. Let us look at the individual himself in respect of old-age pensions. I am now referring to Whites. I do not have time to give all the figures, but there have also been increases in respect of the non-Whites. In respect of old-age pensions for Whites the means test in 1947 was R180; to-day it is R324, an increase of 80 per cent. In 1947 the maximum basic pension was R120; to-day it is R276, an increase of 130 per cent. Let me quote these figures once again: An increase of 80 per cent in the means test, an increase of 130 per cent in the old-age pension. We now come to cost of living. In 1947 the cost of living index figure stood at 139; it now stands at 229. That is an increase of only 64.28 per cent. Let us now look at war veterans&#x2019; pensions. In 1947 the maximum was R120; to-day it is R372, an increase of 210 per cent&#x2014;an increase of 210 per cent in war veterans&#x2019; pensions whilst the increase in the cost of living is only 64 per cent. I think these figures speak for themselves and I leave it at that, for I do not think that there is any figure which proves more convincingly to the pensioner in South Africa that this Government, as far as it lies within the power of any government and as far as taxation structure of the country permits, has done as much as it could have done and perhaps more.</p>

<p>There is just one last point which I want to mention. In connection with this matter I want to bring something to the attention of the Minister and with that I want to conclude. The question of control over pension funds etc. I shall leave to my seconder and other speakers. I have already taken up enough of the time of the House. But there is just one point in connection with old-age pensions which I want to bring specially to the attention of the Minister of Pensions, and that is that as far as our old people are concerned, we should also take particular note of one factor, perhaps the main factor in their lives, namely loneliness. Loneliness is increased by lack of funds, and it has never been brought home to me as forcibly as in recent months what a cruel factor it can be in one&#x2019;s life if one is really lonely. I was told by a lady with whom I am well acquainted that she was sometimes at her loneliest when she found herself in the busiest city of South Africa. I could never understand this. I have now realized this to some extent, having been alone in a distant country without my own people; everything was of the best and everything was good, but one thing lacked, and that is that one did not have the company and friendship of one&#x2019;s own people. One was lonely. This is but a small part of the loneliness which old people have to endure. In Los Angeles I saw old people crowding together on the square, where somebody would play the piano to provide a little music to entertain the others. I had never fully realized what a cruel factor this question of loneliness could be in the lives of old people, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Pensions very earnestly, next time the question of pensions is considered again, to see that greater cognizance is taken of this factor, that is whether we cannot, by means of an increased pension, a pension which will enable the old person greater opportunity to overcome this loneliness, perhaps compensate him a little more for the loneliness of old-age. for, as I have said, lack of funds increases one&#x2019;s loneliness in life.</p>

<p>I second the amendment. Sir, I came and sat here this morning expecting a great deal because I thought the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) would submit certain concrete proposals to the House because he had come here to plead for those workers who are not to-day covered by the Industrial Conciliation Act or the Wage <span class="col_887-888" refersTo="page_460"/>Act. But I must say that I have been disappointed in my expectations. I have seldom seen anybody perform such an egg dance as the hon. member for Yeoville has. He is a very good friend of mine, but one was really sorry to see how he used his talents this morning for propaganda purposes. In the course of my speech I shall deal with certain points that he made but I want to deal with a few of those immediately. The hon. member pleaded that the Government should introduce a medical aid scheme and I now want to point out that the United Party introduced such a scheme in the Transvaal in 1946. They did not have the courage to introduce that same scheme in the other provinces; they tried it out in the rich province of Transvaal. After that scheme had been in operation for a number of years it was found that the expenditure connected with it had a crippling affect on the taxpayers.</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. member the facts about the present-day position since the free medical scheme has been abolished. The position is that the public only contributes 8 per cent of the money spent in the Transvaal on hospitalization and that the taxpayer contributes 92 per cent. Furthermore, because it is no longer a 100 per cent free medical service, the position to-day is that the person who requires hospitalization gets it. Previously under the scheme of the United Party those people who needed hospital services could not get them, because the hospitals were filled with all sorts of people who were not entitled to be there.</p>

<p>I want to point out further that the hon. member has given the wrong information to the House, although he probably did not do so on purpose. He is correct when he says that the legislation in respect of social services, as he called it, was introduced by the old United Party Government. But the hon. member forgets to mention the new services that have been added, such as sick benefits, maternity grants and the cash payments, equivalent to six months&#x2019; benefits, that is paid to the widow on the death of a contributor. We have improved the benefits payable under existing legislation in that we have increased them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>It may have been a good foundation but we have affected great improvements to bring the position into line with present-day circumstances. When you study this motion, Sir, it becomes quite clear that the hon. member really felt that he no longer had the right to plead for the workers in general. He did try this morning, however, to correct the impression that his motion has created, but when you read his motion, you have to conclude that those workers who fall under the direct control of the Government as a result of the Industrial Conciliation Act and the Wage Act are being cared for and that the Government has done its duty towards them. So in consequence the hon, member is only pleading for the so-called white collar workers, the office workers, because their position cannot be attended to by the Government because there is no legislation that covers them.</p>

<p>I want to say this, Sir, that the United Party will make no impresssion on the workers with this propaganda that it is trying to make, because living conditions are good in South Africa to-day as a result of good government by the National Party Government. We are to-day passing through a flourishing period that very few other countries in the world are passing through. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. De Wet) has indicated that our standard of living is one of the highest in the world to-day. But let me say this clearly that the machinery of the Wage Act and of the Industrial Conciliation Act is also available to office workers if they want to be classified under those Acts. Practically all employees in big companies have their own staff associations, some of which are registered. Here I have in mind building societies. They have their own staff associations, the &#x201C;Building Society Employees Association&#x201D;, and if they want to avail themselves of the Industrial Conciliation Act they have the right to invoke its provisions provided they can persuade their employers to do so, and if they want to invoke the provisions of the Wage Act, they can do so in case of a dispute between them and their employers. I want to mention an instance. In the insurance world you have the Society of Insurance Officials to-day. Some time ago there was a dispute between them and their employers. They could not come to an agreement. The provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act were then invoked, they asked for arbitration, and a wage determination was made which is still in operation in the insurance world to-day. So you have the Society of Bank Clerks. These are big office-worker groups that have organized.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the question of how the cost of living of those people is affected by prevailing circumstances. Mr. Speaker, the general economic advance that we have undergone during the past 13 years and to which the Government has paid special attention, has enabled all workers to make a living on particularly favourable conditions. When you compare wages and salaries, you find that the increase in wages and salaries <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_461"/>has kept pace with the increase in the cost of living. I want to prove that. Salaries and wages are determined in the last instance by supply and demand. That is a basic economic principle. I want to point out that the development in the economic field has created a great shortage of skilled labour in the country. Private employers bid so high for the limited number of employees, that the Government has been forced from time to time to increase the salaries of its own officials, not only to enable them to make a better living, but also to compete for the available labour. When you consider what a civil servant earns&#x2014;the Government is responsible for that&#x2014;you see that the average income of civil servants has risen by 72 per cent in this country. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark mentioned the figure of 64 per cent in respect of the rise in the cost of living. However, the increase in the average earnings of civil servants, White and non-White, has been 72 per cent. When you take the position of a railway official, you find that the wages of railway officials (this figure only applies to Whites) have risen by 63 per cent. In other words, provision has been made for the increase in the cost of living in the wages and salaries that the Government pays its officials. So if the Government finds it difficult to get sufficient officials for its Civil Service and Railway Service in spite of these increased wages and salaries, it can only mean that the private employers are offering higher wages and salaries than the Government. In other words, if you argue on that basis, it means that the white collar worker of this country is in a position to make a reasonably good living in South Africa due to the general improvement in our economic position and due to the demand and supply that exist. Not that we do not view with sympathy any improvements that can be effected. All of us would like to offer them better conditions than the existing ones. Take the case of our national income. He did, it is true, mention the net <i>per capita</i> income, but as I have said since 1947 the cost of living has increased by approximately 64 per cent whereas our national net income has risen by 154 per cent. In addition to that our national savings have increased from 9 per cent of our national income in 1947 to 29 per cent of our national income in 1960. That means that a tremendous amount has been saved. Take consumer goods. The national expenditure on consumer goods, which again indicates our standard of living, has increased by 173 per cent. That is not expenditure on luxury articles, but on consumer goods. In other words, over the past 13 years our national standard of living has continually risen.</p>

<p>The hon. the member for Yeoville once again with the old story that we have heard so often, but I think if you consider the actual facts there is very little substance in the motion of the hon. member. I admit that it is a popular subject. I know of many trade unions who have asked for the introduction of such a scheme. But I think if we want to be honest with the workers, we should put the real facts clearly before them and tell them what will be achieved under a scheme such as the one suggested by the hon. member. You must tell them that if such a contributory scheme were introduced, what benefits they could expect. What will they achieve by that? I want to point out to-day what they can hope to achieve by referring to the scheme which is in operation in England. You know, Sir, that when you talk about anything that the British Government has done, it is all right as far as hon. members opposite are concerned. Whatever the British Government does is the best in the world. That is why I want to analyse their scheme. The countries who have introduced such schemes did not obtain the results that the workers expected. They did not yield satisfactory results.</p>

<p>State expenditure alone. The report of the Government Actuary of the British Government points out that for the year 1958 the contributions made by employees and employers to that scheme amounted to only 7&#x00BD; per cent of the contributions.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was showing how under the National Insurance Scheme the British Government had contributed 92&#x00BD; per cent of the expenditure, and that in spite of the fact that it was a contributory scheme the contributions of the employees and the employers constituted only 7&#x00BD; per cent of the revenue. It is not surprising therefore that the British Government became so perturbed at the increasing expenditure that they had to do something about it. In addition to that in 1958 the Labour Party in England promised a new contributory scheme to the British public, a scheme under which between &#x00A3;3 and &#x00A3;15 in benefits would be assured. The Conservative Party then had to do something to make a counter offer to the British public. They then placed a scheme on the Statute Book which <span class="col_891-892" refersTo="page_462"/>they called the &#x201C;Graduated Contributory Pension Scheme&#x201D;. That came into operation on 3 July last year. Before I analyse the results of this scheme I just want to tell you, Sir, what pension a pensioner in Britain received under the old contributory scheme. In 1948 the weekly pension of a single pensioner was 26s. per week and for a married couple 42s. per week. That was when we in South Africa were already paying our pensioners &#x00A3;5 per month (and &#x00A3;10 to a married couple). In 1958, when the scheme reached its peak, the weekly pension of an unmarried pensioner was 50s. and that of a married couple only 80s. per week, at a time when we were paying our pensioners, without contributions, a monthly pension of &#x00A3;10 10s. (or &#x00A3;21 to a married couple if both qualified for a pension). That is in comparison with 80s. per week or approximately &#x00A3;16 per month under a contributory scheme in Britain. It is quite clear that scheme did not come up to expectations, in spite of the fact that the British Government was perturbed about the fact that the costs in connection with the scheme were continually rising. The Actuary of the British Government calculated that the deficits under that scheme would be as follows: 1961/2 a deficit of &#x00A3;144,000,000; 1971/2 a deficit of &#x00A3;316,000,000; in 1981/2 a deficit of &#x00A3;428,500,000. That was why the British Government decided to put the so-called &#x201C;Graduated scheme&#x201D; in operation on 3 June 1961. The so-called &#x201C;flat rate scheme&#x201D; still exists. Workers who earn less than &#x00A3;9 per week contribute to the old scheme. Under the existing scheme which is in operation to-day the employer and the employee jointly contribute &#x00A3;4 1s. 1d. per week and in return for this contribution the unmarried person receives a basic pension of &#x00A3;2 17s. 6d. under this scheme and a married couple &#x00A3;4 12s. 6d. per week. In other words, in return for his contribution of &#x00A3;4 1s. 1d. per week the pensioner receives a pension of &#x00A3;2 17s. 6d. per week, or &#x00A3;4 12s. 6d. per week in the case of a married couple. If he earns over &#x00A3;9 per week up to a maximum of &#x00A3;15 per week, he may become a member of the &#x201C;graduated scheme&#x201D;. Under this scheme the employee and the employer jointly contribute &#x00A3;1 1s. 6d. per week up to &#x00A3;1 9s. 4d. It is expected that the State&#x2019;s contribution will rise from &#x00A3;187,000,000 this year to &#x00A3;238.000,000 in 1981/2. The question that arises is what does the pensioner receive under this so-called &#x201C;graduated scheme&#x201D;? Hon. members must remember that under the basic scheme a pensioner receives &#x00A3;2 17s. 6d. per week if he is unmarried and &#x00A3;4 12s. 6d. if he is married. Pilch &amp; Wood who recently published a book on pension schemes and they tell us what additional benefits the British pensioner will receive under this &#x201C;graduated&#x201D; scheme; they come to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This also means incidentally that to-day&#x2019;s pensioners derive no additional benefit from the scheme, and on the present scale it will be 20 years before any contributor can add so much as a &#x00A3; per week to his pension by this means.</block>

<p>Therefore, if that is the scheme that the British Government has given to the public of Britain, I think we all agree that scheme will not suit our circumstances and that it cannot meet our needs in South Africa. That is why it is this Government&#x2019;s policy to encourage private pension schemes, and I am pleased to note that since the passing of the Pension Funds Act, there has been a great increase in the number of registered pension schemes. In 1958 there were 2,771 registered schemes; in 1959 that number had risen to 3,075, in 1960 to 3,374 and at the moment there are 3,640. I mention this to show that the effect of that Act has been the annual establishment of a great number of pension funds for employees. In 1958, 675,000 persons were covered under this scheme; in 1959 this figure had risen to 803,000. I do not know what the figure is to-day, but if you consider to what extent the number of funds has increased, namely, that there are approximately 500 more funds than there were in 1959 and if you consider that as yet there are no State funds, you realize that a great many workers are covered under existing schemes. We have three State pension schemes for the Civil Service, the Police, Prisons and the Defence Force; we have the Railway scheme, and there are approximately three provincial schemes for each province, one for teachers, one for hospital staff and a third for the ordinary staff. It would appear, therefore, that anything between 1,000,000 and 1,200,000 workers are already covered to-day under these schemes. We should like, therefore, to continue in this way, and, as in the past, I should like to plead to-day for the introduction of legislation as soon as possible to compel these private schemes to conform to certain requirements. In the first place, as far as the various schemes are concerned, it should be made compulsory for benefits to be transferred. The hon. the Minister announced last year that he approved in principle of such legislation. But unfortunately it appears that this legislation will not come before us this year yet. As I have said, a very large number of employees are already covered. The purpose for which a pension scheme is instituted is to a large extent, frustrated however. There are far too many employees who resign from their jobs who draw their benefits and fritter them away before they reach retiring age. The Registrar of Pension Funds mentioned in his first annual report that he had made a test of ten funds chosen at random and had found that 48.2 per cent of the payments made in that particular year were in respect of repayments to people who had resigned from their jobs. In other words, almost half of these payments were made to people who had not yet reached retiring age.</p>

<p>They resigned because they went from one job to another or because they wanted to lay their hands on the <span class="col_893-894" refersTo="page_463"/>money. Hon. members on the other side must not shake their heads so quickly. I shall also give them another finding. I have an article here which proves that it is the young employee who does not value his pension yet who resigns in order to get back his contributions.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>This is done by the person who still has his life in front of him and who does not think of his old age, and then he goes out buys a car or a motorcycle. It is not the cost of living which troubles him, but he misuses the pension fund in order to obtain a little cash and then he wastes it in this way. Many of these cases later become a burden to the state, and I feel therefore that we should introduce legislation to protect these people from themselves. I think that we should accept the principle that it is the duty of every individual to provide for his old age himself. I agree with the hon. member for Yeoville and also with the hon. member for Umbilo that it is wrong, unreasonable and undesirable that thrifty, careful and industrious people have to provide for those who waste and squander their money during their working years. Mr. Speaker, our people cannot afford it either. I want to point out that we tax the young productive citizen in order to provide pensions for the aged. It is the young people who still have their lives in front of them who are being taxed to-day to provide for these people who already have their lives behind them. I do not say this unsympathetically, but I am pointing out the real difficulties that we have in connection with these schemes.</p>

<p>In addition to that our people are living longer nowadays. As a result of medical science, etc., our people are living longer and the number of men over 65 and women over 60 is increasing in proportion to the total population. I do not have the latest figures in this connection. The hon. member for Umbilo mentioned certain figures. I want to mention the figures for England. These figures cannot be applied to South Africa completely because our people do not age quite so fast, but they are nevertheless significant. In 1911 one person out of every 15 in England was a man over 65 or a woman over 60. To-day one out of every seven falls in those age groups, and it is expected that in 1979 one out of every five will be in that age group. In other words, the number of people who are taxed to provide pensions for the older people is becoming smaller in proportion to the population. For this reason I say that it will be a great burden that we will be placing on the productive part of our people if we are going to have this state contributory scheme, which is nothing but a form of taxation. That will be the position if we introduce it in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo has said that their policy is that it should only apply to Whites. What he said was really in conflict with the attitude of the hon. member for Yeoville. But, Mr. Speaker, let me say this&#x2014;and it is a fact which we must accept&#x2014;that in our industrial life to-day there is a greater and ever growing number of industrial workers who are non-White and for whom we shall have to make provision under the present old-age pension scheme. This is a fact which we shall have to accept. This amount cannot be calculated at the moment. But it cannot be argued away that it will constitute an ever-growing burden on the population unless steps are taken very quickly. I would seriously urge therefore that the legislation referred to should be placed before the House as soon as possible. The sooner we get this legislation, the sooner the vast majority of our population will be covered by these schemes. Delay is going to be very costly. In my opinion there are two things which such legislation will have to provide for at once. The first is the transferability of benefits from one fund to another. If an employee resigns from the service of employer who has a fund in existence, he must be able to transfer his benefits to the next fund where he is employed, if there is such a fund. If there is no such fund, steps should be taken to see that the contributions already accumulated by him are frozen; in other words that he will not be able to get back his contributions until, he reaches retiring age.</p>

<p>I want to go even further to-day. Apparently both sides of the House accept that there should be a compulsory scheme; that is accepted in principle. The Opposition say that it must be a compulsory state scheme. We say that there must be schemes which will cover the workers. The state scheme in England as well as the so-called &#x201C;graduated scheme&#x201D;, has shown, that a pension scheme must be dependent on the contributions of the employers and the employees, otherwise, unless we accept this, the burden eventually becomes too great for the state. I feel therefore that we should urge, if we cannot introduce compulsory schemes immediately, that at least a commission should be appointed to investigate whether we can make it compulsory for private pension schemes to be introduced for all workers. Mr. Speaker, if we accept the compulsory scheme of the Opposition, we shall be compelling every employer and employee to contribute to that scheme. Why then cannot we compel the employer and employee to contribute to a pension fund, without the intervention of the state? Why does it necessarily have to be a state scheme? In other words, it appears to me that the time has arrived for us to introduce a compulsory scheme under which all employers and employees will be compelled to introduce schemes which will cover the workers.</p>

<p>There are certain other objections to a State scheme that I want to mention to-day. In the first place, a State scheme just becomes a political football between the political parties. I have already mentioned that the Labour Party in England put forward a new scheme in 1958 and the Conservative Party then had to make a counter offer. They had to introduce a new scheme as a counter offer to the scheme <span class="col_895-896" refersTo="page_464"/>of the Labour Party. In this way one party will always be able to outbid the other at elections. But the second is that such a State scheme would undermine the independence of our people. As a people we are already making ourselves too dependent on the State, instead of assuming the responsibility of looking after ourselves. I have already indicated that a State scheme provides no solution to the problem of expenditure connected with such a scheme, because the State will always use the funds. If you have a contributory scheme, then the State is going to use those funds for some capital expenditure or other. When the amount has to be paid, the State will tax the taxpayers in order to be able to pay the pension. In other words, a State contributory scheme is no solution for the problem because the pensions are always paid out of taxes. There is no hope that the State&#x2019;s expenses will be diminished, because the State uses the funds of the scheme in the same way as the State to-day borrows the funds of pension schemes through the Public Debt Commissioners. Far from easing the burden, a State scheme does nothing in this connection.</p>

<p>In addition to that, private schemes will promote the mobility of labour. It is a good thing for a young economy to have mobility of labour. Stagnation is harmful in these times. We must, therefore, allow our workers to move about, in accordance with the law of supply and demand, in search of the highest offers for their services. Furthermore, reference has been made here to the older workers. One of the reasons why workers over 45 have difficulty in finding work is that almost all pension funds, as far as I know, provide that an employee over 45 cannot join. One can understand why a pension cannot be granted to such an employee, because his contribution would be very small. But if the transfer of benefits were allowed, then it would not matter if he went from one employer to another, because he would be able to transfer his benefits, and then the pension fund would no longer be an obstacle confronting the older worker who seeks employment. We know, for example, that a person over 45 cannot be appointed on a permanent basis in the public service. The reason for this is that he cannot contribute to the pension fund. Such legislation would also tend to prevent the young workers from resigning from their jobs in order to get hold of benefits. In other words, it would also tend to reduce the labour turnover. In addition we would have these funds available for investment in the country. The savings of our people would increase greatly if the whole population were covered by pension schemes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by putting forward one last plan. We talk now-a-days of the so-called white collar workers. Demands are made in the Railways and Public Service for a five-day week. I should like to add my plan for a five-day week. I know there are people who think that it cannot encourage productivity, that on the contrary it reduces productivity. But it is a fact that most industrial workers already have a five-day week. Actually it is the office worker who still does not have it. And, Mr. Speaker, it is my belief that it will bring about greater productivity. The fact of the matter is that to-day a full half-day&#x2019;s work is no longer done on Saturdays. An investigation was made by the Phillips Company in England. They sent a questionnaire to a large number of employers and the answers showed the following: With a five-day week it was found that productivity improved in 17 of the institutions; in 20 there was no change and productivity dropped in only one. Absenteeism improved in 25, showed no change in ten and did not deteriorate in a single case. In other words, there was an all-round improvement. In respect of late arrivals there was an improvement in 16 cases, no change in nine, and no deterioration in a single case. As regards personnel turnover, nine showed improvement, 12 no change and in only one was there deterioration. Then as far as personnel recruiting was concerned, 19 cases showed improvement, nine no change and in no case was there deterioration. There was an all-round improvement. I think, therefore, that if we accept this, there can be no doubt about the result if an investigation is undertaken. I think it is in the interests of family life. To-day we have more and more married women who are working.. The number of women who go to work will increase further because we have such a labour shortage and such great industrial development. I say that it will provide a greater opportunity to married women to give attention to their families and to do their shopping on Saturdays so that they will not have to ask for time off from their work to do it. Since we are talking about white collar workers to-day, I wish to suggest in this connection that a thorough investigation be undertaken and I want to ask whether it is not in the interests of this country, where we should like to increase the productivity of our workers, to introduce such a system.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Notwithstanding the criticism that has been levelled by both the mover and the seconder of the amendment to the motion before the House, I believe that the House is indebted to both the mover and the seconder of the motion for a very precise delineation of the need that we face in South Africa for a better approach and a more practical approach to the question of social security. Whereas this is in fact a wide and comprehensive motion that I cannot possibly deal with in the short time at my disposal, I propose to devote the time available to me entirely or largely to the examination of that part of the motion which deals with the introduction of a national contributory pension scheme.</p>

<p>I think no one will deny that it is the duty of the State to assure every citizen of the opportunity to live a useful, happy life and to enable him or her, as the case may be, to <span class="col_897-898" refersTo="page_465"/>enjoy the fruits of his or her labours. This becomes of paramount importance when circumstances diminish the earning capacity of the individual, and what is even more important, that at the end of the working life of an individual, he should be assured of a reasonable subsistence in his declining years, when he is no longer able to work. The responsibility of the State in all developed countries is naturally and constantly increasing because, as has already been pointed out, it is a phenomenon in South Africa that people live longer than they did, say, 50 years ago. In fact, this is a world phenomenon and hence we have the science of Geriatrics, conferences on Gerontology&#x2014;things that when I went to school, were not even known by name. To-day they are matters that concern every civilized country in the world. In the case of South Africa&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) cited the example of Britain&#x2014;our own Bureau of Census and Statistics has given us facts and figures which show the increase in the life expectancy of both sexes. For example, whereas some 50 or 60 years ago, at the turn of the century, the life expectancy of a woman was 48 and that of a man approximately the same, to-day the average life expectancy is 70. I know some people argue that women live longer than men because they do not work quite as hard, and then they proceed to enjoy the fruits of the man&#x2019;s labour. That is something about which one could say a great deal, but I do not propose to deal with the matter at all. As has been pointed out, this trend towards longevity increases the degree of responsibility on the part of the State towards the citizen. Another factor that increases that responsibility and which is of special interest in South Africa, is that in a developing country which South Africa still is, and which we hope it will continue to be for many years to come, we are constantly moving out of an agricultural into an industrial economy. The well-known drift to the towns, Sir, does not require any elaboration by me. This fact is again amply borne out by our own Bureau of Census and Statistics in their latest bulletin, that of last month. There they show that there has been a tremendous increase in the ratio of the urban population to the total population of South Africa. For example, in 1936, out of a total population of 9,587,863 the urban population was 3.214,049. In 1960, less than a generation later, out of a total population of 15,841,128, the urban population was 6,970,285. In other words it grew from 33 per cent, that is, the ratio between the urban population and the total population in 1936, to 44 per cent in 1960 and factually during the 25 years that I have referred to, there was an increase of 33&#x2153; per cent in the urban population itself.</p>

<p>It is very simple to point to these facts and figures and I dare say equally simple to find another set of facts and figures to controvert whatever I am going to say in relation to the figures I have produced. But I want to say, Sir, that whether or not I agree with what has been said by the mover and the seconder of the amendment, I do agree that a positive attempt has been made in South Africa to protect a part of the population&#x2014; and I emphasize &#x201C;part of the population&#x201D;&#x2014; from the evils that arise from unemployment and to provide them with that degree of security which we all, I think, have common cause about and which should be enjoyed by every person at the end of his working life. Much has been achieved, for example, by the Unemployment Insurance Fund but this fund is clearly not the complete answer however well-meaning the intention of the Government may be with regard to the continuation of the policy at present under review in this House. I believe that the Unemployment Insurance Fund cannot be held up to be the complete answer. For example, in the report of the Controller and Auditor-General in respect of the financial year 1960-1, there is reference to the deficit which has arisen in this fund over four successive years. In 1957 the deficit was Rl,445,457.92; in 1958 the deficit was R4,165,738.58; in 1959 the deficit was R7,219,093.39 and in 1960 the deficit was R7,419,493.75. And the Secretary for Labour in his report goes on to say that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was no fall in the incidence of unemployment and therefore no reduction in the amount paid in benefits in terms of Section 27 of the Act.</block>

<p>As an aside, Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to note that whereas in the report which I have just quoted, the Secretary for Labour says that there has been no fall in the incidence of unemployment, we have heard a statement here this afternoon from the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) that there is so much opportunity for work in South Africa that there is in fact a shortage of trained people. Now, of course, we know that is only true in certain sectors or employment. To generalize in the face of the facts contained in this document, simply asks for the rebuttal which I think it is necessary for me to give.</p>

<p>Another positive contribution towards the problem of providing social security in South Africa has been made, I think, again for part of the population, by the existing pension funds to which reference has already been made. I have here the First Annual Report&#x2014; to which one of the hon. members opposite has referred&#x2014;of the Registrar of Pension Funds dated 31 December 1959. This is in some ways a revealing document, because in the first place the Registrar defines a pension fund under the Act and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A pension fund is after all a private arrangement between the members of the association or between the participating employers and employees in which it may be considered that the State has no right to intervene.</block>

<p><span class="col_899-900" refersTo="page_466"/>&#x201C;The State has no right to intervene.&#x201D; So that when some of us are to-day advocating, or at least trying to get the House to discuss, a national pension scheme, it is no answer to say that there are certain pension funds, because it is perfectly clear that those pension funds, save and except to the extent that they may be regulated by the State in legislation, have nothing to do with the case whatsoever. They have nothing to do with the question of a State or National contributory pension fund. The Registrar then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is consequently in the interests of the Government to encourage the establishment of private pension funds.</block>

<p>This is, of course, where I must disagree with the Registrar, because I think the inference that can be drawn and which I draw from what he said earlier on, is that it is in the interests of the Government not merely to encourage the establishment of more private pension funds, but once and for all to establish a State or National contributory pension scheme. What demonstrates beyond any question the fact that such a scheme is needed, I think, again appears from the very same document in regard to the increase in the number of members of these private pension funds. In 1958 the total number of members of the private pension funds was 675,404; in 1959 the number was 803,293. That is an increase of 128,000, almost 20 per cent in one year. Surely this points, apart from any question of the popularity of pension funds as such, to an underlying desire on the part of the people in this country to take part in some of a scheme that will give them the kind of social security that they are entitled to. I for one&#x2014;and I say this in common with my two colleagues who have spoken before me&#x2014;believe that there is ample evidence that the time has in fact come for South Africa to adopt a suitable system of social security as has been done in other countries.</p>

<p>I want to say that social security, unlike the curious approach adopted by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, is in no way related to either Socialism or Communism. I was startled by one of the objections the hon. member had to the establishment of a national contributory pension scheme in South Africa. He said that the Government would never establish or introduce such a scheme; it had always been its policy to refrain from establishing such a scheme and he said that &#x201C;We do not want our people to turn to Socialism&#x201D;. He said in effect, &#x201C;you cannot fight Communism with Socialism &#x201D;. &#x201C; The in stitution of a national pension scheme&#x201D; he said &#x201C;means Socialism&#x201D;. And he said that the motion of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) was &#x201C;a socialist scheme. We are opposed to the destruction of the individuality of the South African citizen by a socialist method&#x201D;. It is not for me to read the member for Vanderbijlpark a lesson on the differences between Socialism, Communism and Capitalism.</p>

<p>In America. Now, Sir, this is an interesting thing. According to the Press the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark recently visited the United States. I have done that in the past, too, but I do not know what he looked at, frankly, because apart from a reference to the fact that he was lonely, he did not indicate that he had studied anything at all in the U.S.A. Now that is his business, but for him to come along and ask me &#x201C;where&#x201D;, and when I say, &#x201C;in the United States&#x201D;, for him to express surprise at that answer means in effect that he has been walking, driving or flying around the U.S.A. blindly, without observing anything. In the U.S.A. I think he will find&#x2014;eventually&#x2014;in any sort of study of the subject, the best example, but before I give the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet), the information I have at my disposal, to which he is welcome, I want to deal with another country about which he may not have the same doubts that he has about the U.S.A.</p>

I toured the country and took advantage of the opportunity thus given to me to listen, to look and to inquire and to find out something that I did not know about that country. There we have an example in Europe, before we proceed further into the Western Hemisphere, of a country which has very successfully operated a system of social security, because Germany was one of the pioneers in Europe of a system of social security and social security legislation. In fact, they introduced a comprehensive old-age insurance scheme, as far back as&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t think the hon. member will even guess the date&#x2014;1889. Similar systems were subsequently developed in other European countries and Government officials, as a rule, in those countries had learned that chronic want and necessity among their people was not only an economic liability but a political danger, a political danger, obviously, to the State&#x2014;and perhaps there is a certain moral that we may draw from it here to-day. In this way it was quite natural for political parties <span class="col_901-902" refersTo="page_467"/>to become involved in such important and popular issues at elections, because of the great poverty that existed there, and in some parts of the world still exist, side by side with great wealth. It is an odd circumstance that Bismarck himself, the so-called &#x201C;Iron Chancellor&#x201D;, the man with a heart of steel (which may or may not be stronger than granite&#x2014;I am no expert on materials) himself was responsible for passing the social security laws at that time and partly because, according to history, he hoped that would increase the economic stability of his country and reduce the Government&#x2019;s and the State&#x2019;s vulnerability to attacks from the Left. So much, to begin with, then, for this contention that a comprehensive national pension scheme is something from the Left, is Socialism, because if anyone calls Bismarck a socialist, then I am prepared to sit down now and give the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark the balance of my time.</p>

<p>One of the significant things about the German system of social security is the fact that it survived two disastrous world wars and a series of disastrous monetary inflations, and it is still in full operation to-day. I can only say that looking at Germany as I did a few months ago it seemed to me &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am indeed, because perhaps unlike some other hon. members of this House, I am prepared to give credit where it is due. I am imbued with admiration for the spirit of the people of that country, from my own observations, because I have seen what they have done since 1945 to rehabilitate and reconstruct a country which had virtually been reduced to rubble. That has nothing to do with the one point of view or the other about the war. It is simply a question of a super-human approach by an entire nation to its own problems. I would recommend that when next the hon. member goes overseas he should go to Germany and see what they have done under this system of social security which is so leftist as to be completely beyond his acceptance.</p>

<p>Will the hon. member kindly give us details of the German scheme?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I intend to give the details of a social security system or scheme. That is what I said in the beginning, but by way of introduction to the question which has been raised by the hon. member there in regard to the objection to the scheme, that it does not suit our way of life, that it is socialist and communist, I perhaps digressed in order to give some information about the general position in Germany. The scheme about which I intend giving as many facts as I have is the scheme in America which the hon. member visited so recently. But I just want to round the first point off by saying that there, in Germany, you have the example of a country which under a comprehensive national pension scheme has been able to get a dynamic effort from its people to the point where it is a model for the whole world of the kind of reconstruction that is possible after a tremendous disaster. Sir, you only have to go to a city like Cologne where at the end of the war there was a population of 40,000, because there was no habitation for more and hardly enough for the 40,000, but to-day there is a population of 800,000 and it is still growing; and that city is not merely a place where there happens to be a certain cathedral. It is a very important commercial centre and an important Rhine River port, and the efforts of the people in making that city of 40,000 in 1945 a growing city of more than 800,000 people now is, with all due respect to the hon. member there, something which points a certain moral in regard to the value of a social security system which is comprehensive.</p>

<p>Now I want to carry on with the question of the social security system in America. I believe fundamentally that once the citizen knows that, other things being equal, he can look to the State for his basic needs and even for certain comforts in his declining years, he then becomes imbued with the idea that he is under an obligation to the State during his working life to give the best kind of performance, to create and to produce and to contribute something towards the society in which he lives. If that is not the case, then all the evidence which anybody can adduce in South Africa to the argument that a partial social scheme is desirable will still point to the contention I am trying to make.</p>

<p>I prefer to use the analogy of the U.S.A., if only because there are certain alleged similarities between the two countries. It is for the individual to decide whether that is so or not. Perhaps it is because both are vast countries and young countries, endowed with great natural resources, and both are multiracial, not in the sense that there are more Blacks than Whites in the U.S.A., but that their population derives from many European races. Of course, there is something to be said in regard to the multi-racial aspect of the U.S.A. when you consider that one in every ten of their population is a Coloured person, but that is not the basis of my contention at all. The American system of social security simply applies the principle&#x2014;and I would like the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark to listen to this carefully and to controvert it if he can &#x2014;of private insurance, or a private insurance scheme to old age and disability pensions, to unemployment insurance and to every other kind of benefit. I have not over-simplified it: that is factual. Any insurance company in the United States, if given the opportunity, will be able to provide, subject to its financial resources, a complete social insurance scheme for the entire United States, because that is the way that a private scheme operates there <span class="col_903-904" refersTo="page_468"/>It amounts to this, that through payments over a period of years the individual and his family establish a right to those benefits and they are eligible for those benefits regardless of need, whether they have or have not any income from any other sources. In fact, in the U.S.A., as may be well known to some hon. members here, a Ford or a Rockefeller or a Carnegie or a Vanderbilt is as eligible for the benefits of the social security scheme as any pauper. In other words, the security system is there for all, and not just for the sick or the needy or the old.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, you must remember that America is in fact the prototype of the capitalist society, and not of the Communist or the Socialist society. Surely that must have been observed by the hon. member over there. Yet in that capitalist economy, the prototype of free enterprise in the modern world, you find the most convincing evidence to controvert this belief that only a Marxist doctrine can guarantee social security or social justice; because I say that America has proved beyond any doubt that social security laws can and do operate efficiently in a capitalist society. This system has been in operation now since 1936 and it came about apparently under exactly the same pressures that we are now experiencing and have been for some years, because urbanization and the mobility of labour tended to isolate the family, as it has done here, and to weaken communal ties. In America, as in South Africa, the individual was more and more compelled to rely primarily on his own efforts in order to earn a livelihood. In actual fact, for the great majority everywhere in the world to-day, constant employment has become a necessity and the unproductivity of old age has become a very grim prospect. Under the administration of a special agency &#x2014;and this is something we should bear in mind when there is so much talk about the State&#x2019;s inability to administer it because you would need so many more people&#x2014;under the system of administration of social security in the U.S.A, over 90 per cent of workers gainfully employed are covered by social security. The main exceptions, oddly enough, are self-employed doctors of medicine and Federal Government employees, who are really protected personnel having their own retirement pension plans. But despite the fact that it does operate and has operated now for 25 years, and operated successfully to the extent where it covers 90 per cent of all those gainfully employed, Congress in this &#x201C;socialist&#x201D; country of the United States at this moment is considering further legislation in order to improve that system of social security&#x2014;not to scrap it, and not to revert to the private pension funds, the unemployment insurance funds and the old age pension funds and all the patchwork funds such as we have in this country, but to improve this comprehensive social security scheme.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I see, it is now getting socialist. I notice that in the last 30 seconds America has turned socialist, according to that hon. member. I think I should tell President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Now for a few details of this system. The old age, surviving dependants and disability insurance are all financed from contributions by employers and employees, at the rate of 3 per cent of a worker&#x2019;s taxable income up to a maximum of $4,800 a year, or R3,500, which is about R300 a month. (I think it will be convenient to convert the dollars to rands, with the permission of the Minister of Finance). On this income of R3,500 a year, the employer and the employee would each contribute R105, or a total of R210, and it would then cost the employer and the employee each under R9 a month. This rate of 3 per cent will increase, according to the present plan of the American Government, gradually until 1969, when employers and employees will contribute on both sides 4.1/3 per cent, while the self-employed man will pay 6 &#x00BE; per cent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one should examine the benefits. In America a man is eligible for retirement at the age of 65, and a woman at the age of 62, but pensions are payable only after the individual has substantially retired from gainful employment. In actual practice most Americans, and I think most people in this country, prefer to work beyond the age of 65, so that they now have, according to their records, a retirement age, on the average, of 68 years. The formula used for computing the benefits&#x2014;and all formulae are related to past earnings&#x2014;has frequently been increased, even the monthly payments for people drawing pensions under a set scheme, as the cost of living has increased. This is very important, because the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) made the point that because of the constant increase in the cost of living, which is not purely a South African phenamenon, one must in the interest of the community as a whole have regard to that increase in considering any benefits or pensions to be given to any section of the population Now the maximum is $127, or R91, a month for a single person. Here, Sir, I would ask you to make a mental comparison between the R91 a month, which is the old age pension in the U.S.A., and the R23 per month in South Africa. And the old age pensioners that I have met in America are very much the same as our own aged here. They are not millionaires but people who live as best they can on a restricted income, and yet we have the position there that they draw four times the amount that they do in South Africa, and the <span class="col_905-906" refersTo="page_469"/>cost of living, as the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark will know, in the U.S.A. for the average person is not four times greater than it is here. Now this payment of R91 a month is increased by 50 per cent to R136 a month for a married couple when both have reached the age of 65, and they pay special attention to the needs of the widow, so that a widow, child or aged dependant parent surviving the insured person receives a maximum of R69, and a widow with one child receives R137, and a widow with three or more children, R812. I cite these figures to show the benefits from a comprehensive social security scheme which, if one is to believe the mover and seconder of the amendment, should have beggared the U.S.A. by now, because it is ruinous; the cost is impossible. Yet I am giving you the facts, Sir, about a country which by common consent and to this day is the richest in the world.</p>

<p>But what I want to emphasize is that one of the major differences between our attitude here and the attitude of people in countries where a social system of security has worked for many years is that they regard it as a right and not as a privilege. I think the hon. member for Yeoville, as well as the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) made that point. That is how we should approach it here. But in addition to a social security system, there are in these countries also other schemes similar to the ones we have which augment the income of the person who is already receiving these benefits. In other words, it is not left entirely to the social security system to take care of the individual. There are thousands of profit-sharing plans in industry, a thing which is very slowly being examined in this country. In fact, nearly 4,000 new schemes of that nature were established in 1960 in America, profit-sharing schemes between the owner and the worker in industry. Apart from that, there are 23,000 business organizations which have retirement plans covering 19.000,000 workers. That is in addition, I must emphasize, to the social security benefits. How can one call this a bad thing in any sense of the word? Why is it wrong for an American labour union like the Coalworkers&#x2019; Union to bargain with the owners of the coal-mines (and they will have to foot the entire bill) and as the result of their own negotiations, to obtain for the coal-miner on his retirement a payment of R72 a month over and above whatever he may get from the social security scheme? What would our workers say to that? The facts are there for anyone who wishes to examine them, that in any country which has adopted, not the British system, which has been set up here as the &#x201C;Aunt Sally&#x201D;, but which has in fact adopted and operated a comprehensive social security scheme where the contributors are the employer and the employee, that in every case it has been successful and still is to this day. Therefore one is surprised that only the British example was cited by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt). He says in effect that he has looked at the British system and it does not work, and then he proceeds to give chapter and verse about the British system, well knowing that if you were to consider adopting it, he would be the first to advise against it. Could his time not have been better spent in examining a system that does work, and works well?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have here some of the statements the hon. member made. He said he quoted the British system because everything British was admired by this side of the House. Therefore by inference the converse is true, and everything British is not admired on that side of the House. But then he goes out of his way to take the British system in order to set that up as the clay pigeon and to shoot it down, when all the time, had I known that he was coming into this debate, I would have said to him: Here are the facts and the figures on the American system; now take up the time of the House by telling us about a good system, not a bad one.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark has said in effect that he has every sympathy, and so has his party and the Government, with the worker. In fact, if I am not mistaken, he referred to sympathy no fewer than eight times in about two sentences. But it is more important to do something for the people of this country than to keep on shouting about your sympathy for them. Only in a system of social security will you ever be able to do those things for the individual that you claim you would like to do. We were also told by the hon. member about the increase in the salaries of State employees. Now, I took down some of those figures. They are very impressive, but although everything in the State garden is lovely, everybody cannot dwell in that garden. What about all the other people for whom there is no room in that lovely garden? What is the use of telling us that a colonel in the police now gets R2,400 a year? How many colonels in the Police Force are there, compared with the people in the country as a whole, not to talk about the old-age pensioners?</p>

<p>Then one of the objections in relation to the expense to the State which has been emphasized by both members was that it would cost R278,000,000, according to certain actuarial figures to start one here. Sir, that kind of thinking, with respect, is completely obsolete. You do not set up a fund to-day in order to take care of everybody who may live during the next 2,000 years, on an actuarial or any other basis. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof, but also the blessing thereof. If we in South Africa could do something to take care of the present generation, we will do far better than by arguing about the fact that by setting up a scheme we may not be serving the people 100 or 200 or 2,000 years <span class="col_907-908" refersTo="page_470"/>from now.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) was at great pains to tell us what a good system they have in the U.S.A., and particularly in Germany, and we listened with interest because any scheme like this has definite advantages in so far as the recipient of the benefits is concerned, and such a person will definitely support it, but I have been listening attentively and waiting for the hon. member, who made such a thorough study of the scheme in Germany, to tell us what the cost of it is. But he kept quite silent about that, and the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) also remained quiet about the cost of such a scheme.</p>

<p>But he did not give us the globular amount. The hon. member for Yeoville tried for 25 minutes to say something about his motion. He spoke about the advantages of it, but kept quiet about the cost. I can understand why he did so. He does not want to divulge that fact. He wants to depict the bright side of the motion, the advantages, but not its cost. The hon. member might have said how it would affect taxation, but he remained quiet about that. After having listened to the motion, it reminds one of the typical things we had during the election. They make all the beautiful promises possible&#x2014;the Minister of Transport estimated that they had made more than 300 promises&#x2014;but we hear nothing about the cost or where they would find the money for it. Here we have precisely the same thing again. Promises are being made to the workers. A compulsory, contributory pension scheme is being held out to the workers, from which they can derive benefits. There is even another part of the motion which says that annual leave must be a right and not a privilege. It stands here in black and white, but none of the speakers said a single word about that. It is quite clear to us that the whole of this motion is simply intended as propaganda so that they can say that they moved it in this House, but they never realized the consequences, nor will they submit that to the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital referred to Germany, but I cand tell him that in 1958 the Department sent an official overseas to investigate the system in Germany, Belgium, Britain and Holland, and after thorough investigation it appeared that not only would the cost of it be too high, but its administration would make too heavy demands on us and would in our circumstances be practically impossible. It was not only this Government which came to that conclusion. The Government of those hon. members also instituted investigation before they lost power, and they also found that it could not be applied here.</p>

<p>Now they say &#x201C;at that stage&#x201D;, but the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) stated this morning that in 1944 already there were these social security reports. That Government was in power for four years after receiving those reports, but did they do anything in that regard? They cannot even say that it was war-time. They could not even say that they had to spend so many millions on the war, or that they could not devote attention to it. The war stopped in 1945 and they were in power for another four years during which they could do something practical for the worker, but even with all those reports they had they could not retain the support of the worker and that is why they lost the election in 1948, just because they did not care about the worker. Thereafter the picture changed.</p>

<p>I want to go further. To-day we have in this country quite a number of private schemes which are encouraged by the State. Therefore contributions towards these private schemes are taken into consideration for taxation rebates, and for that reason also a few years ago we went even further and control was instituted over them. It was even made possible for the more prosperous man to deduct his contributions to annuity funds from his income to an amount of R800 if he belonged to such a scheme. Those schemes work particularly well in South Africa. It is interesting to note to what extent use is being made of these schemes ever since control and order were instituted. The latest data show that these voluntary pension funds have increased tremendously. I want to give the House the figures, just approximately, since 1958 to 1960. The number of private schemes increased from 599 to 674; the subscription ones increased from 2,140 to 2,770; private funds increased and even municipal funds increased. There was therefore a great increase in these funds. But apart from that, the members, the people who derive the actual benefits, increased in number. In regard to the private funds, a change came about because the Mutual Aid Societies Act withdrew a large part of it, and therefore this figure shows a decrease, but in 1959 there were already 450,000 people concerned in these private schemes. More than 200,000 people were concerned in the mutual schemes. They increased to 224,000. We find the same tendency throughout, even in the municipal schemes.</p>

<p>The assets of these private undertakings increased from 1958 to 1959 from R355,000,000 to R412,000,000 and the assets of the municipal schemes also increased. They are not even included in this figure. Right throughout there was a tremendous increase in the number of these schemes, and these schemes afford every worker the opportunity to choose. He chooses the scheme which best suits his particular circumstances and his requirements. But apart from that, there are certain industrial agreements <span class="col_909-910" refersTo="page_471"/>entered into since 1958. The number of workers covered by that increased from 110,000 to 119,000. The annual contributions also show us to what extent these schemes are supported, because from 1958 they increased from R37,000,000 to R44,000,000. That just shows what support they enjoy.</p>

<p>The same tendency applies to the payments, lump sum payments and others. But I want to point out that these schemes, which are encouraged by the State, are to some extent also compulsory pension schemes in the sense that the people who will draw the benefits contribute themselves, together with their employers, but the State also makes its contribution in so far as these contributions are not taxable. The State therefore assists those schemes in this way. The establishment of this other scheme which is advocated here will mean that everybody will have to contribute this tax and thereafter there will be a division of assets. But the big difference is this. Because hon. members opposite realize the high cost connected with such a scheme, they proposed that these benefits should apply only from the age of 70 or 75 years. But the actual need of every worker does not arise only from his 70th or 75th year; his need arises the day he stops working, and it is there that these pension funds start making provision for him. Reference was made here to schemes in other countries. What do they cost? Let us look at the taxation being paid in other countries. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) referred to the United States, where he says they have such an excellent scheme, but I would much prefer paying taxation in South Africa than in the United States. Let us look at this middle group, the white-collar group. If one earns R2,000 in the United States, one has to pay R56 in taxation, as compared with R13 in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member is the biggest one. A man having an income of R4,000 in the United States has to pay R474 in taxation on it, whereas here he will pay only R166. We can compare our position here also with that in the United Kingdom. There we find the same position. A person with an income of R4,000 there pays R764 in taxation, whereas in South Africa he pays only R166. These figures show that this group of people to whom hon. members refer are much better off in South Africa, and that they can spend a much larger proportion of their income to satisfy their requirements themselves than in any of those other countries mentioned here by hon. members.</p>

<p>Reference was also made here to old age pensions, and the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) went into it very thoroughly to show to what extent there have been improvements in regard to this privilege. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) referred to the Socio-Economic Report of 1944, which said that the basis of the means test should be increased. The hon. member for Vanderbijl Park thereupon pointed out that this basis has already been raised, and that the increase was more than the corresponding increase in the cost of living. Also in regard to our pensions there was in general a very great increase. Our old age pensions have since 1948 increased by 130 per cent, whilst cost of living increased by 64 per cent. In 1947 the State spent just over R6,000,000 on old age pensions; for the past year the figure was 23,000,000. There was also a similar increase in regard to veterans&#x2019; pensions. The same tendency can be seen in regard to disability pensions for Whites. The rise in the cost of living was kept in mind, and the increase in the benefits was much higher than the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>Mention was also made here of housing, just to mention one of the facilities provided. In 1949 there was a total of only 25 homes for the aged of all races in the country; in 1961 there were 83 only for Whites. Reference was made to the aged and it was said that more could be done for them. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark referred to the loneliness of our old people, and in this respect there is perhaps a great opportunity for welfare organizations to make more use of these facilities than is the case at present.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the question of leave, which is also mentioned in the motion. It is significant, however, that not one of those hon. members opposite referred to it in their speeches, and I take it that the reason why the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), as well as the other speakers opposite, did not refer to this matter was that they discovered, after having placed the motion on the Order Paper, that provision had already been made for those people. The hon. member for Yeoville then realized that they could do no good by arguing this matter further.</p>

<p>Let us just see for a moment what the position is. The fact is that our industrial legislation provides for leave as an annual right for most workers, whether they are manual workers or not. There is no differentiation on the ground of race, colour or religion. It makes no difference whether a person wears an open-necked shirt or a white collar, nor does it matter whether he draws his wages by the week or by the month. Everybody affected by this legislation is entitled to paid annual leave. The Factories Act of 1941 applies to all factories in our country, and as hon. members know, there are thousands of people employed in the factories wearing white collars and drawing salaries. There are the clerks, the typists, the accountants, the managers and foremen, and Section 21 of the Factories Act provides that all these people must get a fortnight&#x2019;s annual paid leave.</p>

<p>But apart from the Factories Act there is also the Wage Act and the wage determinations <span class="col_911-912" refersTo="page_472"/>which are made to control the conditions of service of the employees, and practically without exception these wage determinations make provision for clerical workers, i.e. those people who are salaried workers, as well as for manual workers. They all share in this annual leave, as well as in sick leave privileges. One of the latest determinations made under the Wage Act is that for the commercial distributive trade which came into operation on 1 October last year, and it applies to all the cities as well as to the larger towns in the Republic. Over 100,000 salaried workers are benefited by it, and they are entitled to three weeks&#x2019; ordinary annual leave, as well as to three weeks&#x2019; sick leave. But apart from these wage determinations under the Wage Act, there are also of course the industrial agreements under the Industrial Conciliation Act, which also make provision for leave. The great majority of these agreements also apply to clerks and other employees who are not regarded as ordinary factory workers. There is practically not a single industry in this country which is not subject to some or other wage determining measure. No such measure is published unless it provides for annual leave.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>This is not Mr. Trollip&#x2019;s speech. Why could the hon. member not refer to it? Nobody could write a speech for him on this subject. This annual leave is not only a privilege; it is a right. It is a right which the worker can demand, and if that right is not granted to him he can go to court without incurring any legal costs. But there is of course also the other group employed by the building societies, the banks and the municipalities, and on the whole they are well organized. It is the attractions of this employment which results in their drawing many workers to them. All their conditions of service provide for this leave referred to by the hon. member in his motion. I concede that in some of our smaller towns some of these agreements in regard to wages are not applicable, but there the Shops and Offices Act of 1941 applies, and it is applicable to shops, caf&#x00E9;s, butcheries and hairdressing saloons, etc. It also provides for leave as a matter of right and not as a privilege. You therefore see, Mr. Speaker, that these white-collar workers, the salaried people, are not as badly off as this motion wants us to think. It is clear that the Government is not asleep and that it is continually trying to improve the position of the worker.</p>

<p>The Government has now decided&#x2014;and I have authority to make this public&#x2014;that during this Session still legislation will be introduced to amend the Shops and Offices Act of 1941. This Bill will provide for ordinary annual leave as well as sick leave. Its scope is very wide, and when it becomes law it will apply to any office where book-keeping, typing, writing or any form of clerical work is done, including the work of a cashier or telephonist. In other words, it will be binding on the offices of attorneys, accountants, brokers, estate agents, advertising firms, auctioneers, etc., to mention just a few. I trust that this explanation will satisfy the hon. member for Yeoville that in this broad field I have mentioned leave is not only a privilege but a right of which the workers can make use. But I must point out that this question of leave still remains a matter of the relations between the employer and the employee, and any sound business man who wants to treat his employees fairly will see to it that this aspect of his human relations will always remain sound. The fact that the hon. member for Yeoville did not mention a word about this matter in his speech is probably due to the fact that he, after having adopted his motion, discovered to what an extent provision is being made for the worker in this regard.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of attention is devoted to the question of the increase in the cost of living. The hon. member for Yeoville did his best to show that economically things are not going well for South Africa and that the worker is badly off. We know that type of propaganda. They did their best, even during the last election, to convince the voters of that, but did not succeed in doing so. We admit that in South Africa, as in any other country in the world, there has been an increase in the cost of living, but we also know that since the Nationalist Government came into power, it systematically tried to keep the cost of living as low as possible. Not only were strong economic considerations at stake in so far as inflation and a decrease in the value of money are concerned, but here in South Africa we have a particular reason, namely that we have the gold mines here, and the fact that the price of gold has never risen in relation to the dollar since 1934; and in regard to sterling, since 1949 when we devalued our currency.</p>

<p>But the interesting thing is that when we compare the cost of living in South Africa with that in other countries we find that South Africa compares very favourably with those countries. We can compare South Africa&#x2019;s position with that of other Commonwealth countries. We find that in South Africa since 1953 there was an increase of only 20 points to 120, whereas the cost of living in Australia rose by 123, in the United Kingdom by 127, in Sweden, 128, Japan, 122, and in France, 137. In all these countries I have mentioned the cost of living increased more than it did in South Africa. It is true that there was not the same increase in countries like Canada and the United States, but we know that this tendency to increase is not found in countries which did not devaluate in 1949.</p>

<p>But we can go still further. The fact is that just recently, particularly during the last three years, we have succeeded in keeping the rise in the cost of living fairly constant and <span class="col_913-914" refersTo="page_473"/>in limiting it to a minimum. Since 1958 our cost of living rose by only 1.8 per cent, whilst in Australia the cost of living increased by 3 per cent, in Canada by 1.2, in France by 4.4, in Japan by 4.3, in Western Germany by 1.5, and in the United Kingdom by 2.2. That proves that we succeeded in limiting the rise in the cost of living in South Africa to a minimum, and that is particularly to the benefit of the worker. We still have price control on essential things like bread, milk, petrol, coal, etc. Price control has been abolished as far as possible, but it has been retained in regard to these essential things. Action is taken when there is a monopolistic tendency to increase prices, which is not in the interest of the public. There is still a subsidy on maize and even on bread. In South Africa we have succeeded in keeping these costs particularly low in comparison with other countries. But apart from that our national income has increased, and the increase in our national income compares very favourably with the increase in the national income of other comparable countries. Our cost of living did in fact rise, but it is also clear that wages rose to the same extent.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville referred here to post office workers. I notice in the latest report of the Board of Trade and Industries that from August to September last year there was a decrease of 7,000 in the number of workers, of which 4,000 were Bantu, in mining, in the factories, in construction and in transport, but in spite of that decrease of 7,000, we note that the total salaries and wages increased by R1,600,000 in September. We also read here about the increase in wages of which the post office contributed R1,200,000. There was therefore a large increase there. Also in regard to local authorities it appears that there was a reduction in the number of employees, but there was an increase in wages. It is a generally acknowledged fact to-day that during recent years there has been a considerable increase in wages. Quite recently the hon. the Minister of Labour stated that since 1959 and including the first months of 1960 the wages fixed in terms of the Wage Act were R13,000,000 higher than in the previous year. The wages of more than 500,000 persons were affected by it. Even recently Mr. Silberbauer, Director of the Bantu Wage and Productivity Association, stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is estimated that during the past 12 months wages earned by African workers throughout South Africa have increased by R40,000,000.</block>

<p>I can also refer the House to the latest Bulletin of Statistics, which indicates that in mining and in manufacturing industry, in so far as White workers are concerned&#x2014;and the same applies to the non-Whites&#x2014;where there was an increase in numbers, there was a much greater increase in the wages paid to the workers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital referred to the question of costs. He compared the costs in the United States and in South Africa. I have here an interesting comparison made by the <i>Financial Times,</i> from which it appears that whereas for dinner and bed one has to pay &#x00A3;7 in New York, the average price in Cape Town is &#x00A3;1 10s. In regard to petrol, we are much better off than most other countries, including the whole of Europe. A comparison was made between the price of a food hamper containing 1 lb. of steak, 1 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of potatoes, a loaf of bread and &#x00BD; liter of wine in Cape Town and America, Canada and London, and we see that whereas the cost of such a hamper in Cape Town is 11s., one has to pay 25s. for it in America, 20s. in Montreal, and 16s. in London. A comparison was made in regard to clothing and rent between South Africa and other countries, and it appears that of the 25 cities mentioned here, the cost of living in Cape Town is the third lowest, and it is practically a quarter of the cost of living in that city where it is highest. The hon. member spoke about the United States. He himself knows that to have his hair cut he sometimes had to pay $2, and in addition he still had to give a tip of 50c. The hon. member for Yeoville also knows that.</p>

<p>I want to conclude on this note, Mr. Speaker. The position of the worker in South Africa is much better than it is in many other countries which are in any way comparable with us. Our unemployment is at a minimum. Our prospects are better than in many other countries. Reference has been made here to Canada. I just want to point out that there is 12 per cent unemployment there. Reference was also made to Australia, that other country which is so prosperous, but at the end of 1961 the unemployment figure stood at 109,000, three times more than the number of registered unemployed in South Africa, which includes not only Whites but also non-Whites. If we look at other countries we see that wages in the United Kingdom have already been frozen since the middle of last year; there is the so-called &#x201C;pause&#x201D;. The position of the workers there is not by any means as good as that of the workers here. If we look at the prospects, there is no reason for being pessimistic. Our exports prove it. The latest report of the Bureau at Stellenbosch proves it, and the mere fact that the Opposition at the beginning of this week, when the Part Appropriation Bill was introduced, did not even see an opportunity to attack the Government&#x2019;s economic prospects and economic policy on a single point is the clearest proof of the confidence in this country, and the worker will get his share of it.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill, as stated in its long title, is being introduced to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals, and provides for the control of experiments on animals and to amend the Entertainment Censorship Act of 1931 and the Slaughter of Animals Act of 1934, with a number of amending Acts relating to measures which have been adopted since. The existing laws of our land dealing with the protection of animals are basically founded on Act No. 8 of 1914, which was passed almost half a century ago. There is a long series of amending Acts, starting from about 1922 onwards until 1949, plus other measures dealing with such things and the protection of wild birds (Act 22 of 1934), the controlling of the export from our country (Act No. 6 of 1925), the Slaughtering of Animals Act (Act 26 of 1934), and several amendments to that Act, the Protection of Performing Animals (Act 24 of 1935), which again was later amended by Act 62 of 1955. With the tremendous change which has taken place in practically every phase of our national life&#x2014;and this also applies to the world at large&#x2014;it has become imperative that this group of laws be amended to clarify them and, where necessary, to extend them in order to bring them up to date and make them efficient to deal with the conditions as they exist to-day. For instance, there has long been a necessity for the Minister in charge of the administration of the Act to be given much greater and wider powers to make regulations dealing with the protection of animals than he has under the existing legislation. There is also a need for more definite authority to be given to approved officers or officials of the registered animal protection societies in the country which are doing such valuable work, so that they may be allowed to function more freely in connection with the prevention of cruelty to animals and in dealing with cases which come to their notice. This Bill now before the House is an endeavour to meet those needs. It also clarifies the position where there is a certain measure of overlapping an consequent delay as a result of successive measures which have been passed and the amendments thereto, which inevitably result in a certain amount of confusion which has now crept into the general animal welfare structure of the country.</p>

<p>The Bill before the House, I make bold to say, is absolutely and completely outside of the field of politics. I believe that whilst there may be points of difference with regard to particular features dealt with in the Bill&#x2014;the method of carrying them into effect&#x2014;I believe that every member in this House would be prepared to support the principle of the Bill, that is to afford protection to the animal life of this country against cruelty and ill-treatment. I believe that it should be possible to approach the Bill&#x2014;and I believe it will be so approached&#x2014;on the basis of an all-party measure in which we may all share in the satisfaction of facilitating its early appearance on the Statute Book. I think it will be as well to very briefly, remind the House of the previous history, of the attempts to get this type of legislation through, because the Bill before us in slightly varying forms has been now before the House for some six or seven years. It first saw the light of day in the form of a much smaller Bill, at that stage introduced by Dr. Vernon Shearer. The present hon. Minister of Justice is the third Minister occupying that important position to be asked to implement, or to assist in the implementation of such legislation.</p>

<p>The point is that I was not asked before.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister is being asked now. The first Bill introduced by Dr. Vernon Shearer was a much more circumscribed Bill and received the approval of the then hon. Minister of Justice, now our State President, who was instrumental in the setting up of a Select Committee to examine the legislation. The Select Committee itself, then appointed, made a most comprehensive review of this kind of legislation; they took evidence from bodies representative of practically every phase of our national life who are concerned with animal welfare or dealing with animal life in the country, and eventually, as a result of their report, a proposed Bill was presented to this House. That Bill was practically identical with the Bill which is now presented to the House. The Bill the Committee presented was largely a combined consolidating and amending Bill and all its main proposals were practically identical with the Bill now before us. Certain amendments, improvements to that Bill, however, were suggested by the Department of Agriculture and the South African Agricultural Union, and in order to try and reach agreement, the hon. the Minister at that time agreed that a special inter-departmental committee would be set up in order to examine those particular points of difference. About that time, however, the hon. Minister of those days was elevated to the position of Governor-General and consequently had no further opportunity of pursuing the undertaking that he had given. But when he was succeeded by Mr. Erasmus as Minister of Justice, discussions ensued with his successor in regard to the previous history of the Bill and the proposed legislation. <span class="col_917-918" refersTo="page_475"/>After giving the matter due consideration, he gave an undertaking which is set out in Hansard Vol. 103 of 1960, in Col. 670, in which among other things the Minister said in regard to the Bill at that stage presented by Mr. John Cope&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member is quite correct in saying that I agreed to carry out the promise made by my predecessor last year to appoint such an interdepartmental committee consisting of representatives of the Departments of Justice, Agriculture (Technical Services) and the Railways and Harbours Administration to consider this question further. But I want to add to what the hon. member has said that valuable work has been done by members on both sides of the House in the Select Committee and in having discussions in regard to the preparation of this Bill. What I have promised now is that I would carry out the promise made by my predecessor and appoint this committee to go into the question and advise me after consulting different bodies and persons and also hon. members of the House who are interested in this matter as to whether the Government should go on with a measure of this kind which consolidates the animal protection legislation of South Africa, and what department should handle it.</block>

<p>That was the assurance given by the then Minister As we know, shortly after that, we went into recess and before the committee which was appointed, or was to be appointed by the hon. the Minister had had time to bring up its report, the hon. Minister Erasmus was appointed to Italy and the present hon. Minister of Justice succeeded him in that office.</p>

<p>Sir, we all know that during the past number of years the Minister of Justice has probably been one of the busiest Cabinet Ministers. Matters have arisen which, apart from the changes in the occupancy of the office, have made it undoubtedly difficult or impossible for any Minister of Justice, with the other more pressing matters on his table at the time, to tackle a matter of this nature. But I understand that the inter-departmental committee set up by Mr. Erasmus has to some extent&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know whether it has completed its work, but I understand that it has to some extent carried out certain of these investigations, and particularly as far as the agricultural section of the Bill is concerned their report has either been placed before the hon. the Minister or is in the process of being placed before him. That of course is a matter entirely at the Minister&#x2019;s discretion, but I would appreciate very much indeed if the hon. the Minister in due course could advise the House as to what progress has been made with regard to the implementation of the undertaking given by his predecessor and what are the prospects of early legislation of this type? I take it for granted that the principle applies that if anybody succeeds another Minister in office, he automatically inherits the liabilities as well as the assets of his predecessor, and I have no doubt that the present hon. Minister in a matter of this sort would be as willing to assist as his predecessors, Sir, due to circumstances very largely unforeseen and in the main completely uncontrollable at any rate, beyond normal control, substantial delay has had to be incurred in the proposed legislation which has been put before the House, and I would like to express the sincere hope that this third attempt&#x2014;you know the old saying &#x201C;third time lucky&#x201D;&#x2014;with this hon. Minister may be lucky and that this Minister will have the satisfaction of completing the work commenced by his predecessors in regard to the animal protection legislation, a task in which I am certain he will have the support, the fullest possible support of every member of the House, as well as the backing of the vast majority of thinking South Africans.</p>

<p>I think at this stage it will also only be fair to pay a tribute to the tremendous amount of valuable work done by all who have assisted in the previous efforts to have legislation of this kind placed on the Statute Book, not only the members who have brought the matter before this House but by so many people in all walks of life who have assisted both by advice and practical help in the drawing up of the legislation, to have our code for the protection of animal life, including the bird life of South Africa, the wild and domesticated animals, brought up to meet present-day conditions. I want to include in that tribute, sincere appreciation of the great help and sympathy shown by the various Ministers themselves who have been approached in connection with the matter, their staffs and state officials in general, and I want to say that much of the present Bill flowing from the work of the Select Committee is indeed the drafting of Government Departments and of officials who are specialists in the knowledge of their particular type of animal life and who by their experience are well aware of the weaknesses in our existing legislation and the particular points on which it requires to be tightened up or improved. I will go so far as to say that without their valuable assistance, without that very sympathetic manner in which they have approached this legislation, it would have been practically impossible for the Bill to ever have reached its present stage. I want to pay also a special tribute to that band of devoted workers and officials, senior officials and the staffs and those associated with them as members of the various societies, registered and approved societies, who function in our country for the protection of animal life and the prevention of cruelty to animals. They in turn, are men who as a labour of love come into daily contact with the necessities of the legislation we are asking for to-day, men and women who have given valuable advice from the practical point of view and guided by their day by day experience. To all of them, and to many others who have been associated with these attempts, it is only fair that this tribute should <span class="col_919-920" refersTo="page_476"/>be recorded, because the Bill now before us is the product of no one or two individuals&#x2014;it is the combined effort of practically all thinking animal lovers, all people connected with animals, right throughout the country, quite irrespective of any other aspect that they may consider in other matters.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the various features in the Bill itself, I want to say that we, our race, our country, our people, pride ourselves on the standard of civilization we have attained; we often quote ourselves as being of the Western way of life, setting up a certain standard of civilization. But that very standard of civilization that we pride ourselves about, that very civilization of which we are so proud, also imparts upon us very heavy responsibilities. One of the acid tests by which any nation&#x2019;s standard of civilization, its real standard of civilization, can be assessed is its treatment of the dumb wild animal life which forms a part of its national responsibilities. that animal life which Providence has entrusted to our care and which in so many cases has become an essential feature in the daily life of the nation, either from the food supply point of view, from the labour producing point of view, or from the hundred-and-one points of view where animals play a part in our whole set-up. No matter whether they are intended eventually for slaughter or whether they are kept as household pets, or for the other essential domestic uses, or whether they are merely in their wild state, used as national attractions, either in their wild state or in captivity, the very fact that of all the animal kingdom, we the human animals are endowed with the power of thought, the power of reasoning. The power of speech puts on to us that responsibility of caring for the other animals which are not endowed with those same benefits, and who have to rely on man and man alone for their protection and their welfare. One has only to go through a game reserve to come away with that feeling of inferiority when you see the animals in their natural state, the condition they are in compared to their condition in captivity, their domestic condition, to realize how in their wild state they are indeed far better off than many of the animals we have in our care. I think the lesson to be drawn from that is that we have to make the conditions for those animals which it is necessary for us to keep as near as we can to those they enjoy in their natural state, to repeat those conditions as near as we can and to give them the security and the comfort and protection which they experienced in their wild state, where the protection is largely afforded by the strongest taking charge&#x2014;the rule of the mighty; in our case it should be the rule of civilization, the rule of ourselves through legislation such as the Bill before us. I think that I can truly claim that having regard to the wide variation in the standards of our country, the standards of life, standards of civilization, standards of culture between the various sections of our very widespread population, due also to the very multi-racial nature of our country, in which the gap between the lowest and highest standard of culture and civilization is so great, due to the very widespread nature of our country and the very hard natural conditions often experienced, that South Africa can justly take credit, in the general sense, for its good standard of treatment of our animals. I believe we stand very high in relation to the countries of the world in that respect. Both in the towns and in the country, the mass of our people pay full regard to their animals. I think very few can take exception to the manner in which in the main, animals are treated in South Africa. But we have our weak spots, weak spots which have to be eliminated. We have gaps in our legislation, due to the age of our legislation and the necessity to amend it and bring it up to date, due to the very rapid changes which have taken place in the standards of life, in the whole set-up of life in the country and the people. They have caused gaps to develop in our legislation, and the object of the present Bill is to attempt to fill those gaps, an attempt to bring the animal protection legislation up to date, to meet present day requirements, and also an attempt to provide a better opportunity to those responsible for administering the law to act in the cases where they have found flaws and weaknesses which enable the relatively few who desire to break through the law to ill-treat animals or carry out actions in defiance of such law, to be dealt with more expeditiously.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not propose to weary the House by dealing with a number of cases, examples of the treatment meted out to animals, but I want to mention three cases very briefly to show the House the type of thing which does happen and the type of cruelty for which it is necessary to provide legislation such as this. I want to say that in addition to the national legislation, there are provincial ordinances and regulations issued by local bodies dealing with the protection of animal life, the protection of animals against cruelty, which are complementary to the national law and which make the general converage fairly widespread. But even there you find very startling gaps, and I quote one here in my own province, the Cape Province, were two or three years ago in amending its Motor Ordinance regarding the responsibility of a motorist having an accident and injuring an animal, to stop and to render all the possible aid to the injured animal and to report the accident to the nearest police station, two years ago dogs were excluded from the list of animals covered. Now a dog occupies a very particular place in human life and in relation to human life. The dog is, I think, well known as the friend of man; many of them become almost part of your family whilst they grow up with the family; many of them have grown to trust the human being, And yet, Sir, I have seen myself a motorist behaving in a shocking manner&#x2014;I want to say here that without question the vast majority of motorists injuring a dog would stop immediately <span class="col_921-922" refersTo="page_477"/>and do all in their power, although no longer compelled to do so by law, to ease its pain and to deal with it. But you do get the callous individual, and I have seen myself a motorist who had run over a dog and broken its back, leaving the poor animal in the road, screaming in agony, a mass of blood and broken bones, in bitter agony, and the motorist driving on without even attempting to stop and remedy the damage that he has done, may well be by accident. I believe that is wrong, Sir. I believe that is not in accordance with the tenets of civilization and I believe it is one of the greatest mistakes that particular feature was eliminated from the provincial Motor Ordinance. This particular Bill re-instates it, and will make it compulsory, in addition to other animals, for a motorist who has injured a dog, to stop and to attempt to remedy the damage that he has done, to bring relief to the dog and to report the accident to the nearest police station. I believe that every dog-lover and every thinking human being will agree that it is correct that should be so. I want to refer to another case. In our own area, in our part of the country, we have been inflicted with many large fires, mountain and bush fires, in many cases not accidentally started, but started by gross carelessness, or in many cases intentionally, fires which in themselves are a breach of law. In assisting to deal with certain of these bush fires out in the nature reserve, 48 hours after the fire was extinguished, I have personally come across a buck with every hair burnt off its hide, its eyes burnt out, its feet burnt into ragged masses of pulp as a result of the embers over which it tried to escape&#x2014;48 hours afterwards that animal was still lying there whimpering and crying to be put out of its misery. These are things that I think have to be taken congnisance of when on the rare occasions it is possible to apprehend the individuals responsible for causing such fires, not only for the ordinary material damage caused, but for the misery and pain, suffering and agony inflicted on the dumb animals in that particular area. I don&#x2019;t believe we can tolerate that sort of thing any longer, and I believe action has to be taken to give the necessary powers to people who have to deal with this type of thing. I know it is a difficult thing to bring home. Nobody knows that better than I do, having been associated with this type of welfare work for many a long day. But I believe that we should provide the machinery so that when it is possible to apprehend a person for such a crime, he should be punished.</p>

<p>I want to touch on one further example and that is an example which I believe legislation of this nature is designed to deal with. I had occasion as chairman of a special subcommittee of the Meat Control Board to carry out an examination of the abattoir facilities of all the major towns in the Union, the slaughter facilities and various other features including the facilites provided for the accommodation of the animals arriving at the abattoirs and being kept for the necessary wait-over periods, near the abattoirs, before slaughter. I would say that whilst there are very good examples where the cities concerned have done their duty&#x2014;and I would say that very often the inland towns are ahead of the coastal cities in this respect&#x2014;that in certain of our major municipalities the accommodation for animals awaiting slaughter is many years out of date, and as a result of their nature, as a result of the insufficiency of the accommodation, and the antiquated methods adopted, they inflict unnecessary pain and misery and cruelty on the animals being brought from the agricultural centres for the food of the cities and waiting to be slaughtered at the abattoirs. Some of them have been in need of overhaul for many years. Action to overhaul is not being taken quick enough. One continually reads of missions being sent overseas, expensive missions to examine the conditions overseas. Three years later another mission is sent overseas to examine the findings of the first commission. But the animals go on suffering. I think it reflects little credit on some of our major municipalities that they have not long, long ago moved in the direction of cleaning up that particular side of their activities. The Bill now before the House helps to provide the machinery to speed up that type of work. I would say that the conditions which still exist in certain areas reflect little credit either on the authorities concerned, or on us as a nation for permitting those conditions to remain even when they are conditions in a local area and not general over the whole of the nation. The last example is the ravages which are caused amongst our bird life by the noble, not so young sometimes, hunters who have to try out the efficiency of their pellet guns and air guns and .22 rifles and who leave behind them a trail of maimed and injured birds, eyes shot out, wings broken, fluttering around on the ground in misery, while the gallant hunter goes home maybe with a turtle dove in his bag. It is illegal, I know, but it is most difficult at the moment for the authorities to be able to deal with that kind of think, and I think the Bill before the House will give opportunities for easing those difficulties, making it possible for the authorities to act in such cases.</p>

<p>The Bill in itself consists of three main sections: Chapter I, apart from the definitions, defines very extensively in Clause 2 the various types of cruelty which the Bill proposes to prohibit. It provides for the treatment of animals, the loading of animals for transport, their accommodation, including abattoirs, feeding, injuries, training conditions, the trimming or cutting of certain animals for certain purposes, the cutting away of parts of an animal, castration, de-horning and various other features. I know that in respect of certain of these provisions there is some difference of opinion between agricultural interests on the proposals of the Bill itself with regard to certain particular proposals. I would only like to make it quite clear, Sir, that the Bill now <span class="col_923-924" refersTo="page_478"/>before the House, as the result first of the Select Committee, and then in part amended as a result of similar objections raised at the time and dealt with at the time, is not presented as a hard and fast agreement on matters in respect of which we can be satisfied that there is a genuine objection. There are points in the Bill which I still believe can be improved, and where it can benefit from further discussions. It was partly the object of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessors that the departmental committee should go into those points, and may be the hon. the Minister as a result of those investigations has information in regard to what had happened in that respect. But as the mover of the Bill, I want to make it quite clear that I am not digging my toes in saying &#x201C;This must be the answer&#x201D;. What I want to see is a Bill which will have a passage through Parliament, and will appear on the Statute Book and which in the opinion of all of us is the best measure that we can produce for the safety and protection of our animals in this country. Therefore if there are genuine amendments which are required, in the normal process of dealing with the Bill, no doubt those amendments can be dealt with. I have dealt mainly with the first two clauses, but on page 7, Clause 2 deals with animals being used for certain experimental purposes and imposes what we believe are genuinely necessary controls in order to see that these experiments are carried out in as humane a manner as possible and by people who in general have the qualifications and authority to deal with them. Clauses 3, 4 and 5 generally deal with the powers of the court. Clause 6 provides authority for the police and pound masters in regard to the destruction of animals injured and which have to be destroyed, and where it is not possible to make contact with the owners. Clause 7 deals with the custody of animals pending proceedings in connection with animals; Clauses 8 and 9 provide the necessary machinery for the expenses of pound masters and the police, and from 10 to 12 the Bill deals with the powers and rights of the police in general in regard to the provisions of the Bill, powers and rights which we believe would make it easier and allow the police and the authorities to take more effective action with less delay. Clause 13 deals with powers which may be granted or used by the officers or registered animal welfare organizations, the S.P.C.A. and other bodies of that nature, where they have trained officials for the protection of animals, and it gives them more scope than they have at the moment in assisting the police and the authorities both in dealing with cases that they come across and in general the administration of the Act. I believe this is a very valuable clause and that it can be of valuable assistance to the Government in their handling of this particular matter. Clause 14 is also very important because it is the Clause which empowers the hon. the Minister to make certain necessary regulations, in some cases in consultation with the Minister of Agricultural (Technical Services) which the Minister will find necessary in order to carry out the provisions of the Act without delay and to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Chapter II deals in greater detail with the control of experiments with animals. It sets out the authorities that can be authorized to carry out these experiments. They must have the permission of the hon. the Minister who has power under various clauses of this Bill, to impose certain conditions under which the experiments must be carried out and the extent of those experiments, the premises, the equipment to be used and various other features connected with those experiments.</p>

<p>Clause 20 lays down that a complete record of any such experiments must be kept available and Clauses 21, 22 deal with the powers of inspectors to enter premises and generally to take action to see that the law is being observed.</p>

<p>Clause 24 again empowers the hon. the Minister to make certain regulations dealing with authority to conduct experiments with animals.</p>

<p>Chapter III is a general and miscellaneous chapter. It deals with amendments to certain existing Acts, such as the Entertainment Act which deals with the infliction of cruelty, pain or terror on animals in order to make them perform some trick; with pictures of animals depicting how this terror is artificially produced. Clauses 28, 29 and 30 bring about necessary amendments to the Slaughter of Animals Act No. 26 of 1934 to meet current developments in the set-up of the country and scientific instruments which are now available but which were not previously.</p>

<p>Clause 31 deals with the killing of bovine and equine animals and Clause 32 lays down the penalties that may be imposed on persons contravening the Act. These Clauses in the main cover the provisions of the Bill itself.</p>

<p>I want to conclude on this note Sir. I am to-day introducing this Bill as a private member&#x2019;s Bill. I am prepared, if necessary, with the approval of the House to deal with it in its various stages. But I do want to say quite clearly, Sir, that I do not believe that a Bill of this nature, a Bill that deals with such far-reaching matters of national importance, is the type of Bill for which a private member should legislate. I believe that it is the class of Bill that should be dealt with by the Government of the day. It is a class of Bill that has such an impact on our national life that only the Government of the day can hope to deal with it successfully. It is beyond the capacity of a private member in that respect. We have already had certain conditional assurances from previous Ministers with regard to investigations into the matter, upon which they could then finally formulate their decisions and I would be most happy, if the hon. the Minister, following in the footsteps of his predecessors, would give us an assurance that as a result of the investigation conducted so far&#x2014;or if they have not been completed that <span class="col_925-926" refersTo="page_479"/>such investigations will be instituted in accordance with previous assurances as soon as possible&#x2014;he feels that legislation of this nature is essential and that the Government itself will sponsor such legislation.</p>

<p>I do not deal like that. I tried to deal with the Minister in a proper manner in his office.

If there are any clauses upon which agreement cannot be reached, I have not the slightest objection to those clauses being held over for further examination.

<p>I should like to assure the hon. the Minister that he will have not only my own but I believe the fullest co-operation of every member in this House in that regard.

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I second, and I should like to support the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) in his plea to the Minister. This is not a Bill which is coming before the House for the first time. This Bill is based on the report of the Select Committee on the subject of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Bill which was before the House in 1957. Three of the members of that Select Committee are still hon. members of this House, and I hope they will give their support to the hon. member who moved this motion. It is not necessary to discuss the provisions of this Bill, but I want to say that ever since I became a member of this House, that is to say in 1958, I have been giving this matter my attention. I was constantly in touch with the then hon. Minister of Justice, to-day the State President of the Republic of South Africa. It is perfectly clear that there were certain difficulties but a promise was made to investigate the matter, and it was investigated. Later on there was a change. Mr. Erasmus was appointed Minister of Justice and the matter was repeatedly brought to his attention. particularly by Mr. Cope, a former hon. member of this House, and myself. After the introduction of a similar Bill last year, I personally had discussions with the then Minister of Justice and he told me that the Government intended to introduce particularly the first chapter of this Bill during this Session, and that the provisions of the later chapters would have to be examined further, because I understood that there were certain objections.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself at once with the hope expressed by the hon. member for Simonstown in connection with this Bill. It was introduced in the first place by a private member. It was then sent by this House to a Select Committee where it was discussed over a period of three months&#x2014;and here is the evidence. But after that had been done and after the Bill had been reported to this House, I understand there were certain objections. I fully agree with the hon. member for Simonstown that it would be much better if legislation of this kind could be dealt with by the Government of the day and by the Minister concerned, the Minister of Justice. I want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to do so. It is perfectly clear from the question asked by the hon. member who has just sat down that this matter was not brought to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. This Bill is one which is urgently necessary. The existing laws have been on the Statute Book of this country for many years, and the time has come to bring this whole matter to the notice of the House again and to place on the Statute Book a measure which takes into account present-day circumstances. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to say so to this House, or that he will be prepared to say that this Bill can be sent to a Select Committee with the support of the Government, or that he is prepared to investigate the matter further and, if possible, to introduce legislation which will enjoy the support of the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is perfectly clear that a change is necessary. I understand that the members of this House who were members of the Select Committee&#x2014;the majority were of course Government members&#x2014;were not unanimouse in their opinion about all the clauses, but certainly in regard to most of the provisions of the Bill. I understand that the difficulties in this connection are difficulties relating to Chapters 2 and 3. As far as Chapter 1 is concerned, I understand that there are no difficulties. I am sure that if there had been no change in the portfolio of Justice, Mr. Erasmus, the then Minister of Justice, would personally have introduced a Bill in terms of the promise made by him. I hope therefore that the present Minister will be prepared to say to this House that he will go into this matter and that he will be prepared, if this Bill is withdrawn, to introduce his own Bill in connection with this subject. I am also in a position to say that I understood from the previous Minister that the difficulties which exist in connection <span class="col_927-928" refersTo="page_480"/>with Chapters 2 and 3 may quite possibly be removed by certain amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think all hon. members of this House will agree that it is necessary for White South Africa to have on the Statute Book an up-to-date law in connection with this very important question of animal protection. I associate myself therefore with the plea made by the hon. member for Simonstown to the hon. the Minister that he should give his personal attention to this matter. If the hon. the Minister is prepared to heed the plea of the hon. member for Simonstown I can say to him that he will have the full support of this side of the House in connection with any legislation that he introduces.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the subject with which this Bill deals, is naturally one which is close to our hearts. In the main, I do not think that there is anyone here who has any fault to find with what the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) and also the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) said. It goes without saying that all of us are particularly sympathetic to the matters with which this Bill deals. Not only are we sympathetically disposed towards this subject, but we are all grateful to those people who sacrifice their time and energy and who are prepared at all times to put the case for animal protection. I think there can be no misunderstanding or difference of opinion between us on this aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>In the first place I do wish to differ slightly from the hon. member for Simonstown. I think he painted far too sombre a picture here this afternoon. I think hon. members will agree with me that our people in South Africa have at all times treated our animals well, and still treat them well to-day.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I think it is only in rare, exceptional cases that people have ill-treated their animals. It so happens unfortunately that I only saw this Bill for the first time this morning. In the nature of things I have had very little time to look at this Bill. I have had no opportunity whatever of consulting with the Department about its provisions. The hon. member for Germiston (District) expressed the hope that I would view this matter with sympathy. It goes without saying that I do so. I want to put it clearly too that I know that it is difficult to get along with me politically. Hon. members on the other side cannot get along with me politically. But my door has always been open to hon. members on the other side, and they know it, as far as matters unconnected with politics are concerned. And I am sorry that no one found it necessary to inquire from me or for that matter from my Department whether or not we intended to introduce such legislation. I have again asked the Department whether anyone did inquire and it appears that no one made any inquiries and no one inquired from me personally. I understand that the hon. member for Simonstown communicated with my office twice or three times and that he wanted to see me. I was unfortunately engaged. But, Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that the hon. member could have asked me in passing in the lobby whether or not I intended introducing legislation; or he could have written me a note inquiring whether I intended introducing such legislation. Unfortunately this did not happen. My attention has now been drawn to a report in the <i>Star</i> of 22 January from which I see that hon. member for Simonstown is introducing this Bill at the request of the National Council of Women. I also note &#x2026; and the hon. member may take it amiss if he wishes to do so but I do not think that the best way to initiate this Bill was to say as the hon. member did in the interview which he gave to the <i>Star</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There have been a number of vague statements from the Government that they will take over certain sections of the Bill and examine others.</block>

<p>I do not know why it was necessary to cast a reflection in this regard seeing that this is a Bill which has nothing whatever to do with politics. The hon. member goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am introducing the measure in a bid to prod the Government to get vital sections on the Statute Book.</block>

<p>I ask again of the hon. member: Why grant an interview to a newspaper in which these two reflections are cast without taking the elementary trouble of asking me or my Department whether or not such a Bill is going to be introduced. If the hon. member had asked me or, if he could not talk to me personally, if he had inquired by means of a question on the Order Paper, I would have had to tell him that I would be introducing such a Bill shortly, dealing with those aspects of the matter that I am charged with; and I shall come back to the other aspects. I want to say to him that the aspect with which I have to do, has been dealt with and that I will introduce a Bill.</p>

<p>Hon. members will notice from the Bill that three ministries are really concerned with this: The Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the Department of Education are concerned with it. The hon. member for Germiston (District) himself mentioned the difficulties of these Ministers and it is unnecessary for me therefore to go into it. Unfortunately events have taken this course, and I wish to say how sorry I am that this matter has come before the House in this way. I did not even have time to read through the Bill; I had no time whatever to study it; I had no time to consult with my Department to find out to what extent this Bill is acceptable. <span class="col_929-930" refersTo="page_481"/>But there are certain principles which have caught my eye and which I must say at once are unacceptable to me and which concern the essence of this Bill. They are to be found in Section 13 (1) of the Bill which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any Society for the prevention of cruelty to animals which is registered under &#x2026; the Act, may, by any person authorized thereto in writing under the hand of the chairman or secretary thereof, prosecute for any offence against this chapter and the provisions of any law relating to private prosecutions shall apply to all such prosecutions.</block>

<p>This principle that private individuals should be allowed to bring prosecutions in the courts without restriction is not one which I can accept. Hon. members will realize at once what it may lead to and what repercussions it will eventually have. The usual safety valve as far as private prosecutions are concerned, namely, that it is only when the Attorney-General and the prosecutor have refused to prosecute and have given a certificate to that effect, that the private individual can go to court, does not apply here. The principle contained in this section is not one which I can accept. Then sub-section (2) goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A magistrate may, by writing under his hand, authorize any officer of such a society to exercise all or any of the powers conferred by this chapter upon a police officer &#x2026;</block>

<p>If one reads the Bill, one finds that far-reaching powers are conferred on the police. For example, in Section 11 we find&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every person who is suspected on reasonable grounds&#x2014;</block>

<p>Merely suspected&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of having committed an offence under the provisions of this chapter, may, if there is reason to believe that the ends of justice would be defeated by the delay in obtaining a warrant, be arrested without a warrant by a police officer and shall be brought before a magistrate&#x2019;s court and dealt with in accordance with this chapter.</block>

<p>This is one power, amongst others, which is granted to the police by this Bill and provision is made in another section for private individuals, over whom I have no control whatever, who may be with a society to-day and gone to-morrow, to have the power of arrest without a warrant whenever they suspect anyone on reasonable grounds of having committed a contravention of this Act. Mr. Speaker, I cannot accept a principle which confers such powers on private individuals. But sub-section (3) of that section, in my humble opinion, goes much further. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One half of any pecuniary penalty recovered from any person convicted under Section 2 of this Act, shall be paid into the funds of such society &#x2026;</block>

<p>One can realize how many prosecutions we would have if the societies were to obtain their funds from convictions by the courts. We would have the same position as in the small town where a traffic constable was appointed who was given half of the fines paid by the people he caught. These are principles&#x2014;to mention just a few of them to hon. members &#x2014;which caught my eye in glancing through the Bill hurriedly and which unfortunately cannot accept.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say in the circumstances, that in so far as those aspects are concerned over which I have control, I intend introducing legislation. As far as I am concerned the matter has practically been disposed of and I shall shortly be in a position to come to the House. I am sorry that because of the circumstances I have mentioned, I cannot give my support to this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I make no excuse for coming back to deal with the Government&#x2019;s policy of &#x201C;Apartheid&#x201D; and &#x201C;Partition&#x201D; in the concluding stages of this Part Appropriation Bill. &#x201C;Apartheid&#x201D;&#x2014;this policy of despair&#x2014;is the greatest single cause of our miseries and dissensions, as well as many of our financial problems. It is because of the stubborn and inflexible ferocity with which this policy is implemented that South Africa has been led to the brink of the precipice. There may yet be time to call a halt and in the hope of bringing that about I will put before the House to-day, my particular point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems that all parties in this Parliament are now agreed on certain inevasible facts. To the Nationalists these facts may be ineluctable, but they have reluctantly accepted them. We agree, first of all, Sir, that we live in a multi-racial State and that our peoples are integrated into one social economy. We agree that we are all dependent each upon the other for our daily existence. And now, at last, it seems we all admit that, in such a society, political rights cannot be permanently withheld from all or any of the race groups of South Africa.</p>

<p>The Nationalists naturally do not like this state of affairs. Their dogma is that a Whiteskinned man is inherently superior to one who may have a skin that is Brown or Black. They are determined to separate the races and to keep them apart, if necessary by force. Their policy, put simply, amounts to this; they intend to remove all of the non-Whites from any continuity of contact with the superior White people&#x2014;except in the capacity of servants to masters. Now, in pursuance of this policy and in order to know who is White and who is Coloured and who is Black, so as to separate them more effectively, they must first of all classify, label and docket all the individuals of different races. Just as Hitler classified and separated the Jews so South Africa must classify and segregate the White, the Black, the Coloured and the Asiatic citizens of our country. Each man must be given his indelible badge of superiority or be stamped with his particular stigma of inferiority. Appearance, of course, is no final criterion. So we must have a human &#x201C;stud-book&#x201D; we must carry registration cards to show who is of what colour.</p>

<p>Our system of government is called a democracy. Of course, it is not. It is, at best, a democracy for the White people only. (And even for the Whites liberty is rapidly becoming freedom to do what Dr. Verwoerd permits.) &#x201C;The White man&#x201D;, say the Nationalists, &#x201C;must be boss.&#x201D; He must control the destiny of this multi-racial country without any reference whatsoever to, and quite unimpeded by, Black or Brown or Coloured thought. The majority of the citizens of this country will, according to their policy, remain voteless, and practically voiceless in this Parliament, for ever and a day.</p>

<p>But the Nationalist is a religious man. He may not be a statesman, but he is a Godfearing politician. Therefore he seeks for a moral basis for his unusual plans. To justify the policy of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, he has devised the master plan of partition, the plan of Bantustan. In this way he will do more than merely condition his conscience. He hopes also to pacify a truculent world. Mr. Speaker, we are, according to the plan of the hon. the Prime Minister, to divide South Africa up into several, independent Black states. The Prime Minister asserts that, if he gives the Black man a small country in which he will eventually be his own boss, he, the Prime Minister, can look the world in the eyes and say: &#x201C;I am a Christian democrat; I give independence now, and I promise eventual sovereignty, to the Bantu in seven Bantustans; I give away 17 per cent of the area of my land to 70 per cent of the Black people; people with whom I do not wish to mix in any way whatsoever. That entitles me to wreak my will on the greater number of their Black brothers who must remain permanently in what we call &#x2018;White&#x2019; South Africa.&#x201D; His followers throughout this country, these loud interjecters opposite me, repeat the parrot-cry, &#x201C;if we give independence to the Bantustans we can do what we like with the Black men in White South Africa; if they do not like it they can get out regardless of whether or not they have any place to go&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Of course, Sir, partition, fairly carried out, is not immoral. It has been achieved in the past in some countries with success. But partition is worse than immoral when it is carried on on the basis of: &#x201C;I divide and I choose.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The present partition of South Africa is carried out on that basis. It cannot be justified on moral grounds. In any case the whole <span class="col_933-934" refersTo="page_483"/>morality of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; goes by the board, breaks down completely, if one considers it in relation to our Coloured and Indian populations. There is no part of South Africa which the Nationalists intend to cut off and divide with them. Nor do they intend to set them up in independent &#x201C;Stans&#x201D; of their own. Although we cannot deny that they are ripe for further political rights they are to be kept voteless and practically voiceless, permanently. But I must get back to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s master plan of Bantustan.</p>

<p>Here is the skeleton of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, dragged out of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s cupboard. South Africa is to be partitioned, first of all, into one &#x201C;White&#x201D; state which will be multiracial. That &#x201C;White&#x201D; state will contain some 3,500,000 Whites, 1,500,000 Coloureds, 500,000 Asiatics and 6,000,000 Bantu. In this &#x201C;White &#x201D; state the small minority of White men will be in complete political control for ever. The non-White citizens cannot ever share in government. Thus we have one &#x201C;White&#x201D; multiracial state and it is to be sub-divided yet further into one Coloured state within this state and one Indian state within this &#x201C;Whit&#x201D; state, secondly we must add to this strange conception, this unusual conglomeration, seven distinct and independent Black Bantustans. Here the least advanced of our African population, the least sophisticated section of our people, are to be given their own political institutions, and will advance to complete sovereignty. The White man must either retreat from these areas, or stay in them on terms laid down for him by the Bantu. The White man has that option. In order to create these Bantustans, the Prime Minister intends to make boundaries at some time in the future. Eventually he will drive barbed wire fences of division through the heart of South Africa. Mr. Speaker, this is his ludicrous Bantustan scheme. This is the bare outline, the naked absurdity of his wonderful scheme which is to save South Africa and keep it whiter and purer, forever. Let us examine some of the consequences of this larger lunacy. What is the result of this immolation? There will be no change whatsoever in the racial proportions and complexities of White South Africa&#x2019;s heterogeneous population. Our truncated White South Africa will have exactly the same race problems, only intensified and potentially much more threatening. By carving up and giving away valuable parts of South Africa, the Prime Minister gains nothing in the direction of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; at all. He does not even succeed in pacifying an antagonistic world, or salving the conscience, if the truth were known, of many of his followers. What remains of our country will still be multiracial. There will be just as great a preponderance of non-Whites in our factories, on our farms and in our homes. The Bantustans cannot attract any significant number of Bantu out of our &#x201C;White&#x201D; areas. The main part of the master plan is based on the theory, the assumption, that 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 Blacks will eventually leave us about the year 2,000 A.D. to return to their homelands, leaving us a purer, even if a poorer, nation. Neither the Tomlinson Commission, that Nationalist-appointed Commission that finally killed &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, nor the Fagan Commission, agree that it practicable or possible. Let me quote from the Fagan Commission: &#x201C;It will be utterly impossible to put the Native population, which is now outside the reserves back into the reserves, or keep the whole of the increase there in future &#x2026;&#x201D; Even the most vigorous implementation of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, Sir, does not save South Africa from the need to plan for a steadily increasing permanent African population in so-called &#x201C;White&#x201D; South Africa, to whom it would be impossible, unjust and immoral to deny for ever the rights of citizenship. I believe that many thinking Nationalists have come round to the view expressed by the Stallard Commission as far back as 1921, when they said that if the Natives in our towns do not depart&#x2014;I quote &#x2014;&#x201C;There can be no justification for excluding them from the franchise on the simple ground of colour&#x201D;. And we know they will not depart; they cannot depart. Mr. Speaker, I am sadly convinced that an eruption of disquieting dimensions must finally occur if, in our integrated economy, in our multi-racial society, we try to keep political rights away from the overwhelming majority of our people.</p>

<p>Sir, speakers in previous debates on this Part Appropriation Bill have laid bare many of the tragic consequences which are inherent in this new partition plan. They have dealt with the danger of one or more of these Bantustans serving as a possible springboard for foreign intervention. They have shown how UNO may interfere if the Prime Minister&#x2019;s newly-created Colonies become dissatisfied with the speed of their transition to full sovereignty, or if the Bantustans seek to protect, with foreign aid, the position of their people who will form the majority group in &#x201C;White&#x201D; South Africa. Economists have dealt with the risky future of border industries and have indicated that internal competition from our own Colonies might affect our industries if the present Common Market arrangement we have in South Africa breaks down. Members representing Zululand and the Transkei have pointed out that the great but uncalled-for sacrifices made by their White constituents, may be made in vain. In this transition we must not forget the White people of the Transkei and Zululand. Many of us may remember the Prime Minister&#x2019;s just indignation when, in this Parliament, the Prime Minister of Britain said that in Africa the White man was &#x201C;expendable.&#x201D; He must have had every sympathy for the South Africans, as well as the British settlers who had gone to Kenya and Tanganyika and who were being told that they were &#x201C;expendable.&#x201D; And yet he now says himself &#x201C;just as the White man must get out of Nairobi, so the White man will eventually have to go from Umtata.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, in my opinion the White settlers of Kenya fall into a different category entirely from our people who <span class="col_935-936" refersTo="page_484"/>live in Umtata. They emigrated from a faraway land to a strange and to them wondrous African country; they knew they were taking a risk for the future; they settled, with open eyes, in a foreign country. But it was different with our people who set themselves up in Umtata. They chose this part of their own country, in their own town, under their own Government, to build up a future and make homes for themselves. And now they are told by this Prime Minister that they are &#x201C;expendable.&#x201D; They are told that one day they must get out. As I see it, there is one thing on which we must insist. They must be compensated. I hope the Minister of Finance will get up in this debate and admit that it is the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to see that every White or Coloured citizen affected by this transition will be absolutely adequately compensated.</p>

<p>Before I deal with some important issues which arise from the reply of the hon. the Minister of Finance to the second reading debate, I think it essential to refer once more, (and for reasons which I think will become soon apparent to him) to the unfortunate remarks made by the hon. the Minister of Lands in a previous debate. I bring up this matter now because I feel it is my duty to do so and because I think the Minister should take advantage of this debate either to recant what he said or to explain that he did not mean what his words appear to mean. If he does not do so, I fear that the consequences may be serious for our foreign relations. Now, from Hansard it is apparent that this is what the hon. gentleman said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hulle (die Verenigde Party) weet dat die pad wat ons nou ingeslaan het sal jy enduit moet loop. Jy kan nie terugdraai nie. Al die lawaai wat hulle maak sal nie help om Suid-Afrika op daardie pad terug te voer nie. Ons het nou eenmaal die pad ingeslaan en ons het hom vir goed ingeslaan. Daar is net een manier waarop Suid-Afrika afgedwing kan word van die standpunt wat hy nou ingeneem het, nie deur die huidige Opposisie nie, want as hulle m&#x00F4;re aan bewind kom sal hulle moet aangaan met die beleid wat ons nou neergel&#x00EA; het. Die enigste manier waarop dit gedoen kan word is deur milit&#x00EA;re intervensie van buite.</block>

<p>Now, I want to be quite fair. Yet I believe that there is only one interpretation to be placed on that statement. I should mention that at a subsequent stage in the debate the hon. the Minister was given the opportunity by the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) to get up and explain what he really meant. Speaking in English he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I did not say that only military intervention could divert the Government from its course. What I said was that South Africa was committed-to this policy, and I also said that if the Opposition were to govern South Africa they would also have to carry on with this policy, because once having embarked on it we could not return. Then I said, the only way &#x2026;</block>

<p>And these are the important words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in which South Africa would be able to change that policy would be by military intervention.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Minister, look again at the original Hansard, and I am sure you will agree, when you re-examine it, that your explanation added no light of clear understanding to what you said, whatever you may have meant. In the original Hansard, as you will admit, the words were &#x201C;The only way in which South Africa can be forced to change its policy &#x2026;&#x201D;. In his explanation he said, &#x201C;The only way in which South Africa would be able to change its policy &#x2026;&#x201D;. Sir, the change in wording is significant. Then also the original phrasing in Hansard said &#x201C;through military intervention from outside&#x201D;. In the Minister&#x2019;s later explanation of what he said he left out the words &#x201C;from outside&#x201D;. He alleged that he only said &#x201C;through military intervention&#x201D;. I think it is most important to mark the very notable addition and to notice the very significant omission. His original words must be read in a sense which I think very ominous. His explanation is unsatisfactory. The Minister will see that he should deny more authoritatively what he said, or must take steps to see that the world understands it in a different way. I ask the new Minister for Propaganda whether something should not be done to clear up this matter. I really do not want the <i>Burger</i> to be the only apologist for the Minister of Lands &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Order! I do not think we have a Minister of Propaganda.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, we have a Minister of most impropaganda. It is called &#x201C;Information&#x201D;. The Minister of Lands must realize that it is important to set this matter right. I am sure that certain overseas observers and people who nurse resentment or animosity towards us might easily read the original meaning into the Minister&#x2019;s statement, in spite of his explanation. They might read it to mean, as it seems to me to mean, that the road to separate development on the basis of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; is now such an established fact that not even the Opposition can do anything about it and that the only thing that can change it is military intervention from outside. This is a dangerous statement and therefore it must be corrected authoritatively. I ask the Minister to do so in this debate. We all realize that it is a serious thing if the outside world regards this statement as a defiant declaration of inflexible policy based on race discrimination. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Lands must remember the fact that all of its policies of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; are applied with equal vigour to the mandated territory of South <span class="col_937-938" refersTo="page_485"/>West Africa. They must know that we are involved in a case pending before the International Court of Justice, the outcome of which we all fear. Yet, in advance of that judgment, a senior Minister has made a provocative and challenging statement. I ask him to correct it. He must know that UNO voted unanimously to send a Committee to South West Africa, which will apply for admission shortly. Surely in these circumstances and at this juncture, and with this knowledge in mind, the Minister should have shown a greater degree of responsibility. I hope that he realizes what his duty is to South Africa and that he will take advantage of this debate to get up and explain his inconsistencies and to make it clear to the world that his meaning was not intended to be a challenge. He must renounce any suggestion that he was casting a defiant gauntlet in the face of our ill-wishers and enemies abroad, or that he was doing something calculated to embarrass the last few friends we have in the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I come to that other master of inconsistencies, the hon. the Minister of Finance. He attempted to shrug off many of our criticisms by showing some petty inconsistencies which he saw in some of the speeches coming from this side of the House. Yet he himself was guilty of the grossest inconsistency of all. Does he not remember saying at Worcester two years ago that &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; is an experiment and should it fail it could be reversed? That &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; could be changed? But now, inconsistency personified, he says with glee and with triumph: &#x201C;You have been forced on to a road which you cannot leave.&#x201D; He says: &#x201C;Apartheid is onherroeplik. Julle moet die onvermydelike beleid van apartheid aanvaar.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance referred to our Common Market and said that this newly-conceived Bantustan policy would bring economic unity with separate political units &#x201C;in the same way as the six member states of the Common Market were striving to create economic unity with separate political units&#x201D;. Sir, he should know that he is completely wrong about the Common Market in Europe. Its aim is the very reverse of the Bantustan policy. There the Europeans aim at having economic unity with eventual political integration. That is their declared policy. Here we now have a Common Market with political unity and economic unity, and the Prime Minister is breaking it up. Let me quote, in case he does not believe my words, the words of Mr. Norman H. Strous, the great American merchandiser, and specialist in common market activities. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The six nations seek to create an economic and a political combination &#x2026; They seek the elimination of any restrictions on the free movement of persons, capital and services.</block>

<p>Does this Minister seek that?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lying behind these more obvious official objectives are considerations much more far-reaching. We seek a common currency &#x2026;</block>

<p>We have a common currency&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a common legal system &#x2026;</block>

<p>We are dividing ours&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and even a common European Government.</block>

<p>Does this Minister seek a common South African Government? How can he make an analogy between South Africa and the Common Market on those lines? His Bantustan policy is the very reverse of the policy of the Common Market.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance also attempted to tell us that all of the money, the hundreds of millions needed for the development of these Bantustans, will be found in South Africa; and that we will underwrite any loans from a foreign agency. Now let me say outright that I am in favour of giving foreign aid to undeveloped countries and I agree with the Minister when he says it may be cheaper to absorb the annual increase of Bantu labour and population in the Bantustans than in South Africa. All the facilities they need, such as housing and transport and water, may be more cheaply provided in Bantustan than in &#x201C;White&#x201D; South Africa. But the Minister should be honest with this House and with his followers. Do they realize that in future every single rand raised by way of taxation loan which we underwrite; every cent which is spent in that new independent Bantustan country, every single bit of money we vote in this House, for Transkeian development, will not be an investment in our own country, in an integral part of our country? It will be a foreign loan. It will be foreign aid to a country which we are making foreign. I am not against foreign aid to what was once a part of South Africa. But I hope his followers outside realize what they are doing and those inside this House realize that when they vote supplies in future for Bantustan development they are voting foreign aid to a foreign country. I believe myself that the correct course that should have been taken was not partition into Bantustans. I believe that we should have followed the policy which would have been introduced if we had not been thrown out of power in 1948. We had intended to give the Native Representative Council greater law-making powers, increased taxing powers and larger executive powers. We approve of the sensible extension of political responsibility to our African citizens, and we hope they know, whether they are inside or outside our borders, whether they are cut off or not by Nationalist policy, that they will have our goodwill and help in so far as we can give it to them. We wish them to gain democratic experience and <span class="col_939-940" refersTo="page_486"/>develop eventually for themselves a constitutional arrangement which will work harmoniously. It is our aim, Sir, if only this process of truncation and separation does not go too far, to draw them within the orbit of our federal plan and to give them a share in our Federal Government.</p>

<p>My time, Sir, is at an end. Let me in a few final words reiterate that I believe that this Government misgoverns. I believe that their rule is misrule. It is my fervent hope that some change may take place in the hearts and heads of all South African voters and that they will not allow this ill-omened, ill-planned, ill-fated, ill-thought-out Bantustan partition policy to come to eventual fruition.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INFORMATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite a few years since I had the opportunity of addressing you in this House. I feel that under the present circumstances, without any preparation for my reply, it Is a privilege and a duty on me as an English-speaking South African to reply to the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). I have stated on previous occasions in this House when I sat on the Conservative Party benches and the hon. member turned his vindictiveness against the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker). I told the hon. member then that he is fast going in this House towards earning himself the reputation of being a &#x201C;Boerehater&#x201D;. This afternoon we heard the hon. member adopting a line that still makes him so. He puts himself and his party on a pedestal. He says that a man&#x2019;s colour should not be the criterion. He would make us think that his party relies on such a policy. He intimates that they are the only ones who are just and fair towards South Africa and the rest of the world. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should look to the beam in his own eye and in the eyes of his colleagues. Let me just read a few quotations from those hon. members who, sitting behind him, applaud his efforts this afternoon. I want to speak about the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), a dour fighter, who is not afraid to stand up to debate. But if a man&#x2019;s colour should not be the criterion, how is it that the hon. member for South Coast can make this statement, which I quote from an English newspaper, in Durban&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;With mixed bathing on the South Coast, the tourist trade will decline. Your property will deteriorate and there will be general stagnation,&#x201D; Mr. Douglas Mitchell told a meeting at Umkomaas last night.&#x201C;Let the Progressives go and frolic in the surf with the coolies and the non-Europeans.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Is that the language of people who put themselves on a pedestal? I see the hon. member for South Coast is not here, but I see the hon. member for Sea Point (Capt. J. A. L. Basson) s here, and he was reported in the Press as saying this. This is the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Toe &#x2019;n Blanke hom oor apartheidgeriewe uitvra, het kapt. Basson geantwoord: &#x201C; Ek weet nie hoekom my vriende so &#x2019;n behoefte het om saam met die Kaffers te swem nie.&#x201D; [Laughter.]</block>

<p>They had nothing to say about the Native Reserves in which there has always been partitioning, because no White man has been able to buy land there. I have never heard hon. members opposite say that the protection of the Blackman&#x2019;s land in these reserves is a positive way of handling the affairs of the Black man. I have never heard one of them defend that policy, and we know that but for that policy the Black man would not have had an inch of land to-day in the reserves; it would have been bought up by the White people. If there is any policy for which South Africa can claim a moral basis, it is this policy that the Native must have certain areas of land which are his and which the White man can never take away from him. The position has now gone a stage further where the Native is to be given a system of self-government. The decision with regard to the Transkei was not made because of a sudden moral conscience. The fact that the Natives have held this land for years is due to the moral conscience of the whole of South Africa. It is the basis on which we have arranged our affairs in this country. But what has been happening in Africa? I do not want to quote Native leaders in South Africa. I want to quote the language of Native leaders in territories adjoining South Africa.

<block name="quote">Dr. Banda is to join Mr. Jomo Kenyatta, Mr. Julius Nyerere, Mr. Kenneth Kaunda, and Mr. Joshua Nkomo, in what has been described as a little summit conference at Dar es Salaam. Dr. Banda said at a Press Conference at the airport here that the Federation had been brought about to save White settlers in Southern Rhodesia who were on the verge of bankruptcy. The Federation was broke and Welensky and his gang get all their money from America and the World Bank.</block>

<p>Let the hon. member listen. Sir, when we were having our trouble with the Conservative Party, it was the hon. member who has just interrupted me who said, &#x201C;we are all on the Progressive line in the United Party; you chaps are Conservative and you have to take the consequences of your action.&#x201D; Those were the days when they were all Progressives. Now, of course, the position has changed and they are all Conservatives, including the hon. member who interjected&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Banda referred to the forthcoming independence of Tanganyika and said that every African Nationalist Leader wanted to see the entire Continent of Africa independent and free from imperialism and colonialism. Tanganyika&#x2019;s final independence was just another nail in the coffin. He accused Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead of baiting the Africans in Southern Rhodesia by easing local discriminatory laws. We are not interested in sitting next to White men in the theatres. It is a matter of human dignity, and you cannot have this unless you are running the country yourself. If the Africans in Southern Rhodesia are prepared to swallow that bait, I don&#x2019;t care tuppence for them and I will tell Nkomo so to his face.</block>

<p>What is happening in Africa? It is not a question sharing the vote on a qualified basis as my friends in the Progressive Party think. It is not a question of treating the White man fairly and justly. That is clear from what is happening in Kenya. It is a question of human dignity as they see it under the United Nations Charter; it is a question of majority rule; the Black man must rule this country. They are in the majority and they must rule. That is their definition of human dignity. It has nothing to do with sitting together with Whites in bioscopes. Dr. Hastings Banda who is a cultured man says that is simply a belt. He says&#x2014;that the majority must rule this country and the majority are Blacks. What has been said further? The White man is here on sufferance. Sir, what does the hon. the Minister of Lands say? He says that we are not going to give up our position as Whites in this country even if it means the intervention of arms. Of course, hon. members opposite will try to place their own interpretation on that, but basically the hon. the Minister was indicating that our position as White people in South Africa would be intolerable if we had to bow down to the international concept of human dignity. That is what he was conveying. Let me say this to hon. members opposite: they may try to cause a split here and there, but basically the Government of this country is sound and solid, and the Government is growing from strength to strength. I know it: I can see it. I am not ashamed to sit on this side of the House.</p>

<p>I am very happy to sit on this side, and I want my hon. friends on the other side to know that in the long run sneers will not help them in South Africa. Whether they sneer at me or whether they sneer at the Prime Minister, it is not going to help them in South Africa. There is strong and ever-growing support behind this Government. What do people who come down from Kenya say? They say, &#x201C;thank heavens there is a strong Government in this country; thank heavens in this country alone they are facing to the realities of Africa.&#x201D; You can go to the White people of Tanganyika, the White people of Kenya, and ask them what they think. It is true that hon. members opposite have political influence over a large number of people. That is shown by the number of seats they have in Parliament, but that influence is becoming less and less. They are being forced more and more into a situation which one could never have imagined in the days of General Smuts. They are being forced into the urban areas. Whereas formerly they had a number of seats in the platteland, to-day they have not got one. They have even lost Queenstown. More and more their influence is confined to the English-speaking section of the population.</p>

<p>Sir, I have mentioned to you that this is the feeling in Africa. During the election campaign the former member for Maitland (Dr. Zac de Beer) also endeavoured to answer questions that were put to him as to whether South Africa could possibly carry on under a qualified vote. The following question was put to him by Mrs. Taylor&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_945-946" refersTo="page_489"/>Die grootste Bantoe-party in Suid-Rho-desi&#x00EB; het die grondwet-voorstelle daar verwerp. Watter hoop het die Progressiewes dat die Bantoes in Suid-Afrika sy voorstelle sal steun?</block>

<p>That question was put to him by a United Party supporter, not by me. This was Dr. de Beer&#x2019;s reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As die Bantoes ons voorstelle verwerp &#x2026;</block>

<p>Which showed that he had a doubt in his mind&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; sal dit uiteindelik op &#x2019;n botsing uitloop, maar dan sal die Progressiewes ten minste weet hulle veg vir &#x2019;n goeie saak.</block>

<p>I want to put this now to hon. members opposite: The issue in Africa is not the question of a qualified vote. It is not a question of a so-called Federation in which the White man represents the Black man. The issue is &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; and the majority must rule. That is the issue throughout the whole of Africa. Sir, do not let us draw any red-herrings across the trail. Basically the problem is a majority problem; it is not a minority problem, whether that minority be Coloureds or Indians. Everybody in Africa knows that is the real problem, because one need not look very far to see what is happening; one need only look next door; one need only look at the trouble experienced by Southern Rhodesia in trying to arrive at a constitution that will satisfy the Black people. For the rest, wherever one looks in Africa, one sees nothing but chaos and the misery of the Congo. What is the basis of our attitude on this side? The hon. member says that our whole object is to say to the Bantu, &#x201C;if you do not like the harsh, vicious treatment that you are getting in the Republic, go back to your Bantustan.&#x201D; That, of course, is a complete distortion. Our attitude is that in a certain part of the Republic the White man is going to rule, and that in the Bantustans the Black man will rule, on a basis of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; if that is his wish.</p>

<p>As far as the economic development of the Republic is concerned, we want to see a continuation of the situation which exists to-day under which the Bantu gets far higher wages and far better treatment than anywhere else in Africa. What right has the hon. member then to suggest that this is purely a policy of holding the Black man by the scruff of the neck, and if he does not like it here, he can starve in the reserves? It is this sort of propaganda that admittedly makes it difficult for me to do my job. What makes my task difficult is the sort of propaganda that we have from the hon. member for Constantia who, knowing what accusations are being made against us. at UNO, talks about slave labour in South Africa. The hon. member knows that these talks are taking place; he knows that they are even accusing us of genocide in South West Africa, but when we prove, on oath, that the population in South West Africa has doubled itself under the present r&#x00E9;gime then the hon. member says, &#x201C;that is what I mean by &#x2018;genocide&#x2019;; the population could have been much bigger if it had not been for the present policy.&#x201D; Sir, these things have happened, and that is why I say that these extravagant statements by the hon. members for Constantia and Wynberg about slave labour and Nazism in South Africa, do this country so much harm. Quite frankly, I do not think that the hon. member for Constantia intended to convey what he did convey by using the word &#x201C;slave&#x201D;, but nevertheless that word was used and his statement appears in Hansard, and the next thing that will happen is that our Minister of External Affairs will have to face that quotation at UNO.</p>

<p>We have many problems in this country, but I can assure hon. members that the solution of those problems does not lie in their hands, because they have shown no willingness to try to face up to the position. They always use platitudes and profess moral indignation and put themselves far above the ordinary mortal in South Africa. They have always tried to create the impression that they are the veneer of South Africa and that everybody else is someone to be looked down upon. As long as they continue to adopt that attitude and as long as the hon. member for Wynberg carries on in the way he carried on here to-day, you can be sure that this side of the House will continue to govern.</p>

The last point the hon. the Minister made, was that we were going to create wonderful circumstances in the White area of South Africa, the remaining area. I do not call it a White area: it is not going to be a White area.

Because the conditions in White South Africa are going to be so good that none of the Natives here would ever want to go back, either to the Transkei or to any of the other areas. I just want to say that it is a pity that a person like the hon. the Minister who has just spoken, has to supply the outside world with information on South Africa.

<p>This deception of the people went on throughout the years until just before the election. We on this side suggest that the people of South Africa did not know what this election was about and did not know about this plan of the Government&#x2019;s. I repeat that the people of South Africa were not told what the hon. the Prime Minister proposed to do after the election. He did not tell the people of South Africa that the Transkei would become independent. I can prove that. I quote from the <i>Burger</i> of 2 August 1961, when the election was announced&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A parliamentary election will take place on 18 October this year, it was announced in Pretoria last night after the Cabinet had met for the first time since the parliamentary session.</block>

<p>Then the Prime Minister says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The election is being held because it is essential in the interest of the country that everybody here and abroad should know that once again a stable, strong Government will be in power for the next five years. <br/>It is also desirable in the interest of peace and order and racial harmony in the country. The whole population, White as well as non-White, will by an election be protected against attempts to disrupt law and order. <br/>Attempts to disturb the peace on 31 May 1961. have failed. The second attempt is set for 1963, the normal election year, as <span class="col_949-950" refersTo="page_491"/>being the year of active rebellion against the Government. <br/>In order to combat any organized assaults on the orderly Government of the country as well as attempts at incitement, it will therefore be a good thing to get the election out of the way so that it cannot afford an opportunity for disorderliness.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I said so. and the hon. member over there denied that it was so, and I shall repeat it in a moment and hon. members will again deny it. I say that this was misleading the people. What I said at Pongola I say again, viz. that the policy of the present Government leads to the sacrifice of everything we hold dear in South Africa. I say it will lead to the doom of the White man in South Africa. And now I want to state very clearly that this slogan of the Nationalists that they are fighting for White South Africa is just as misleading to the people outside as the slogan of apartheid was in the past. When we say that it is dangerous to create these states, we are told that Britain gave Kenya and the other territories independence. But the difference is that Britain is thousands of miles away from the countries to which they grant independence, whereas here we will be surrounded by those countries. We will be in between the new states which are being created, and those states will be created out of what is now White South Africa, that South Africa which is beloved by all of us and which was made safe by our forefathers under such difficult circumstances. The hon. member says that I stated at Pongola that we would have to sacrifice what our forefathers fought for. I repeat it to-day. The hon. member did not say here that I was addressing the farmers of Pongola and he has forgotten that he tried to have a motion of no-confidence passed against me but that he did not succeed. I think the farmers of Pongola realized what was happening. and realized how the policy of the Government will land them in trouble in the near future in regard to their labour. Do you realize, Mr. Speaker, that the most satisfied section of our Native population are those living on the farms and that they are the people who are least likely to take part in incitement? In future we will have the position that whereas a large section of the population of the Transkei will have the franchise they will live in parts of our country, perhaps on the farms in the Cape Province. So in future the other areas which are to be given their independence will be in a much more difficult position. It is obvious that other areas must also be given independence in future. It cannot be otherwise. In those areas the position will also be that our farmers will be dealing with persons who work for them but who have the franchise in another area. And in so far as the farmers are concerned, the hon. the Prime Minister comes along with this announcement of the independence of portion of our country at a time when the farmer in the Peninsula has to plough in his cabbages because prices on the market are so low; they come along with this announcement at a time when the prices for dairy products have fallen, when a dairy farmer had to empty out his milk on Church Square. Pretoria, at a time when the meat producer is receiving a minimum price and sheep and cattle are piling up in the abattoirs, when lorries with pigs have had to turn back home, when we have a large surplus of maize in the country and the present surplus will be increased still further by the maize now standing on the lands. It happens at a time when there is a surplus of bananas and when, according to a report, farmers have to feed 30 per cent of their crops to their cattle, when our sugar growers have a larger production than in the past whilst their markets are shrinking, when citrus experienced a bad year in 1960-1, although it was a little better last year, but whilst thousands of new trees are beginning to bear fruit, new markets must be sought. It comes at a time when there Is no market for potatoes and an export market has to be found for butter and cheese, at a time when agricultural unions are making every attempt to find new markets and every person realizes that there is a vast potential new market for us amongst our non-Whites, But now the hon. the Minister at this time announces a policy which I believe will result in an impoverished Transkei. and he announces something which will create impoverished areas in our country. Sir, without the initiative of the White man and his &#x201C;know-how&#x201D; and capital, it is impossible for those areas to make progress.</p>

<p>In the second reading debate the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) said that this Government stands for peace, good order and sound government. These are the three thing which he says are so necessary in South Africa &#x2014;peace, order and good government. And the hon. member made a long speech about racia interests which, as he says, always triumph.</p>

<p>Peace in South Africa, when we are goin to give full independence to seven or eigh <span class="col_951-952" refersTo="page_492"/>non-White states? Peace in South Africa, when those states lie in the shape of a horse-shoe around the neck of White South Africa? Peace, whilst in White South Africa there will still be 6,000,000 Natives, apart from the Coloureds and Asiatics? Peace in South Africa, when we know that they will make further demands? Peace, when we know that the independence which will be given to these non-White states will result in the Coloured and the Asiatic also demanding the same thing?</p>

<p>The hon. member should really go back to his sheep. Peace in South Africa, where such deep emotions are being stirred up by the Prime Minister, political emotions which can become a devastating and uncontrollable flood? Amongst those who make demands I have mentioned the other non-White parts of South Africa, those areas to which the Prime Minister has already promised independence. Because he has promised it. I say that if we think of peace in South Africa under this Nationalist Government, we can see that instead of peace we will have the greatest unrest we have ever had.</p>

<p>The second point mentioned by the hon. member for Standerton is order. Order in South Africa, when there is murder and assault? Order, when no woman is safe on a farm any longer? Order, when no woman is safe in the streets of Cape Town? Order, when the police are incapable of maintaining order in our country? Order? I remember that at the National Party Congress there was talk of order and that they spoke about the control of the Bantu areas. I read in the <i>Oosterlig</i> of 13 September 1961, how delegates from the border areas adjoining Basutoland spoke about a powder-keg, and of a feeling of revenge in the hearts of the border farmers. They said that trouble would ensue. According to these farmers, there is trouble between Basutoland and the Republic. What will be the position between these independent states and the Republic? Because these independent states will continually have people who come from the White areas of South Africa, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister realizes that there will be no order in the country, because this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We will not surrender to the Afro-Asian states, because that would be suicide. We would rather defend ourselves to the bitter end.</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister said that before he started surrendering. There is one hon. member over there who says &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D;. He has not yet discovered <span class="col_953-954" refersTo="page_493"/>that the Prime Minister has begun to yield. That was also before the Japanese were declared to be White. But the Prime Minister says that he would rather defend himself to the last. I do not intend defending myself to the last. I want to defend the life of South Africa, not the end of it.

<p>The hon. member for Standerton spoke about good government. A good Government, a Government which at one time stood as the granite Government which would not submit to the Afro-Asian states? A Government which took us out of the Commonwealth because they would not submit to the Afro-Asian states? And now the Prime Minister says that he is buying freedom for the White man. Is he buying it? That is now the good Government we have, a Government which runs away from the outside world. One can hear it very clearly from the speeches of hon. members opposite, from the speech of the Minister of Lands and the speech made by the Minister of Defence outside this House. A good Government, when the tremendous potential of South Africa lies untouched? A good Government, which prevented us from getting immigrants to South Africa to strengthen the White man? If there is one thing I will never forgive this Government for, it is for having wrecked the immigration plan of the United Party and not having strengthened the White man here. I accuse the Prime Minister of all these things, because the member sitting behind him did not know all this. I want to say here that the Prime Minister did not even consult his Cabinet in regard to this plan for granting independence to the Transkei. I say that he did not even consult his caucus. I have good reason for saying so, because on the same day that the policy of independence for the Transkei was announced by the hon. the Prime Minister, Schalk Pienaar wrote the following in the <i>Burger</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our history will record that yesterday was a dramatic day in the House of Assembly. Dr. Verwoerd announced the speedy independence of the Transkei, with all the implications it holds for the future separation between White and Black South Africa.</block>

<p>Remember, it was only the day before yesterday that the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said that they would achieve full independence. Now the Prime Minister speaks about speedy independence. Schalk Pienaar continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister did so against the background of a world situation which he described as being very dangerous for South Africa, and in the face of a certain outburst on the part of the Opposition and of a possible reaction in his own ranks. True to his nature as being the most dynamic Prime Minister our country has ever had, he simply took a decision and is now forcing it through, come what may.</block>

<p>Schalk Pienaar says he is forcing it through, come what may. And then the Minister of Finance gets up and says that the whole of the caucus and the Cabinet stood behind the Prime Minister. He only said it in the hope that it would perhaps deceive somebody. It will take a long time for South Africa to regain her good name and before we will be rid of the effects of what this Government has done to South Africa. It will be a long time before we will be able to survive the detrimental effects of this policy of apartheid and this word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) started speaking, I could not help thinking of a parody by A. G. Visser&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bedwelmend werk die susterpaar, <br/>Die vrou, die soete wyn. <br/>Die wyn word soeter elke jaar, <br/>Die vrou helaas asyn.</block>

<p>The hon. member started with a terrible tirade against the Minister of Information, but that tirade began even while the hon. Minister was speaking. This reaction was not at all strange to us. We have been waiting for it for a long time. We have been sitting here waiting for an outburst to come against the hon. the Minister of Information and against the hon. the Minister of Labour. Why? Simply because they are English-speaking persons who have publicly dared to join the National Party. Sir, you heard what attacks were made upon him while the Minister was speaking. And who led the attack? The attack was led, you will have noticed, by men like the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross), the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes), whom we know in this House from their speeches as people who are not very found of the Afrikaans-speaking section in our country. They reveal that fact throughout their conduct. They are the people who launched this attack upon the hon. the Minister of Information because he had dared to become a member of the National Party. And they used an Afrikaans-speaking member on their side to reply to the Minister. But these are their old tactics. That is how we know them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg has painted a sombre picture here as to what we can expect now that the National Party&#x2019;s apartheid policy is being implemented. She painted this picture of a great Black danger to us. She painted this picture of a great Black danger arising from the fact that the Bantu States, all of which, she alleges, will gradually be given their independence, will surround the White area and create an enormous danger for the Whites in South Africa. She also talked about the tremendous dangers in the White area itself, about women who will no longer be safe in the streets, etc. She visualized all sorts of dangers. But what is the solution offered by hon. members on the other side to meet these dangers? Their solution is that these people must remain here and must be given the vote, that they should be allowed to come into the White area in greater numbers; that we should make conditions as pleasant as possible for them here so that more and more of them will come in, and then we will be so much safer here! That is their solution! In the course of the debate which has been conducted on the Part Appropriation Bill during the past few days, the United Party has not succeeded in concealing its inability to offer resistance to, or to make any suggestions as to how it can check, the National Party in its forward march along the road that it has been following. In all the speeches made on the other side the United Party has demonstrated its inability to check its own retrogression; it has shown its inability to conceal to what extent it is retrogressing. There is one fact which was as plain as a pikestaff throughout all their speeches, a fact which they did not even try to deny, a fact which was mentioned by all the speakers on this side as an accusation against the alternative policy of the United Party, and that is that eventually their policy of race federation must culminate in Black domination in this country. Not one of them tried to deny that. Not one of them tried to refute it. They have to admit it tacitly. I believe that their leaders and those members on the other side who make a study of these things realize that is so. They know that eventually that must come about under their race federation plan. But they <span class="col_955-956" refersTo="page_494"/>dare not admit it at this stage. At this stage they dare not even argue because there are still too many members in their own party whom they cannot take along with them on this road; people who still think as we on this side of the House do about the colour problem, people who still think for themselves, people who cannot be taken in tow on this road which leads straight to the road followed by the Progressive Party to-day. Because those hon. members must remember that their party was responsible for the birth of the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party and the Liberal Party originated from the United Party. They must be careful therefore. They dare not admit these things, because they have to take along with them on this road as many of their members as possible, and as quickly as possible, this road which leads straight to the one which is already being followed by the Progressive Party to-day. If ever there was a speech which proved the truth of the statement that the liberalists feel just as at home in the United Party as they can possibly be in the Progressive Party, it was certainly the speech made by the hon. member for Wynberg to-day. He is perfectly happy in the United Party, and his language, not only this afternoon, but in all his speeches, clearly shows that he is an out-and-out Progressive, a full-fledged Progressive. But he is perfectly happy in the United Party. Why? Because he knows that the race federation policy of the United Party will bring him exactly where the Progressive Party will bring him and bring him there sooner. All he says is that they must proceed slowly. I am convinced that if we hold an election in this country again, the National Party will not have to fight the election against the United Party but against the united front of the liberalists in South Africa. By that time the United Party will have dissolved completely and perhaps the Progressive Party will have dissolved and there will be a new combination of liberalists opposing the National Party. All the signs indicate that is going to be so. The utterances of leaders of the Opposition clearly indicate that is going to be the position. As the hon. member for Wynberg has said, the Progressive Party has simply been over-hasty. We have the speeches of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), we have the statement made by the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) at their National Congress in Bloemfontein in August last year. They stated clearly that we must not give the non-White too much too soon. The emphasis was on the words &#x201C;too soon&#x201D;. Members on the other side have hinted repeatedly that they believe that the eventual goal towards which they are moving is precisely the goal to which the Progressive Party would like to lead them.</p>

<p>One of the basic arguments advanced by hon. members in this debate against the granting of self-government to the Transkei is that the rights of the urban Bantu are not recognized here; that they are given no political rights here and that the political rights which the urban Bantu are going to get in their own homelands will be entirely worthless. They say that the granting of a measure of independence to the Transkei, this continuation of the apartheid policy, is no solution of the problem at all because, they say, the Bantu in the urban areas are detribalized and that if the detribalized Native is not given political rights in this area in which he resides, it will not solve this problem at all. But is that so, Mr. Speaker? Is it true that the Bantu living in the White areas are detribalized? Anybody who makes that allegation does not know the Bantu at all. The Bantu living in the White area, whether he be a Xhosa, a Zulu or a Basuto, still maintains the traditions of his tribe and of his homeland. He still believes in the cultural possessions of his own people; he still observes their traditions. Who are the detribalized Bantu? It is true that there is a group of Bantu who have become detribalized, and they are the agitator types who are the henchmen of the pro-Left organizations as well as of proLeft Whites in this country. Those are the detribalized non-Whites. Those are the people to whom those hon. members want to give political rights in the White areas under their new race federation policy. Those are the people who will eventually come and sit in this House. After all. we had proof of that when Whites represented the non-Whites in this House. It was the Lee-Wardens and the Stanfords who represented them here&#x2014;people who were simply out to disturb the relations between White and non-White. They were people who did not look after the interests of the non-Whites. The Government and the Departments concerned have always had to do that in any event. Mr. Speaker, once those people have the vote, if the policy of the United Party is to be implemented, then I agree with them that you will have a detribalized Bantu group in White South Africa; you will then be severing them completely from their tribal connections; you will be linking them to the White man&#x2019;s political institutions and you will be detribalizing the Bantu and really doing a great injustice to them.</p>

<p>I believe that the United Party leaders are aware of these things. They realize that is the position. But it is because that is so that they are preparing their people so as to be able to take them along with them. Some of them still contend that the Bantu will not be represented in this House by his own people. But what are the facts? I want to quote here from a speech which the hon. member for Yeoville made in Pretoria on 13 July 1960, when he addressed the Pretoria Women&#x2019;s Council of the United Party. On that occasion he said this, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party&#x2019;s policy is to restore Parliamentary representation of the Bantu and to extend it to all the provinces. At the present moment these representatives will be Whites, but Bantu representatives will come. The Coloureds are already a Westernized community and they will be put back on to a common voters&#x2019; roll.</block>

<p><span class="col_957-958" refersTo="page_495"/>That is only one bit of evidence that I want to tender but there is further evidence. Sir, you will have seen that one of the main architects of the race federation scheme, Dr. Silk, used the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There will be a system of overlapping provinces, consisting of the present four White provinces and something like eight Native provinces. Whites, together with Coloureds on a Common Roll, will elect their members for the Federal Parliament and the Natives will elect their members, but fewer than the Whites. <br/>Indians will be on the same roll or a separate roll. Initially the non-Whites will have to elect Whites as their representatives, but Dr. Silk feels that gradually this system will lessen racial tension to such an extent that Whites will agree to non-Whites being represented by their own people.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Senate will consist of three representatives of every White and non-White province, without appointment by the Cabinet.</block>

<p>And then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Silk feels that the federal constitution must contain a guarantee that the interests of every large racial group will be represented in the Cabinet. Initially it will be a Cabinet consisting of Whites only, but eventually it will become multi-racial.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is not a politician but it is certainly a person of whom hon. members on the other side take some notice. Surely they would not want to repudiate the words of this strong supporter of theirs. There is also another very prominent leader in the United Party who made a similar statement. The hon. the Minister of Information has quoted from the same speech made by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I also want to quote the speech which the hon. member made last year on 20 September at Doonside, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the United Party is placed in power, the party will give elementary training to certain Natives so that they can eventually enter Parliament, in terms of the race federation plan.</block>

<p>Those are the words used by the hon. member for South Coast. But only last week the younger lights of the United Party made a similar statement. The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) said at Greenside last Tuesday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party believes in White leadership for the present but concedes that a multi-racial Parliament that will look after the interests of the various races, will be a natural follow-on of its federal plan.</block>

<p>The hon. member is in his seat and perhaps he will be able to state his case much more clearly in this House. I doubt whether he will be allowed to do so. But to my mind there is further, very revealing evidence that the United Party is moving, and moving rapidly, along the road of the Progressive Party. We know that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke about this matter at a meeting at Mowbray on 3 October last year, and there he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In reply to the question as to whom the United Party have consulted when it decided to give the Bantu eight representatives in the House of Assembly, Sir de Villiers Graaff stated that he had had too much experience of the Security Branch of the Police to reply to that. He was able to say that a Black leader had addressed the United Party caucus during the previous session.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, does this not prove beyond any doubt that the United Party is gradually conditioning its members in Parliament and its members outside so as to be able to take them along on this road of integration, this road of multi-racialism in this Parliament as well? But there is further indisputable proof that I want to quote, and here again that proof was given by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I refer to a speech which he made during the election campaign in Wolmaransstad on 23 September, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was vital that Basutoland and the other Protectorates should become part of South Africa, and they could well do so within the framework of the United Party&#x2019;s plan for a race federation, the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff, told a United Party meeting here to-day.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to me it is significant that the Leader of the United Party says that Basutoland and the other Protectorates must be incorporated in the Republic of South Africa if the policy of race federation is put into operation here. We see what the position is to-day; we see that Basutoland is agitating and fighting hard for full independence. It will probably get it in the near future. We notice that Swaziland is beginning to ask for it; we notice that Bechuanaland is on the road to full independence. It is perfectly clear that those Protectorates, once they have been given full independence, will not, without imposing conditions, allow themselves to be incorporated in South Africa&#x2019;s race federation. After all, they would not come here and sacrifice their independence and willingly come and serve under White control and White leadership.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SADIE</person>:</from>

<p>We have no time for nonsense now. It is perfectly clear that the United Party is conditioning its people to be prepared not only to sit here eventually together with the Black man but to serve under him under their policy of race federation. But, Mr. Speaker, there is a very interesting phenomenon to which I should like to refer. I want to adduce further evidence in support of my proposition that the United Party is conditioning its people for this state of affairs which is developing and which they know is unavoidable under their policy. On 16 August last the United Party held what they called a national congress at Bloemfontein, and there they had two agendas. They had the ordinary agenda which all party congresses have, but they also had a secret agenda. What was in that secret agenda? The mere fact that there was a secret agenda and that points for discussion which had been submitted by constituencies and which clearly showed a liberalistic trend, were incorporated in the secret agenda, clearly proves, in my opinion, that this was a further attempt at conditioning. It was an attempt to condition all those people who had been brought together at the conference from all over the country so as to be able to take them along, and to take them along as soon as possible and in the greatest possible numbers, on this multi-racial road. What happened there, and what were the items on the agenda? We find that no less than three constituencies asked that the Bantu would be given direct representation in Parliament. Which three constituencies were they? Mr. Speaker, this alone is very revealing in my opinion. They were the constituencies of Constantia and Wynberg and the Humansdorp branch of the United Party, where those two members of the United Party had probably held meetings. There were eight constituencies which asked on the secret agenda that the non-White groups should be given representation in Parliament. I notice that the hon. member for Rissik (Mr. de Kock) is not here, but his constituency asked that the Asiatics should have representation in the Federal Parliament. Knowing what the race federation policy of the United Party is in respect of the Indians, the hon. member for Rissik could have said to them: &#x201C;Look here, we want to consult the Indians; we must not simply pass resolutions here; we must first go and ask the Indians whether they want the franchise and how they want it.&#x201D; But I believe that the hon. member read out a report from a conference held in Durban on 22 July of last year. It was a conference of 384 delegates, who represented 134 political, educational, religious and ratepayers&#x2019; organizations of Indians and which included, amongst others, observers from the Progressive Party. What conclusion was arrived at by that representative meeting of Indian organizations? They decided that they wanted to have nothing to do with the policies of the United Party and the Progressive Party. They wanted one thing only and that was complete equality. Surely the hon. member could have told his constituency that before they drafted that item for discussion. After all, they wanted to consult the Indians, and there they have the opinion of the Indians.</p>

<p>On this secret agenda there appeared items for discussion from two other constituencies which asked for a national convention. I do not know whether they consulted the hon. member for Wynberg because he is an expert on this convention idea. What is this convention business? We have some experience of a mixed convention which was demanded last year. We know about the demand which was made upon the Government under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, who is probably still a fugitive to-day.</p>

<p>They ought to know where he is. A national convention was demanded on which all groups and races were to have representation and where the demand would have been made that there must be complete equality in this country. I say that the hon. member for Wynberg is an expert in this sphere. He knows a great deal about that national convention. Amongst other things he could have said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The demand for a multi-racial national convention should be heeded; it was wanted by all sections of the community and showed great stirrings in the nation which no Government should ignore.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg himself insists that convention be held, a convention at which there would be a demand, as foreshadowed. for complete equality.</p>

<p>No, but I shall tell the hon. member over there what they want to give in addition to that. Not only do they want to give the right to these agitators to come and sit in the House of Assembly eventually&#x2014;these people who have the ear of the outside world, these people who are lauded in the outside <span class="col_961-962" refersTo="page_497"/>world as the heroes of South Africa, these people to whom even a Nobel Prize is awarded, these people who are given banner headlines in the English-language Press in South Africa too&#x2014;the moment Luthuli or somebody who shares his views opens his mouth he is given banner headlines. These are the dangers which threaten us. These are the things that we must exterminate in this country.</p>

<p>I come now to a final argument advanced by the United Party. The hon. member for Drakensberg has just used the same argument again, and that is that the electorate knew nothing about this further development in our apartheid policy when they had to vote last year. Time does not permit me to quote many speeches made by the hon. the Prime Minister, but may I just mention a speech made by him on 20 May 1959 in this House, in which he not only announced this policy but emphasized it very strongly. May I refer just in passing to the speech which the hon. the Prime Minister made in the South Africa Club in London on 17 March last, where he once again stated the position very clearly. That speech, in pamphlet form, was placed in the hands of every office-bearer of the National Party of the Republic of South Africa. On 8 June of last year, too, the hon. the Prime Minister used these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we do not want discrimination, then there is only one way to achieve this object, and that is by separation. I know that hon. members will claim that we only say that for political purposes, and that we do not mean it; that we will not carry out this policy. Do hon. members still remember that they said the same thing to me at the time when we discussed our policy of Bantu homelands and when we advocated their development along their own lines?</block>

<p>It was old news as far back as last year already&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They said: You will never really dare to advocate nor will you dare to move in the direction of truly independent development of the Bantu&#x2019;s own areas.</block>

<p>Last year already the hon. the Prime Minister clearly pointed out out that members on the other side refused to believe it. He said that we had said so repeatedly but they refused to believe it. They think that it is nothing but talk and that we are not in earnest. The Prime Minister said that time and again. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I am sorry but I cannot congratulate the hon. member who has just sat down on his speech. His contribution this afternoon was more or less a nought. He made a number of allegations, not one of which he tried to prove and not one of which he could prove. He started off by saying&#x2014;he devoted so much time to it that his time eventually expired&#x2014;that the United Party stood for equality. He then quoted from a speech by the hon. the Prime Minister to prove that this Bantustan policy of theirs was nothing new. Had he read the whole of that speech he would have seen that in that very speech the hon. the Prime Minister really charged the United Party not with having a policy of equality but one of discrimination. How can you have discrimination and equality at the same time? Surely that is nonsense. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development got up in the Other Place and said that the United Party policy of White leadership with justice was a figment of the imagination, that the world would not allow any discrimination. In other words, the position is this that the most the hon. member could have said was that the United Party policy of discrimination with justice could not be carried out. But he should not say that the United Party policy is one of equality. He ought to know that is not the position. I do not think I need devote any more time to that hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Information quoted from a newspaper cutting this afternoon that I was supposed to have used the word &#x201C;kaffer&#x201D; at Sea Point. I got up immediately to correct him. I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that he was not quoting from a newspaper but from a political pamphlet, the <i>Burger.</i> We are used to the <i>Burger</i> not speaking the truth. I will give you a few examples, Sir. I am supposed to have made that speech at Sea Point. Various newspapers were present there. Only the <i>Burger</i> heard the word &#x201C;kaffer&#x201D;. I did not see the report but my electioneering agent telephoned me the following day&#x2014;I was not in Cape Town&#x2014;and told me what had appeared in the <i>Burger</i> and that he had written them a letter to tell them that the word &#x201C;kaffer&#x201D; had not been used. The <i>Burger</i> replied and said that they were sorry but they could not place the denial. I just want to say to the hon. the Minister that if in future he should complain about having been misrepresented overseas and he wrote letters to those newspapers in which he had been misrepresented and they told him that they could not publish his reply, he would know why. I want to tell him of another experience I had with the <i>Burger</i> and the manner in which they report. This happened during the referendum campaign. During that time I held a meeting at Hout Bay and there were two Union flags with a number of smaller ones that evening. The next day the following heading appeared in the <i>Burger</i>: &#x201C;Volop Union Jacks op Houtbaai by Jack Basson se Vergadering&#x201D; (Many Union Jacks at Hout Bay at Jack Basson&#x2019;s meeting). Usually I do not take any notice of distortions but I telephoned the <i>Burger</i> and told them that there was not a single Union Jack at that meeting. Some of the executive members of the Nationalist Party who had been at Hout Bay telephoned me by chance and I asked them to get in touch with the <i>Burger</i> as well. The <i>Burger</i> then placed a denial, hiding it away in an obscure corner, that any Union Jacks had been displayed and <span class="col_963-964" refersTo="page_498"/>said they were sorry for what had happened. Two or three days later I went to Springbok to address a meeting there and somebody got up and asked me why I had had so many Union Jacks at my meeting at Hout Bay. I then told him that allegation had been refuted in yesterday&#x2019;s newspaper; that the denial had been published and that it had been a mistake that had crept in. I then opened the newspaper of Thursday and although I read it with my own eyes, I could not find any denial in that particular newspaper, much to my surprise. I then discovered for the first time that the <i>Burger</i> published two kinds of <i>Burgers</i>&#x2014;one for overseas consumption and the other for consumption in Cape Town. It had been corrected in Cape Town but in Namaqualand, Springbok and other parts of the country they still believed that there were Union Jacks at the Hout Bay meeting. That is why I shall not pay much attention when that hon. Minister quotes to me from the <i>Burger.</i> In that constituency, that attractive constituency of Sea Point for which the hon. the Minister has such a special love&#x2014;they are all coming to live in my part of the world at a fairly reasonable price&#x2014;they dance all sorts of dances, the Rock &#x2019;n Roll and the one that they call the Twist. In Sea Point they call it the Frankie Waring Shuffle.</p>

<p>Not as well as the hon. member. He is swimming on dry land with this Bantustan policy of theirs, but he will nevertheless drown. I want to say this, Mr. Speaker, that I think most of us inside and outside this House are deeply and seriously concerned about the position in which South Africa finds herself today. [Interjections.] That hon. member says he is not worried. The whole spirit of the speech by the State President was one of worry and concern about the future. It is true, however, and I am sorry to have to say this, that since the salaries of Members of Parliament have been increased so much, it seems to me that they have all become followers of Epicurus and that their motto to-day is: Let us eat and drink because to-morrow we die. They are leading South Africa on the road to destruction. The White man is being led by them on the road to destruction and there is not a single Nationalist or any other person in this country to-day who feels happy about his own future and that of his wife and children. It is not as a result of anything else but as a result of this Government. The least they can say is that is the position to-day in spite of them. As a result of their policy South Africa is to-day faced with a future where not one of us on either side of the House can to-day say to our children: Within the next ten or 15 years you will be happy and safe in South Africa. It is sad to have to admit that but it is the truth. It is the same South Africa where a few years ago the word &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; was the open sesame to private homes and to the highest forums throughout the world.</p>

<p>If you study the political history of this country, Sir, you will find that it seems as though fate has decreed it that whenever we are in a critical period, the Nationalist Party has chosen the road that will lead the White man of this country to destruction. Fortunately on every such occasion the Almighty has called upon the United Party once again to govern South Africa before irreparable harm has been done. The hon. the Prime Minister and every Cabinet Minister have painted a picture to us; the Minister of Defence told us that we would have to fight until our horses stood up to their bridles in blood. That is the picture they have painted for us after 13 years of Nationalist Party rule. That is the hope they hold out to us; the child whom you have brought into this world, your child whom you have struggled to educate, is faced with a future where he will have to fight until his horse stands bridle deep in blood. That is the only hope we can hold out to our children.</p>

What we need in addition is that in this troubled world South Africa should have allies, strong Western allies.

<p>Some members can never be serious. The hon. member is going downhill. He realizes that he will probably not live much longer in South Africa but I and my children want to live here. If he is prepared to say that he will take as much as he can, that he will take the big salary for which he himself has voted and forget about posterity, he can do so, but we on this side will not do so. That is the spirit that those stupid interjections reveal. I repeat that the spirit with which the Government and the Nationalist Party have imbued the people of South Africa by means of their powerful political newspapers and by means of the radio which they use as a propaganda machine today, as Hitler used his radio, will render South Africa and the Nationalist Party the same service <span class="col_965-966" refersTo="page_499"/>as that rendered to Germany by the propaganda machine of Hitler. There is evidence to-day that during the last war the German Command realized in 1943 already that they could not win the war and that they tried to persuade Hitler to put an end to it. They tried a <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i> but they realized that would not help, because the spirit of the German people had been so conditioned that it would not have worked for any length of time. That is exactly what we have here to-day. By means of the schools, and having given it careful thought, I want to go so far as to say by means of the Church &#x2026;</p>

I am very sorry for them but that is the position. The Government comes forward with a policy which holds out no hope. All they say is that when the time arrives when the numerical strength of White and Black is such that the overwhelming majority is four against one in favour of the Black man, we should introduce this policy of Bantustans, a policy which offers no solution and holds out no hope. They have become afraid of the little snake that they themselves have nurtured. If it is true that the position has become untenable and that the numerical strength is too strong and they continue to increase as the number of non-Whites grows, we shall have exactly the same comparison in 50 years&#x2019; time. Will the answer again be Bantustans and will we again have to go through the same process, and will that have to continue until eventually the Minister of Finance and I will be the only two who are safely ensconced in Sea Point? No, a nation and a country do not become stronger by separating a portion of your people and by giving away portions of your land. It becomes weaker.</p>

<p>No, my time is running out. If that separation could be permanent and complete so that all the Bantu would be in those Bantu states, it would even be more dangerous but there would have been some justification for it and you could have said that offered a solution to some extent. But when the majority of citizens of those Bantu states have to live as strangers in the Republic of South Africa, you are creating trouble from which you will not be able to get away. May I just remind the Nationalist Party that we had a Boer War not only because of the rights of the so-called &#x201C;uitlanders&#x201D;&#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Middeland (Mr. P. S. van der Merwe) is the last person to talk. He is a foreigner born beyond the borders of the Republic. He is a Portuguese, born in Angola, and he came to this country by grace alone and he now abuses the hospitality that has been extended to him. [Laughter.] I said that what we were doing was to create a position in which we would have the biggest fifth column possible right within our midst, where our industries and our farming industry that has to produce our food, will be in the handls of foreigners.</p>

<p>But I want to come nearer to the Nationalist Party. I want to go back to 1939 when this Government tried to justify Hitler&#x2019;s attack on Poland. The Prime Minister who was editor of a Nationalist newspaper, said at the time that Hitler was quite justified in his actions because of the way in which the oppressed German minority were ill-treated in Sudeten-land, Austria and Poland. Do they for one moment think that another Hollander will not go to those Bantu areas to lead them and to tell them that when their people form the majority in a foreign country, they should not allow any discrimination against them? What does the Government do? They are not trying to solve our problem. They are trying to find a peg for the world outside on which it can hang its hat. That is all and that has failed. I now ask them this: In view of the fact that your attempt to mislead the world outside has failed, in view of the fact that you were prepared to take the risk &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member asks for how long? If the United Party came into power again the White people of this country will have one choice only.

What is the basis of their whole argument? Why will the Bantustans not be a danger? The hon. the Prime Minister has admitted that there were possible dangers connected to it, but, he said by implication, that he believed and hoped that the Bantu would always realize that it was the White man who had given him his independence and that being so he did not believe that the Bantu would become a danger. May I point out to the Prime Minister and the entire Nationalist Party that man is simply not made like that. Man is not always grateful. Gen. Hertzog said that England was the mother of our freedom. Shortly after the two republics had been conquered England gave South Africa her freedom and four years after the establishment of Union supporters of the Nationalist Party rebelled against England and shot the British, under what pretence? What makes them think that a Bantu is more decent than a Nationalist? What makes them think that the Bantu will not follow their example and shoot the White man who has given him his freedom?</p>

<p>No, I am not being mean. I say that as far as this Government and this country are concerned, I sometimes wish and hope that when they read their Bible they would read one of the most beautiful and true verses in the Bible. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration complained to-day and said that the United Party were not grateful for what was being given to the Bantu to-day. Let me tell him that there is a very beautiful verse in the Bible that says although you bestow all your goods to feed the poor and though you give your body to be burned, and have not charity, it will profiteth you nothing; the policy of this Government is not based on the principle of giving the Native and the Coloured their fair share of love. Their policy is based on the principle&#x2014;and that brings them votes&#x2014;of putting the Native and the Indian in their place. Not equality. One of their back-benchers said to-day that the United Party spoke about equality, but they do not do so; the only person who talks about equality is the Prime Minister. And why will he not gain by that? The more money they give, while the Bantu and the Coloured feel the way they do feel to-day, and the more goods they give to feed the poor will not profiteth them if they do not have the charity. When there is another change of Government in South Africa, I hope without any shooting, I hope that Government will make a statement to the affect that in spite of what this Government has done, the Republic of South Africa will once again become one unit; that every person in South Africa, whatever his colour may be, will once again be loyal to South Africa and not have to rebel against South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the swimming is concerned, our attitude is more or less this: Most decent people may swim there and if the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark wants to apply, it will be seriously considered whether or not to allow him. I say to the Coloured and the Native and the Indian and the White man that they can take this from me that as soon as the United Party come into power, they will once again be regarded as citizens of South Africa and although they may be of different colours and speak different languages, we shall demand from them that they have one common loyalty towards South Africa and that they do not commit high treason, but that they all pull in the South African harness to make South Africa a prosperous and safe country. That is why, where this Government has done much to cut South Africa into fragments, there is still hope. As the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) has said it is very essential that the political parties should once again think of what has happened here. The danger does not lie in the little that they have given the Native to-day. There is only one thing that is more dangerous than independent Bantustans, and that is to promise them independence and not to give it. No country in the world has ever been prepared or willing to wait for the date on which independence has been promised to it. All of them have always demanded it before that time. If the Government do not go further than they have already gone, order may yet be restored out of the chaos that they have brought about and I believe that there is only one answer and my hon. friend will agree with me that if they go further there will only be one answer, and that is a form of federation, albeit a race federation or a geographical federation. I believe that a race federation may still save the situation, but I want to say this: I hope there are still Nationalists whose love for South Africa is stronger than their love for the Nationalist Party. I believe there are still Nationalists in this House who will realize that once you have promised or given independence to those areas, no subsequent Government can withdraw that. We can safely carry out this experiment of the United Party and have Bantustans any time in the future, because Bantustans only mean the unconditional surrender of the White man to the Bantu. That you can do at any time. You can adopt the policy of the Liberal Party at any time and say &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; because that means unconditional surrender. But if you carry out any one of those two policies, either that of the Nationalist Party or that of their allies, the Liberal Party&#x2014;because they fall into the same category&#x2014;no future Government will be able to restore order from that chaos. That is why I trust that those hon. members who are laughing and carrying on in the way they are, when they are encouraged by their regional leaders, will, when they have <span class="col_969-970" refersTo="page_501"/>to erase that look of fear from their faces on the instructions of their group leaders, the Gestapo within their ranks &#x2026;</p>

<p>Speaker, I do not think one should take the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) too seriously. At most, one can compare him to a balloon. He inflated himself and then again deflated himself, and look at the hon. member now. If he feels the way he looks, he must feel very bad indeed after all the personal remarks he made. The hon. member told terrible stories about South Africa. If only he had added locusts and lice, it would have reminded me of the plagues of Egypt, but if the Egyptians and the Jews had just had the hon. member for Sea Point as the eleventh plague, one would really have heard them complaining!</p>

<p>He asked what country was prepared to be an ally of South Africa. The hon. member asks that after having taken part in the campaign of vilification against South Africa.</p>

<p>It just shows what harm he and his party have already done South Africa. If he reads the newspapers he will see that all those people who tried to escape what the future holds in store for South Africa by settling in Australia and elsewhere are returning one by one because they say that the peace which they foresee in South Africa cannot be found anywhere else in the world. [Interjections.] After having listened to the hon. members for Sea Point and Wynberg (Mr. Russell), and also to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), one can come to two conclusions only, namely the very deliberate attempt made by the United Party to keep its racial policy as dark as possible. Not one of them tried to cast any light on the position or to give any explanation of their own policy; on the other hand, one finds the obstinacy on the part of hon. members opposite in simply not even trying to understand the policy of the National Party. For years now our colour problems have practically predominated over all other problems in the country. We have fought and won one election after another on the strength of that, and what do we find in the House to-day? On the part of the voters and of members on this side of the House there is greater clarity to-day in regard to the policy of the United Party than there is amongst those hon. members themselves. What does the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) know about the policy of the United Party? At most, he knows as much about it as the hon. member for Sea Point, and that is hardly anything at all. What does the hon. member for Durban-Point (Mr. Raw) know about it? Why did he not tell us what the policy of the United Party is? But then they come here and try to kick up dust about our policy. Have you noticed, Sir, how the back-benchers of that party try to keep at a respectful distance from the policy of their party? They approach it very cautiously, but then seem to regard it as something sacred; they do not touch it, because if they do they will burn their fingers. The policy of the United Party has to-day become one which can be interpreted only by a small inner circle in that party, and one of the men who can still interpret it is the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), who is not here at the moment. Every year he acrobatically tries to evade the snares in the United Party policy, but even he does not succeed. What hope has the hon. member for Orange Grove, or the ordinary voter, of understanding or accepting the policy of that party if even the hon. member for Yeoville cannot do so? If not even the United Party members in this House can thoroughly understand that policy, how can the voters outside be expected to do so? All that the ordinary United Party member knows about their policy is the anthology of worn-out terms by means of which that policy is described from year to year in terms such as White leadership with justice, the moderate middle course, etc. The hon. member for Durban (Point) already knows that rhyme so well that he can recite it with his eyes closed. Every year we simply have a repetition of the arguments and metaphors used by them. This tune has been repeated so often that it is becoming monotonous and intolerable. It reminds me of the two tramps who lay down beneath a thorn bush and the one sang a song, &#x201C;Oh the locusts, the locusts&#x201D;, until the other one became annoyed and told him, &#x201C;Leave the locusts alone. If you have to sing, sing something else.&#x201D; Then there was a slight pause and again he started to sing, &#x201C;Oh the locusts,&#x201D; and when his friend asked what he was doing now, he said, &#x201C;No. it is another swarm of locusts <span class="col_971-972" refersTo="page_502"/>I am singing about now.&#x201D; It is still the same policy, but they just try to put it in a different form. The one year it is the Graaff Senate Plan and the next year it is White leadership with justice, but it is still the old story. It is high time for the United Party to use their imagination and develop their thinking powers. No wonder that the editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> accused them of being unable to think. I read what he wrote in February 1959&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Has the United Party lost the power of positive thought? Does it really believe that the answer to the problem of 1960 is the settlement of 1936?</block>

<p>He says that tens of thousands of United Party supporters are looking for new leadership&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">People with the listlessness of habit rather than the ardour of conviction hold them together.</block>

<p>And is it not true? [Interjections.] Yes, I thought the hon. member for Orange Grove would feel hurt now. Now I see the hon. member shaking his head. I have been told that one shakes a bottle to see whether it still contains anything. It is because that party cannot think and have lost confidence in itself that it carries on in this way. It sees no hope in its own policy any more. That is why it sought an ally in the person of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), who has just entered the Chamber. Sir, just imagine this position. The United Party wanted to seek light from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who himself stood holding in his hand a candle the flame of which had been extinguished in Namib. If things went so badly with me that I had to seek an alliance with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the position would be very serious indeed, and I think that is the case with the United Party. Or is it because the United Party saw a potential danger in the hon. member that it wanted to enter into an alliance with him, because they are frightened by every bush they pass. They were frightened of the National Party, and now they are afraid of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also and prefer to be his ally than to have him as an opponent. That reminds me of one of the cordon guards from the constituency of the hon. member for Sea Point who was sent to my constituency. He had never before seen a thorn-bush and they sent him to a place 150 miles from the nearest township and his fright increased, and when it started getting dark he grew alarmed and it seemed to him as if the bushes were coming nearer, and he then decided that in order to survive he would have to pray, which he did, but whilst he was busy praying a jackal cried out behind him and he said: &#x201C;O Father, and I am just as afraid of that thing which screams like that.&#x201D; The United Party is in the same position. It is afraid of every sound that it hears. That is why it entered into such an expensive alliance with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. The hon. member knows that he did not make the contribution towards that alliance which the United Party expected of him and one would have thought that he would be so ashamed that he would have pulled his hat over his eyes and said: &#x201C;You promised me a seat in the Senate, but seeing that I did not make my contribution you need not keep your promise.&#x201D; But he is so unashamed that he demands: &#x201C;Give me that seat,&#x201D; and now the United Party will have to make him a gift of a seat in the Senate.</p>

<p>There is no longer anything on earth of which the United Party is not afraid; it is afraid of practically everything, and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout unscrupulously abused the fear of the United Party. I do not mind if in its anxiety the United Party affords us some amusement, but what grieves one is that in the process of doing so they did their best to refuse to understand the policy of the Government. I refuse to believe that they cannot understand that policy which has been expounded so clearly that a child can understand it, as clearly as the Prime Minister explained it the other day. I refuse to believe that the United Party is incapable of understanding it. I refuse to believe that the hon. member for Wynberg cannot understand it, even though he looks so stupid. I refuse to believe that the hon. member for Orange Grove cannot understand it.</p>

<p>What they are doing now is to set up all kinds of bogies and then to say that this is the policy of the Government, and then they take all their courage in their hands and very courageously knock down those bogies again, and then they beat their breasts and say: This is how we have dealt with the policy of the National Party. They realize as well as we do that the policy of the National Party, in view of the developments in Africa, is the only one acceptable to both the Whites and the Blacks. But what do they do now? They go out of their way to tell the Bantu not to accept it. They try to tell him not to accept the policy which is the only thing which can save the White man in South Africa. It appears that they do not hate us because of our policy, but for ourselves. I find this phenomenon on the part of the United Party whilst the White man in South Africa stands in the last trench and we are in danger of losing our continued existence in Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to discuss the policy of the National Party. Suffice it to say that what we are granting to the Xhosa in the Transkei and hold out in prospect to the Bantu in South Africa in general is not one whit less than that which the American in America claims and the Jew in Israel claims, and what more do they want? What we want to give them is no more and no less than what we demand for ourselves, namely, the opportunity to live our own lives. The White man in South Africa has no feeling of guilt. We did not, as may be said <span class="col_973-974" refersTo="page_503"/>of other nations, destroy others in order to settle here. Our only sin in South Africa to-day is that we are in the minority, and we refuse to accept that being in the minority constitutes a sufficient moral basis for asking us to sacrifice ourselves.</p>

<p>But let us anlayse the race federation plan of the United Party. I shall indicate that not only is it unacceptable to the Whites because it knocks away from under their feet the only moral grounds they have to stand on, but it is also totally unacceptable to the Bantu. If it were acceptable to the one section, one could at least have pleaded mitigating circumstances, but in this case one cannot even do that. The United Party wants a race federation in South Africa&#x2014;a federation, a contract derived from the Latin word &#x201C;faedera&#x201D;. They want race relations in South Africa to be based on a contract, in this modern world in which Africa is demanding independence. Sir, I should like to see how those hon. members want to control race relations in South Africa by means of a contract. It is a complete fallacy. There is no race federation to-day throughout the whole world, and in this 20th century in which we are living, the age of Africa, it is completely inconceivable. It is not worth the paper it is written on. We find a federation in an inflexible constitution where nothing is sovereign except that written constitution. Neither the President of America, nor the White House, nor the Governor of any of the states, nor the local legislative bodies, nor the court, is sovereign in America. An amendment can only be made if two-thirds of the states in America ask for a change and three-quarters approve of it. This race federation plan is based on a contract, but it already contains the germ of racial discrimination. In America we, e.g. have the position that in New York, with a population 200 times as great as that of Nevada, has equal representation in the American Senate. Where the discrimination is, however, on a racial basis, as the United Party wants to have it here, the constitution will soon be violated; no discrimination will be tolerated. Nothing will be able to stand in the way of the demands in Africa for the franchise for the masses, and such a constitution is not worth the paper it is written on. The Black man in Africa expects and demands not only partnership&#x2014;whether it is a federation or a union&#x2014;but what he expects and demands is simply full independence, and that is what the chairman of the African Movement says. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We stand for the complete overthrow of White domination. That means that the South Africa Act of 1909, that fossilized relic of the White man&#x2019;s exclusive privileges and prejudices, must be scrapped.</block>

<p>That is what he demands.</p>

<p>The United Party propounds this plan of federation because it hopes that the Bantu of South Africa will accept that plan, but it completely misses the target. That is not the position. Not even the moderate Bantu element is satisfied with the policy of the United Party. I will read what was said by one of the so-called moderate Bantu, no less a person than Albert Luthuli, who is so highly regarded by that side of the House. I am quoting from <i>New Age,</i> and this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the face of it there seems very little difference between the Nationalists&#x2019; policy and that of the United Party. Racial domination, whether it is caused by baasskap or White leadership, is fundamentally unacceptable to Congress. It might be said that the Nationalists murder you most ruthlessly, while the United Party tries to poison you slowly.</block>

<p>They merely think that the National Party wants to go faster, but they are not prepared for a moment to accept the policy of the United Party. This is what Albert Luthuli, the man who received the Nobel Peace Prize, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party&#x2019;s &#x201C;new look&#x201D; policy regarding political and other rights for the non-White people is most disappointing. We are not to be bluffed or fobbed off by any version of the archaic 1936 Smuts-Hertzog &#x201C;Native&#x201D; legislation, or attempts to present dud forms of &#x201C;representation&#x201D; in Parliament as a substitute for democracy. We shall not be side-tracked by schemes for creating a privileged African middle class whose intention is to leave the masses leaderless.</block>

<p>What he demands is simply the vote for the masses and not one iota less. That is what the moderate element among the Bantu say to-day about the United Party. What do the agitators say? What does Mandeloa say? No, when we have to work out the pattern of future race relations in South Africa, we must take these demands into consideration, and that the only moral standpoint against the demands of Black Africa which at the same time affords protection to the Whites, is that of the National Party. If the standpoint and policy of the National Party fails, we will have a Black Government in this country. Therefore I say to-day that the alternative Government in South Africa is not the party opposite, nor the Progressive Party; the alternative Government is a Black Government.</p>

<p>It is not only the Whites who will have to pack up if the system of Bantu homelands fails. What will happen to the minority of Indians and of Coloureds? They will travel with us in the same boat, because democracy, as seen by Africa, is based on the principle of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, It does not matter how illiterate that person is, and the Coloureds and the Indians who are in the minority in South Africa to-day, in the potpourri the United Party wants in South Africa, will simply have to travel with us in that boat. <b>I</b> do not only fear for those minority groups, but I even fear for the ethnic groups which are in the minority in South Africa to-day. <span class="col_975-976" refersTo="page_504"/>What will happen, e.g., to the Hereros in South West if that territory is to be given independence? There we have an Herero population of 32,000, as against more than 300,000 Ovambos. Do you think that they will be able to retain any share in the administration of the country? No, not in the least. The division on a tribal basis between the Bantu tribes in South Africa and in Africa is as strong to-day as ever before. I want to read what happens in Kenya. I have here a Sapa-Reuter report from London, which appeared in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger.</i> It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The outlines of the struggle are already clear. Ronald Ngalan&#x2019;s ruling Kenya African Democratic Union (K.A.D.U.) is afraid of an independent Kenya which will be dominated by the Kikuyu tribe, which is in the majority, and its ally, the Luo tribe. The Kenya African National Union (K.A.N.U.) led by Kenyetta, a Kikuyu, and Tom Mboya, a Luo, press just as strongly for a strong unified government and condem a &#x201C;division&#x201D; of the country. Threats of tribal wars have been made in recent speeches by leaders of the Masai and other tribes which support the Government Party. Tribesmen have been requested to sharpen their assegais and poison their arrows in preparation for the battle if Britain should reject the plan of K.A.D.U.</block>

<p>But that shows again that you cannot say that if the Bantu as a whole should take over control of this country there will then be peace. No, we have already had that position in South West Africa. Between 1830 and 1890, before the White man came to make peace there, 60 golden years passed, and in those 60 years there were no fewer than 57 wars between those Bantu tribes of South West; the position was so bad that the 55 Herero and Mbanderu tribes came to ask the Cape Government for protection in order to bring peace to their country. Can we abide by that, or do we have a responsibility towards the non-Whites and the other non-White minorities in South Africa? I say that the Whites who to-day are the guardians of the Blacks have a responsibility not only towards themselves, not only towards the minorities, the Coloureds and the Indians, but they also have a responsibility towards the other Bantu groups who are in the minority. The United Party will say: Let us surrender; what can we do about it? We have already had the experience of what happened to the so-called democracy which the United Party envisages in South Africa. We have already had experience of it in the Black states of Africa. What happened to them? I want to quote from a Sapa-Reuter report from Brazzaville, which summarizes the position of the other Black African states in regard to democracy, because I say that if those independent Black states which will eventually predominate over the Whites if the United Party policy is to triumph in South Africa, then we will be in the same position in which other Black countries in Africa find themselves, namely the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Liberia, which boasts of its similarity to America, has now for years already been a a one-party state with Pres. William Tubman as the head of state. In Guinea, which became independent last year, the Prime Minister, Seko Tour&#x00E9;, openly says that Parliament is simply there to confirm the decisions of his Democratic Guinea Party. In Cameroon, which will become independent on 1 January, about 50 people are already in prison. In Central Congo the opposition leader, Jacques Opangault, has also been in prison. Ghana is practically to-day the one party-possession of the Prime Minister, Kwame Nkrumah.</block>

<p>Then I have here a report which appeared in the <i>Burger</i> of 23 January&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An international movement which propagates freedom of speech and religion alleges that no fewer than 200 Ghanaian citizens have been thrown into gaol in terms of the Preventive Arrests Act of 1958. Their only crime was that they opposed the Government. That is the type of democracy we will have in South Africa if the policy of the United Party is accepted.</block>

<p>We in South Africa have only one solution to our racial problem, the solution of territorial segregation which is as old as the nations themselves. That is how France and Germany and Holland and Belgium and Luxemburg and Britain and Western Europe received their final form. That is the way in which the greatest problems of the present century were solved. That is how peace came about in Pakistan, when there were clearly demarcated borders between Pakistan and Bahrat. That is how peace was obtained between the Jews and the Arabs in Israel, when the Jew was given his area in Israel and the Arab his in Jordania. This development has taken place under the guidance of UN itself. The policy of race discrimination and race federation will of course be acceptable to UN. but only in so far as it enables the Black man in South Africa to enforce his idea of democracy, on the White man. I say it is either territorial separation in South Africa or the end of White civilization here. South Africa now has the opportunity to make that choice and I repeat that the demands made by the Bantu of the United Party are not to be ignored; they are demands which should be borne in mind. In the <i>Burger</i> of 12 December 1961, are seen the demands which were made by Luthuli, the great peace-maker. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Black people of Africa will be satisfied with nothing less politically than the direct vote for every adult and the right to be elected to every governmental body. As far as these principles are concerned, there can be no compromise.</block>

<p>That is what Luthuli says. Therefore I say&#x2014; and I wish to conclude on this note&#x2014;that we in South Africa are to-day faced with a serious <span class="col_977-978" refersTo="page_505"/>choice we have to make, not for the sake of the preservation of the White man in South Africa, but also for the sake of the minorities here, and it is a pity that we have in our midst a party like the United Party which wants to disguise these important political problems so that the ordinary voter in the country cannot get a clear picture of the problems confronting him. Such a party, I say, deserves nothing else but that it should be destroyed to its very roots.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland (Mr. P. S. v. d.

He indicated that France and Germany and Holland and Luxemborg were all independent countries and he made the same plea for independence for the races in this country.

<p>We have had the effort of the Minister of Information here this afternoon. I do not think he can be proud of his first speech in that capacity. We were looking forward to a speech dealing with his portfolio and we do not think that is an example which he would like to follow in future. The less we say about the speech of the hon. member for Winburg (Mr. Sadie) the better. But I want to come now to the hon. member for Hercules (Dr. A. I. Malan). The other night the hon. member for Hercules, in his private capacity, criticized the Building Societies by inference, and said that it was unfortunate that the Building Societies did not follow the lead of the Banks. Sir, one would not think so, but we are dealing this afternoon with a financial measure, and I hope that the Minister will deal with this matter in his reply. The Minister will have ample time to reply to this. The hon. member for Hercules suggested by inference that the Building Societies were not following the example of the Banks. I would like the Minister to tell us in his reply whether he agrees with the hon. member for Hercules that the Building Societies should follow the Banks in reducing their rates. Does he not think that the time has arrived to bring about a further reduction of the bank rate? Call money rates are tending to fall under pressure, and the bill rates dropped from 4.07 in December to 3.84 at the beginning of February, and the long-term gilt-edged market is not still in the position of bare balancing, as was suggested by Dr. de Kock of the Reserve Bank last December. At existing rates there are more lenders than borrowers and yields on preference shares have been brought down to 6.5 per cent, if one can get them. The Minister of Finance is the custodian of the public purse and we look to him to give us a lead in financial matters. One knows that it is unusual for any Parliamentarian to get time on the South African Broadcasting Corporation, but when a person holding the position of Chairman of one of our leading commercial banks criticize Building Societies, an institution which also gets guidance from or is in consultation with the Minister of Finance, one is entitled to ask the Minister of Finance whether he agrees with that advice, and if he does not agree with the advice, what his attitude is, and, if he does agree with the advice, what he intends to do. There are two points. Firstly, does the Minister agree that the Building Societies should be encouraged to reduce their rates both for lenders and for borrowers, and, secondly, does the Minister not agree that the time has come for the banks to reduce their rates. The effect will be to encourage building if the Building Societies reduce their rates, and, as the Minister knows, the building industry is in the doldrums at the moment and a reduction of rates might have the effect of encouraging building and helping the unemployment position. Secondly, if there is a reduction of rates, it might help to boost activity and trade generally as a prelude to the Minister&#x2019;s budget which might not have the same effect. I hope that the Minister will use this opportunity to indicate what his attitude is to the suggestion made recently in a broadcast by a person who speaks with responsibility.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is almost farcical to expect me to reply to this debate. This debate is supposed to be a financial one, but only in the last moments of this debate, during the last three minutes of a debate which lasted three hours, did we find the first and the only financial point raised here. I shall, as I usually do, reply to all the questions, even though there were few of them.</p>

<p><span class="col_979-980" refersTo="page_506"/>The first thing the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) wants to know is whether the time has not arrived to have a further reduction in the bank rate. The bank rate was reduced in the beginning of December. Any matter in regard to lowering the bank rate is in the first instance the function of the Reserve Bank, even though the Reserve Bank always consults the Treasury. Hitherto&#x2014;and I quite agree with him&#x2014;they have seen no reason for reducing the bank rate further again within three months. It is a complicated matter. Hon. members can hardly expect me to give a lecture here on the subject, but I just want to give the assurance that the Reserve Bank has not yet felt&#x2014;and I share their standpoint&#x2014;that the time has arrived for a further lowering of the bank rate.</p>

<p>The other question put by the hon. member was whether the building societies should not also reduce their rates of interest in the same way that the banks did when the Reserve Bank lowered the bank rate in December. I know that many bankers feel this ought to be done. I also know that many members of building societies feel that it should not happen. In the financial sphere there is not always the best co-operation between the various financial institutions, and because I would like to have it we are at the moment having the question of the relations between the various financial institutions investigated by a Committee of the Treasury and of the Reserve Bank. At the moment I can only say that I cannot blame any person who thinks that the rates of interest of the building societies should also fall in line with the rates the banks have to follow. Everybody is entitled to his own opinion. I think this is one of those matters where much can be said for both points of view. We know that the argument of the building societies is that they have not yet amassed sufficient funds to perform the necessary functions of their business, and therefore they cannot afford&#x2014;that is their argument&#x2014;to reduce their rates of interest now. But I am not here to act as the arbiter now. We must first see what the position is there. I want to congratulate the hon. member for Pinetown very heartily on having saved the debate and having given me the opportunity to reply to something.</p>

<p>The other arguments advanced here gave me the impression that it is the second team which has been batting to-day. They still batted on the same pitch we had during the second reading, but if I have regard to the standard of the contributions we heard from the other side again, it really seems to me that it is not the first team which was batting to-day. The hon member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) evidently acted as the captain to-day, but I really do not know whether I can congratulate him. In any case he made my thoughts turn back to the scholars of the middle ages. Having seen how he put up ninepins here, ninepins of his own creation, and then took great delight in knocking them down, and having seen how he stretched words as far as possible and burdened them with meanings which those words cannot really carry, and if I think of the zeal with which he did this exercise, it really reminds me of the arguments carried on in mediaeval times as to how many angels could actually point on the point of a needle. It was the kind of complicated cleverness which existed in the Middle Ages. I just want to touch on one point he raised. I just want to tell him that it is not apartheid as such which is irrevocable. The point made is that the granting of self-government, the eventual granting of freedom, is irrevocable. I reminded hon. members of the words of Chief Justice Stratford when the argument was advanced that the Statute of Westminster was an Act of the British Parliament and therefore it could be repealed by the British Parliament. With reference to that argument, Judge Stratford used the words: &#x201C;Freedom once conferred cannot be revoked&#x201D;. Even the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) said here that if one promises freedom to these people, one must keep one&#x2019;s word. Then it is irrevocable not only from the ethical, the moral standpoint, but also from a legal standpoint.</p>

<p>The second person who went in to bat today was the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). I must say that I was very impressed by the enthusiasm with which she tried to defend impossible propositions here. She said with almost a sob in her voice that what we are asked to do here is to sacrifice everything which is dear to us. I wonder whether she was here when the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) spoke, because he clearly said that it was no sacrifice, that it was merely a bluff, and that it was perhaps the greatest bluff of all. Just imagine coming here and saying that what we are giving is the greatest bluff there ever was! The hon. member also sang the Jeremiads of agriculture. She told us in what a deplorable state agriculture in South Africa found itself. I want to give her only two figures which I get from the Survey of Contemporary Economic Conditions and Prospects for 1962, published by the Bureau for Economic Research. In this publication they say that the latest figures available to them, namely for 1959/60, show that whilst the general increase in the gross income of the country was 7 per cent, the increase in the agricultural sector was 9 per cent. In other words, the increase for which agriculture was responsible was above the average for the whole country. It is clear also from the other figures they give that in that last year for which they have figures available, the gross income from agriculture was between R20,000,000 and R30,000,000 more than in the previous year. When listening to the speech of the hon. member one would have thought that agriculture is on its last legs, but if one has regard to the facts and the figures and sees what the opinion is of responsible people, of experts, then fortunately for us the picture is not quite as sorry as the one painted by the hon. member.</p>

<p>In this debate we have again had the same old arguments and I will be forgiven if I do <span class="col_981-982" refersTo="page_507"/>not even use all my time. It is quite unnecessary to do so. We have again had the same arguments, of hon. members opposite but they have been effectively replied to by hon. members on our side of the House who took part in the debate. I just want to say that the pattern still remains the same. There has been no criticism at all of any Government Department except in respect of the Bantu homelands and the granting of self-rule to the Transkei. That was the only point of criticism. Seeing that the hon. the Minister in the main was not attacked, he himself had to make a sortie.</p>

<p>The other point which was also raised here again are the bogies which hon. members opposite continually set up. The idea is that we should now get gooseflesh, that we should become afraid of what we have done, and they also want to try to frighten our supporters, However, I think that is an impossible task. We again had the old doubt about the irrevocability of the step we have taken. I want to associate myself with what was said there, namely that even though another Government comes into power they will not be able to restore the position, and I also want to agree with what Judge Stratford said, that freedom once given cannot be revoked. Even another Government will not be able to turn back on that road. Whilst it still happens in one&#x2019;s own state, one can give rights and take them away from sections of the people from time to time, but when once one has given any section the liberty to break away, the position is irrevocable. Therefore, not for the sake of the National Party but for the sake of South Africa, I want to repeat that our hon. friends opposite should accept this fact, namely that this freedom which is being envisaged here is irrevocable, and that they and we should now co-operate to determine the tempo at which the Bantu in the Transkei are to develop from self-government to independence. On that point, if I understand the arguments correctly, they will probably stand very near to us. We cannot take these rights away again, but we can together with them, not for our sake but for the sake of South Africa as a whole and also for the sake of the Bantu, together ensure that we do not repeat the fiasco of the Congo by giving too much too soon to the Bantu of the Transkei.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill aims at amending the Births, Marriages and Deaths Registration Act of 1923. The amendments really deal only with deaths, and they affect Section 15, 21 and 27 of the existing Act. Section 15 is affected in this sense, that a district registrar or an assistant district registrar of births and deaths may issue an order for the burial within his district of the body of a deceased person who died outside his district. Section 21 again affects it in the sense that notice must be given to the district registrar or the assistant district registrar of births and deaths of the death of any person occurring in his district Thereupon the district registrar or his assistant has to issue an order authorizing the burial of the deceased within his district. It is provided in Section 27 that if the burial of the deceased does not take place in the municipal area in which the death occurred, a removal order must be obtained from the district registrar in whose district the death occurred or from his assistant for the removal of the body. Further it is provided in these sections that if either of those officials, the district registrar or his assistant, is not available at certain times before and after office hours and perhaps on holidays or Sundays, any police officer in charge of a police station or in charge of a police mortuary, or a police official of the rank of sergeant or higher, in command of a charge office, may issue such an order in the three cases I have mentioned here (in terms of the three sections of the existing Act) when he considers it necessary to do so in order to avoid delay and inconvenience. Such officer must inform the district registrar concerned, or his assistant, as soon as possible after the issue of such an order and in writing. It now appears that the Commissioner of Police reports that when constables, particularly on Sundays and holidays when there is not so much work and the station commander is not in the office, are in control of charge offices, the public at present, as the result of this arrangement, is not able to obtain the necessary burial orders or orders for the removal of the bodies. This state of affairs, as hon. members will realize, causes much sorrow and inconvenience to the bereaved. Now the House is being asked to amend it in order to obviate the inconvenience and delay, and the amendment is to the effect that the power to issue burial orders and orders for the removal of bodies should be granted not only to officers in command of a charge office with at least the rank of sergeant but also to constables in command of charge offices. In the Other Place objection was raised to the effect that this might lead to injudicious action. I immediately sent a telex message to the Commissioner of Police to ensure that proper regulations would be drafted which would give proper guidance to these constables who under such circumstances will be in command of charge offices, and I have received the assurance that this is now being done. The position therefore now is that if the police consider that a person is capable of being in charge of an <span class="col_983-984" refersTo="page_508"/>office and of doing the other work there, we can take it that he is also capable of authorizing the removal of bodies.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill is the first sign of the tremendous growth and progress we have had within the Republic. If you find that your archives and your system of documentation which reflects your present and past history are expanding and you find that improvements have to be effected, it is something to gladden your heart; it gladdens your heart to see how the country has developed and what has been achieved. As a result of the growth that has taken place since the Second World War the State has also had to undertake more work. Documentation in various fields has increased tremendously and has placed a bigger and more oneous burden on those in control of our archives. It has, therefore, become necessary to extend the scope of the 1953 Archives Act and to amend it to meet the needs of the development that has taken place.</p>

<p>This Bill proposes that one Minister shall be charged with the custody and care of archives. In the past various ministers have been charged with the custody and care of archives but it has become apparent that responsibility can be passed on if it does not rest on the shoulders of one person alone. Particularly from the point of view of control measures, also in respect of this place, it is essential that the responsibility should be placed on the shoulders of one Minister. In referring to archives I am not only referring to archive depots, but I am referring to all documents in Government offices and offices of local authorities, all documents that, in the course of time, are received or created in a Government office or an office of a local authority. So as to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to emphasize that the Minister is only charged with the custody and care of archives in Government offices. The other aspects of documentation in Government offices are not affected and are being left as they are at the moment. It is only a question of the custody and care of archives.</p>

<p>As hon. members know that the majority of archives when they are 30 years old find their way into the archive depots where they are taken into custody and cared for and it is essential that we extend this function of exercising control over that custody and care and to start with Government offices because the Archivists are experts in this field, and if this function is extended to include Government offices it will mean a great saving in expenditure because it has become evident in practice that documents have been damaged and neglected on a very large scale.</p>

<p>There is a new provision in this Bill that is closely linked with the provision that I have just explained to the House, and that the power that we are giving the Minister to establish intermediate depots under Clause 5 (c), that is to say, places between Government offices and archive depots where archives will be kept in custody. We are adopting this new course because it will mean a very great saving on present-day expenditure on filing and controlling of archives in Government offices. Hon. members know that Government offices where the documents have to be cared for are as a rule very expensive buildings, particularly in our capital cities. The rental that you have to pay for space is very high and because of that we are introducing this system of intermediate depots which is much more economical. It has come to light that Government offices keep documents although they very seldom refer to many of them. If they could be removed from those expensive offices and kept in these intermediate depots to which Government offices will have access when necessary, it will mean a great saving to us. Furthermore, it will also bring about a saving in that less staff will be required for these intermediate depots and because the staff is smaller it will mean a saving in salaries.</p>

<p>An important fact is that this Bill also makes provision for the custody of archives belonging to local authorities. To enable us to exercise proper control over the archives of local authorities it has become very necessary that we adopt this new course. We are getting nearer and nearer to the stage where some of our towns are getting 100 years, 150 years and 200 years old and it has already been found that when the local history of a town or of a city has to be recorded, much of the important data that could have been obtained from archives, is completely missing, with the result that it is difficult to give a true reflection of the history of such a town. We know how that is being done at the moment. The provincial administrations are the bodies that keep copies of important documents and the originals are kept by the local bodies themselves. We now want to hold the provincial administration responsible for the originals as well. By means of this Bill we will therefore <span class="col_985-986" refersTo="page_509"/>ensure that better control is exercised over the custody and care of those documents.</p>

<p>This Bill also contains a provision in respect of the designation of the chief archivist. He will in future be called director. This is to fall into line with the general trend in the world to-day, namely to give this person a higher status, although not necessarily a higher salary. We merely wish to give him the correct title in view of the important task that he performs.</p>

<p>There is also an exemption clause in this Bill because it has been found that some legal documents have found their way from magistrates&#x2019; court offices to the archive depots, documents that should really have been destroyed in the magistrates&#x2019; courts and should never have found their way into court records. I refer to civil cases that have been settled out of court. You can do what you want to but the possibility exists that some of those documents will give rise to actions for damages because they should really never have been there, and the person who uses them and the Government itself who keeps them in custody may become involved in an action for damages. They are being destroyed as far as possible. But some such undesirable document may creep in and for that reason we have to indemnify and protect the Government. These documents are of no value whatsoever to the legal profession or as far as research work is concerned.</p>

<p>This Bill also contains an important amendment in respect of access to archives. Hitherto after the expiration of a year archives have been accessible for another year but that procedure has been found unsatisfactory, because there may be documents in one file that should really not be made accessible as yet and then such a file must be half closed or partly closed and research workers do not always observe that condition and often tamper with the section that is closed. The precautionary measure that we are now taking is rather to make a file accessible for a further period of five years, every five years. This means that there will be fewer files of which some portion is closed and after every five years the department can open up a new set of files, and those portions that have been disposed of, can then be properly used. For the rest a number of sections are clarified and there are a few minor amendments. If it is found necessary to go into those at the Committee Stage, I shall be pleased to reply to questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first instance I think that I would be neglecting my duty if I did not congratulate the hon. the Minister on his appointment as Minister of Education. He was a member of the teaching profession for many years. He is aware therefore of the needs of education and of the teachers. He is familiar with the science of education and we expect a great deal from him in this connection. He placed his case before us to-day in a succinct, scientific, thorough and objective manner, which is the proper thing to do in dealing with such a Bill. I want to say to him at the very outset that in principle this side of the House has no objection to this Bill. I propose to deal with a few aspects of the Bill and to put certain questions to the hon. the Minister with regard to certain clauses or matters, and whether we are going to move amendments in the Committee Stage or not will depend on his replies.</p>

<p>My hon. friend is so taken up with our new form of government that he acted rather hastily in saying that we are bringing about these changes to our Archives Act of 1953 so as to indicate the tremendous growth of the Republic! My hon. friend has overlooked the fact that our first Archives Act was placed on the Statute Book as far back as 1922, and although our country has developed enormously since that date, we failed for many years to adapt ourselves by means of legislation to this new development or growth. It soon became evident after 1922 that changes would have to be brought about. Circumstances&#x2014;I think the war certainly had something to do with that &#x2014;prevented us from bringing about any changes, changes which would be more embracing, which would or could embrace the development of our history to a greater extent and meet that development. Our universities, for example, have developed and expanded in an unprecedented way since those days. Many more universities have come into being or have been established, due entirely to the fact that more degrees have been awarded, that we have had more advanced education in the universities since 1922, that more students have enrolled for the higher or more advanced degrees which necessarily entails or requires research. Nevertheless we waited until 1953 until we proceeded to place an improved and more comprehensive Bill on the Statute Book, that is to say, to make the provisions of the Act of 1922 in connection with our archives more embracing and more thorough. In that debate in 1953 various suggestions were put forward, and in reading that debate one notices that well-considered, thorough and very sound suggestions were made, to which I shall come back later on, by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) particularly, and I hope he will forgive me for mentioning his name. I am pleased to see that the hon. the Minister realized so soon after 1953 that some of those suggestions put forward by the hon. member should be accepted in this new Bill. It shows that he approaches this matter objectively. and scientifically and that he will be willing to accept good suggestions, and that criticisms and suggestions from this side will not fall on barren soil.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has not cut up the Act of 1952 by introducing an amendment here and an amendment there, by inserting new provisions and omitting other provisions, but that he has come forward with an entirely new Bill with amendments, of course, but a <span class="col_987-988" refersTo="page_510"/>Bill which is and will be of much greater value to the student and to us in this House than a measure which has been subjected to the cutting-up process that we so frequently follow in this Parliament.</p>

<p>As my hon. friend has said, this Bill makes provision for two or three very important changes. He talks about the depots or interim places of custody for our archives. If ever anything was essential in South Africa it is these depots or interim places of custody. Whereas in the past certain documents were destroyed, very often because the offices had become too small or because the official did not have the necessary knowledge as to what was historically important in a document, we now have the convenience and advantage of these interim places of custody. The Minister has now brought the designation of the Chief Archivist more into line with the modern trend by calling him the Director of Archives.</p>

<p>Because the Minister has realized, and perhaps also become afraid, that documents in our offices may become lost, but also because he realizes that in these files there may be documents which can be misused by research workers, he has also brought about another change and improvement. Mr. Speaker, I want to admit at once that not everybody who goes to the archives goes there purely to do scientific research. Very often people go there to try to make political capital or to try to determine a certain trend, and although a certain document may still be closed to us it is only human nature to use that information in some way or another. I am pleased therefore that he has made this period for the closing of the files five years, thus reducing the possibility of misuse.</p>

<p>I should like now to refer the hon. the Minister to Clause 4 and put a few questions to him in that connection. Clause 4 makes provision for a board of at least seven members. I should like to hear from him who the present seven members are; secondly, who appoints the chairman and, thirdly, how frequently they have met during the past year or two to perform their functions? Then I also notice that in the Other Place the Minister accepted a suggestion from the Opposition, one with which unfortunately I cannot agree. I agreed with the explanation which the hon. the Minister gave there. He pointed out, quite correctly, that the Opposition had not read this clause correctly and you will forgive me, Mr. Speaker, if I read this clause correctly now. I refer to Clause 3 (f)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; may, on the application of any person (and on payment of the prescribed fee), do any research into any archives or accessions and make copies thereof or extracts therefrom for such person.</block>

<p>The Minister has accepted a suggestion made in the Other Place and has omitted the words &#x201C;on payment of the prescribed fee&#x201D;.</p>

<p>May I just explain the position? The Senate has no right to discuss financial matters. That is why this portion could not be accepted by the Senate, but it will remain in the Bill as passed by this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, then I am perfectly satisfied. I had forgotten that provision for the moment. In other words, the Bill remains as it was submitted to this House originally. If these words do not remain in the Bill, the officials will be so inundated with applications that they will be able to do no other work.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to Clause 12 on page 8. There the word &#x201C;wilfully&#x201D; is used: &#x201C;Any person who wilfully damages any archives or accessions, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding R200&#x201D;. As far as I am concerned, the Minister could make it R500, because anybody who wilfully destroys one of our treasures in our archives should be punished severely. That is why I am pleased to see that provision is made in a subsequent clause for the Minister to be able to prevent such a person from attending our archives again or from being admitted to our archives. But I am wondering about the use of the words &#x201C;wilfully&#x201D; and &#x201C;negligent&#x201D;. Many documents in our archives have already been thrown away or carried away with other papers as the result of negligence, or a page has been torn out or something has been erased, etc., as the result of negligence. I wonder whether my hon. friend should not insert the words &#x201C;wilfully or negligently&#x201D; there. He can reply and then we shall see.</p>

<p>As somebody who has had something to do with research and with investigations, I am able to say that there are still many hundreds, if not thousands, of very important documents and letters, etc. in the hands of our people. But that does not only apply to private individuals. I have in mind my own case. If I had to die to-morrow, valuable documents would be destroyed in my office, unless somebody knew that they were valuable. Here I want to make a suggestion. There are hundreds of others in the same position who have such documents or portraits of great value to the history of South Africa and to our descendants, and I feel that steps should be taken to see that they are not destroyed. Hundreds of those documents are destroyed annually, not deliberately but because our people do not realize the value of those valuable documents in their possession. I am thinking of our churches, for example: I am thinking of the attics of our old magisterial offices. I wish I could give you some idea of the number of most valuable documents that I came across in an attic, covered thickly in dust, dealing with the old Klip River Republic. There are valuable documents lying there which are being ruined. The same applies to our churches. In the church offices and archives one finds <span class="col_989-990" refersTo="page_511"/>the minutes of the church. I wonder, for example, how much we would have known about the celebrations at Blood River if we had not gained that knowledge from the minutes of the Utrecht church. There are many other churches where there are valuable documents which ought to be traced.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. What about the political parties as from 1910? Has the time not arrived for the archivist to see whether it is not possible to get hold of the documents of our political parties? Mr. Speaker, a portion of the history of South Africa is to be found in the history of the political parties. There is nothing of which we need be afraid.</p>

<p>Are you sure?</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>It is part of our history. Perhaps my hon. friend over there knows that better than I do. But I am sure that there is nothing in the documents of my side of which I need be afraid. That is just a suggestion. The Minister realizes the value of what I am saying here because he himself is suggesting that we should appoint archivists attached to our Departments to see that valuable documents are not lost. I think that not only is it necessary that we should get the local authorities to do this or that we should get the Departments to do this, but I think it is necessary, as the hon. member for Turffontein advocated in 1953, that we should also get semi-Government Departments to do so. That is why I suggest the appointment of a travelling archivist, somebody whose duty it would be to trace these documents, to trace the documents which are in the hands of people like Mr. de Klerk, Dr. van Nierop, Gray Hughes or myself, so that, while not compelling those people to hand over those documents, we can at least urge upon them that there is only one place for such documents, and that is in the Archives building.</p>

<p>Finally I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether we have the necessary modern archives buildings. We must have modern buildings. We must have buildings which are not only big enough but which are convenient enough for convenient research. I can recall the days in Pietermaritzburg when the archives there were in a critical condition and how pleasant conditions were after the erection of the new building. That building too has already become antiquated and too small. What about the Union Archives, what about the Archives in Cape Town? The Archives here are far too small and it is high time we built Archives of which South Africa can be proud. Apart from that, we want places where all our public records can be properly preserved and where it will be possible for research workers to do their research in comfort.</p>

<p>These are just a few suggestions that I want to put forward, but I want to say again that we on this side are grateful to the Minister for having introduced this Bill. We shall help him, as far as it lies within our power, to keep our public record system far above politics and we know that he will help us in that regard. We shall help him too if he puts forward any suggestion to place our archives on a sound footing.</p>

<p>It is a long time since I last heard anybody praising a Bill and the deeds of a Minister so much as the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) has just done. In the beginning he said that he supported the principle of the Bill. We were very glad to hear that. He then continued to advance a few minor arguments, with which I shall deal later. At this stage I should like to move&#x2014;</p>
