<heading>NATIONAL EDUCATION COUNCIL BILL</heading>

<p><i>Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s Ruling</i></p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have now had an opportunity of considering the arguments adduced by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), the hon. member for Durban (Musgrave) (Mr. Hourquebie) and the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), in connection with the point of order raised on Wednesday last as to whether in view of the provisions of Clause 8 of the National Education Council Bill and the provisions of Section 114 of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961, it was competent for this House to consider and pass the National Education Council Bill, in the absence of a petition from the provincial councils of the Republic requesting such legislation.</p>

<p>Earlier during the present Session, the hon. member for Germiston (District) raised a similar point of order in connection with the Group Areas Amendment Bill and I then ruled that it was competent for this House to proceed with that legislation. Subsequently, the same point of order was also raised in the honourable the Senate, and Mr. President ruled that the point of order was not well founded.</p>

<p>Clause 8 of the National Education Council Bill provides that no proposed legislation relating to the education of White persons shall be introduced in the Senate or the House of Assembly or in a provincial council except after prior consultation between the Minister and any other interested Minister or Administrator and after the Minister has obtained the views of the National Education Council thereon.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Germiston (District) <span class="col_7415-7416" refersTo="page_0954"/>and Durban (Musgrave) have both submitted that Parliament, in imposing this condition on provincial councils, is derogating from the powers which are at present enjoyed by provincial councils and that this is in conflict with the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 114 of the Constitution, which provides that Parliament shall not &#x201C;abolish any provincial council or abridge the powers conferred on provincial councils under Section 84, except by petition to Parliament by the provincial council concerned&#x201D;</p>

<p>Attention was also directed to Section 59 of the Constitution, which provides that:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Parliament shall be the sovereign legislative authority in and over the Republic and shall have full power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Republic.</li>

<li>(2) No court of law shall be competent to inquire into or to pronounce upon the validity of any Act passed by Parliament other than an Act which repeals or amends or purports to repeal or amend the provisions of Section 108 or 118,</li>

</ol>

<p>but both the hon. members for Germiston (District) and Durban (Musgrave) contended that as long as Section 114 (b), to which I have already referred, remained on the Statute Book, it was the bounden duty of Parliament to act in accordance with that section. They further contended that acting in this manner would not be a derogation from the sovereignty of Parliament.</p>

<p>I want to point out, however, that I consider the solution to the point at issue to be found in Section 84 of the Constitution, which provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution and the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, 1945, a provincial council may make ordinances in relation to <i>inter alia</i> &#x201C;education, other than higher education and Bantu education, until Parliament otherwise provides&#x201D;. This section clearly does not confer the exclusive right upon provincial councils to pass ordinances in regard to educational matters&#x2014;a fact which was admitted by the hon. member for Germiston (District). Nor does it in my view debar Parliament, in the exercise of its sovereign legislative powers, from passing legislation on such matters if it deems it expedient in the public interest to do so. In the light of this specific provision in the Constitution and the views I have expressed, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether Clause 8 of the Bill now before the House does in fact abridge the powers of provincial councils.</p>

<p>For these reasons I consider that it is competent for this House to proceed with the National Education Council Bill and I rule accordingly.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>On Wednesday I referred to this Bill as being an happy Bill, and some hon. members on the other side took exception to that phrase. I do not know why, because this Bill is the inevitable consequence of our leaving the Commonwealth, and therefore the only people who could feel happy about the necessity for introducing a Bill of this kind could be those people who wanted to leave the Common wealth. And who wanted to leave the Common wealth? The hon. the Prime Minister has said that he did not; the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly said that he did not. Only last week in addressing a distinguished gathering of diplomats he was reported as having again said, quite clearly, that South Africa was forced out of the Commonwealth. He is reported to have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I was with the Prime Minister at the Prime Ministers&#x2019; Conference in London in March last year and I can testify that he did everything to remain in the Commonwealth but we were really forced out.</block>

<p>In this statement which the hon. the Minister made on Wednesday he used language which I think bears that out. He said that this Bill represented part of the task of reconstructing our future relations with the United Kingdom. He said that his Government and he had sought to preserve as much of our past relations unchanged as the constitutional position would permit. One may observe, Sir, that it takes a Bill like this to make people realize and to bring home to them how closely linked those relations were and how little it is possible to save in the reconstruction work which the Minister is undertaking. This is not the relevant occasion to try to enumerate just what both sides have lost as the result of these developments, but the list is already a formidable one and it is still growing, and some <span class="col_7425-7426" refersTo="page_0959"/>day a full statement will have to be made. The Minister went on to say that it was his desire &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I wish the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) would keep quiet, Sir. I can never hear what he says. One just gets up to make a speech and then he makes an unintelligible remark and wobbles like an overripe jelly, from which one concludes that he thinks he has made a witty remark. I am trying to make a serious statement on behalf of this side of the House on a very important question. The hon. the Minister said that it was his desire&#x2014;and when I say &#x201C;his&#x201D;, of course, I speak of his Government&#x2014;to maintain the traditional bonds of friendship between this country and the United Kingdom, ties of friendship which have been cemented by Commonwealth membership and which have been torn out and removed. They say that adversity makes strange bed-fellows, but I think it is quite clear that on this occasion the Minister, like myself, feels that this is an unhappy Bill to have to introduce, and on that point I think we are in agreement. Sir, the basic fact that we have to consider is this, that henceforth South African citizens are aliens in the eyes of the United Kingdom and of the Commonwealth, and that British and Commonwealth citizens are aliens in the eyes of the Republic. But I think&#x2014;again I think the Minister will agree with me&#x2014;that while that is a basic fact which has to be grasped by everybody, I think it is true to say that neither side is really anxious to regard each other as aliens or strangers in the strict sense of the word. I am not trying, Sir, to initiate a wide and long debate on this question. All I want to do is to make clear the attitude of this side of the House. Our attitude is quite simple. While we condemn and deplore as strongly as ever the events which have led to our leaving the Commonwealth, we are faced with the stark fact, the ineluctable fact that owing to the policies and the actions of the Government, the ties of kinship which have made us welcome and which have ensured us rights and privileges in so many parts of the world, have been broken, and that legally and constitutionally we are aliens where we used to be kinsmen and that our former Commonwealth partners will in future come to our shores as strangers and as foreigners. Faced with this fact, it is obvious that legislation is necessary. In that sense there is no new principles involved in this Bill. One might refer to it, really, as containing one long series of consequential amendments resulting from the fact that our membership of the Commonwealth has been so rudely terminated. Our task to-day is to see how the Government is setting about the task of reconstruction, as the Minister called it. It is the task of saving, one might say, something from the wreck, because if we are going to reconstruct, it means that we shall have to rebuild something which has been torn down.</p>

<p>A large part of this Bill is concerned with the removal of all verbal and legal signs of Commonwealth membership, and of our relationship with Britain. Another large section of the Bill deals with the Merchant Shipping Act and the substitution of the phrases &#x201C;treaty countries&#x201D; and &#x201C;treaty ships&#x201D; for &#x201C;Commonwealth countries&#x201D; and &#x201C;Commonwealth ships&#x201D;. At the moment there are no treaty countries&#x2014;in other words, this Commonwealth Shipping Act was an essential part of the whole shipping world as far as we were concerned &#x2026;</p>

<p>But the most important part of it. Now that the Commonwealth side of it has been removed, that part of the Act becomes a dead letter, or at least until such time as there are treaty countries and treaty ships to take the place of Commonwealth countries and Commonwealth ships. This is an important question and one should, therefore, like to know what is being done about it. It is of importance to the future of our young and growing merchant service and also to the future of our young men who wish to adopt the sea as a career and who cannot all find that career at the present time in our own comparatively small service.</p>

</speech>

<p>The hon. the Minister made a very brief reference to this question and said that discussions were going on in connection with the employment of South African seamen on British ships. We should like to know, however, to what extent the Government is negotiating fresh treaties particularly with the United Kingdom with whom our relations were the most important in relation to this matter. At the present moment, all we know is what the hon. the Minister said, namely that he was having discussions in regard to the employment of South African seamen. There is, however, much more to it than that&#x2014;that is obvious to anybody reading this Bill and comparing it with the Merchant Shipping Act. A third section of this Bill deals with persons of one category or another. I think there are four main categories of persons involved. Firstly, there are temporary visitors, i.e. people who either come in as holiday visitors, or those who come in as temporary visitors. Provision is made in this Bill to exempt these from a good many of the provisions of the relevant Acts. A second class is that of British subjects who have lived here for years as permanent <span class="col_7427-7428" refersTo="page_0960"/>citizens but have not become South African citizens and who wish to continue to live in that way. Provision is also being made for these, third category is a class of British subjects who do wish to become South African citizens but who have not yet done so, either because they have not yet qualified as to length of residence, or for some other reason. Provision is being made for these as well. Fourthly, there is the class of people who are South African citizens but who wish to renounce that citizenship and become resident aliens instead. The details of these provisions can be discussed in Committee if it is necessary to do so. Broadly speaking, the essential feature is that the responsible Minister has wide powers of discretion in administering the relevant provisions. He has, for instance, powers of exemption and discretionary powers in various other directions. It will depend very much on the administration of these provisions, therefore, whether the objects which the Government has in view are achieved or not. One gathers from the speech of the hon. the Minister that the Government intends using these powers as part of the policy of preserving as much of our past relations as is possible. He indicated that, particularly in respect of some of the old Commonwealth countries, it was intended to make exemptions as wide as possible so as to disturb the existing position as little as possible. One can only hope that that will be possible and that it will have the effects the Minister hopes it will, At this stage, however, one can only say that time will tell and show how it works.</p>

<p>The Minister also made only a brief reference to the position of the Protectorates. He told us that trade and customs agreements were being negotiated and that measures to regulate and control the movement of persons were under consideration. This is a most important aspect of the question we are considering. One appreciates, therefore, that whatever negotiations may be going on, the Minister is precluded from giving us many details. But it is a pity that in referring to this matter, he was not in a position to give us any indication of the policy which actuates the Government in conducting these negotiations and what exactly they have in view. Our attitude on this side of the House on this question is, generally, that in regard to trade and customs matters and the movement of persons, the present conditions should be changed as little as possible as things are at the moment. I say this because whatever the political position may be, economically and financially these Protectorates are very much within our orbit and we believe that we should go out of our way in an endeavour to keep that so. There are members in this House from various parts of the country, who have special knowledge of the state of affairs in those parts of our country bordering on the Protectorates. They know of the continual coming and going there is between those territories and the Republic. They also know of the close economic ties which exist and how difficult and unwise it is going to be to try and set up anything like barriers between the territories beyond the minimum that is necessary.</p>

<p>In the absence of any statement of policy from the Government as to how it views this matter, therefore, we would urge that in any negotiation in respect of the relationship between ourselves and the Protectorates in future, a long and broad view should be taken in an endeavour to keep these relations as close and as friendly as they are to-day. The Government should not stand on small points, or make difficulties about a few people being here or a few people being there, but they should keep in mind the main object, i.e. that we would like to see South Africa as the economic, financial and cultural centre of the territories around our borders. Now is the time when the foundations of those future relations are going to be laid. A great responsibility, therefore, rests on the Government in this regard because if we set off in the wrong direction, we might never be able to rectify it again.</p>

<p>Lastly I should like to refer to the fact that the Minister said that negotiations were at present being conducted predominantly with representatives of the United Kingdom. But what about negotiations with the other older members of the Commonwealth with whom we have had very long and close relations as well? We have common interests also with these other Commonwealth countries, interests which might become greater in the event of the United Kingdom joining the Common Market with its attendant economic and political implications. We should, therefore, like to know with whom else the Minister is negotiating besides the United Kingdom? He told us that the task of reorganizing South Africa&#x2019;s future relations with the United Kingdom and certain other Commonwealth countries, was practically completed except in regard to the question of visas with the older Commonwealth countries to which he made a brief reference. He made no reference, however, to what negotiations he is having with other Commonwealth countries. There are, for instance, shipping treaties to be negotiated; there are trade treaties to be negotiated; there are reciprocal arrangements to be made on the lines of this and, I take it, also other Bills. I think the Minister might, therefore, reasonably be asked to give us some idea of what steps he has taken apart from the major negotiations he has had with the United Kingdom, to set up permanent arrangements with other members of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>I think that when he said that the task of reorganization was nearly completed, he was optimistic. Apart from the wide reorganization and reorientation which have to take place in every sphere of our financial, economic and political life, there are other things to be considered as well. We are for instance, told that the Minister of Immigration is undertaking a campaign to obtain immigrants. Since this campaign is being undertaken, I suppose the Government is examining the position in relation to this Bill very closely. In this Bill there <span class="col_7429-7430" refersTo="page_0961"/>is a provision which certainly reacts harshly against South African citizens who have been here for 25 or 30 years and have contributed over those years to a pension fund for their old age. Has it occurred to the hon. Minister of Immigration to investigate what the position is in regard to pensions in other countries? There are countries who have special arrangements with certain Commonwealth countries, particularly is this the case with Canada, in this connection. In terms of these arrangements, the position is that if, for instance, Canada gets an immigrant from West Germany, that immigrant will lose none of the pension rights he has acquired whilst in West Germany. This is a very important question. If any man of from 35 to 40 years goes with his family to another country to settle down, it is a very important question for him to know what about his pension rights acquired in the country of his origin. What is more, he might be required to start <i>de novo</i> and might have to wait 25 years before qualifying for any pension. This, I suggest, is one of the very many questions which require investigation.</p>

<p>As I said before, I did not stand up this morning to initiate a long debate. If we want to do so, we can cover an enormously wide field. I do not think, however, that that will be in the interest of the country. So I simply stood up to make clear what the attitude of this side of the House is to this Bill and to say that having to regard the position as it exists to-day, we accept this Bill as an unhappy necessity while at the same time deeply regretting the circumstances which have led to its introduction. I, therefore, wish to express the hope that the Government will act more wisely in future than it has in the past, thereby minimizing the damage already done by virtue of the position in which we find ourselves to-day.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, knowing the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and knowing our history, I think he must be permitted to call this an &#x201C;unhappy Bill&#x201D;. I think it augurs well for South Africa that the hon. member could make the speech he has in fact made, and for that reason I only want to come back to a few of the points he has made.</p>

<p>The hon. member has said that this is &#x201C;an unhappy Bill&#x201D; because the people who wished to leave the Commonwealth are delighted by it. I think that it is necessary once again to put the matter in its correct perspective, by emphasizing that the policy of this Government and the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister last year in London was to keep South Africa in the Commonwealth. That is generally accepted. For three days with the patience of Job he made every effort to keep South Africa in the Commonwealth on an honourable basis. The hon. member was therefore not doing right when he tried to create the impression that there is gratification amongst those who wanted South Africa out of the Commonwealth. As matters are to-day, it is a good thing that South Africa is out of the Commonwealth but it was never the policy or the desire that we should leave the Commonwealth as it was. As the Commonwealth has developed since then, however, and in the form it has taken to-day, it is best for South Africa to be out of it. This present position also represents the only reason why South Africa is out of the Commonwealth. Although I do not begrudge the hon. member his attitude, namely that this Bill is &#x201C;an unhappy Bill&#x201D;, I cannot agree with him that this is in fact the position. This Bill once again offers us the opportunity to emphasize the independence of the Republic for the benefit of anyone who wants to take note of it. It also offers us the opportunity to ask every citizen of this country to give South Africa his undivided allegiance. The Bill is also a very clear indication of the very good relations and cooperation existing between Britain and South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize once again that this Bill is not the result of a policy of this Government that we should leave the Commonwealth, but the result of a change in the Commonwealth. I do not want to overlook the fact that the hon. member and others on his side of the House still wish to retain a dual allegiance. Nor do I want to be unfeeling towards that sentiment. It would moreover be out of place to use this opportunity to start a fight or to begrudge them that attitude. It would not be in the interests of the unity which we are building up. Nor would it be in the interests of the good relations which we have with Britain. Allow me to point out in this regard that no one can regard this legislation as an unfriendly act by South Africa towards Britain or by Britain towards South Africa. On the contrary, it creates the basis for good relations between two equal states. The atmosphere in which these discussions took place and the way in which the matter was handled in the House of Commons testifies to a very good spirit. It is also our desire to express our appreciation and praise to the Department of Foreign Affairs and others who undertook the negotiations.</p>

<p>I want to deal for a moment with the provision in this Bill which provides for a single loyalty and allegiance and together with that, the abandoning of loyalty and allegiance to another country. Perhaps the hon. member for Constantia and others do not welcome this and perhaps this is why he regards this Bill as an &#x201C;unhappy&#x201D; Bill. But allow me also to tell him in this regard that in this matter he represents a very small group in South Africa, a group which is becoming smaller by the day, and this is to the benefit of South Africa. Actually the attitude that one can have a dual allegiance belongs to the past. I therefore think that I can maintain that this attitude will become African a sooner than we want to realize. Seeing that that is the position, I do not want to cross swords with the hon. member, but I welcome the fact that in reasonably moderate language he has welcomed this position, the position which I know is painful to him.</p>

<p><span class="col_7431-7432" refersTo="page_0962"/>The <i>Argus</i> of 1 June said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Republican Afrikaners would be doing the country a service by understanding how many English-speaking South Africans feel at being classed as aliens in their country of origin.</block>

<p>We should like to do so, but on the other hand we would be failing in our duty if we did not make it quite clear that although there are people who feel in this way, we cannot make concessions to their feelings. This is because of the necessity to do those things which will make South Africa strong and to build up our nation. And there are a few things which these people can do to help achieve this ideal.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia told the <i>Sunday Times</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Low&#x2019;s Commonwealth Bill sets the seal on the isolation into which South Africa has steadily been drifting.</block>

<p>This submission must be refuted. The fact that South Africa is out of the Commonwealth and the fact that this Bill is now being introduced, have absolutely nothing to do with the allegation of the hon. member to the effect that South Africa is becoming isolated because to become an independent nation does not mean that one has become isolated. As a matter of fact the relationship existing between South Africa to-day and foreign countries is even better than at any time in the past. I even want to submit that as a result of our leaving the Commonwealth we are extending our international circle of friends. We can make this submission on the basis of the attitude which other countries have adopted towards the Commonwealth. For this reason the hon. member and the <i>Sunday Times</i> are quite incorrect in maintaining that this step signifies isolation.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, this Bill is another great step towards the furthering of national unity in South Africa. In South Africa we have had various types of loyalty, and I say without fear of contradiction that the removal of all these types of dual loyalty will promote greater national unity. The oath of allegiance to the Republic of South Africa embodied in this Bill seems to me to represent the removal of the last of these forms of dual allegiance. For this reason we welcome it, particularly because it places the seal on what took place on 31 May last year in Pretoria. We are all aware of the atmosphere prevailing in South Africa to-day, namely a South African and purely national atmosphere such as we have never known before. The diplomats in our country will testify to this particularly. It is a privilege to speak to them to-day and to hear the proof which they submit regarding the growing national unity in our country. Just think of the speech by the Prime Minister on the occasion of the function in honour of the 1820 settlers and the visit by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to Durban a little while ago. The circumstances surrounding these two occasions all augur well for South Africa. The celebration of Republic Day last year was not a political occasion, but all sections of our population participated. These are things which testify to such definite signs of national unity that this is a factor which must be taken into account.</p>

<p>The <i>Cape Times</i> has also written a leading article on this matter. We all know what the attitude of this newspaper is, but what it says in this leading article is, to me, a sign of the times, and testifies to the change which is taking place in South Africa. In this article the <i>Cape Times</i> wrote the following with reference to the death of Mr. Arthur Barlow&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The one thing that stood out firmly in the character and memory of Arthur Barlow was his South Africanism. The two historic resolutions he moved in the House, one in effect abolishing the paraphernalia of titles for South Africans and the other leading to a single South African national flag, were at their time in advance of many of his English-speaking South African citizens. But they helped to contribute towards a common South Africanism which will one day bring us to some sort of haven, which will almost certainly be different from anything ever imagined by himself or by the so-called &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am merely pointing out that, while there may be people who do not feel happy about this change, who do not feel happy about the abolition of a dual allegiance, this is a step which is essential for South Africa in order to round off the establishment of the Republic.</p>

<p>I now just want to deal with another point. I think it raises the status of South Africa abroad as well; it strengthens the position of the Republic. Allow me to give hon. members an excellent example of this strengthened position, as far as loyalty towards the Republic and undiluted South Africanism are concerned. I have here a letter which I received from a friend of mine. We were at university together, and he is someone who, at that time, had the same ideas as the hon. members for Constantia and Wynberg (Mr. Russell). Today he is in Durban. The fact that he has written this letter to me is so much a sign of the times in which we are living. I do not want to mention his name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have been meaning to write to you for some time. Living in Durban, where the tone is quite often out of step with the rest of the country, I thought I would like to put it to you that there are many of us here who regard South Africa first and foremost. If I at any time could be of help to my country, I would be only too willing, and a number of my friends feel the same way. We could quite easily get sufficient doctors for a field ambulance, and, of course, we are prepared to give up the necessary free time to undergo training. Should <span class="col_7433-7434" refersTo="page_0963"/>trouble ever come, it would be useless offering one&#x2019;s services if one were untrained, and I feel strongly that our country is worth every bit of the trouble in helping to do something. I am still only 37 years of age, and, though not as fit as I was when we played rugby together, I am still fit enough, if necessary, to march 20 miles.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is precisely the point I want to make. There are many of these people who feel like this. We do not want to have an argument on this point. I felt that I should just make these few points quite clear. Now there are one or two other matters which I want to mention. I have seen a report in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of Durban, and it creates the impression that this is a political matter. The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eric Low&#x2019;s plan to regulate further relationships between Britain and South Africa is causing increasing concern to those South Africans who have dual nationality. They fear that the political implications of his recent call for single undivided loyalty to the Republic may amount to a major setback for anti-Nationalist</block>

<p>Now it is creating the impression that there are 400,000 people to-day who have the franchise but who may lose it. Mr. Chairman, allow me to say quite clearly, because I think this is something we must accept, and I shall be glad if the hon. Minister will make it quite clear to South Africa, that only a person who has an undivided allegiance to South Africa can share in the political activities of this country. On&#x2019;y such a person will be able to vote when there is an election. I think that this is the implication of this whole matter.</p>

<p>For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly with these few words, so that we will have this legislation, not because we have left the Commonwealth <i>per se,</i> but because we have left a Commonwealth which has the character it has to-day. And then, secondly, because it will give us the opportunity to place the final seal on the Republic and to remove any vestige of dual allegiance once and for all from South Africa. It is a good thing for us as a Republic, and I believe that, with this legislation, we may be taking the last step towards making the Republic of South Africa one of the strong nations of the world. We may only be 3,000,000 Whites in South Africa, but I believe that, with the developments which we are seeing in South Africa to-day, with the contribution which this legislation will also make in this regard, although we are only 3,000,000 Whites in South Africa, anyone who thinks of touching South Africa and the Republic will not be faced with 3,000,000 Whites, but will be faced with the equivalent and the strength of perhaps 30,000,000 Whites.</p>

<p>My regrets are largely those of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and it is not, therefore, necessary for me to delay the House very long in passing the second reading of this Bill. I feel that this is riot the opportunity for making political speeches. Just as Mr. Thomas, in introducing the third reading of the South Africa Bill in the British House of Commons, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not see it as a declaration or instrument of political opinion; it is not intended to be that and it is not that. Its purpose is to regulate the application of United Kingdom law as it applies to South Africa. It seeks to regulate it in such a way that both human and material interests, which it seems right to preserve, are preserved.</block>

<p>Well, Sir, I would say that with the necessary changes having been made, that is precisely the attitude with which we should be considering the Bill which is before the House today. I am not going to cross swords with the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) in regard to what he said about dual loyalty, although I should like to comment on one thing which he said on this question of the reasons for our being out of the Commonwealth. He ascribes that to the changed nature of the Commonwealth itself and I hold the view, and have always held it, that we are out of the Commonwealth largely because our racial policies in this country are out of step with the rest of the Western world. But this is not the occasion for political speeches of this kind, and therefore I do not intend to carry on along that line.</p>

<p>I think there are certain clauses which will have to be discussed in some detail when we take the Committee Stage of this Bill. The particular clause which worries me is Clause 24. In terms of that clause the hon. the Minister may deprive persons of South African citizenship who have performed some &#x201C;voluntary act&#x201D; which in his opinion indicates that such citizen has made use of his citizenship or nationality of that other country. I think the hon. the Minister should explain to the House what he means or what he is likely to mean by this &#x201C;voluntary act&#x201D;. If, for instance, a South African citizen who, by virtue of British law is still entitled to enter Britain by virtue of a father of such a person having been born in Britain or he himself having been born in Britain (although he is a South African citizen), claims to enter through the &#x201C;British subjects&#x201D; gate at a customs house in Britain rather than through the &#x201C;Aliens&#x201D; gate, will that be a voluntary act which will deprive him of his South African citizenship?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I entirely agree with the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) that this is not an occasion for making, what she termed, political speeches. I also agree with both her and the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) that a more appropriate occasion for dealing with the points which he raised would be the Committee Stage. My colleague, the hon. Minister of the Interior, who is responsible for a number of these amendments, agrees that that would be the occasion for raising those matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I agreed that this is not an occasion for political speeches. I must confess to a measure of disappointment at the approach of the hon. member for Constantia. What we had this morning was in fact a rehash of some of the arguments which were used before the referendum took place. I was under the impression&#x2014;and I think many others were&#x2014;that whatever the views of the hon. member and of others might have been about the establishment of the Republic, they by now would have accepted that position, as indeed a large number of English-speaking South Africans who also felt the way the hon. member for Constantia did, are accepting the position.</p>

<p>For instance, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made a statement&#x2014;I made a note of it&#x2014;to the effect that only people who could feel happy about this Bill were those who wished to leave the Commonwealth. That was a case where there was a political implication. He also emphasized repeatedly that the effect of this Bill would be to break the ties with the Commonwealth. That is a natural consequence of South Africa first having become a Republic and secondly having withdrawn from the Commonwealth. [Interjections.] Let me come to that point at once, because I think that is a point which should be put straight. When the Commonwealth Conference was discussed in this House, after the Prime Minister had given an exhaustive statement regarding the happenings at London, we had the suggestion that South Africa had&#x2014;in fact it was stated very strongly&#x2014;in some way or other manoeuvred to leave the Commonwealth; that we had gone to London with the intention of leaving the Commonwealth. That is not so. I gave the full facts at the time. I quoted what had been said by several of the Prime Ministers from which it was perfectly clear that they did not wish us to remain in the Commonwealth. I state again what I stated at the Union Day gathering when the diplomats came to pay their respects and to which the hon. member referred, namely that South Africa was forced to leave the Commonwealth. It is too bad, Sir, that the hon. member and others refuse to accept that. After all, Sir, I was present. I was present right through those discussions.</p>

<p>The hon. member said it was an unhappy Bill to have to introduce. The basic fact was, as he called it, that South Africans would now be aliens in Commonwealth countries. That is so; that is a natural effect. Let us rather try to reconcile ourselves with that position. Let us rather try to accept the Republic in the sense which, I believe, will lead to a greater measure of unity between the two White sections of our population. It is already having that effect.

<p>The whole tenor of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech was a reiteration of &#x201C;it takes a Bill like this to show how strong the links were with the Commonwealth&#x201D;. This Bill is a logical consequence of our departure from the Commonwealth. The hon. member also suggested&#x2014;I hope I am wrong in that interpretation&#x2014;that I was not quite sincere when I said that it was our real and keen desire to maintain the traditional bonds of friendship with the United Kingdom and those Commonwealth countries with whom we have always been friends.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked about the discussions with other members of the Commonwealth. The position is that certain discussions have taken place, and other discussions are still taking place; discussions with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Federation of Rhodesia, Nyasaland and also the High Commission Territories, to which the hon. member referred. Discussions are taking place in regard to matters of common concern. Hon. members must realize that there is a difference between our previous relationship with the United Kingdom and our relationship with the other Commonwealth countries. Those relationships were never identical. The fact that we were a member of the Commonwealth rather inclined to obscure the fact that there were matters in regard to which we did not see eye to eye with some Commonwealth countries. But that did not in any way affect our friendly relations. Mr. Speaker, I wish to make it clear that the discussions with representatives of the United Kingdom which have been proceeding since the end of last year, have been conducted in a very amicable spirit.</p>

<p>Many of the matters in this Bill are the result not of agreement with the British authorities, because those were matters which we could decide for ourselves. There were other matters in respect of which the British representatives expressed their understanding, matters in respect of an arrangement was arrived at although not a formal agreement.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton referred to a discussion in the British House of Commons. Sir, except of course for the Socialist Opposition and one or two others, as far as the Government was concerned, there was a spirit of maintaining and extending friendly relations. There was no spirit of hostility. That was particularly the case in connection with the discussions in the House of Lords. I say, therefore, Sir, that it is no good at this stage having a rehash of the doubts and fears that were expressed in the past. Let us rather go forward in a spirit of co-operation with Britain and members of the Commonwealth in respect of all matters of common concern. Let me assure hon. members that that cooperation does exist. After all, such matters are handled by my office and there is a spirit of co-operation between us and the British Government. Some of them are of a secret nature which I obviously cannot divulge. We wish to extend it and I believe that the best way of extending it is to accept the position as it is to-day.</p>

<p>With regard to the High Commission Territories, these discussions are still proceeding. I have noted what the hon. member has said and those points will be borne in mind. Those matters are still being dealt with although no agreement has been reached as yet.</p>

<p>When we come to the Committee Stage hon. members will have full opportunity of dealing with the various clauses of the Bill which will be dealt with particularly by my hon. friend, the Minister of the Interior, as so many of them affect his Department. I hope, Sir, that we will go forward in the spirit that we now have the Republic, that we must make it succeed, that we must, as is stated in this Bill, have an undivided loyalty to the Republic.</p>

<p>The Health Vote is one of the most important Votes. I should like to deal with the &#x201C;first interim report of the committee of inquiry into the financial relations between the Central Government and the province The committee did a fine job of work. It dealt with the relations between the Central Government, the provinces and the local authorities. I read from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The committee has completed a thorough examination of health services and regards that its report on this subject should be presented without delay.</block>

<p>The committee was appointed in August 1956 and presented its report on 1 September 1959. When you examine the legislation which has been passed in the interim, you find that very little has been done to implement this very important report. I think, Sir, we are inclined to disregard the position as far as &#x201C;health control&#x201D; between the Central Government and the provinces is concerned. I do not think we realize that the country is growing daily and that our health services require reviewing. I should like to suggest that the hon. the Minister should implement this report before it becomes out of date. To a certain extent it has already become out of date because the statement by the hon. the Prime Minister that the Transkeian Territories would take over the administration of their own health services was not dealt with by this committee. This is unfortunate, but that fact should make us realize how quickly a report becomes out of date. As far as the provinces and the Health Department are concerned, you find that the provinces are responsible for curative diseases, but not for infectious diseases. The anomalous position is created from time to time when a patient who is admitted to a provincial hospital develops an infectious disease, and you visualize the amount of paper work which is involved in having that particular patient transferred to an infectious diseases hospital under separate control.</p>

<p>In this report they make provision for transferring the infectious diseases hospital section from the local authorities to the provinces. In not implementing this report, or portions of it, you find that this matter is left high and dry.</p>

<p>One of the most important items requiring attention in our country to-day, where people are inclined to live very much longer than in the past, is the question of the aged. If it had not been for interested bodies, they would be having a very bad time. There also is the question of the chronic infirm. You find that these people are housed in the most unsatisfactory conditions. Had the Government got down to this problem, we would, perhaps, have had a very much more satisfactory position than we have at the present moment.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the position of the Minister of Health in relation to the other Departments which are very, very closely allied to him. I think it is all wrong that we should have a Minister of Health responsible for health only, and not responsible for social welfare, because those of us who have experience of hospital administration know that the patient who is admitted to the hospital and is then discharged, and is not in a condition to work, becomes a social welfare problem. If these two departments were closer allied than at the present moment, we would get very much further in our treatment and after-care. You find, in general, that hospitals have their social workers. The Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town deals with no less than 200 social workers from various agencies. It is very necessary to have a closer tie-up between social welfare and health. We have a new name for the Minister of Housing, but there again it should be tied up with the Minister of Health, because, if you have decent housing, it is a type of preventive medicine; it results in less sickness and disease.</p>

<p>Coming back to the social welfare side, and talking about alcoholics, the Provincial Administration of the Cape started a hospital for the treatment of alcoholics, and the records of the Minister&#x2019;s Department will show that they are having very satisfactory results. But it is no good taking these people into a hospital and, after clinical treatment, discharging them on to the street. Instead, they should be given the complete curative treatment, through the clinic, nursed back to health and then given sheltered employment. To-day these people go to the hospital for alcoholics and, when they are discharged, it is only by the grace of private persons and charity that they can keep their heads above water. Once again I should like to make a plea that there should be a reallocation of these various departments, and that the Minister of Health should also be the Minister of Social Welfare, and possibly of Housing. I think they are so closely allied that they should be under one head. I might also suggest to the Minister, where he has quite a number of departments under him, that this becomes the responsibility of one Minister.</p>

<p>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to item &#x201C;L&#x201D; on page 204 where he makes provision for extra-statutory expenditure in connection with the treatment of certain former Bantu mine labourers who are suffering from tuberculosis. The question I want to put to the Minister arises because under Section 41 and 42 of the Pneumoconiosis Act these Bantu are handed over to the Department of Health for treatment to see whether they cannot once again enjoy a measure of health. I am raising this matter because I want to know whether the Minister, in his capacity as Minister of Health, has any control over the origin of this tuberculosis which he must treat after they <span class="col_7441-7442" refersTo="page_0967"/>have worked in the mines. There is no indication that the Minister has any control over the origin of the tuberculosis in the mines, but when they are sick they are handed over to the Minister of Health for treatment and under Section 42 they are in turn handed over to the Minister of Bantu Administration, and after a certain time that Minister in turn hands them over to the Department of Justice. This is a long series of authorities who are saddled with these people who contract tuberculosis in the mines. The Minister is the person who is responsible for restoring these people to health. I need surely not advocate that it is far better to prevent these people contracting tuberculosis or pneumoconiosis. In other words, I think the Minister should have a say where the disease originates, and institute preventative measures. If ever there was a case where prevention is better than cure, it is as far as pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis are concerned. I want to ask whether the Minister is satisfied that he has sufficient control over the origin of the tuberculosis in the mines? When one examines the small amount for which provision is made here, it is negligible; it is only R2,000, but when one looks at page 16 of the pneumoconiosis report which appeared on 31 March 1961 one finds Table 9. Then one finds that during two years, namely 1960 and 1961, the numbers of Bantu who worked on the mines and contracted pneumoconiosis plus tuberculosis are given. During 1959 the figure was 1,459, and during 1960 it was 1,492. For the two years the total was therefore 2,951. But the frightening figures are to be found in the case of tuberculosis alone which are given in the same table. In 1959-60 the figure was 4,323 and in 1960-61 it was 4,881. The conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that during those two years there were 12,255 sufferers from tuberculosis. The largest figure is found in the case of tuberculosis alone without pneumoconiosis. Perhaps hon. members will say that this is not yet so bad, but we must remember that these people before they entered the mines, were healthy. They were examined and certified as being healthy and they became ill in the mines. The inferences to be drawn from these figures are very serious. I think we cannot over-emphasize that the Minister of Health should not only have the treatment under his control but that the health measures aimed at preventing the contracting of that disease should also be under his control. Despite the great pessimism which is sometimes revealed here, there are a few milestones in the history of the Department of Health of which we can all be very proud. Reference made last night to the way in which polio has been defeated in South Africa, and this is due to research which the medical men of South Africa have undertaken. But one of the greatest triumphs of the medical men was when they controlled malaria, something which has been a model for the whole world. Since South Africa has got malaria under control, the population of Africa has increased over the last 20 years in an unprecedented way because malaria was the greatest killer. Because we have such great confidence in the Department of Health, because they have already made such great progress towards defeating diseases with which the world is struggling, I think we should give them <i>carte blanche</i> in the case of tuberculosis. It is pointless combating tuberculosis in other respects; the mines are a very great contributor in this regard. We must remember that after these people are dismissed they are not isolated. These 12,000 can infect other people. It is because I see the position in this light and have so much confidence in the ability of our medical men that I think the Minister of Health should have full control over this aspect because this is a great source of tuberculosis. It is only by taking effective steps to prevent the disease that we shall better be able to combat the disease, rather than doing what we are doing now, namely merely handing the people over to the Department of Health once they have contracted the disease and then passing them in turn like a football to one Department or another. I urge that the Minister of Health should also have control over the prevention of tuberculosis in the mines.</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter of great importance to the people who are represented in these benches. Some 16 years ago, at the time when my wife happened to be secretary of the Cape Mental Health Society, I learnt with a shock that there is no institution in the whole of our country for feeble-minded or mentally defective Coloured children. Sir, it is impossible to give the House any statistics, because it is impossible to obtain such statistics, because as the result of the fact that there are no such institutions, and guardians and parents of such children are aware of it, these cases are not reported. I am not quite certain of the following fact, because of the lack of statistics, but there must be truth in the presumption on the part of some experts that these cases of cerebral palsy, spastics and mentally defective or retarded children-a high percentage of them is caused by brain injury which may be due to prenatal or post-natal circumstances, or to bad maternity facilities, which is prevalent in the rural areas as far as the Coloureds are concerned. That is due to the poverty and the poor facilities with which the Coloured people in general have to cope, in comparison with the Whites, but the percentage of such cases amongst the Coloureds is even higher than it is amongst the Whites. There is also the fact that the larger families of the Coloureds push up this percentage even further. But the fact is that to this day there is no institution at all, apart from two small homes run by the Cape Mental Health Society, the Garden and Torrence Homes, catering for 60 high-grade mental defectives only. This organization, which is a voluntary one, and which has only the salaries of its qualified social workers subsidized, earns the gratitude of the Coloured people and of society in general for what they have done over the years in regard to this matter. But even in the case <span class="col_7443-7444" refersTo="page_0968"/>of these 60 high-grade mental defectives&#x2014;they can only accept 60 under present circumstances&#x2014;the question arises what happens to these children after they leave those institutions. In the first place, we have the one category which might be susceptible to training and who might be employed in useful work after they leave there, such as labourers or in work not demanding a very high standard. There are some of them who have nowhere to go to, with the result that they go on to the streets and become a burden on society. Over the years 1,112 cases of mentally retarded or defectives have been reported to the society in Cape Town. This represents only Cape Town and the immediate surrounding areas. We do not know what the position is in the rest of the country. Over the last eight months 110 cases of mental defectives between the ages of one and 20 years have been put on the waiting-list of this society. These are current cases only, who desperately require institutionalization either because they are completely helpless, extremely hyper-active and restless or aggressive and cannot be coped with at home at all. The fact remains that these patients who require immediate attention are kept at home, and names are being added to this list continually and there are just no institutions for them to go to. I want to plead on behalf of the people whom I represent that something should be done as soon as possible in regard to this matter. Many of these cases would be susceptible to training and could be made useful citizens, as is being done with cases of the same degree of mental defectiveness amongst Whites. We feel that what is urgently needed are institutions falling into the following categories and here I do not want to address a sermon to the Minister&#x2019;s advisers, and I do not want to make the case that separate institutions should be established for the various categories. But the position at the moment is that the low-grade mental defectives of all ages who are so helpless, restless or aggressive that it is practically impossible for them to be cared for within the family, have to be kept in the family, and they completely disrupt normal family life. Every one of the 110 patients on the waiting-list falls into this category, and there are definitely more. Many of these cases are not on record. There are many more. We do not know how many because of the lack of statistics and the fact that guardians and parents of such children know that they cannot apply to any institution for assistance. Therefore there are no records. The only record that it might be possible to obtain is where such cases are subsidized in the form of a grant to the parents or guardians looking after them. Then there are the higher-grade teen-age and older mental defectives, who through inadequate social adjustment come into constant conflict with the law. They cannot learn through punishment and the only solution is custodial care in an institution. For these there is no hope at present. We feel that there should be day centres for the higher-grade mentally defective children who can be coped with at home but require occupation and elementary training for part of the day. These children cannot be accepted in ordinary nursery or primary schools, just as in the case of such White children, because they cannot benefit from ordinary instruction and are a disruptive element in an ordinary school. They cannot keep pace with the rest of the class in which they are put and so they have to be put into special classes and there they feel at a loss and become retarded more and more, and they realize that they are making no progress and that has a further detrimental effect on them. As I mentioned before, there are these two small homes with 60 occupants, but in pursuance of what they are doing there should be sheltered employment and occupation centres for the higher-grade mental defective adults who cannot compete in the open labour market but could be productively employed under sheltered conditions. Occupation is essential to their personal wellbeing and would lessen the amount of vagrancy and conflict with the law which occurs through their inadequate social adjustment and being unoccupied and unsupervised during the day. At present, in the Cape, for such cases there is only one solution, and that is that if he commits some offence or other which the normal person would not commit, or might commit once but is then deterred by the punishment&#x2014;there is only one solution, and that is that such cases are reported to the police and they are locked up and come before court and the magistrates sometimes know that they are sentencing a person who is not responsible, but there is nothing else they can do with them. They are not in such a stage that they can be certified and sent to a mental institution, and there is no other way open than to punish them and sentence them to gaol where they come into contact with habitual criminals, and are made use of to further the ends of such people when they come out of prison. I feel that special attention should be paid to sub-normal and border-line mentally defective children who can benefit from school instruction, but not at the pace set in ordinary classes. Grave behaviour problems result from emotional conflicts caused by trying to maintain the pace of the normal class. It is people in this category for whom something can be done if the case is handled correctly, but the progress and possible usefulness of such a person are being hampered by the fact that he has enough intelligence to realize that he is not a useful member of society, because he cannot keep pace with others of the same age group in the same class at school with him. Before my time expires, I wish to say that in the case of such mentally defective children who are in charge of some guardian or foster parent, the allowance paid is at the rate of 25 cents a day, which over a period of a month is only about 50 cents more than in the case of a normal child. It is obvious that in such cases more medical and personal attention are needed, and more money is needed, and I hope the Minister will give his serious attention to this matter.</p>

<p>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to the mentally deficient and handicapped children who have always been somewhat neglected in our country. To make the position clear I want to say in advance that all children with an I.Q. of less than 80 are regarded as mentally deficient.

I just want to say that we can only congratulate the administrations on the progress which has been made with the education of these children. They are in special classes and to-day are even in special schools and are being taught by specially trained teachers. To-day we have the opportunity of making these people useful citizens. But the group who have an I.Q. of less than 50 are regarded as uneducable and they of course are the responsibility of the Department of Health. They in turn fall into two sub-groups. The one with an I.Q. of less than plus 20 are commonly called idiots. All they need is physical care, and for this purpose we have institutions such as Alexandra in the Cape. There is also one in Natal and one in the Transvaal. The only objection to these institutions is that usually they are crowded and too big and I feel that we must have institutions that are more evenly distributed across the country so that through having small institutions we can maintain greater contact with the parents.</p>

<p>The other group, falling between plus 20 and plus 50, are the group about which I actually want to say something. They are also regarded as uneducable and are commonly described as imbeciles, but they are only uneducable in the sense that they cannot derive much benefit from the normal education offered in the ordinary schools. They are educable in the sense that they can look after themselves physically and can submit to discipline and that one can even teach them to do useful work. It is the confusion we have between training and education. These people are educable in the sense I have mentioned, but do not derive any benefit from ordinary education. For this type, who fall between plus 20 and plus 50, we have the so-called day work centres in the large cities, which have been established by associations for handicapped children, particularly on the initiative of the parents. They also fall under the control of the National Council for Mental Health. They are really day schools. By these means we can relieve the parents of part of their responsibilities during the day and in the evening the children go home again. Then there are also a few residential centres under the control of private organizations where a number of these children are cared for. Boarding is provided and the children live more or less permanently there. By these two methods approximately 500 to 600 children have been placed under proper care. This represents approximately one-quarter, it is estimated, of the large number of children who need this type of care. We do not know exactly how many of these children there are in the country, but if we accept the findings of other countries, there are approximately three children of this type in every thousand. Then there must be between 2,000 and 3,000 in South Africa who need care. I just want to indicate briefly what can possibly be done; I think there should be an extension of this system of day centres to all the bigger towns and cities which do not have it. There must be boarding institutions at these centres so that children from the platteland can enjoy this care and accommodation, for children who would normally be neglected if they do not receive proper care. Then we can support the residential institutions which have been established by private undertakings. There is for example an institution such as the Rudolph Steiner school which has found that if one takes such a child away from the urban environment to the platteland and one establishes a colony there for such children, they are then under proper care, and away from the dangers of ordinary life, and the children can be cared for. What happens later is that these children go home, often to a home which cannot receive nor look after him, and for this reason it is so essential that one should think along these lines. Whatever we may think of the idea underlying the Rudolph Steiner schools and the philosophy which is basic to them, anyone who has visited these institutions is immediately struck by the fact that the children are well mannered and that they are above all happy. And that is all we are striving for, namely to make these people happy. This is a matter which I feel the Minister of Education and the Minister of Health can iron out between them. Actually the best of these children, the more intelligent ones, should not fall under the Minister of Health, but in fact under the Minister of Education. I should like to see consideration being given in the near future to this matter which I have already discussed on many occasions with the hon. the Minister of Health.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should just reply at this stage to a few of the points made by hon. members. I want to start with the last two speakers who have dealt with the position of the feeble-minded in South Africa. If there is something which we all feel, it is of course the unfortunate position of the poor children who are feeble-minded and who for all these years have, when the position is viewed superficially, perhaps not been given their rightful due by the State. But there is a reason for this, namely that the parents hitherto have always regarded it as their duty to care for this type of child. It was extremely difficult for a mother to give up a child which <span class="col_7447-7448" refersTo="page_0970"/>was feeble-minded because she as a Christian being considered that she had an obligation to such a child. This struck me so forcibly in a recent case which I myself dealt with. I was approached and asked to help find accommodation for a certain child. The clergymen, the teachers and the whole local community made representations on behalf of the child. I succeeded in finding a place for her in one of the institutions, but to my surprise, after the child has hardly been a few days in the institution, they received letters from the mother in which she criticized myself and the State for daring to take her child from her&#x2014;and this notwithstanding the fact that she herself had agreed and that she herself was persuaded by the community to give up the child. I am mentioning this to show why the State hitherto has not made the necessary progress in this field. In recent years, however, a new approach has gained ground amongst many parents because gradually parents have come to realize, particularly as a result of the education of the public by the mental health associations and associations which are interested in these children, that it is after all in the best interests of such a child itself and in the best interests of the community that these children should not stay at home. Gradually the mothers and the parents of South Africa have started to realize that it is essential that they should hand over their children to institutions where the State can make far better provision for them together with their friends with whom they can be happy. The best solution, the ideal solution, would of course be that we should have such an institution in practically every place where there are such children, but in practice this is simply not possible. At the moment all the parents in South Africa are in addition not prepared to give up these children. In other words, when we come to the assistance of such children, we must take practical action and we must establish institutions at certain places, or where we already have institutions we must try to extend those institutions. The State at the moment has three such institutions which provide for feeble-minded children, <i>inter alia</i> Alexandra here in the Cape, Witrand in the Transvaal and Umgeni Waterfalls in Natal. But the unfortunate position is that in recent times these institutions have become so overcrowded that it is practically impossible to accept any more children. But we immediately took steps to meet this problem. I just want to tell hon. members what developments are taking place at the moment. As a result of the new steps which we have taken to deal with mental diseases, accommodation has become available in certain of our mental institutions. At the same time one of our new big and outstanding mental hospitals has just been taken into use, namely the Stikland Mental Hospital. In this hospital patients are now being accepted from elsewhere in South Africa, persons who are not from the local area itself. But I just want to give the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) this interesting piece of news: To-day, on this very day, no less than 100 patients are being transferred from Alexandra to Stikland which will create accommodation for another 100 patients in Alexandra. We appreciate the tremendous need amongst the Coloureds to which the hon. member for Outeniqua has referred. Amongst the Coloureds there are a very large number of feeble-minded persons, and we have therefore made plans to provide accommodation for Coloured feeble-minded persons in Alexandra as well. In other words, it will now be possible to accept a large number of Coloured feeble-minded persons in Alexandra. But we have also gone further. As a result of the success which we have had with the combating of tuberculosis amongst Whites, we have succeeded in reducing the incidence of tuberculosis amongst Whites in the Western Cape to such an extent that Westlake Hospital to a large extent is empty. We are now drawing up plans to remove from Westlake Hospital all the tuberculosis sufferers who can be treated in other hospitals and we then intend accommodating feeble-minded persons and particularly Coloured feeble-minded persons in Westlake. At the same time we appreciate that elsewhere in South Africa additional accommodation is required for feeble-minded Whites, and to meet this position we are at present negotiating with the Municipality of Bloemfontein with a view to taking over the Tempe Hospital and to changing it into an institution for feeble-minded White children. I hope that by these means we shall be able to make far more rapid progress towards solving this problem.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should first deal with one or two other points raised this morning. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) has asked that the Department of Health should play a bigger part in the combating of tuberculosis on the mines. I do not want to discuss at this stage all the problems involved in this matter. But one of the most important methods of combating tuberculosis is to determine its origin. If we can trace tuberculosis to its origin and we can destroy that origin, we can take effective action. This is one of the secrets why tuberculosis has been eradicated in Holland for example. But as far as the detection of tuberculosis in the mines is concerned, the Department of Health in effect has very little say.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>We do not have it. In the first place we have to detect it in the Native when he is accepted as a</p>

<p>miner. We know that many Natives in the past have unfortunately been taken into service while they have in fact been suffering from tuberculosis and in the nature of things it inevitably spread tremendously. We have no control over the admission of workers to the mines. But there is a second source, namely: When these miners work underground&#x2014;the <span class="col_7449-7450" refersTo="page_0971"/>House will forgive me if I mention this&#x2014;they often spit where they are working. The passages are continually being washed and by these means the germs enter the water with which other floors are also washed. In other words, if precautionary measures are not taken, those germs can be spread throughout the mine, with the result that the White miners and other miners contract tuberculosis even more quickly. I do not say that this is the position but I say that it is a possible source, and as long as these sources are not combated under the supervision of the Department of Health, we can of course not play a part in protecting the miners against this disease.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) has urged the reorganization of the Department, but as the Chairman has indicated, that does not really fall under this Vote; it falls under the Vote of the Prime Minister. I just want to refer the hon. member to a principle. Every Department has many branches. The Department of Health has its health aspect but it also has its financial aspect. Allow me to mention the aspect of mentally ill persons who commit offences. Because they have committed offences, they are really criminals, but they are also mentally ill. One can so easily say that a Department should be placed under another Ministry so that all the functions of the same nature fall under the same control, but this would mean that all departments would have to be under one Minister. Departments are allotted to Ministers to a large extent on an arbitrary basis. But matters that are common to the departments are after all taken into account. Allow me to give the House an example. Until last year housing fell under the Department of Health because, as the hon. member has correctly said, housing contributes to the health of a people. Consequently, while there was a big shortage of housing for Whites, housing was included. But then we had this other development in South Africa: provision had to be made on a large scale for Coloured housing&#x2014;not only Coloured housing but Coloured residential areas.</p>

<p>I just want to point out to the hon. member that the amount for which provision is made on the Estimates this year is considerably less than last year. It is often asked why it is still necessary to maintain a leprosy institution in Pretoria. I have discussed the matter thoroughly with my advisory committees, and we have reached the conclusion that for the training of our young doctors it is absolutely essential; in other words it is essential to have leprosy patients in Pretoria where there is a hospital at which students from Pretoria and Witwatersrand can see patients suffering from leprosy, so that when they encounter such cases in the community it will be easier for them to diagnose such cases. It is for this reason that we still retain a leprosy institution in Pretoria, even though most of the patients are Bantu.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) very sincerely for the kind words he has addressed to me in connection with the combating of polio, but I think the credit should go to others. I am grateful for the fact that he has referred to certain institutions and on behalf of the House and also the Government I should just like to convey our thanks to all the persons who have helped in combating polio over the past two years. The combating of polio, as the hon. member has said, has really been very successful. It has not been successful merely because we have eradicated the disease and the terrible consequences of the disease; not only because we have spared people suffering, people who might have been handicapped for the rest of their lives by the mutilation caused by polio, but also because of the financial savings which it has brought for South Africa. Perhaps I should just point out to hon. members what this campaign has meant to South Africa in terms of money. In 1957 there were 2,442 cases of polio which cost the country approximately R l,890,000. In 1958 there were 675 cases which cost the country R477,000. In 1959 there were 726 cases which cost approximately R480,000. In 1960 there were 1,054 cases and the estimated cost was R717,000. During the years I have mentioned the average expenditure caused by polio was approximately R1,000,000 per annum. As a result of the polio campaign there have only been 23 cases this year and they were all persons who had not gone through the full immunization course. In other words, if those persons had only taken the trouble to have the full course of injections, there would not have been one single case of polio in South Africa. In other words, hon. members can see the tremendous saving which this fight against polio has brought South Africa. The success achieved is due to the efforts of a whole series of organizations. It is not merely due to one person or a few persons only. I should like in the first place to convey our thanks to the Planning Council of the Department of Health with its capable chairman, Professor Snyman, who has played a leading role in the combating of polio. But I also want to mention particularly the Polio Research Institute which provided us with the vaccine when it was not yet available elsewhere in the world, a polio institute which has helped us in a wonderful way in this whole <span class="col_7451-7452" refersTo="page_0972"/>campaign and which, as the hon. member for Odendaalsrus has said, has devised special thermos flasks which could not be bought anywhere else in the world so that in this warm climate of South Africa the polio vaccine could be effectively stored under the conditions under which it had to be used. I also want to mention the name of Dr. James Gear who was in charge of that institute and who was responsible for many of these developments. I also want to mention the virological committee which had to advise the State. But I also want to thank the head of our Department who played a very important role in furthering this matter. He was the link; he was the man who brought together all the organizations and all the leading persons who assisted in this matter and who continually provided them with advice and inspiration. I also want to thank all the officers of our Departments, but particularly Dr. Willem Smit, one of the heads of our Department who dealt particularly with the administration of this campaign. Then there is a whole list of persons. It is too long for all the names to be mentioned. I shall only mention the organizations which have participated in this campaign merely to show the House what the extent of this campaign was. The whole Department with all its regional organizations throughout South Africa; other State departments; all the municipalities; all the divisional councils and, all the provincial councils and schools. All these organizations and many others as well were concerned in ensuring that the children of South Africa and the young people of South Africa were immunized as far as possible. In particular I want to thank our Airways, the Railways and the Government Garage for the conveyance of this vaccine under circumstances which often were very difficult. I must also mention the Red Cross Association, St. John&#x2019;s, the Noodhulpliga, the agricultural unions and the public all of whom helped to inoculate the young people of South Africa. And finally I must also thank the Blood Transfusion Services, the creameries, the abattoirs and private medical practitioners for making their refrigeration facilities available to us. I think, Mr. Chairman, you will agree with me that all these persons and organizations deserve our sincere thanks.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Geduld (Dr. Jurgens) has raised a very important matter, namely the question of the compulsory immunization of the population against certain diseases. He has not mentioned all the diseases but I want to mention a few of the most important against which we should like to immunize the population. The diseases he has mentioned are in the first place diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. But I want to go still further. We dare not stop there. We must extend this immunization at least to polio and tuberculosis. But I want hon. members to appreciate what problems are involved, and the first is this: In the case of diphtheria alone four injections are necessary, and in the case of polio three. In other words, if we want to combat these diseases, there will have to be ten injections for each person. Some of the injections can be done together but not all of them. Every person will have to be inoculated on at least four or five occasions against these diseases. But there is a further problem, namely that when a person is inoculated against certain diseases, it can have serious consequences if he is perhaps already immune or if he has already reacted positively. In other words, in the case of certain of these diseases, such as for example diphtheria and tuberculosis, when B.C.G. is used as a vaccine, one must first ensure that the person concerned either does not react positively or is not already immune. This test usually takes three to four days. In other words, if we want to introduce compulsory immunization, we are faced with this problem that all the persons to be inoculated will first have to undergo the test and in the base of the Bantu such an arrangement will practically be impossible. It may be that when we have developed a different vaccine which we can use with safety in the case of both susceptible and immune persons, the position will be different. I want to refer hon. members to what has happened in the case of tuberculosis. When the old vaccine was being used, it was necessary first to test a person, but now there is a new vaccine which we hope can be used without prior tests. Our Department is busy on this, and particularly our leading expert in this field, Dr. Dorman. He has already been engaged for a considerable time on experiments with the new vaccine.</p>

<p>But there is a second problem. The moment we make immunization compulsory, it means that a person who does not have himself inoculated must be punished. In other words, we are faced with the fact that we shall have to prosecute such a person but we cannot do so if we cannot prove that he has not been inoculated. If we can devise a method whereby one can see by a simple mark on a man&#x2019;s arm whether he has been inoculated for each of these diseases, we may finally have found the solution, particularly as far as the Bantu are concerned. Dr. Dorman has an interesting theory. There is a new method of inoculation with an instrument which consists of a number of needles by means of which the vaccine is injected through a person&#x2019;s skin, but at the same time the needles leave small tattoo marks. If the tattoo marks have different numbers or letters, it is possible that we shall be able to have a permanent mark in the case of each inoculation and in this way we shall be able to check whether a person has been inoculated or not. This is only an idea which has been mentioned and unless some such step is possible, it would be impossible to try to introduce compulsory immunization in South Africa in the case of the Bantu people. Nevertheless, I want to thank the hon. member very much for having raised the matter which is of the utmost importance to all of us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Geduld had advocated the provision of increased facilities for Bantu mental patients in South Africa. You know, <span class="col_7453-7454" refersTo="page_0973"/>Mr. Chairman, our main mental hospitals in South Africa are already overcrowded as far as Bantu patients are concerned. In recent times we have come to realize that it will be better to accommodate Bantu mental patients in their own areas. We have come to realize that when there is a large group of Zulus for example, it is undesirable to spread them across the whole of South Africa. It is more humane and also more economic to accommodate such people in an institution in Zululand. For this reason we asked the Department of Housing which at that time fell under the Department of Health to undertake an investigation into the various places in South Africa where such institutions could be established. I should like to thank the Secretary for Housing, Mr. van der Walt, especially for the excellent piece of work which he and his committee have performed because they have submitted a very well drawn-up report in which they indicate all the various places in South Africa where such hospitals can be established. They have even calculated the cost and have had plans drawn up for the buildings which may be erected. We are going further into this matter, and I want to assure the hon. member that if it is at all possible we shall establish such institutions in the forseeable future. These are the questions which I want to answer at this stage.</p>

<p>After I had spoken last night, the hon. member for Geduld (Dr. Jurgens) replied and he disagreed with the authorities I have quoted with regard to the causes of lung cancer, and he considered that diesel fumes were the main cause. That is precisely what happened in Great Britain, 10 years ago when efforts were made in the House of Commons to get some action taken in the matter of lung cancer. As soon as authoritative statements were made, others, some of whom claiming to be authorities, and others simply sneaking on their own, came out with other views, apparently contradictory, and so the public became confused. It is just because there are so many contradictory statements bandied around through the Press and in other ways in South Africa that I requested the hon. the Minister to have a thorough investigation made into this matter. The hon. the Minister has not replied yet to that point and I hope he will do so later. I also asked him to have published separate figures in respect of each year for cancer of other parts of the body and cancer separately of the respiratory system, so that it will be possible for the public, the medical profession and others in South Africa to form a better opinion as to what is happening in South Africa. I quoted some figures last night, and I think I may just shortly repeat them, as to-day other hon. members are present and I gave the figures from the latest report of the Department of Health in regard to cancer in South Africa. The figure in 1956 was 4,045 deaths, whilst in 1948, the number was 3,088, showing an increase in the number of deaths by nearly one-third in a matter of eight years, whereas the recent report of the Royal College of Physicians shows that in Great Britain in recent years as far as cancer of the other parts of the body is concerned, there has been a slight decrease, whereas those from lung cancer have gone ahead by leaps and bounds from 2,510 in 1926 to 25,000 deaths (the last figure available). Therefore there was a tenfold increase in that period, and those increases were in respect of lung cancer. That is why I feel it is so essential that these figures in South Africa should be analysed.</p>

<p>With regard to the statement made by the hon. member for Geduld that diesel fumes are a more important cause of lung cancer, I should like to quote further from the report now received in South Africa of the Royal College of Physicians. This is what they state on page 20&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Various independent authoritative bodies have been set up to examine the evidence of the relationship between cancer of the lungs and smoking, and have all agreed that it is established.</block>

<p>In the book they quote 216 different authorities, including the British Ministry of Health, the British Medical Research Council, the National Cancer Institute of Canada; the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health; the United States Study Group of Smoking and Health; the United States Public Health Service, and the World Health Organization. They state, however, that other causes had been put forward and they spent several pages in this book dealing with the various other causes. Now, surely, such an important body would not come to those conclusions without examining all the other possible causes. I want to quote from page 23&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The possibility that motor-vehicle exhausts might be an important cause of the recent increase in the incidence of lung cancer can be rejected since there is no increase in lung cancer death rates among road haulage workers, who would be expected to have excessive exposure to such gases.</block>

<p>Then they go on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question of the role of general pollution is more complex. The relationship of smoking with lung cancer has been shown to hold in both rural and urban areas, but death rates from lung cancer are higher in urban areas than in rural areas. These differences can be accounted for only in part by differences in smoking habits between inhabitants of urban and rural areas.</block>

<block name="quote">There is the observation that the death rate from lung cancer in Finland has been the second highest in Europe and only slightly less than in Britain, although the population is largely rural and there appears to have been little air pollution. The people have long been heavy cigarette smokers, and this suggests that smoking is more important than air pollution.</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7455-7456" refersTo="page_0974"/>We are therefore left with the hypothesis that habitual cigarette smoking over many years is a cause, in the ordinary sense of lung cancer.</block>

<p>The conclusion they arrive at is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The strong statistical association between smoking especially of cigarettes, and lung cancer is most simply explained on a casual basis. The conclusion that smoking is an important cause of lung cancer, implies that if the habit ceased the death rate from lung cancer would eventually fall to a fraction, perhaps on-fifth, or even, among men, to one-tenth of the present level.</block>

<p>The matter that was brought up by the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) is most important and he has reiterated to some extent, what we on this side of the House have previously asked for. We feel that if the hon. the Minister is going to do anything to control the spread of tuberculosis and if he is really earnest in his efforts to find the source, and stop the spread of tuberculosis, I think he must, in conjunction with the Minister of Mines, make up his mind who is going to control the pneumoconiosis and silicosis diseases that affect people working on the mines. It is quite apparent, to all of us who know anything about the matter, that one of the great sources of the spread of tuberculosis is due primarily to Natives who have been working on the mines. I would like to support what the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) has said, and I hope that in due course we will have some opportunity of discussing this matter more fully and in detail so that we can make recommendations to the Minister to see whether or not the health services as now provided for in relation to pneumoconiosis and silicosis and allied dust diseases on the mines, cannot, to some extent, be taken over by the Minister of Health.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with a matter which I understand is at present in the hands of the Minister. About 18 months ago, the hon. the Minister appointed a commission to investigate the high cost of medicine and medical services. I think it will be called the Snyman Commission. We hoped that the report of the commission would have been given to the Minister as soon as it was completed. We hoped that there would be no delay in ascertaining the causes of the high cost of medicine and medical services. We hoped that no sooner had the Minister received the report, than he would table it in this House. However if my information is correct, this matter has been in the hands of the Minister for some time. My information may be incorrect, but in any case what I do want to say to the Minister is this, that if he has got a report and if he had an opportunity to study the report, he should come to this House before the end of the Session and tell us what the Snyman Commission has found. It is no good us having to wait for years after a report like this has been finalized and then to decide what we are going to do in the matter. This is a matter of urgency. It affects not only the population of this country as such, but it affects the medical services that are required for the treatment of disease and it also affects the medical aid societies particularly. I would urge the hon. the Minister strongly to give to this House those findings which he has available. If he has not had the report, he should make it his business to get the report finalized soon, because what use is it to us if we get a report relating to last year and only have it presented to this House next year? It will only mean that the report will be outdated and valueless. I will ask him please to do what he can in this matter and not wait but to start immediately to implement those recommendations which can be implemented immediately. He should see to it that these costs are brought down to reasonable level as soon as possible. I have found during the past few months that there is no ceiling to the rising costs. Costs in hospitals have gone up tremendously; the costs in nursing homes for patients have gone up tremendously. Recently in the Cape the hospital services that are provided for those people who cannot afford private treatment have also gone up. The Minister if he has this report has got no business to retain the information unduly.</p>

<p>The second point I want to deal with is the shortage of medical personnel in our country to-day. I raised this matter some time ago, and the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) took part in the debate. He tried to illustrate that there was not a real shortage, that the position was really that too many doctors flock to the large towns and left the platteland denuded of medical services. However, I am telling the Minister now that unless he faces the position fairly and squarely, there is going to arise a state of affairs in the near future as far the health services of this country are concerned, which will be disastrous. I find that the universities that are able to provide a medical course have restricted the entrance of students in the first year. They pick what they consider are the best students. They have to be in the main students who have got a first class matriculation pass, and the rest of the students can only come in if vacancies exist. Now firstly, I feel that it is difficult to assess a man&#x2019;s ability to be a doctor on his matriculation pass. We have far too many youngsters who are excluded from the university who have not reached a first-class matric. If you go back, you will find that many people who have made a success in the medical history of this country, have not been in the first-class matriculation category. I plead that those people be given an opportunity to enter <span class="col_7457-7458" refersTo="page_0975"/>the universities. But how are we going to do it if there is not sufficient room for these people? The existing universities have got to be expanded to accommodate those people who want to become doctors. Secondly, it is my contention that there is room in this country for another medical school, and whether that medical school is going to be in Bloemfontein or in East London or whether it is going to be in Port Elizabeth &#x2026;</p>

<p>With due respect, Mr. Chairman, I cannot divorce the shortage of medical personnel from the training at the universities, and I therefore ask that the hon. the Minister should give serious attention to this matter. I ask the Minister firstly to investigate the possibility of opening the doors of our existing universities to more medical students so that we will be able to produce more doctors in this country and secondly, to investigate the position of building a further medical school in a university town. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that it is high time that he took advice from me and open up the Barangwanath Hospital for non-White students. They should be trained to become doctors there. If he does not do that he will be unable to provide a sufficient and an efficient medical service to the Bantustans which the policy of this Government envisages for the future. Where is the hon. the Minister going to find personnel to provide the necessary medical services to the non-White countries that are going to arise around our own White South Africa? I do not know.

<p>I should just like to ask your permission to submit three matters relating to mental hospitals to the hon. the Minister. The first relates to the position of male nurses. I should like to refer particularly to those nurses who have more than 15 years service. Appointments of nurses to the post of charge nurse take place according to seniority. There are not sufficient charge nurse posts so that male nurses who already have a long period of service and have rendered very good service during that period can be given promotion as charge nurse. I personally know of nurses who have given from 15 to 23 years good and faithful service and who cannot be given promotion because there are so many of them and, because, as I have said, the promotion to charge nurse posts takes place according to seniority. It is the position that these people regularly act as charge nurses. They act as charge nurses on at least two days or two nights per week in the section of the hospital where they are. One feels that to these people who have had such a long period of service and given such good service and who have to assume so much responsibility, a concession should if possible be made. I want to ask whether special attention cannot be given to their position. I can perhaps make three submissions for the consideration of the hon. the Minister. The first which I should like to make is that more charge nurse posts should be created so that people, after let us say 15 years&#x2019; good service as nurses, will normally come into consideration for an appointment as charge nurse. In the second place, if that cannot be done, can a post of acting charge nurse not be created so that these people who act from time to time as charge nurses can be appointed in that category. And if this also cannot be done, can consideration not be given to compensating them for the work which they do as charge nurses, when they have whole hospitals or parts of hospitals under their supervision for a day or a night. I shall appreciate it particularly if the hon. the Minister will give this matter his very serious consideration.</p>

<p>The second matter which I should like to submit to the hon. the Minister is whether he cannot consider laying down that appointments to mental hospitals, that is to say those in the lower grade, should not be made exclusively by the administrator or the head of the hospital, but that they will only make the necessary recommendations in order of merit, and that the hon. the Minister or an official whom he might appoint will then make those appointments himself.</p>

<p>The third matter which I should like to submit to him is whether he will not have an investigation instituted into the rentals for their homes paid by the people who are employed at the Komani Hospital in Queens town. It is my impression that their rentals have recently been increased unreasonably and also that this has been done arbitrarily. This is causing dissatisfaction amongst the staff and I shall welcome it greatly if the matter can be investigated and if it can be investigated by a departmental committee.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with a question of malnutrition in general and kwashiorkor in particular. While I appreciate that the treatment of disease and sickness falls mainly within the purview of the provinces, I submit that the matter of malnutrition is something which is of vital interest to the country as a whole and to the Department of Health. I feel that in our country we are fortunate in that we have the remedy to this scourge in our own hands. It is merely a question of direction, co-ordination and distribution. I should like to refer briefly to the annual report of the Secretary of Agricultural Economics and Marketing for 1960-1. On page 1 it is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Generally speaking the year under review was exceptionally favourable as regards agricultural production&#x2026;. Both the physical volume of production and the value thereof constituted a new record. However, <span class="col_7459-7460" refersTo="page_0976"/>with the further increase in the production of those field crops and pastoral products which marketed chiefly in the Republic, the surpluses above local disposals has also increased.&#x2026; As a result of this the Republic has for a few years now been exporting surpluses of some products at prices which were insufficient to cover the local prices plus the transport and other costs&#x2026; Not only do these surpluses show a greater loss per unit presently than during the most recent few years, but also the magnitude of the surpluses is at a record level.</block>

<p>On the second page of the same report they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In some circles the thought has been expressed that consideration should be given to a limitation of production by means of quotas. There is, however, still so much room in South Africa, not only for improved marketing, but also for better feeding, that the emphasis should rather be an increase in the local consumption than on a limitation of production.</block>

<p>At this stage, Mr. Chairman, the report does mention that the matter is receiving expert attention in regard to the matter of surpluses. They refer to the question of local consumption and surpluses and they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection it may also be mentioned that the Ministers of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and of Bantu Administration and Development have also constituted an inter-departmental committee with certain representatives of certain large municipalities to determine how the marketing and consumption of food products could be promoted amongst the urban Bantu population.</block>

<p>I submit that this is not only a problem affecting the urban Bantu population, it affects the poorer people in the European, Coloured and Indian communities as well. On that basis alone it seems most essential that representatives of the Department of Health should play an important part in this coordinating committee with a view to making sure that the surpluses are used to good effect as far as malnutrition is concerned. When one goes on to consider the various surpluses this report is very enlightening. We find, for example, that on 16 May 1961 there were 100,000 bags of dried beans still on hand. On page 14 they refer to the Cape Town milk scheme, which is a local scheme dealing with a purely local area, but the final remark is also of significance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The price at which a distributor may purchase milk from a producer was fixed at 26&#x00BE;c, per gallon. During the 12 months under review the surplus amounted to an average of 11,900 odd gallons per day. The net realization from the sale of this surplus amounted to 13.7c per gallon.</block>

<p>May I just refer to the question of the egg surplus too, Mr. Chairman? This seems to have caused a certain amount of trouble as far as the disposal overseas is concerned by virtue of the unfavourable market overseas. I was very surprised to see in yesterday&#x2019;s newspaper that we were trying to sell eggs overseas. I believe a member of the Egg Board is going overseas to sell these eggs because they have a good market, because they have strong shells. I should like to suggest that these eggs could be used in South Africa to build a nation of strong people to exploit all the resources with which this country is so well endowed. In the same newspaper one reads &#x201C;18,000 non-White children in Durban nearly half of them under the age of three, are in serious need of proper food&#x201D;. If we take the matter a little bit further, Sir, there is the question of bananas. This has been dealt with already but I would like to point out that, from a medical point of view, Gelfand in his book &#x201C;The Sick African&#x201D; recommends bananas in the diet of children who are being treated for kwashiorkor. Referring particularly to kwashiorkor, one finds from figures that last year in Durban 1,137 children were admitted to King Edward VIII hospital suffering from kwashiorkor, 364 died. The cost is estimated by one source as R90 to treat each child. So, on the basis of simple arithmetic it means that last year the province had to spend at least R102,000 odd in the treatment of kwashiorkor. Later figures indicate that this cost is rising, because now it is estimated that it cost R3.45 per day, and the course of treatment to cure a child of kwashiorkor is now R103. Statements have been made in which, I think, the position is underestimated, when it is said that 1c per day per child will prevent kwashiorkor. I do believe that the money that would be required to be spent on the prevention of kwashiorkor, bears no relation to the amount that is required to treat these poor sufferers of this dreaded disease. I realize, Sir, that there are many volunteer organizations who are playing a major part in dealing with this problem, but I submit that it is beyond their capacity to coordinate matters of food surpluses and to arrange for the distribution of surpluses in the various parts of the country where they are needed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if we were engaged in a shooting war we would soon find ways and means to distribute large quantities of food to large numbers of people in very inaccessible spots if it became necessary. I submit that we are engaged in a cold war, a cold, protracted war against starvation and malnutrition and the forces at our disposal should be used to combat this very serious menace.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I welcome the fact that during these last years the hon. the <span class="col_7461-7462" refersTo="page_0977"/>Minister has seen fit to follow the advice given by this side of the House to put forward amendments to the Mental Disorders Act of 1916, as amended in 1944 with the two amendments which were put forward last year, 1961.I would like to quote from the speech made in 1959 concerning the Mental Disorders Act by the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford). On 3 June 1959 the hon. member for Durban (Central) made this point (Hansard Vol. 101 col. 7256)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There should be no special formality for the admission of patients to mental hospitals. They should not be obliged to sign an application for admission or to give formal notification to leave.</block>

<p>This is important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ordinary patient who is ill goes in by the hospital door. He is accepted there and seen by a doctor and directed to a ward; but not in the mental service. Two people have to certify that he is insane and he must go to a special hospital.</block>

<p>I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this admission of patients to mental hospitals to-day. The position is that those patients who wish to be admitted to a mental hospital have to go through a great deal of formality. Our present Mental Disorders Act, I feel, does not go far enough in this way. Further amendments are necessary. I feel this is very important because of the new Act which has recently been passed overseas; both in Britain and in the U.S.A. they have recently introduced new mental health Acts. The new British Act has revolutionized in its way the whole concept of mental health. Because there are now less formalities for the patient to be admitted into a mental hospital. The stigma of admission which remains in our Act is what I should like the Minister to consider very seriously and to adjust it more in line with the admission of the ordinary patient. I feel that there are three types of patients. There is the certified patient, the voluntary patient and the temporary patient. In the British Mental Disorders Act they have retained one or two categories for a small percentage of the cases, but the vast majority of mental cases do not require to go through very complicated formalities before they are admitted.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for the announcement to the effect that 100 patients are to be removed from the Alexandra Institution here in the Cape to Stikland and that 100 Coloured patients will be admitted to fill those vacancies. While we appreciate this, Sir, I should like to point out that over the years the position has become very serious indeed. As I mentioned earlier, 110 cases have been reported at one voluntary organization over the past eight months, cases which are of the utmost urgency. Over the years the mental suffering to which parents who were in the unfortunate position of having such children, have been subjected, has been tremendous. They could not do anything with the children but keep them at home. Many cases have been recorded where the mothers had to chain the child to a solid object in the home while they had to go and work to earn the bread for the family. Those children have often been locked up in closets or cupboards. The matter is very urgent, Sir, and while the Department is doing something about it, I want to make a special plea to the Minister that an endeavour should be made to cope with the situation as it presents itself at the moment. This position to which I refer is only in respect of Cape Town and its immediate environments. We know nothing about the rest of the country because no records are available.</p>

<p>There is one further matter I should like to raise with the Minister. I have had some correspondence with his Department in this regard before. Representations have been made to me from time to time in regard to mental hospitals in my constituency. As far as the Coloured people are concerned there is a mental hospital at Port Alfred and one at Fort Beaufort. I am not quite sure whether one should call them mental hospitals or mental institutions; I think in most cases they are both. I will come back to that point. The position is this, Sir, that no difference is made between the Coloured and African patients at those institutions both as far as their housing and their treatment are concerned. In raising this matter, I do not want it to be construed as racialism. Unfortunately we have the situation in South Africa that your social status is largely dependent on the colour of your skin or your race. It might be argued that a mental patient in such an institution or hospital would have no regard to where he or she was, but you have to consider the relatives and the next-of-kin. They take an interest in that patient. I know of a case where it took the family months before they succeeded in getting the mother removed to Valkenburg so that she could be housed with patients of her own race. I know of another very pathetic case. The hospital superintendent himself brought it to my notice. It is the case of a Coloured school teacher who became a psychotic. On appearance she would have been judged to be White and she was housed in an institution where she was together with the most primitive Africans from the Transkei. They spoke a different language, had different customs, different habits and even eating different food. The staff consisted of Africans and this Coloured school teacher had to be treated and attended by them.</p>

<p>It is perfectly obvious that with the development which is taking place in regard to the future independence of the Transkei etc., that the position in regard to these institutions which I have in my constituency would change in the future. When this change is effected I think something should be borne in mind, something which has been the experience over the years in regard to all mental institutions. As we know we have a place called Valkenburg here in Cape Town. Over the years a stigma has become attached to the very name. We say in Afrikaans &#x201C;hy meet Valkenburg toe gaan&#x201D;, inferring that he is mad. This is very wrong, Sir, because there are so many different types of mental patients. You get the neurotic type and even the acute psychotic type for whom there is a hope of recovery. They may go to such an institution with the hope of recovering and many of them actually recover completely, and return to society, but a certain amount of stigma attaches to them as though they were chronic psychotics who never recover. In other words, Sir, what I have in mind is this that if there is to be reorganization in future this aspect should be borne in mind. If a person is a chronic psychotic, <span class="col_7465-7466" refersTo="page_0979"/>or if his age is such that there is no hope of his ever recovering, he should be sent to an infirmary or an institution specially maintained for that type of person. But the person who suffers a temporary illness such as the neurotic, neuro-psychotic or even the acute psychotic, where there is hope that he will recover, should go to a general hospital. I think that principle should be observed right through as far as mental patients are concerned, particularly in the case of the Coloured people.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>One of the first matters raised here has been that of kwashiorkor. The hon. members for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) and Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) have raised it. I want to remind them that kwashiorkor is caused by a protein deficiency. In other words, it would be pointless to provide poor people with food of any kind, because it will not cure them, but only food which is rich in protein. The only surplus food which we have with a high protein content is milk, but this certainly does not apply to bananas. The hon. member has referred to what a certain expert has said about the provision of bananas to people who are suffering from a protein deficiency, but this is not in line with the experience and knowledge of medical science. The provision of food to a child suffering from kwashiorkor will not be of any avail unless it has a high protein content. I agree with the hon. member that kwashiorkor is widespread in South Africa. It is calculated in the vicinity of Cape Town that there are no less than 22,000 children suffering from kwashiorkor, but I want hon. members to consider the causes. We must remember the simple fact that kwashiorkor can be prevented by the provision of a negligible amount of milk powder or milk. One only needs to give a child 2d. worth of milk powder per day, and he will never suffer from kwashiorkor. Why has kwashiorkor become such a big problem in recent years? It was not such a big problem in previous years. One of the reasons is that the mortality rate has dropped so considerably as a result of the combating of diseases such as malaria and fever in South Africa and Africa. Previously the mortality rate amongst young children was so high that parents could bring up their children within the means of their disposal, but to-day it is no longer possible. Consequently, one of the primary problems in Africa to-day is the fact that there are not planned families. In the cases of the Whites one does not find kwashiorkor on a large scale, but amongst the Bantu and the Coloureds it is a serious problem. But do not think that this is only the position in South Africa. A little while ago one of the executive council members in Basutoland referred to what a tremendous problem it is in that country. One of the first problems is to teach the non-Whites to have less children. [Interjections.] It is pointless to say that the non-Whites are so terribly poor. It only costs 1s. 3d. per week to keep a child healthy but if one has six or seven children that is quite a big amount. In other words, unless one is prepared to teach the non-Whites that it is in their own interests to plan their families, one will never find a solution for this problem.</p>

<p>A further question which has arisen is how we are to reach the child who needs the milk? I want to ask the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) this. If she sees the problem in this way, then it is pointless saying that we must give those children food. If one gives food, one does not give it to the children but to their parents and then it goes to the husband and never reaches the child. In other words, that is no solution. This is the problem with which we have always been faced. I should like to give the head of the Cape Town Municipal Health Service and the chief medical officer of the Divisional Council credit for starting to seek a solution and for showing us the way. They developed a system in Cape Town whereby they have made it possible for the powder to reach the child and not the parent, and have achieved tremendous success. Last year I informed the House that the Government had set aside a certain amount for launching a pilot scheme, i.e. two schemes in Cape Town, one in Pretoria and one in Natal, to see whether we could not devise a scheme whereby the protein can reach the child. I want to thank most sincerely the officers of the Department and of the municipalities who were engaged on this scheme for showing that we can eventually develop a scheme which will in fact be effective. But hon. members will realize that if in the vicinity of Cape Town alone there are 22,000 children suffering from kwashiorkor, what the extent is of kwashiorkor throughout South Africa amongst the Bantu and the Coloureds? It is taking on tremendous proportions. It is making it simply impossible for any Government to take action aimed at <span class="col_7467-7468" refersTo="page_0980"/>feeding every child in every family. We must therefore find another solution, and it has been found. The solution is to bring the parents back gradually once again to the realization of the value of milk. The schemes which we have undertaken in the Cape, Pretoria and Durban have had the wonderful result that the parents who originally could obtain cheap milk as a result of the Government&#x2019;s subsidy, have come so much under the realization of the value of milk and milk powder that in the course of time they have started buying that milk themselves. Here in the Cape, within a comparatively short period, 75 per cent of the parents who originally obtained subsidized milk, have started buying it with their own money. We have therefore had an interesting experience, namely that we have not only saved the child, but that we have also taught the parents to keep their children healthy. If this is the effect of the schemes which we have undertaken, we can educate our non-White people by means of a comparatively small expenditure to appreciate the value of milk. The Government has now agreed that we can extend these schemes and has made R20,000 available for the next year. We shall therefore be able to assist a larger proportion of our non-Whites. I hope that we shall be able to solve the problem of kwashiorkor in this way.</p>

In other words, by subsidizing mealie-meal, we will be subsidizing the parents again, and we are trying to reach the child, because it is the child who suffers from the deficiency.</p>

<p>No, we have not carried out any experiments in that regard.

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) has raised one or two matters. The one is the fact that there should be fewer formalities when mental patients are being admitted to hospital, and at the same time that there should be more institutions such a Tara. The hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) has also raised an important point, namely the stigma which attaches to our large mental hospitals because they are regarded as madhouses&#x2014;not because the treatment is bad, because it is excellent. Perhaps I should explain to hon. members what the latest developments are. The position is that it is very essential that the person be treated timeously. The obvious solution is that one should make it possible for such a person for example, to undergo an hour&#x2019;s treatment from time to time and then to return to his work. That is the ideal solution. It is pointless our having large institutions such as Weskoppies. At every large hospital we have to make those facilities available so that the person who has had a light attack can go there and be quickly healed. We are faced with the disturbing fact that under the tension of modern life more and more persons are evincing mental deviations. In recent years we have been taking active steps to meet this problem. We are engaged on negotiations with the provincial authorities which control the large hospitals to help us and allow every large hospital to have a section where our psychiatrists can help people&#x2014;in other words, a type of out-patients&#x2019; section. We have already had negotiations with Pretoria hospital and we already have a large number of beds available there. This section is run by the staff of Weskoppies. They are also negotiating with the other provincial authorities and I hope that with the co-operation we are enjoying we shall be able to solve this problem. At the same time everywhere in our large cities, under the leadership of the National Council for Mental Health, clinics have been set up where members of the staff of that council meet patients. We are therefore, already making it far easier for such people to enter hospitals. We have not yet been able to abolish all the formalities in regard to admission, but the large institutions are to an ever-increasing extent becoming places for the treatment of chronic case or persons who have to be there for long periods. For this reason it is essential that certain formalities should be observed. I therefore hope that with this integration of the ordinary hospitals with our mental services, and also with the integration of the staff of the ordinary hospitals <span class="col_7469-7470" refersTo="page_0981"/>with those of our mental hospitals, we will gradually remove the stigma. The House will remember that hitherto there has been another problem as regards our mental institutions because in the past they were regarded as prisons because in actual fact they were prisons. Poor people for whom there was no remedy and who were a danger to the community were simply locked up. That is why they gained the name of &#x201C;madhouses&#x201D; or &#x201C;prisons&#x201D; although the treatment provided was excellent. But in the course of time we have found that the medical profession has come to regard these as institutions apart. We gradually found that fewer and fewer medical men wanted to study psychiatry so as to make their services available to the large mental institutions so that we were forced to move in a new direction. We therefore had to try to bridge this gap between the mental institution and the other hospitals, and we are doing so in various ways. We are doing so for example by making it easier for young doctors to take psychiatry as one of their subjects. But we are also creating a large number of posts in our mental institutions for young doctors who wish to specialize and we are even changing the titles of the doctors in our mental institutions so that they correspond with the titles used in ordinary hospitals. It is strange, but the fact that in the case of a mental institution one refers to the head as the &#x201C;physician superintendent&#x201D;, whereas an ordinary hospital has a &#x201C;superintendent&#x201D;, makes the young doctors think that it is not a hospital. For this reason we are changing all these titles so that they correspond to those of an ordinary hospital. It may seem strange to hon. members, but in our entire mental service to-day we only have 11 specialist psychiatrists. We must now take every possible step to ensure that we increase their number. We have succeeded in having a psychiatry course introduced at the University of Pretoria. Because we are breaking down this stigma, this wall, eight students are already taking the course. At the University of the Witwatersrand through our endeavours a diploma for psychiatric medicine has been introduced and there are already seven candidates who are receiving their practical training at Tara and partly at Weskoppies. Then the S.A. College of Physicians is offering an examination in psychiatry for persons who are not studying at those universities and we already have two candidates who are studying for that examination and two from Valkenburg. We have created ten posts of clinical assistant, three at Valkenburg, three at Sterkfontein, and four at Weskoppies. and all these posts have already been filled. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that at the moment we only have 11 psychiatrists, we have approximately 29 persons who at the present time are undergoing training. This will to a large extent help in overcoming the problem which the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) raised when he discussed the shortage of trained medical men. We must face the fact that the estimate of the National Bureau for Educational Research is probably correct, namely that by the year 1965 there will be a shortage of approximately 2,000 doctors. We must not forget that to-day we already have a shortage of doctors in practically every field. We have a shortage in the Provincial hospitals, in State hospitals, in the Provincial Administrations and in my Department. I agree that we must take steps to ensure that this shortage is met. We have already done so in recent years by improving salaries. This has had results. May I just remind the hon. member for Rosettenville of the facts. In 1958 we recruited three additional doctors to our Department. In 1959 there were nine; in 1960 there were 13; and I think we must ascribe this partly to the fact that the salaries have been increased. But we have not relied on that exclusively. We have had to take further steps. In 1960 we obtained permission from the Government to create ten medical bursaries of R600 per annum, and we have granted these bursaries to selected students in their fifth and sixth years, with great success. In 1960 we granted ten bursaries; in 1961, 14 and in 1962, 15&#x2014;a total of 39. Every one of these students is obliged to remain in the service of the State for a few years. I do not want to say that these students will remain in the public service all their lives, but I have sufficient confidence in them to believe that they will remain in our service for a number of years. I feel that once these students appreciate the value of the service they render their country and their people in the Department, many of them will remain there.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the points raised by the hon. member for Queens town (Mr. Loots). In the first place he has discussed the question of male nurses. The position which the hon. member has described is quite correct. There is a large number of male nurses who simply feel that they cannot make any headway. But we have now created a number of posts of charge nurses. One unfortunately finds that so many of the male nurses fail to apply to become nurse-in-charge. The result is that by so doing they lose promotion. Many male nurses are only too inclined to remain in a specific place rather than apply for promotion elsewhere, and in that way they lose promotion. We felt that we should also improve their position by other means and that it might improve the position considerably if we introduced a merit system so that in future every man will not be automatically promoted but only if he really shows that he is outstanding at his work. The man who does best is the man who will get promotion. I hope therefore that this will also bring about greater satisfaction amongst the staff. But there is another approach to the problem, and that is that many male nurses are perhaps doing therapeutic work, many of them are people who do supervisory work and these people feel that the description &#x201C;male nurse&#x201D; is not the appropriate designation. The Department is also giving serious consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member has referred to the rentals. <span class="col_7471-7472" refersTo="page_0982"/>I want to assure him that I shall go into that matter immediately.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) has raised the problem of rabies. I think we can accept that rabies is endemic to South Africa, but that it is perhaps a new type of rabies which we have encountered in recent years, first in the Northern Transvaal and later in Zululand. When it broke out in 1955 in the Northern Transvaal all the dogs in that area were immunized by the Veterinary Services Division, but in 1961 this new type of rabies also made its appearance in Northern Zululand. The hon. member for Durban (Central) has made the accusation that we failed to create a neutral zone in Zululand in which all dogs could be immunized to prevent the spread of this disease. The indications, however, are that the disease spread in a different way; that it spread as a result of the fact that dogs which might have been the carriers of the virus were transported over long distances by their owners.</p>

<p>I have never heard that the virus is endemic to a banana. Mr. Chairman, the hon. member has also criticized the Department for not having used the new &#x201C;duck egg embryo vaccine&#x201D; sooner. There are actually two types of vaccine which are generally used. Hitherto there has been the old type, the semple type of vaccine. That type was used in the past but it is not always free of danger. It happens in very rare cases that it can nave serious consequences for the person who is inoculated with that vaccine. A new vaccine has now been developed in America, namely the &#x201C;duck egg embryo vaccine&#x201D;. This vaccine has only recently been made available. A year before the outbreak in southern Natal our Department was in touch with Geneva and with the manufacturers of it, but it could not be provided at that time. It was only during the outbreak in Natal that it was possible to obtain that vaccine. When we take the facts into account, therefore, we cannot accuse the Department of having been negligent. I think the Department has done its utmost to be at the spearhead of developments.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the half-hour. Sir, over a number of years now we have been warning various Ministers of Agriculture and the Ministers of Agricultural Economics and Marketing about the surpluses that are building up against the farmers in South Africa. These surpluses are creating difficulties that are going to have serious repercussions upon the farmers of the country. The Minister is faced with the position to-day that he has to go overseas to find markets for these <span class="col_7473-7474" refersTo="page_0983"/>products, in competition with similar products produced possibly at a lower cost of production and possibly even subsidized. But there is worse competition than that, and that is that many of those products that have been dumped on those markets are sold on a long-term credit basis. Sir, there is one thing that is worrying us on this side of the House, and we think it most important. We feel that the Minister is taking the line of least resistance in dealing with this matter. He is reducing the prices to the consumer, regardless of the rising cost of production that we have throughout the country, and this will solve none of our problems. I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a number of these factors in the hope that he will take some notice of them. In the first place interest rates have been raised from five to seven per cent. We have the iniquitous rate that has to be paid if it is a Land Bank bond, a rate which, when it carries insurance, is equal to approximately 10 per cent. These rising costs are referred to in the Minister&#x2019;s own report of 1961. Taking the figure of 100 as the basis for 1938, we find that the price of implements has soared to 307, spare parts to 310, implements and spare parts to 308, trucks to 410, tractors to 268, and so we go on. Over the last eight years prices have risen in the order in which I have given them; implements by 36 points, spare parts 26, implements and spare parts 32, and trucks 72, while in the case of building material there has been a rise of 188. But even over the last year you still have an increase over and above that of five points in many of those essential items for production. Added to these you have repairs. I do not think the hon. the Minister needs to be reminded of what it costs to take any farm implement to a garage or a blacksmith to-day. Your labour charges have gone up 400 per cent and there are still demands for further increases. Then you have taxation and rates, and may I remind the Minister of what is taking place in the rural areas. Where you have had revaluation of farms, the valuations in many instances have been doubled and quadrupled. Does the hon. the Minister realize what that means to the farmer. Those divisional council rates on capital are mounting up against production costs. Over and above that we have rail age which is still mounting. Railage has increased six times over and above what it was. May I quote the figures. Let us take wool alone on which the rail age was 43 cents; to-day it is R2.72. Then there are the other costs of production in connection with that commodity which have risen from R2.08 to R9.52. Sir, these are all recent increases. There are also the distribution costs which are mounting up against the farmer, and in the face of that the Minister still risks the reduction of prices. We have with us all the time&#x2014;and I need hardly mention it again but I think I should&#x2014;the hail, the floods and the droughts that take their toll of stock. Is it any wonder that we have a depopulation of the platteland under those circumstances? Is it any wonder that agriculture has become an unpopular source of investment with investors.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that the hon. member who made that interjection does not agree with the reply that came from the Minister two or three years ago when we referred this very matter to him and when he said that he could do nothing about it unless he had control of land prices, control of production and control of distribution. Sir, the hon. the Minister and any decent Government in this country can settle this matter without those fascist ideas. Sir, the question of quotas was referred to in the last Vote that we dealt with a few minutes ago. The position is that if sugar quotas can be applied successfully to deal with over-production and surpluses of sugar, surely quotas could be introduced in the case of other products. Sir, the small man is one of the biggest producers in this country of many of the surplus commodities. Those men are gradually being eliminated by the land grabbers. What does the hon. the Minister intend to do about this, because those men have to be protected?</p>

<p>Sir, the Mealie Board has issued a report that is extremely interesting. It refers to the production costs in certain parts of the country, and I want to repeat them to the hon. the Minister because they reflect a shameful state of affairs, in the face of the fact that the Minister has now reduced the price to the producer. In the Transvaal High-veld the overall average cost of production is 271&#x00BD; cents; the price to the producer is 276 cents, leaving him a margin of cents per bag. Sir, what farmer can live on that? In discussing it generally I was told that there was an aftermath. Well, I am sorry for the farmer who has to depend on an aftermath mealie shucks for any profit plus 4&#x00BD; cents per bag of maize. There are other areas which are more favourably placed&#x2014;the Western Transvaal for instance where they have a margin of 80 cents. How can these men compete with the men producing that commodity in the Transvaal Highveld? Is the Minister doing anything about a change over from the product that is being produced there?</p>

<speech by="#warren">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>Surely that is a margin that needs investigation. The poor unfortunate producer gets 4&#x00BD; cents. Who gets the R1.20? Is the Minister satisfied about it? Sir, the Government asked us to improve our methods of farming and to mechanize. Well, we have responded and responded wonderfully; we have employed those improved methods of farming and we have mechanized, and this is the result. While these items which are essential for production are continually increasing in price, I take umbrage at the fact that the Minister employs the line of least resistance by saying, &#x201C;I am going to reduce prices&#x201D;. How they do it I do not know because they either have to go out of business or continue to mine their soil. The Minister knows full well that if we put our shoulders to the wheel to investigate this problem or surpluses, we might create some machinery whereby we could absorb the greater part of these surpluses, for better use in our own country. But he knows full well that they cannot be absorbed without the capacity on the part of the consumer to pay for them. That is the reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question. We have a rapidly increasing population in South Africa and it is up to us to see that the present population gets some improvement in emoluments so that it can at least absorb some of the surpluses. But above all other things we are losing thousands of head of stock that might reasonably be saved from the ravages of droughts and disease.</p>

<p>The Minister is bringing about precisely the same position in the dairy industry through the reduction in the price of butter fats. Herds have been built up on the present prices, and when you get a reduction in prices the herds must inevitably suffer. Those herds cannot be maintained at that standard when you have continual reductions, and I have no doubt, in view of what is stated in this report, that there may be further reduction. I note with interest in this report that the Minister talks in terms of the quality of our butter. I am extremely pleased to realize that he has at least come to the conclusion that the quality of our butter is an important issue in this whole matter. Sir, I have a little pamphlet here which was distributed by the Minister of Information, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A realistic export policy; it has always been the policy of the different Governments of this country to export products only after the requirements of the country itself have been met.</block>

<p>Well, the Minister is perfectly at liberty to read my speech. If I criticized it and we had butter in the country to distribute, I would remind the Minister that the year before that the Minister&#x2019;s counterpart in the other Department told me that he had had to import butter because he required butter to send to Rhodesia to full fil their order. That is what happened. The Minister knows that the quality of our butter is due to malpractices. Furthermore, he knows full well that it is due to the fact that we had to store that butter for lengthy periods of time to satisfy his requirements. However, let me go on quoting from this pamphlet&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This policy was carried out because it was alleged that South Africa is subject mainly to sporadic surpluses.</block>

<p>I think my hon. Leader, some six or seven years ago, dispelled that by pointing out to this House that we were then faced with enormous surpluses and that they were likely to increase, so they can hardly be called sporadic surpluses in 1962. Sir, this is a Government document, and it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To-day it is again apparent that it is the farmer who has to pay for this policy. This policy was probably responsible in part for the fact that we exported our inferior grade of butter&#x2026;.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I think they looked something like that hon. member. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, that that hon. gentleman has no right to make remarks of that kind. Let me go on quoting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Auction prices: During the year under review the weighted average price of all grades of beef at Johannesburg reached the low level of R10.33 per 100 lbs., in May and June 1961, after the high level of R12.17 per 100 lbs., in December 1960, compared with the previous year. The fluctuation between the highest and the lowest prices was considerably less, namely R3.14.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I deal with those individually, because that in fact is a deception. It is perfectly correct to suggest that it is, say R3.14 per 100 lbs., but no farmer sends 100 lbs. of beef down to the market. He sends a 500 or 600 lbs. beast down to the market, and the basis of R3.14 per 100 lbs. means that he loses R18.84 per beast or R180 per truckload. Sir, that is happening daily. In 1960-61 it was reduced to R11.04 per beast or, in other words, R110 per truck load of stock. What those people who are further away from rail heads have to put up with, I would not know. That is the true position. I want to impress upon the hon. the Minister that it is essential that that price margin be reduced. But in any case it will be seen from these records that the most they get for that is in round figures R12, or R10 now per 100 lbs. and that in round figures is 1s. per lb., and I would like to see the housewife who pays anything under 2s. per lb. for the beef she buys and if she wants the best, she has to pay more. I would ask the hon. the Minister what producer can stand for that; fluctuations of up to R180 per truckload cannot be stood by any farmer. What farmer can face a glutted market one day and a starved market the next day? In the one instance an increase of R180! It is unrealistic and unreasonable of the hon. the Minister to expect that from the farmers. That is being done while it is costing the meat producers of South Africa R2,000,000 to have so called stability in marketing. The control market system is costing us R2,000,000, Sir. I remember the days when we had ordinary auctions, and I can assure the hon. the Minister that the farmer at least had the right to take his oxen home if there was a variation in price of something like &#x00A3;9 per head. I want to ask the hon. the Minister: What has been achieved by placing meat on the hook? Sir, he has had these fluctuations which have brought about this unstability. Those are undeniable facts; Disastrous fluctuations! What is he going to achieve by removing permits? He has certainly removed a little bit of rascality, but if he thinks he can get any steady flow to markets without working out some scheme whereby that stock can be brought in as required, then the whole issue must become a failure. I ask the hon. the Minister: Is it any wonder that the producers find themselves in difficulties? The hon. the Minister must know of all these abuses, otherwise he has not been attending to his job. And you will find them in respect of almost every control board system we have in this country. He knows the abuses and he knows the shortcomings. It is impossible for the hon. the Minister to apply his mind to that position and set up some machinery as a result of which he can get more prompt action to try and stop this state of affairs? I want to assure the hon. the Minister that the farmers of South Africa can no longer stand it. As far as I am concerned, I have got to the stage where it just reminds me of the doctor who stood by and waited for his patient to die so that he could hold a post mortem. I want to say this to the hon. the Minister: Farming is getting into a worse state to-day than it has been for many years as a result of surpluses, as a result of reduced prices and as a result of increased costs of production.</p>

<p>I want to come to this question of drought relief. There are certain parts of the country when districts are declared drought stricken, where certain farmers are entitled to relief while others are completely precluded. I would ask the hon. the Minister to apply his mind to that also. Should a dividing fence decide whether a farmer on the one side farming on exactly the same lines as a farmer on the other side of the fence is treated differently?</p>

<p>Of course there are farmers in urban areas. May I give the hon. member an example? I can mention the case to him of a common age of 46,000 morgen. What happens there? They are farming there. Originally that land was given to them as farms. Why cannot they receive the same benefits? And I go further: That makes it impossible for the neighbours to get that relief. I admit that that became a racket and I think the Minister should counteract that position, but what about the other cases?</p>

<p>There is another item. &#x201C;Cubes&#x201D; are regarded as a processed food. Now under drought conditions to-day, the farmer is using cubes very extensively to save his stock. Why can he not get those cubes in a concentrated form under drought-stricken regulations as other foods?</p>

<p>The hon. member is merely displaying his ignorance, because the hon. Minister in April this year decided that he was going to get rid of this whole thing, and he has handed it over to his colleague, the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services. So the hon. member should keep quiet.</p>

<p>I want to refer very briefly to the question of quality. It is referred to extensively in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s report. If we want to get markets overseas for the surpluses, we have got to see to it that we are to put better mealies into the bags, better oats into the bags, better butter into wrappers, if we want to capture any markets overseas. Because if we are going on, as we have done in the past, to export products that are far below the standard quality, we can never expect to capture those markets, let alone hold them. I want to issue a warning to the hon. the Minister. The position as far as the destruction of good wholesome food is concerned, is having a nasty impact upon the minds of all people, let alone on that section of the community that can ill-afford to pay for them. The destruction of such food its going on continuously, and yet there are many people in South Africa who are living below the bread line who could well use that food. Even the export of foodstuffs at very reduced prices is having an impact on the minds of the people, who if they could get them at the export price, would willingly buy them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has spoken in very general terms, but he has made one or two points of which one can take note. But seeing that he has spoken about the great difficulties the farmers are experiencing, I find it very strange that he was completely destroying the Magna Charta of the farmers. Our country has always been prepared to introduce orderly marketing, and the former Marketing Council was established to exercise control over our products. But the hon. member is already talking about export products which we should sell in our country at a lower price. I wonder how on earth we shall ever achieve stabilization and how the farmers will be able to exist under such a scheme. We are sorry the price of mealies is not higher, but under the hon. member&#x2019;s scheme the price would fall still lower. Then I want to tell the hon. member he should not speak so lightly of the quality of our export mealies. I think we are producing a very good quality mealie in South Africa and I do not know of any case where there have been complaints about the mealies which have been exported. But export is absolutely essential for the farmer in South Africa. The Marketing Act was introduced to give us systems in terms of which we could control our domestic marketing. Under the National Party Government matters have developed to such a stage that to-day we have surpluses. If the hon. member had suggested a new scheme aimed at dealing with the export surpluses he would really have been doing something of value for the agricultural industry. But he has now <span class="col_7481-7482" refersTo="page_0987"/>asked that the export surpluses which are sold abroad at a lower price, should be kept in our country. If the farmer must pay for the prices which are received abroad for those mealies, the mealies would be still more expensive for the farmers to use as fodder than is the position to-day. That argument is obsolete.</p>

<p>We then turn to dairy products. We have our boards under the Marketing Act. Organized agriculture is absolutely in favour of the Marketing Act being upheld. That is why we have our various boards which must distribute or export every product in the country. With a view to development, and seeing that we now have surpluses, we may have to make amendments to the Marketing Act. There are certain improvements which can in fact be effected. But when we speak in such general terms, we must please not allow one thing, namely this venerable old Marketing Act which has kept our farmers on their farms, to be destroyed. The whole idea of the Marketing Act was to change the old emergency regulation system of the United Party. In the days when they fixed the price as they liked, and after the war when mealies rose in price, and they made a profit, they paid the profits which they made into the Treasury. At that time it was the National Party which built up the Stabilization Fund of the mealie farmers. It was Minister Havenga who said that this money belonged to the farmers and that his emergency regulation should be withdrawn and the farmers with the assistance of the Marketing Act should see to it that their house was put into order. The principle of building up a stabilization fund was then accepted and it has worked very well. But as a result of improved farming methods the yield per morgen has increased and we now have surpluses, and now at lease we have something on which to work. What else could the Minister do except to accept the advice of his Marketing Council? There is the cost of production plus a living wage, which can be used to determine a sound basis. How can one single hon. member criticize the Minister seeing that we have this machinery? But where we can help is to place our exports on a sound basis. We can say that we should have a larger Stabilization Fund as regards the export of mealies. Let the farmers then contribute in order to strengthen the Stabilization Fund. The Stabilization Fund is still strong enough to carry the mealie farmers at the moment. But let us do something of a practical nature in this direction, and seeing that the Government is supporting industrial development, I want to say that it should also to a certain extent stimulate the export of surpluses. But I want to say that if we are going to restrict the mealie farmer and say that he should not produce more, then we are only going to have chaos and the small farmers will disappear completely. But what we can in fact do is to make other arrangements for example as regards the railways, which will stabilize to a greater extent the cost of transport to the various harbours, something which will help the farmers. I feel that we can do something along those lines. But to place restrictions on production in South Africa to-day and to say: &#x201C;You can produce so many mealies and your neighbour can produce so many&#x201D;, will result in the worst possible chaos. The system we have has always yielded good results hitherto.</p>

<p>As far as meat is concerned, to-day we have a surplus of meat for the first time. We must now consider how we can dispose of this surplus. I think we have already made very great progress. The Minister has appointed a commission. The Minister appreciates, just as all of us do, the difficulties of transporting stock to the cities. We all realize that to-day there is over-production at one moment and the next moment there is under-production. Foot and mouth disease unexpectedly breaks out or there is some other setback. As far as that is concerned improvements are perhaps possible. Practical steps can for example be taken to provide improved slaughter facilities and improved refrigeration facilities. The Government is busy with that. The Meat Board is considering the problem. If the facilities are available to dispose of the surplus meat, we shall have greater stability. We shall have to have the co-operation of the businessmen. When we want to market, we have to compete with big businessmen. I do not want to mention names, but hon. members must please not think that these people are all exploiters. They must also make a living. But when the farmer and these big businessmen can co-operate, as regards exports as well, then we shall be able to make progress. I am convinced that the Minister will be quite prepared to extend the facilities in this regard. If we can form a utility company to dispose of our surplus meat, then our main problems as far as the meat farmers are concerned will be solved.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has now told us about the Marketing Act, but he has forgotten that we are the people who are responsible for the Marketing Act. The hon. member has referred to costs of production plus a reasonable living wage. But he must just tell us how, if the costs of production of mealies are always rising and all costs of production are rising all the time, while the prices paid to the farmer are falling, what is to become of the living wage? The hon. member was still <span class="col_7483-7484" refersTo="page_0988"/>saying in February this year that the farmers were doing badly. That is so. The position of the farmer is becoming worse by the day. His position is becoming worse all the time. Just read the report of the Land Bank. In 1956 loans totalling R8,500,000 were granted, in 1957 the amount was R9,000,000, in 1958 it was R10,500,000, but in 1959 the loans rose to R63,000,000 and in 1960 to R53,000,000.

From 1939 to 1960 it was never more than 2 per cent but in 1960 it rose to 3.4 per cent. The farmers are no longer in a position to pay. There is surely no one who doubts that the farmers&#x2019; position to-day is not good.</p>

<p>We should not export it. We should rather sell it at a lower price in the compounds of Johannesburg. We can only build up an export market if we export quality meat. The <i>Farmers Weekly</i> says that the Minister has stated he does not believe in the permit system, nor does he believe in the quota system. The quota system was recently introduced in order to prevent the piling up of slaughter stock at the markets. The quota system had to be implemented by the market agents. I want to say frankly that I think the Government has shifted its responsibility to the market agent because it knows it will be unpopular amongst the farmers. We cannot have the permit system, we cannot have the quota system. Then we are only left with the conditions which we had until recently, where the markets were overstocked so that stock had to wait 10 to 12 days before they could be slaughtered. That is the alternative. In brief, Mr. Chairman, the Government does not have a policy in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say something about tobacco. The small farmers are being forced off the farms because they cannot afford these prices. The tobacco market is shrinking. Less tobacco is being sold than previously. According to the Magaliesberg Tobacco Society, the decrease has been plus minus 3&#x00BD; per cent in the case of light tobacco, and in the case of dark tobacco plus minus 9 per cent. That, Mr. Chairman, is due to the high price of tobacco. It is due to the excise duties which this Government has imposed on tobacco. If it makes tobacco cheaper, more will be sold.

<p>I do not blame the United Party for criticizing the National Party Government. It is apparently their duty to criticize. However, the problem which faces the National Party is precisely the opposite from the one which faced the United Party. Under the policy which the United Party followed during the years that they were in power we were always faced with shortages. On the other hand, because of the policy which the National Party has been following all these years, that label has been changed. The National Party has encouraged and assisted the farmers to such an extent that they are to-day faced with surpluses. That shortsighted policy of the United Party of simply reducing the prices when there was an overproduction of mealies, of reducing the price when there was an over-production of meat&#x2014;although there was never a surplus of meat during their r&#x00E9;gime but a continual shortage&#x2014;that policy of theirs of regulating prices according to the production, discouraged the farmers and hampered the development of the country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Con-nan) makes a very big mistake in regard to the Marketing Act. It is not the United Party which sits on those benches to-day which introduced the Marketing Act, but the United Party under the leadership of the late General Hertzog, of which I was also a member. I was present at that time and let me add this that the opposition to the Marketing Act came from members of the United Party who until recently still sat on that side. The National Party of that time did not sound one discordant note, although they were in the Opposition at that time. The only discordant note which was struck right up to the bitter end, came from United Party members who until recently sat on the Opposition benches.</p>

<p>I do not deny that the farmers are faced with difficulties. But their difficulty is just the opposite, namely that they are faced with surpluses whereas there were shortages in the past. But it is not correct to say, as the hon. member for Gardens said, that they were in an extremely difficult position. Here I have the latest figures in regard to the repayment of loans advanced by the Farmers Assistance Board, and I can also refer to the Land Bank. An amount of R92,000,000 was advanced and of that R71,000,000 has already been recovered. An amount of R2,700,000 has been written off and in that amount is included a write-off of over 6 per cent in respect of the demobilization scheme which was embarked upon by that fund at the time. Actually the amount which has been written off is only 2.9 per cent. The amount outstanding to-day is R28,000,000. The scheme which was embarked upon last year was also surprisingly successful and large amounts are being repaid. I take off my hat to the farming community for what they have achieved over the years.</p>

<p>The problem which has arisen is this that because of the nature of the assistance and guidance which the farmers have been receiving from the Agricultural Department a position has developed where there is overproduction and that they are faced with surpluses to-day where there were shortages in the past. They have been producing the necessary food for the country to such an extent that there are tremendous surpluses today. I want to give mealies as an example. Ten years ago the crop amounted to between</p>

<p>20,000,000 and 30,000,000 bags and it was impossible for anybody to foretell that in the past few years the crop would amount to between 50,000,000 and 60,000,000 bags. Let me say this at once that the person who says that all the farmers will go insolvent on account of their mealie crops&#x2014;here I refer to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren)&#x2014;is wrong in saying that. He spoke about the Western Transvaal and he referred to the average yield and to the <span class="col_7487-7488" refersTo="page_0990"/>average costs. But let me tell him that the latest figures prove that in many cases those yields have been very much higher. Although a greater number of morgen of land are being ploughed the increase in the mealie production is due to the increase yield per morgen. As soon as the farmer pushes up his yield to 20 bags per morgen his costs drop. As the Western Transvaal have been pushing up their average to almost 16 bags, their costs have dropped to plus minus 15s. or 16s. per bag. That shows what development has taken place and that is due to the efforts of the farmer but it is also due to the assistance and guidance which have come from the Department of Technical Services&#x2014;the supply of hybrid seed, better seed and better equipment. In addition to that we have to admit that the farmers themselves have played a most important role. In general they have mechanized, only a very small number have not done so.</p>

<p>I do not know where the hon. member got his figures from in regard to tobacco. The latest figures which I have show that the production was 49,000,000 lbs. in 1948. There has been a decline in the production but the consumption amounts to 50,000,000 lbs. In the case of every product in this country both production and consumption have increased tremendously, with this qualification that the increase in production has been greater than the increase in the consumption. There is an in balance in that the consumption of the various commodities has not kept pace with the development of the farmer. This is a period which will have to be bridged. The question is how long will the farmer be able to continue on the basis on which he has developed over the past years, whether he will be able to keep up the pace and whether the development of the country will be able to keep pace. In that process we need all the assistance which the farming community can give, because they have attained wonderful achievements.</p>

<p>It is true that we are faced with tremendous surpluses. The hon. member for Gardens referred to a consignment of meat. Why did he not refer to the other consignments of meat?</p>

<p>That was an experimental consignment which was sent. That proves that we have fallen behind in this development but not in the sense in which the United Party fell behind and totally neglected to assist the farmers of the country to develop. That is the reason why the party opposite have no representatives from the platteland. I think the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) is the only member who represents a platteland constituency. The others have to move to the cities from the platteland in order to get a constituency.

<p>The hon. member for Christiana has referred to the consumption of tobacco. I said that there had been a decline.

<block name="quote">During the first half of the year 1961, in comparison with the same period of the previous year, there has been a decline of plus minus 3&#x00BD; per cent in the case of light tobacco and a decline of plus minus 9 per cent in the case of dark tobacco.</block>

<p>I can only say that one of the reasons is the increase in the excise duty. That is the reason why the consumption remains low, with the result that there are more and more surpluses.</p>

<p>We had those shortages because there was a terrific increase in the consumption during the war. During the r&#x00E9;gime of the National Party there was also difficulty in regard to meat. In 1932 we sold meat at 3d. and 4d. per lb. I sold it for that. The hon. member for Christiana also pointed out the way in which the farmers have been producing lately because of the guidance given by the Department of Technical Services. I say the farmers have produced well; they have done their duty and have done their share in producing as they should have produced. Their production has been better because their methods have improved. That is why they were able to reduce their production costs in some instances. But at the same time other costs have risen, as was mentioned by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and I do not wish to repeat that&#x2014;fertilizer, machinery, fuel, everything has gone up. Consequently production costs are higher to-day than in the past. I do not want to enlarge on the subject of mealies; the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town has already done so. The Free State Agricultural unions met recently at Bethlehem where the Free State mealie farmers expressed their dissatisfaction with the position. If the hon. member opposite is right when he says that prices are good and that <span class="col_7489-7490" refersTo="page_0991"/>they have not declined, then the farmers are not honest whep tfcey tell the Minister that they cannot make ends meet and I think they are honest people like we are. The wheat farmers are dissatisfied to-day because their prices have been reduced. The poultry farmers are in a difficult position; the pineapple industry, and the dairy industry are all in a difficult position. But I do not want to enlarge upon that at the moment.</p>

<p>What solution does the Minister offer to all these problems? The farmer must adapt himself to the changed circumstances! Production costs are rising; prices are dropping; it means in other words that the farmer must adapt his way of life to the profit he makes. If his profits drop he must adapt himself to that, and if eventually he makes no profit he must also adapt himself to that position. One of his main arguments is that the farmers have paid too much for their farms. There are farmers who have paid too much for their farms but how many farmers have purchased farms recently and paid too much? Many who purchased farms had the money to pay cash; not all of them have mortgages on their farms. Generally speaking the farmer is not over-capitalized because fie paid too much for his farm. In any case, taking the present production costs into account, what is an economic price for land to-day? Let me give an example. I want to take a farm of 13,000 morgen as an example. This farm can carry 3,000 sheep. If those sheep yield an average wool production of 10 lbs. which comes to R3 per sheep, his revenue is R9,000 from his wool. If he sells 600 sheep at R6, he gets R3,600. His gross income, therefore, is R12,600. The figure of R600 is somewhat on the low side, but I have not made provision for the sheep which die. If you add those it will be right. What is his expenditure? interest on the capital invested in the stock, namely on R20,000, will be R1,400. Interest on the capital invested in machinery, light lorries, will be R400; depreciation R1,200. Six labourers R1,400; shearing money R150; wool packs R250; extra labour at shearing time R120; transport during the year R200; dipping material, vaccine etc., R200; fuel, tyres, etc., R800; taxes R400; repairs, erosion work, etc., R400; that gives you a total of R6,920. I think that the farmer is entitled to R4,000 for his own living, because the living expenses of a farmer is much higher than that of anybody else in that the schooling of his children cost him very much more. It costs him a great deal of money to keep four children at school. That means that his expenditure, including his living costs, amount to R10,920. In other words, he is left with R1,680. If I work it out further and I take that farm at R2 per morgen, I arrive at a figure of R1,820, so that there is a loss of R140. In that case what can be regarded as an economic land value? I just want to point out that the Minister cannot tell us that the difficulty is due to the fact that the farmers pay too much for their farms. I notice that the president of the Eastern Province Agricultural Union has said that they reckon that a farmer received 2.09 per cent interest on his capital, which is more or less what I said. That is the return which the farmer gets on his capital to-day. In other words, he simply cannot make a living.</p>

<p>I think this Government wants to get rid of the surpluses and the way in which it wants to dispose of those surpluses is to push a number of farmers out of the agricultural industry so that the surpluses will be reduced in that way. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) has painted such a sombre picture that he has practically moved us to tears; and we have now had the same story from the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan). We readily admit that some of the farmers are having a very difficult time. But to come with these stories and to generalize and to allege that the entire farming community is going under, surely is not true.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Gardens said in his previous speech that the farmer was going under. Those were his words. When you say that it can only mean one thing and that is that the entire farming community is going under. I say that is not true. The majority of our farmers are prosperous and their position is sound. The difficulties which are experienced in the farming industry are very diverse. I admit that farming in South Africa is not child&#x2019;s play. Our climate is very inconstant and the person who undertakes farming must be prepared to run great risks. You cannot get away from the fact that very great risks attach to farming in South Africa as a result of our changeable climate and uncertain rainfall. That is one of the main reasons for our farmers&#x2019; difficulties.</p>

<p>The Government does take it into account. That is why it is so sympathetic towards the farmer and that is why so many various forms of assistance are available to the farmer. A tremendous amount is being done to assist the farming community. If a section of the farming industry experiences difficulty assistance is rendered to it. No government in this country has given so much assistance to the farmers as the present Government. The hon. member for Gardens says that the farmer who farms on a small scale is going under. Some of them are quite prosperous. It depends on what they farm with. We admit that a farmer who only produces maize, for example, and who produces, <span class="col_7491-7492" refersTo="page_0992"/>say, 1,000 bags of maize per year, will not prosper, and even if his prices were doubled he would still not be able to make a decent living. You cannot turn an economic farming unit into an economic unit by increasing the price. The hon. member ought to know and understand that. Hon. members make the statement that the producers&#x2019; prices are continually declining and that production costs are rising. The price of our products has risen to a certain height and recently there has been a tendency for those prices to drop. That is true. The price of production incentives is rising and has risen. But hon. members should not generalize; they should produce figures. The hon. member opposite referred to the same book which I have here, namely the latest monthly bulletin for April, 1962. Hon. members are inclined to quote a few figures in order to try to prove a statement. I too can mention a few figures. Let us take production incentives in the first place. Here we have the index for cultivation implements namely 307; harvesting implement 378; others 233&#x2014;an average of 307. These are the latest figures, namely for October, 1961. Then we come to spare parts, 314; implements and spare parts 309; lorries 408; tractors 272. All these are non-consumable goods. If you look well after a tractor and an implement you can use it for ten years and longer and it will still give you good service. [Interjections.] I am a farmer and I know. You can come to my farm, Sir, and I will show you a few tractors which are older than ten years and they are still rendering good service because I have looked after them. These are non-consumable goods but goods which you can use for many years if you look well after them. I now come to the consumable goods: fertilizer 259; fuel, which is one of the most important production incentives, 195.</p>

<p>On page 114 my book shows the figure of 195. Dipping material, which is one of the consumable goods, 192. Let us now deal with the prices of the products: Winter grain (December, 1961, which is the latest figure they give here) 390; other grain 290; average 305. Wool and mohair 216. The average in respect of stock breeding products is 410. Dairy products 264. This is after there has been a decline. Slaughter stock 392. The combined index figure in respect of stock breeding and agriculture is 349. When you calculate the average, Sir, you will find that the increase in the price of the products has been greater than the increase in the price of production incentives. Hon. members do the senseless thing of giving one set of figures and generalizing. That type of argument holds no water. You have to keep count of the facts.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens went on to say that their party was responsible for the introduction of the Marketing Act. I give him a credit for the fact that the United Party was responsible for the introduction of the Marketing Act but they had the full support and whole-hearted co-operation of the then Opposition, the National Party. The trouble is, however, that the hon. members who introduced that Act, do not know it. The Marketing Act is an enabling Act to start off with, tions are nor accept them. That is the trouble, hon. member for Gardens this: When a maize board is appointed is it the Minister who appoints it.</p>

<p>The hon. member will forgive me if I do not follow him. I know that he spoke about the Marketing Act. The commodity I want to talk about is luckily outside that Act. It was big enough to have its own Act. Earlier on the Minister introduced an amendment to the Wool Commission Act and I raised certain matters at that stage and quite correctly you, Sir, ruled me out of order. It therefore becomes necessary for me again to discuss the matter. I want to deal in particular with the Wool Stabilization Fund, because that amendment caused an increase in the levy from &#x00BD;d. to &#x00BD;c. This side of the House raised no objection to that increase. We all realize very well that the farming community as a whole supported it. Now, it might be said that in view of the fact that the farmers fully supported it, possibly I should not discuss it, but I think this is the right place where we should bring to the notice of the Minister and the House the position as we view it from the business angle. I want to make it clear that I am dealing only with the stabilization fund and not with <span class="col_7493-7494" refersTo="page_0993"/>the wool levy. This is the fund which supports the Commission when it finds it necessary to support the market to maintain the price. This fund, I understood from the Minister&#x2019;s Department, has risen to the very satisfactory sum of R21,000,000. I believe that now that the sales have closed at the end of June, that amount will be substantially higher. I feel that all of us on both sides of the House can compliment the founders of this scheme, which resulted in the Wool Commission, which stuck so ardently to its undertakings whereby the fund has now been raised to more than 20 per cent of what the average wool clip of South Africa would realize. I base that on the figure of about 1,000,000 bales which I think would bring in R100,000,000 per annum. The only intention of the founders of the scheme was to build up a reserve which could carry it over those periods when conditions overseas made prices low, it might be through there being a consumers&#x2019; market or for political or financial reasons, or due to conditions in a consumer country where they could not absorb the the quantity of wool we may put on to the market. Prices on the overseas market made the Commission decide that it was time that they should operate to carry the farmer over that period. We have already had the opportunity of actually testing out the working of that particular scheme. We have, as you know, over a particular period, including the year 1958-59, purchased 152,000 bales against overseas competition to maintain the floor price. Of that, 101,000 bales were actually sold in the same season, at a profit which shows that the Commission&#x2019;s functions were correctly performed, whereas the balance of 51,000 bales was held over and judiciously disposed of in the year 1959-60 and realized a substantial profit. Again I think we should have it on record that in 1960-61 87,000 bales were purchased, of which some 85,000 bales were unfortunately pushed on to the market during the last five weeks of the season. Here I must say that one has to accept that anyone can make a mistake and the Commission probably erred somewhat in misjudging the trend of the market. But nevertheless I want to say in support of the Commission that they did not have to sell that wool because of financial pressure, because they had enough finances. Having given those figures, I want to come back to my argument and explain that finance has never been a problem, even in that period, and I am now thinking of a period when the Commission had millions of rand less, but they were still able to finance their purchases. I want to say, further, that even if the position arose where practically the whole clip would have to be purchased, what the producers have in the reserve account to-day is sufficient for that, assisted by banks and financial institutions, to buy up the whole clip. I think the Minister will remember that he himself said that if the Commission at any time required finance, the Government would stand by it. I think one should enlarge upon that position and stress this aspect, that when the scheme was founded the intention was to protect the market against fluctuation to which our wool market is somewhat prone. Any upset overseas, any political or financial upset, can create the position which would necessitate the Commission coming into the market to buy up a certain quantity of wool. In the present year we have had a fairly good year. The market has been good and the Commission was not called upon to operate to any great extent. But I would like the House to take into consideration this particular aspect where to-day the farmers have established a fund which is now well over into R21,000,000, but we are still calling upon them, unless the Minister takes it into this own hands to suspend his levy and allow the producers to retain an amount of R1,500,000, which of course is the annual contribution based on 1,000,000 bales of wool. [Interjections.] We have heard it from both sides of the House that the farmers are facing difficulties. I can give a long list of figures to establish that, from the time I was in the wool trade. But here we have established a fund which is really beyond what the producers originally set out to establish. I have heard it myself from leaders of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I wish to direct a few words to the hon. the Minister in connection with the granting of wine quotas for farmers. Act No. 47 of 1957 gives every imaginable power to the K.W.V. The quotas were determined on the basis of the 1956 crop but farmers were also given the opportunity of taking 1957 as the basis. The preliminary quotas were made known in 1960 and farmers were given the opportunity of lodging objections within a year and if necessary even to demand a court of review. When the preliminary quotas were made known, 4,000 of the 4,500 wine farmers objected, but the K.W.V. satisfied most of them. There are a number of farmers in my constituency who are very dissatisfied and I do believe they have a right to be dissatisfied. This applies in particular to those who farm on a small scale. As happens in these cases, particularly as far as the farmers are concerned, a number of farmers who were dissatisfied did not apply for a court of review within the required 12 months. The hon. the Minister knows that I forwarded the petition of 35 farmers to him at the time and I have another long letter here which has been jointly signed by a number of farmers in which they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All of us intended to appeal against the decision of the K.W.V. but on account of a misunderstanding we were too late to set appeal proceedings in motion and furthermore we have been reluctant to do so because of the new amendment to the quota regulations to the effect that each one should deposit the sum of R100 with the Department of Agricultural Economics and <span class="col_7495-7496" refersTo="page_0994"/>Marketing before he would be allowed to appeal. This regulation came into force after we had already met to consider instituting appeal proceedings, and we feel that this regulation has been announced to discourage as much as possible the noting of appeals.</block>

<p>Apart from those 35 who sent a petition to the Minister, there were farmers whose appeals were one day too late. They had been posted but were not delivered on time; and they were a day late. The Minister will know that he himself agreed to it that those appeals should be heard but the K.W.V. refused. The court which hears the appeals consists of a representative of the K.W.V., one farmers&#x2019; representative, and the chairman who is appointed by the Minister. As you have heard, Sir, a farmer has to deposit R100 and he may forfeit that if his appeal is not successful. In addition to that he has to get his own legal representative and pay him for representing him at court. Most of the farmers who farm on a small scale did not appeal because these costs discouraged them. Apart from that, as far as I know not a single farmer who has appeared before this court has won his appeal. I want to state to-day that the reason why the farmers in my constituency are dissatisfied is because of the fact that the representative of the K.W.V. on that court is also the chairman of the quota committee which determines those quotas. He is really the person who is being charged before the court which has to sit in judgment. I have on occasions attended the sittings of that court and I must admit that I was bitterly disappointed. The experience of some of the farmers who appeared before the court&#x2014;I have letters here, but I have not the time to read them&#x2014;and who said that their quotas were too small, was that the court decided that their quotas were not too small. Some of those farmers have now delivered their crops and those crops are in excess of the quota allocation. And do you know what is happening, Sir? The K.W.V. is confiscating that part of the crop which is in excess of the quota allocation and the farmer receives nothing for it. I have one case of a young farmer who bought a farm a couple of years ago. I assisted him in obtaining a considerable loan from the Land Bank on the strength of his vineyards and the preliminary quota which was allocated to him. One or other mistake was made&#x2014;I cannot go into that now&#x2014;and his crops have been confiscated during the past two years and that young farmer is faced with bankruptcy. He also appeared before the court and submitted his case. The fact of the matter is that there is a shortage of liquor. Another fact is that many farmers have a quota far in excess of their crops. I know of one farmer&#x2014;I prefer not to mention his name&#x2014;who has a quota of 1,000 tons. In 1956 he pressed 550 tons. Last year he only pressed 650 tons. He ordered an additional 40,000 vines this year but his quota remains 1,000 tons. Then I have the case of a farmer whose quota is only 80 tons and he presses 85 tons. He lost his case at court but he cannot get his money in respect of those five tons. The K.W.V. has confiscated it. I think there is only one possible way of solving this problem and that is what I want to ask the Minister, namely to appoint a commission to inquire into this question of the quota system in the wine industry. If there has to be a quota system&#x2014;and it seems to me as if there has to be one in the wine industry&#x2014;I think it should at least be equitably divided among the wine farmers; the small farmers in particular should get their fair share, because the small farmer can only make his living from the soil. The position is this that the farmer who was given a large quota can cause land prices to rise, although he does not produce so much. That is why I am asking the Minister to consider the question of appointing a commission of inquiry.</p>

<p>I want to mention one other case where a grave monopoly existed in the Divisional Council of the Cape. There was no right of appeal to anyone&#x2014;not to the court nor to the Administrator and there were abuses. In 1956 the Cape Ordinance was changed so as to allow for an appeal to the Administrator and I remained a member of the Provincial Council for a few years after that and I never again heard of any complaints after that Ordinance was changed allowing for an appeal to the Administrator. I seriously request the Minister to appoint a commission in respect of this matter. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I rise to protest against the reduction in the price of wheat, but before I do so I just want to reply to one remark made by the hon. member for Cradock. He said that there were so few farmers on this side of the House that they could not protect the interests of the farmers. I want to ask him to look at this side of the House. Of the 11 front-benchers, six are farmers. On the other side only three are of the 11 front benchers are farmers. [Interjections.] Now, I am certain that the wheat farmers would be prepared to make sacrifices if it meant that the cost of living as a whole for the people of South Africa would be reduced. But I would like to ask the Minister by how much the price of bread will be reduced to the consumer if the farmer has to reduce the price of his wheat by 12 cents a bag. He should tell us this when he replies. During and after the war the wheat farmers made very great sacrifices to keep the people supplied with bread at a low price. In those days the fixed price for wheat was something like 37s. 6d. a bag and it went up to about 45s. At that time wheat imported from Canada and Australia cost &#x00A3;3 a bag, and when I was in the Cabinet we were offered wheat from the Argentine at &#x00A3;5 a bag and we refused to take it. Those countries could produce wheat at a very much cheaper price than South Africa, but the farmers here pulled in <span class="col_7497-7498" refersTo="page_0995"/>their belts and were prepared to supply the people with bread at a very cheap rate.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>Why cannot the hon. member keep quiet while I am talking? I saw in the newspaper that one of the reasons for reducing the price was that the yield had gone up from 7 to 9 bags per morgen, or to put it another way, from 12&#x00BD; to 15 bags from 1 bag to 20 bags from 1 bag. But 30 years ago the wheat farmers&#x2019; usual practice was to sow wheat, then oats, and then let the land lie fallow. In other words, he had four cash crops in six years. Now, to prevent the impoverishment of the soil and other modern farming methods, the farmer sows wheat and then oats and then he puts down a grass ley or dry-land lucerne, which stands for about six years. In other words, he now has wheat, oats, and six years of grass or lucerne. In other words, he gets two cash crops in eight years. Of course the yield will be very much higher per morgen, or per bag. [Interjection.] When one is trying to talk about a serious thing like the price of wheat, one gets nothing but flippant remarks from the other side, which claims it supports the farmers&#x2019; interests. Now, this is the position. Of course the yield is higher when land has rested for six years, besides having had a dry land lucerne ley which improves the fertility of the soil. But the fact is that instead of getting a return from his ground of four cash crops every six years, he now gets two cash crops in eight years.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>Meanwhile he is paying interest on that land. But my hon. friend asks what about the wool. Of course there is the credit side of getting the benefit of the grazing for your sheep, but when the farmer used to sow wheat and then oats and then let the land lie fallow, we had the &#x201C;stoppellande&#x201D; and on the fallow land grass grew and that also provided grazing for the sheep, and that was free, whereas when he put down grass leys or lucerne it is very expensive. That is the position. Now I want to get on with what I wanted to say. It was said by one hon. member opposite that the cost of production has been reduced. That might be all very well for some people in theory, who have never grown wheat in their lives, and who go only by statistics, but as Mr. Merriman said, you can prove anything with statistics. In practice, it is not so, and every practical farmer will tell you it is wrong. Every implement, as the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town has pointed out, has risen in price from 10 per cent to 12 per cent almost per year. Everything else has gone up. The first B4 caterpillar tractor which I put my name down for was to be delivered at a price of &#x00A3;900, but when it was delivered it cost &#x00A3;1,200. To-day for the same implement you pay almost &#x00A3;4,000 and every other implement has also gone up in price. Wages have risen, and the price of spares, and particularly of fertilizer, and the cost of repairs, because to-day the machines are so complicated that no farmer can do the ordinary jet-timing of a diesel engine; he has to get in a mechanic to do it, and that is very expensive indeed. Fuel and lubricants have gone up in price. How can it be suggested that the cost of production has gone down? I expect the Minister will raise the argument: Yes, but you do not have the same number of operations to go through; you no longer cut with the self-binder, and you do not have to cart away the sheaves. That is true, but whereas a self-binder costs a few hundred, a combine costs you &#x00A3;4,000. And harvesting cannot be done in one operation. There was a time when we tried to restrict it only to combining, but due to the damage done by wind, practically every farmer first cuts down his crop with &#x201C;windrows&#x201D; and then picks it up with a self-propelled combine, which means two operations. This adds quality to the cost. We are told that we do not have to use bags any more; we can take the wheat straight to the elevators. That is true, but the price of the bag is deducted from the fixed price of the wheat if it is not in bags. The point is this. How is it that 20 years ago nearly 80 per cent of the wheat grown in the South-Western Districts was produced by &#x201C;bysaaiers&#x201D;, and how many of them are there to-day? There are only a few, because the cost of production is so high that they have gone out of business. And look at the risk that the wheat farmer runs. To put in the crops on a medium-sized farm probably costs R24,000, and then if the farmer has a drought or bad run as happens over and over again, much, if not the entire crop is a failure with the result that that farmer is set back for the next ten or 15 years, and it may even bankrupt him.

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>Our side of the House will not long delay the passage of this Bill. I have been drawn into this debate in order to refute some of the statements and correct some of the erroneous impressions which may have been created by the Minister&#x2019;s remarks in his reply to the motion to go into Committee of Supply. He said, first of all, that whenever provision is made for the future development of our Railways and Harbours the Opposition &#x201C;complains about the capital expenditure Sir, we have never complained about sensible, well-planned, productive capital expenditure. We have continually urged this Government to keep abreast of development and never to let our transport system lag behind and clog the wheels of economic progress. I, personally, have gone so far as to say in this House that transport facilities should at least keep half a step ahead of industrial and economic advance so as never to hinder it in any way. Sometimes, of course, we need urgent action which cannot be conceived at leisure, such as the Minister&#x2019;s planning in this Bill; quick action to meet unexpected demands which arise in the case of the export of pig-iron to Japan, for example. We welcome such quick action where it is necessary and, when it is necessary, it will always be approved by us. But what we have objected to in the past, and what we have always criticized severely, has been the haphazard, ill-planned, wasteful and inefficient <i>ad hoc</i> planning of the period immediately following the access to power of this Government; the period immediately preceding the appointment of this Minister to his present high and responsible station. Both sides of the House have, through the reports of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours, connived to say some harsh things, over the past ten years, about the administration of the Railways, and particularly about inaccurate estimating of projected works and inadequate supervision of planned developments. Now happily the situation is being slowly improved. These strictures I mention are contained in Select Committee reports which this House has seen, and indeed some are presented in one report which is at present on the Order Paper but which we will probably not get down to discussing this Session. I want to say this in the Minister&#x2019;s favour. He is only partially to blame for this situation. The transport crisis was inherited by him. He took over at a very critical stage of Railway development. It may be asked how this transport crisis arose. It arose because immediately on its accession to power this Government cut and pruned, in a drastic way, the far-visioned transport plans of the Smuts Government &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member is going very far now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am trying to make it quite clear that through inefficiency and inaction the Government failed to follow up the plans prepared by us. The Minister now says that &#x201C;we cannot build a railway line for sixpence&#x201D;. We appreciate and we feel that one of the big hindrances to progress has been that at the time when we could have built railway lines much more cheaply, the opportunity was lost, and the increased costs have added greatly to our burdens, especially the interest burden. Therefore we welcome the planning which now looks further ahead. We welcome the more dynamic action being taken as something which will contribute to the welfare and progress of our country. When this Government came to power the then Minister of Transport said &#x201C;honeymoon period is over&#x201D;. He indulged in drastic savings; cancelled orders; scrapped plans. That is why this Minister inherited a transport crisis, and in curing this crisis, in spending too lavishly, and without adequate preplanning (about which the Select Committee has severely criticized him), he ran into a financial crisis and is only now creeping slowly out of it.</p>

<p>The Minister made a second statement upon which I must comment. He said that the Opposition complains about capital expenditure and interest burdens. Of course we are very conscious of the huge annual interest burden&#x2014;of between R62,000,000 and R65,000,000 a year&#x2014;which the Railways have to meet. That interest obligation also would not have been so great had we carried out our projected works at the time when money was cheaper. But we realize that it is a great handicap and have made fruitful suggestions as to how it can be reduced or anyway its too rapid growth can be curbed. We suggested a redemption fund, a sinking fund: but I will not enlarge here on the excellent arguments advanced by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). I would, however, recommend to the Minister that he take the advice of one of his own Railway Board in regard to this matter. According to the regulations, the Railway Board should be consulted on all Railway expenditure, although I believe this does not always happen. If he had consulted his Commissioners he would have found at least one member in favour of the sinking fund. He has in the past spoken in favour of it in this House. I refer to Mr. du Plessis.</p>

<p><span class="col_7501-7502" refersTo="page_0997"/>Let me say that we are glad the Minister is learning at last. He has put these estimates before us and has explained to us at length what his plans are for the immediate future. We agree that these expenditures are necessary and we approve of the way in which he gave us his detailed views and also approve the way he proposes to spend the money. We have praised him in the past, especially on the last occasion he introduced a measure to this House, for the excellence of the detailed White Paper he put before us. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) had certain objections. His complaint was that the Minister used the existence of the White Paper as an excuse to say nothing by way of introduction and then nothing was recorded in Hansard. On this occasion he has given us a lengthy and precise statement of account. Perhaps next time he can please both the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and myself by giving us a good White Paper as well as a detailed explanation of what he proposes to do. In his speech the Minister has given, perhaps inadvertently, a pre-view of the trend of future Railway development, and I agree with him if the following is his point of view. He seems to have come to the conclusion that in future very few new lines of railway will be built, other than Guaranteed Lines which leave no burden on the railway user, railway worker or the railway rates. I believe that he realizes that the development of roads will be, in some respects, in future, more important than the building of the new railway lines with great capital expenditure. I believe he has made it clear in this Bill that in future the Railway expenditure will largely take the form of improving the existing lines, by electrification, the installation of centralized traffic control, new stations, additional loops &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am doing just that. I say that expenditure in the future on South Africa&#x2019;s transport needs will be mainly confined to improvements to existing lines. These improvements will take the form of electrification; of installation of C.T.C.; of intermediate bi-directional signalling; of colour-light signalling; of the doubling of existing lines; of the bettering of curvatures and the general quickening up of transport. That is what the Minister, apparently, has in mind for the future, and I say that we agree that this is the sensible line of development and we approve of this expenditure and, from now on, will give this Bill an easy passage through the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will take this opportunity to reply to the point I raised in Committee, because at that time the Minister did not give me a reply. It is that this amount we are asked to vote requires approval in principle of completely new projects. I refer in particular to the electrification of the Komatipoort line. The first intimation we had from the Minister on that subject &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I gave it in my Budget speech.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was suggested in the Budget speech, but the implications of the development of that line were not indicated then. The point I would like the Minister to consider is this, that when we vote money in the House for the development of a new line, we have the report of the Railway Commissioners upon which we can assess the merits before the House takes a decision. I think the Minister will agree with me that in regard to a number of large projects for which capital was voted here we are entitled to more information if we want to have a more objective approach to these matters. We should get some White Paper giving details, so that when we come to the House we are not merely faced with the statement of the Minister and are then called upon immediately to assess objectively what is said by the Minister. All these matters have flown from plans developed by the Planning Council. We have pleaded in the past for some report on these projected new works envisaged by the Planning Council. The Minister has said that he was not prepared to make them available to us, because he regarded the work of the Planning Council as a matter of departmental interest only and he was not prepared to place departmental reports on the Table of the House. I want to ask the Minister whether he will reply to the point I raised, that in respect of these projected new works he should supply us with some information, a White Paper, in which the information is made available, so that when we come to these discussions we can assess these matters objectively. The development of the Komatipoort line is extremely important. It is probably one of the most important steps the Administration has taken for a long time, because it is coupled with a certain amount of international obligation. It will call for a revision of a long-standing agreement with the Portuguese authorities. I ask the Minister seriously to consider the suggestion I made on a former occasion, and I would appreciate it if he could indicate this morning that he will meet us in this regard. I think it must be appreciated that whilst we are merely voting in this Bill the sum of R3,000,000, what we are in fact doing, and what we have done on former occasions, is to approve a capital works programme estimated at this stage at some R53,000,000. It is likely, as the Minister said himself, that this R53,000,000 of work will be increased <span class="col_7503-7504" refersTo="page_0998"/>to R60,000,000 by the time the work is completed, because I take it that the Estimates are based on to-day&#x2019;s costs, but who knows what the cost will be by 1965 when the work is completed? That is why I believe the suggestion I made is important, and I sincerely ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the suggestion I made, because I believe it will greatly assist our discussions of Railway matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to accept the explanation of the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) as to what the attitude of the Opposition is. The difficulty is to determine what the attitude of the Opposition is in regard to any particular matter from day to day, because their attitude changes so rapidly. There is no uniformity among hon. members opposite, in regard to their attitude with reference to any particular matter. So I am prepared to accept the explanation now that the Opposition is in favour of capital expenditure and of making provision for the future, although the hon. member for Turffontein was not in favour of it.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Well, that is the impression the hon. member created. The hon. member complained about the burden of interest on the capital expenditure. In other words, by implication the hon. member was not in favour of making provision for the increased traffic demands of the future. Therefore I am prepared to accept the explanation given by the hon. member for Wynberg and I hope I now know where the Opposition stands.</p>

<p>I do not want to be guilty of tedious repetition in regard to the wonderful plans of the Smuts Government which were not carried out by this Government. That matter has been debated over and over again, and the whole thing has been debunked. As a matter of fact, those plans of the Smuts Government would have made no appreciable difference to the carrying capacity of the railways when the crisis arose in 1954. In any case, this is not the time to debate that matter again.</p>

<p>The hon. member speaks about spending too lavishly without adequate planning. I do not think it is any use making general statements that cannot be substantiated.</p>

<p>When did it do that? The Select Committee might have reported in regard to one particular item, but as far as I know the Select Committee has never made the general statement that there was too lavish spending without adequate planning, because if that were so, the Select Committee would be entirely wrong. For the last seven years since the establishment of the Planning Council there has been adequate planning, and not only planning, but in regard to any particular work there must be economic justification for the expenditure, and planning is continually taking place. These items in the Additional Estimates are based on adequate planning for the future. I do not think the Select Committee has ever made the general statement that there is lavish spending without adequate planning.</p>

As a matter of fact, I go so far as to allow the Railway Board to have discussions with the technical officials before the matter is submitted to me, because they must be completely satisfied in regard to the economic justification for that expenditure, and then I consider the recommendations of the Railway Board before I take a final decision. The hon. member is right off the rails when he makes such a statement.</p>

<p>Yes, that was discussed with the Railway Board, and I decided against it for very good reasons which I gave to the hon. member in a previous debate. It is quite impracticable to establish a sinking fund. As a matter of fact, we have a sinking fund, to some extent, in the Rates Equalization Fund.</p>

<p>In regard to the points raised by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant), I can only say that I have a lot of sympathy with him, but it is quite impracticable to publish a White Paper in regard to every major work embarked upon. The hon. member will notice from the Brown Book that there are numerous works entailing the expenditure of large sums of capital, and it is simply impracticable to issue a White Paper in regard to every one of them before the matter is submitted to Parliament. When they appear on the Brown Book or on the Estimates, hon. members have the opportunity of asking questions and obtaining all the information necessary, and I will always be prepared to give it. Hon. members may ask those questions right throughout the debate. But however much I sympathize with the hon. member, I am afraid it is quite impracticable <span class="col_7505-7506" refersTo="page_0999"/>to prepare a White Paper giving all the information in regard to every major item of expenditure on the Brown Book, because those items are numerous.</p>

<p>Yes, if the hon. member looks at the Brown Book, he will find that there are many new works. In regard to the Komatipoort line, when I made my Budget speech I envisaged the electrification of that line. In fact, I gave the House an indication that that line would be electrified, but the electrification of that line has nothing to do with the Mozambique Convention. It is a separate matter altogether. [Interjections.] No, that makes no difference. It is not a question of whether the carrying capacity is either increased or decreased. The Mozambique Convention provides for the amount of traffic that must go through the Port of Louren&#x00E7;o Marques. That has nothing to do with the carrying capacity of that line. The Mozambique Convention, the provisions of which are going to be discussed in the next month or two, is quite a separate matter, and has nothing to do with the projected electrification of this line.</p>

I think some reference was made to the fact that, under this clause, the particulars on the passports of visitors may be simplified; that it may be possible to have a simplified form of travel documents for certain classes of people and so on, and I think the Committee would be glad to have from the Minister some indication of what use he thinks he will be able to make of these amendments.</p>

<p>As the law reads at the moment, the Minister has the discretion to grant exemptions to any person or class of persons as far as visas or endorsements are concerned. Commonwealth countries follow the procedure of endorsements. There is usually an agreement between those countries which make visas, etc., an essential requirement. The object of the amendment which is proposed here is to empower the Minister to accept much simpler documents, such as travel documents, as proof of identity. It is left entirely to his discretion. In other words, the object of the amendment is really to disturb as little as possible the good relations which have existed between us and those people who have entered our country, and to make it possible for us to be satisfied with a much simpler travel document.</p>

<p>When introducing this Bill, I intimated that I would be withdrawing Clause 4, and I therefore suggest that this clause be negatived. May I recapitulate the reasons that I gave in my statement. It will be noticed that Section 10 (3) of the present Act prohibits, <i>inter alia,</i> the use of any words, abbreviations or initials in companies&#x2019; names which purport or suggest that such companies enjoy the patronage of Her Majesty, the Queen of England, or of any State within the British Empire. Such protection, however, is not given to any other country. As a logical sequence of South Africa&#x2019;s withdrawal from the Commonwealth, it was intended to amend the relevant section of the present Act as provided in Clause 4. However, after consideration, it has been decided to leave this matter in abeyance for the time being and to substitute the present provisions of Section 10 (3) at a later stage by a provision of a general nature; in other words, it will extend the protection also to heads of States of other countries.</p>

<p>The existing Section 2 of the Act, which is being amended here, provides, firstly, that permanent residence is given to persons, but that they should first be approved of by the Immigration Selection Board.

In other words, if they wish to come here permanently they must be approved by the Selection Board. If they wish to stay here temporarily, they must have a temporary permit. I wish to point out, however, that, in terms of Clause 12 of this Bill, the Minister of the Interior is given powers of exemption, and these powers of exemption are so wide that there is only one respect in which he cannot give an exemption, and that is in terms of Section 9 of the Act, which concerns the change of name.

The existing power of exemption is only in respect of a very small group. The Minister may grant these exemptions conditionally or unconditionally. As far as the Federation of Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories are concerned, this matter is still under discussion as already explained by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 14 provides that, as from 1 January 1963, any person who is in the Republic and has become an alien by virtue of this legislation, shall be deemed to be there for temporary sojourn only unless, before that date, he makes a certain declaration before a certain official. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister why he has found it necessary to lay down this limitation to 1 January 1963 if it is the intention that he should have discretion to extend that period, as the clause apparently allows him to do. Why not simply make the period longer <i>ab initio</i>? The results, of course, can be quite drastic so far as the person is concerned, and he might not be able to comply with the provisions at the first date, that is by January 1963, owing to illness or absence or pure ignorance of what has happened. And, therefore, my question firstly is why not provide for the extended period straight away, and the second question is, if that is not possible, what assurance have we that ample notice will be given of any extension? Thirdly, of course, nobody can act under this until the designated officials have been notified by <i>Gazette.</i> What assurance is the Minister going to give us that that designation will take place timeously, so that those who want to operate under this immediately after 1 January will be able to do so?</p>

<p>Every house must be put in order as soon as possible. There are numbers of British subjects in this country in respect of whom we have no knowledge whatsoever; we do not know whether or not they are here because no documents were demanded in the past. A prerequisite for citizenship is permanent residence. Nobody will receive citizenship if he is here on a temporary permit; he must first have a permit for permanent residence; then he can be granted citizenship. We now wish those persons who came here before 1 January 1963 to state whether they desire to remain here permanently. Those who wish to remain here permanently and indicate that that is their desire, will receive a permit from the Department for permanent residence. We take it that those who do not apply before that date, wish to remain here temporarily on a temporary permit. They will then be treated as aliens. After 1 January 1963 any person who is here may apply for permanent residence. But we would like to see those persons who are living here permanently become citizens as soon as possible. In terms of existing legislation, if an alien is here on a temporary permit and he eventually wishes to remain here permanently, he must first of all return to his country of origin and only then can he re-enter this country on the strength of a certificate of permanent residence. We are now giving notice long before the time&#x2014;and I hope great publicity will be given to this&#x2014;that all persons who have not had citizenship conferred upon them but who intend establishing themselves here permanently, must apply before 1 January 1963. Those who do not do so will be classified as holding temporary permits. If there should be cases where persons apply after that date, the Minister still has the right to exempt them and to issue them with a certificate of permanent residence at any time after wards. We simply have to fix a date otherwise we will get nowhere. If we do not fix a date this matter may again drag on for years and you will not know who is really here permanently and who wants to become a citizen.</p>

<p>I would like a little clarification here. In his introductory speech the Minister said that he wanted to waive certain requirements of the Aliens Act as it applies to people in the Union, but he only mentioned one or two. I would like to point out to him that these provisions apply to hotel-keepers, partners, employers and many other classes of persons. I would like him to give us a brief view of what he intends. He said in his introductory speech that up to 1 January 1963, these people would not have to register as aliens, but of course the position will go on after that, and I would like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s intentions are and to what extent he is prepared to waive the provisions of the Aliens Registration Act.</p>

<p>I can say no more than my colleague has said in his introductory speech, and that is that where the words &#x201C;born British subject&#x201D; are now deleted in Section 1 of the Registration of Aliens Act, it means that in future British subjects will be treated in precisely the same way as aliens. They will be subject to precisely the same laws; they will have to register and notify any change of address. I might just say that in this respect our Government has been somewhat more moderate than the British Government. They have carried out this agreement more strictly than we have. For instance, we do not insist on compliance with this requirement in the case of people who come here for less than six months. They, on the contrary, only allow a South African citizen three months there.</p>

<p>In terms of Section 20 of the principal Act certain categories of people are exempt from registration. In terms of sub-section (d) to which the hon. member has referred, women who become aliens by virtue of the fact that they have married an alien are exempt. With a view to the previous amendments which we have effected, it is quite redundant, because Sections 12 to 15 of the South African Citizenship Act lay down that a woman does not lose her South African citizenship by virtue of her marriage to an alien. In other words, the hon. member is quite right; it really has nothing to do with this, but while we are putting everything in order, we have done a little bit of smartening up in this case as well.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what provision is made to preserve the rights of those persons who attained South African citizenship by a process of registration. Their rights were preserved, of course, by the provisions of Section 8 of Act No. 44 of 1949, but I can see no provision here which makes any reference to preserving the rights of South African citizenship of persons who have acquired it by registration. It is true that Clause 29 provides that anybody who applies for registration and has not succeeded <span class="col_7511-7512" refersTo="page_1002"/>in being registered in time, will now become naturalized, and sub-section 2 of Clause 29 preserves that right; it is specifically designed to say that a person&#x2019;s rights will be preserved, that he shall be a South African citizen by naturalization; but it seems to me that once you repeal Section 8 of the South African Citizenship Act of 1949 and make no provision here for the preservation of rights, the whole position becomes changed, and there is nothing in the legislation itself to indicate that those persons&#x2019; rights are going to be preserved.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make it quite clear that I welcome the provisions of this clause, but I want to ask the Minister whether he will explain why certain people have been excluded. The proposed new Section 4<i>bis</i> deals with the descendants of persons whose paternal great-grandfather or paternal grandfather or father was born in any part of what now comprises the Republic, and it also deals with persons descended from burghers of the two old Republics. There is nothing wrong with that at all, the point being, of course, that these people need not have been born in the old Republics. They might have come, as so many did, from foreign countries for the purpose of taking part in the gold rush, became burghers and then left. Their descendants can come to the Republic, get a permit for permanent residence and can immediately become citizens. What I want to ask the hon. the Minister is why there is no provision for the descendants of the equivalent of the burghers in the Cape and Natal, that is to say, descendants of people who became citizens in the sense in which one was a citizen, with the right to vote and so on&#x2014;the equivalent to the burgher of the old Republic, but who was not born here and who would not fall into that category. Why is it only the descendants of the burghers of the old Republics?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The reply to the question of the hon. member is simply this: We are dealing here with two different categories of persons. The old South African Republican citizen who left the country, did not leave the country of his own free will in this sense that he simply left the country. Take the case of the citizens, for instance, who went to Angola and to the Argentine after the three-year war, the Anglo-Boer War. Those people simply left the country as citizens of this country because they felt that they had been deprived of their freedom. They were those who fought to the bitter end and the stubborn ones who said: We will rather go into the wide world than to live under a foreign flag. I am not discussing the merits of the case, but that is the historical background. The other persons who left the country left it voluntarily, just as an emigrant usually leaves his country. There was nothing which made them feel that they had to leave the country such as that they had lost their freedom. In that way they had sacrificed the citizenship which they would have obtained here or probably did obtain. The only reason why we are taking these steps is to afford the opportunity to the White man in those countries of Africa where his existence has become endangered, and who wishes to return to the country of which he was formerly a citizen, to obtain citizenship immediately he returns. We discussed this position last year already. I want to put it to the hon. member that there is a difference between those people who have to leave those countries and the other category of persons to whom he has referred. My colleague, the Minister of Immigration, will not afford those people financial assistance to come here, but if they have to leave, if they have to leave and seek refuge elsewhere, then this is the country where they had had citizenship and we will immediately again give it to them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. member for Durban (North) said, we welcome this clause as we welcomed a similar provision previously, i.e. in 1961. There is, however, a question which I raised with the Minister at that time and I should like to know whether he has been able to investigate it in the meantime. It is of much more importance now than it was last year in view of the changes which have since taken place. This question related to children in the territories to the north of us and to whom the Minister has only just referred, i.e. territories like Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Kenya, etc. The children I have in mind are those of parents both of whom were originally South Africans, or of parents one of whom was originally a South African citizen. These are people who know Africa. Now we will find that on their return there will be many children born there who will not, in terms of this clause, become South African citizens. I know of many cases of persons who have returned from the Rhodesias and elsewhere.</p>

<p>I do not think it will be wise to slip in n amendment here now without prior thorough investigation because one does not ant to make a mistake. I do hope, however, bat the Minister will be prepared to go into cases of this nature and that it will be possible <span class="col_7513-7514" refersTo="page_1003"/>for him to come forward with an amendment. We want to bring as many of these people back to South Africa as is possible and they should, therefore, be encouraged to come back here rather than to go elsewhere in the world. We can do that by making it easier for the children concerned to acquire the citizenship their parents enjoyed before they left.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we do not oppose the principle of this clause, but I have two amendments on the Order Paper which I should like the hon. the Minister to consider. These are as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 36, after &#x201C;voluntary&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and formal and in lines 36 and 37, to omit &#x201C;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The intention of the first amendment is to bring the wording of the clause into line with Section 19 <i>bis</i> of Act No. 44 of 1949 as amended by Act 64 of 1961. The law, as it stands at present, may deprive a South African citizen of his South African citizenship, if he has after the commencement of the Act (i.e. Section 13 of Act No. 64 of 1961)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">by some voluntary and formal act in the Union &#x2026; acquired the citizenship or nationality of a country other than the Union &#x2026;</block>

<p>It seems to me that the Minister will be wise to use the same phraseology in this clause. Why should it not also be a &#x201C;formal act&#x201D; here as it is under the section referred to? Otherwise there is going to be a lot of doubt in the mind of people as to exactly what this clause means. It is quite clear that people might do voluntary things abroad without realizing that they do so in contravention of the law although they do so in an informal way. The Minister might reply by saying that such things will not be taken seriously. As far as we are concerned, we think it would give a much clearer indication of what he has in mind, if the Minister were to specify it to be some &#x201C;voluntary&#x201D; and &#x201C;formal&#x201D; act&#x2014;in other words, a deliberate contravention of the law relating to citizenship.</p>

<p>My reason for the second amendment, i.e. to delete the words&#x201D;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;, is because as the clause stands now, the Minister could just write to, say, Mr. Smith and tell him that he, in the opinion of the Minister, has performed a voluntary act&#x2014;without specifying what it is&#x2014;and that he has, as a result, been deprived of his South African citizenship.</p>

<p>The Minister is, in other words, taking very wide powers to himself in this regard. I know of course how the Minister will react, namely by asking whether it is really believed that he will do an unreasonable thing. But all Ministers say that and no Opposition ever accepts it! The fact of the matter is that Parliament is being asked to give the Minister the most exceptional powers. It is true that the Minister could also reply that he is empowered by Clause 24 (c) to cancel a decision under subsection (b) to take away a person&#x2019;s citizenship. That, however, can cause a lot of trouble to the unfortunate citizen. This can be avoided by not making it subject only to the &#x201C;opinion of the Minister&#x201D; because the Minister of the day will then be very careful as to how he acts. It will not prevent him from exercising his powers, but it will make him very careful as to how he does exercise them, because he will know that if he uses them arbitrarily and without sound reasons, he might find himself brought to court and being called upon to give reasons for his actions.</p>

<p>I hope, therefore, that the Minister will, so as to ensure that everybody has confidence in this clause, accept both my amendments and incorporate them in the clause.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry but I have objections against the principle embodied in this clause. Accordingly I move the amendment which I have given notice of, i.e.</p>

<p>To omit paragraphs (a) and (b).</p>

<p>I do this because I believe the hon. the Minister already has very wide powers under existing legislation. This clause amends Section <i>19bis</i> of the South African Citizenship Act of 1949. This particular section, as amended by Act 64 of 1961, already gives the Minister the power to deprive a South African citizen, i.e. not a citizen by naturalization or registration but a South African citizen by birth who is not a minor, of his South African citizenship, if the Minister is satisfied that such citizen&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) has at any time after the commencement</li>

<li>of this Act, by some voluntary and formal act in the Union, other than marriage, acquired the citizenship or nationality of a country other than the Union; or</li> <li>(b) has at any time after the commencement of this Act, whether in or outside the Union&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) made an oath or other declaration of allegiance to any country other than the Union; or</li>

<li>(ii) made a declaration renouncing his South African citizenship with intent to accept any other citizenship or nationality.</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>I believe these are all the powers the Minister should have. The Minister should only have <span class="col_7515-7516" refersTo="page_1004"/>the power to deprive a South African born person of his citizenship if such person actually renounces South African citizenship and takes up the citizenship of another country. Only under these circumstances should the Minister have power to act in that way. Accordingly the extension of these powers asked for in this clause is in my opinion unwarranted particularly so as this clause is very widely worded. Even if the amendments proposed by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) are accepted, the clause still contains very wide powers. It means that in the Minister&#x2019;s discretion, a person may be deprived of his citizenship if at any time such a person has performed either a formal or a voluntary act which indicates that such person has made use of the citizenship or nationality of another country. This is carrying the question of &#x201C;dual nationality&#x201D; far too far in the circumstances of this country to-day. There are persons who for many years have enjoyed certain privileges in Britain by virtue of the fact that his or her father was born in Britain.As I said, I think this goes much too far. I should like to give some examples of what might be interpreted by the Minister as being a voluntary act or even a formal act and where use is made of privileges which we have been granted to persons for many years on account of a father, for instance, having been born in Britain. Persons falling in this category are those many thousands of young South African students and other young persons who have been in the habit of going across to Britain and of taking up temporary work there; they educate themselves further with the assistance of what they earn in that way; and, generally, taking advantages of the culture of Britain and of the experiences gained there. Now, however, a South African person may not do so after a certain date without having obtained a work permit first unless such a person still enjoys the privileges&#x2014;as they will do under the relevant British Act&#x2014;to which he or she is entitled by virtue of their father, for instance, having been born in Britain. Such a young person could then go to Britain and make a formal declaration that, although he carries a South African passport, he enjoys certain privileges under the British South Africa Act enabling him to take up work in Britain because his father, for instance, was born there. He could, perhaps, also travel more freely in other countries, as for instance in some parts of Africa where South Africans are not welcome, for educational, scientific and other purposes. This he could do on a British passport. This does not mean that such a person has a dual loyalty but only that he is lucky enough to have additional advantages to use for educational and other purposes. The commission of such a voluntary or formal act, i.e. to utilize for purposes of educational study, etc., a British passport, should not be grounds for the Minister to decide that such a person has, more or less, been disloyal to South Africa and should, accordingly, be deprived of his South African citizenship. But this is exactly what this clause is enabling the Minister to do, because it enables the Minister to deprive a person of his South African citizenship if such a person, in the opinion of the Minister, has made use, by means of any voluntary or formal act, of the advantages of the citizenship of another country.</p>

<p>There are people who travel to Britain and who are used to walking through &#x201C;British subjects&#x201D; gate at the customs without any difficulty who might feel that they do not want to be deprived of those facilities. It is a small matter, but one of pride to certain people. Accordingly, they produce a certificate or make a declaration to the effect that his or her father was born in Britain thereby becoming entitled to enter the country on the same basis as British subjects. I do not think, as I said before, that this displays dual loyalty, nor does it display disloyalty to South Africa. The Minister should, therefore, not have these additional powers and consequently I move the amendment which stands in my name.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will find justification for accepting the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). I say so because that will bring this legislation into line not only with Section 19<i>bis</i> but also with Section 15 of the Act as introduced by Section 10 of Act 64 of 1961. In this section, too, the words &#x201C;some voluntary and formal act&#x201D; are used.</p>

<p>In regard to the second amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia, I hope the Minister will accept that as well because as the clause now reads, it does seem that the executive is claiming rather excessive powers. It will be observed that the words &#x201C;if the Minister is satisfied&#x201D; already appears at the commencement of Section 19<i>bis</i>. Consequently the section will, in conjunction with this clause, read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may by order deprive a South African citizen who is not a minor, of his South African citizenship if he is satisfied that such citizen &#x2026; who has also the citizenship or nationality of a country other than the Union, has at any time after the thirtieth day of May, 1963, performed some voluntary act which, in the opinion of the Minister, indicates that such citizen has made use of his citizenship or nationality of that other country.</block>

<p>&#x201C;In the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;, where it appears in the latter part of this quotation, is therefore a complete surplusage. If left in, the clause might create the impression that this power is going to be used more arbitrarily or drastically than the existing provisions of the law. I say, therefore, the Minister will be wise to remove these words from the clause because one would loathe to create the impression that South Africa is trying to obtain loyalty from people by means of some sort of intimidation.</p>

<p>In so far as the first amendment is concerned, it is quite obvious that the insertion <span class="col_7517-7518" refersTo="page_1005"/>of the words &#x201C;and formal&#x201D; was found necessary in the already existing sections and should, in my opinion, be included here as well. There is, otherwise, the danger that someone might fall under this clause unwittingly and merely because that such person has accepted the benefits which accrue in terms of a personal relationship to Britain by birth or otherwise. He could have accepted a scholarship, for instance. As such it could affect persons who have been good South Africans all along and who have served this country very well. I accept, of course, that the words &#x201C;and formal&#x201D; do not constitute a guarantee that someone might not fall within the term &#x201C;unwittingly&#x201D;, but it certainly makes it less easy to fall &#x201C;unwittingly&#x201D; within the terms of the clause. In view of the fact that sub-paragraph (3) of this clause gives the Minister the power to withdraw any such cancellation of citizenship, the operation of this sub-paragraph will also be facilitated by the inclusion of those words. In the circumstances I hope the Minister will accept both these amendments.</p>

I feel obliged to say unequivocally to the hon. member for Houghton and those who think the way she does, that if her amendments were accepted and the two paragraphs in question deleted, it would only mean the continuation of dual citizenship&#x2014;it will flourish&#x2014;without in any way curtailing or changing the existing position in this respect. I wish to state unequivocally that I am pleased that the United Party is not prepared to go as far as the hon. member for Houghton, and that they subscribe in principle to a single loyalty although they suggest certain changes in this respect with which I will deal in a moment. I wish to say to the hon. member for Houghton and her kindred spirits who think like she does, that I think the most precious and priceless possession any person can possess is his citizenship. I cannot express in words how priceless this possession is. Citizenship should not only entitle the holder thereof to privileges, because anything which only confers benefits and privileges is not as priceless as something which also places certain obligations on the person. It is only when you as a citizen have to fulfil your obligations under your citizenship that you realize its value. To sacrifice on the one hand and to give on the other hand; to give and to receive, are the two most pleasant duties which anybody can perform. But it demands loyalty and proof that you are prepared at any cost, to show a single loyalty. You may be fond of any country and if every country had the right to confer citizenship on whomsoever he pleases so that one person may be the citizen of three or four countries, the time will sooner or later arrive where such a person will stand before the choice. We wish to place our South African citizenship on such a high level and beyond every possible reproach, and we should be so fervent in our loyalty to our country that there will be no doubt as to that choice, there should definitely not be the possibility of making another choice.</p>

<p>I can give a long list of acts which a person with dual citizenship can do and ask the hon. member whether she approves of them. Let me mention a few things&#x2014;perhaps the United Party should also listen to this, bearing in mind the amendments which they have moved. Will the hon. member approve of the following act: When a citizen voluntarily applies for a passport in another country will she say that he is being loyal to his South African citizenship? Or is it merely a principle of convenience of which you can avail yourself?</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, I regard that as an absolute act of disloyalty to the country of which you are a citizen. I will certainly deprive a person who has such dual citizenship of his South African citizenship. What does the hon. member think of a person who, while he is a South African citizen, takes part in the voting on the occasion of a political election or referendum in another country? If a person does that is he not being disloyal to the country of which he is a citizen? The hon. member shrugs her shoulders indicating that she does not know. That is exactly the trouble. What would she decide if she were the Minister of the Interior? We cannot argue with the hon. member because her moral conception of the meaning of citizenship differs completely from that of this side of the House. Another case which I can mention is that of a person who in another country approaches the embassy of a foreign country for assistance whereas his own country has an embassy in that particular country. What will the hon. member think of that?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am not talking about the powers under 19<i>bis</i>, but about when a citizen of South Africa is loyal or disloyal. I can give a number of other examples, but I do not think that is necessary seeing that the hon. member and I do not see eye to eye as far as our conceptions of morality are concerned.</p>

<p>That is why I say I am pleased to see that the United Party have not made themselves <span class="col_7519-7520" refersTo="page_1006"/>guilty to the same extent, but that they subscribe to the principle of a single loyalty. In other words, they want to be South African citizens and they want their supporters to be that. As far as the amendments of the hon. member for Constantia are concerned, I regret to say that I cannot accept them for reasons which I am convinced the United Party will understand and to which they will perhaps subscribe on deeper reflection. You cannot restrict disloyalty to the Republic to voluntary or formal acts. That can simply not be done, because it is exactly in the field of informal voluntary acts where it clearly becomes evident whether a person wishes to give undivided loyalty to the Republic or not. If we make the act a formal one, the basis of citizenship, namely the undivided loyalty to the State, is completely emasculated. A citizen should at all times promote the interests of the State to which he owes undivided loyalty and he must at all times combat and oppose that which may injure that State, otherwise he is not only judicially disloyal but also morally disloyal. That is the big difference. It is easy to say somebody is loyal to his country in the judicial sense of the word by laying down a formal act, but when it comes to the moral aspect of the matter, that is when you cannot measure loyalty with a yardstick as you can in the case of judicial loyalty, the position is different. The hon. member for Constantia objects to the provision that the Minister must be the judge. That is not in conflict with the existing provisions of the South African Citizenship Act. I wish to give only two examples in this connection. The final say in the granting of citizenship, for instance, rests with the Minister. He also has the right by means of an order to deprive somebody of his citizenship. The whole history of and historical background to the granting and dispossession of citizenship in this country, is that it rests with the executive authority. The Minister does not, therefore, act as a person, but as the representative of the executive authority. The hon. member for Constantia said that in spite of the fact that I had an honest face and no matter what I promised, they would not accept it as it was. But it is not necessary for them to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the one or other Minister.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>No.But surely a Minister does many things on behalf of the executive authority. In cases of capital punishment, for example, all the Ministers do not decide, and the hon. member who was also a Minister of State knows that in such cases only two or three Ministers take action together with the State President, that is not even the majority of the Cabinet. In any case, a Minister does not act irresponsibly. Historically, therefore, the position is as I have set out. This is a principle which we have inherited from the British constitutional law. That is precisely our attitude here. But the important point lies in this, that it is a guarantee to hon. members, the democratic guarantee in respect of the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D; and all the dangers in which they see in that. There is no danger for the simple reason that in this legislation the Minister is, in the first place, obliged in every case where he deprives anybody of his citizenship, to lay that case on the Table of both Houses of Parliament within 14 days. In other words, the Opposition and any other member has the right to study the reasons why the Minister has done so, to discuss them and to criticize the Minister with the result that the Minister will have to act very carefully. Because the Minister also has the right to restore citizenship. He can make a <i>bona fide</i> mistake, or he may have been too severe in his judgment. He may have judged that informal act which the person has committed too strictly, and he may at a later stage on reconsideration or as the result of representations made to him come to the conclusion that he acted too severely and that he may wish to restore citizenship to that person. I am not saying this to find excuses, but I want this Committee to realize that what we are doing here is as far as we can go. The idea originally was that in the case of a formal act there would only be a certain period of time during which we would allow dual citizenship. We have no objection to this amendment&#x2014;if anybody values his British citizenship to such an extent that he does not wish to lose it, he can retain it. But when he commits an act which testifies to disloyalty to South Africa, we tell him we are very sorry but he can no longer remain a South African citizen; he can no longer sit on two stools, he has made his choice voluntarily.</p>

<p>I did so during your absence. You must ask the others for those. I can still give a number of other examples. I just wish to say, Mr. Chairman, that I really think that at the time of the negotiations with the British&#x2014;I was one of those who conducted those negotiations&#x2014;it was stated very clearly, and we stated it unequivocally, that, as far as dual citizenship in the case of South African citizens was concerned, we expected undivided loyalty to the Republic on the part of the person, and that principle, given to us in a memoir by a British Ambassador, was unequivocally accepted, and it was not held against us. I just want to say that I do not think we should interfere with this clause. I must say that our experience has been&#x2014;that has been my experience as one of those who conducted the negotiations&#x2014;that they demand it, and they do not hold it against us for demanding it. We need not conflict with one another because of that, nor do I believe that that will cause us to come into conflict. I just want to add that the Government will be very careful before it <span class="col_7521-7522" refersTo="page_1007"/>deprives anybody of his citizenship. It is a valuable possession; it means a tremendous amount to a person, and a great deal of thought will be given to it, and there will have to be very definite reasons before such a thing is done. We can discuss the circumstances in which it can be done <i>ad infinitum,</i> but I would rather ask that we do not do so. Let the Minister exercise this discretionary power which is being given to him in such a way that when such cases are eventually tabled the necessary criticism can be levelled if we are not satisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak to the second part of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), that is to remove the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;. I think the hon. the Minister himself gave the best reason why that amendment should be accepted. The hon. the Minister said that the most priceless thing that one could possess was one&#x2019;s citizenship. The hon. the Minister is saying in effect that it is a priceless thing, that it should therefore be guarded and it should, therefore, I submit, also be protected. All that the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia means is whether or not when a certain fact has occurred, it should be determined as if it were a fact and should not be determined as if it were an opinion which the hon. the Minister has. I appreciate the fact, Sir, that the hon. the Minister is not lightly going to deprive anyone of his citizenship. I think the Minister has already indicated to this Committee how extraordinarily difficult it is going to be. That has been indicated by the questions which have been put to this side of the House and the questions which have been put to him. The hon. the Minister has said that they will talk and talk about it before they come to a decision. I must say that this is a most unsatisfactory way in which to determine a fact. What we are deciding in this clause, Sir, is whether someone can be deprived of his citizenship. We say that he can be deprived of his citizenship on the happening of certain events, not on the happening of the hon. the Minister feeling that someone should be deprived, not on the happening of the Minister&#x2019;s interpretation of some event, but on the happening of certain facts.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) asks who will have the initiative. The initiative will, of course, lie with the Minister. If the Minister does make a decision and does deprive a person of this most priceless possession, then, Sir, if he does it arbitrarily, if he does so on false premises, then the citizen has a right to go to the court and say that there were no facts whatsoever upon which such a decision could be founded. It will not affect the initiative of the hon. the Minister. There are two other factors which come into this. The one is that the act concerned must necessarily have been committed outside the Republic. The hon. the Minister is going to have to decide, when he deprives anyone of his citizenship, purely on hearsay evidence. The hon. the Minister has said that there is a safeguard inasmuch as all these names will be laid on the Table of the House. But, Sir, this is no way to determine facts. Facts must be determined by proof. Facts must be determined by the best methods known to our society, known to our system, known to our Constitution. There should be proper examination as to whether a fact is a fact or whether it is not a fact. I submit that laying it on the Table of the House will have no effect whatsoever so far as the determination of the fact is concerned. It will give certain hon. members the right, when the Minister&#x2019;s Vote comes up, to discuss with him across the floor of the House whether a certain fact is a fact or not. I submit it is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs and I would ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not reconsider, in the light of what he himself has said, the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<block name="quote">To omit Clause 5, as amended.</block>

<p>This is a new power to curb the freedom of the Press. Despite the assurance which the hon. the Minister gave at the second reading that the Bill was not designed in any way to restrict free speech or to curtail the freedom of the Press, this provision is, in fact, such a provision. Because it means that new machinery is being introduced whereby a newspaper proprietor has to make a deposit before registration can take effect, and that the deposit may be forfeited to the State in certain circumstances. Although it ostensibly affects only those proprietors who wish to register after the coming into operation of this law, it actually goes much further, because, where there is a change in ownership, or even in name, of an existing newspaper, this section will operate. Where there has been a delay beyond one month in the publishing of an existing registration, the provision will also apply. The objection of this side of the House to the clause is the forfeiture by executive decree. It means that it rests entirely in the hands of the executive as to whether or not there should be a form of penalty over and above a cancellation of a registration of a newspaper. Not even in time of war was there a provision as drastic as this. Not even the War Measures went as far as this. The Minister will know that, although consideration was given to apply a form of censorship on the Press during the war, it in fact never did take place. As I say, Sir, the objectionable aspect of this clause is not so much that a new newspaper will have a certain amount of capital tied up as security, but this amount of money can become forfeited to the State entirely by executive decree. The Minister is the sole judge as to whether this form of penalty is to be enforced or not. The only relief that has come is the provision which the Minister has introduced himself in providing that there can be a remission. In any case, Sir, that power of remission by grace or favour is part of executive authority already. The executive can always, by grace or favour, remit a form of penalty. In so far as it may affect the discus, it can also do so by an ordinary appropriation.</p>

<p>At the Committee Stage this side of the House tried to ameliorate the harshness of this provision by providing that the court, and not the Minister, should be the arbiter of the circumstances. That was ruled out of order. I naturally accept the ruling, and I am not going to try to advance the argument now. Except to say this: that the hon. the Minister will have an opportunity in the Other Place of dealing with this. I hope he will give us an assurance that he will have recourse to that method of dealing with the matter before this Bill becomes law. As it stands now, Sir, it provides no safeguards of a nature that we would like to see in it. It is a bad provision and harsh. I, therefore, move the deletion of the clause in its entirety.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has advanced two arguments. The first was that this clause conferred a new power on to the Minister &#x201C;to curb the freedom of the Press&#x201D;. The people who would naturally have been the first to object to it, had the hon. member been right in his contention, would have been the Newspaper Press Union and I have not received any objection whatsoever from them in this connection. How can the hon. member come with that argument, in spite of the fact that he ought to know that these people who are intimately concerned did not object to the clause concerned? The hon. member will also remember that in everything that was written in the newspapers in this connection, no reference was made whatsoever to this amendment by people who are intimately and mainly concerned in this. As far as his second argument is concerned, namely that the clause as amended will now give the Minister the right to confiscate by way of ministerial decree, a certain amount or the whole amount which was deposited as a guarantee. I take it that the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is that the ministerial discretion which is granted is in conflict with the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; about which we have heard such a great deal. But that clause has been inserted at the request of the Bar Council. I cannot understand, therefore, how the hon. member can accuse me of violating the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; in that way, whereas those very watchdogs of the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; were the people who asked me to effect this amendment. I am afraid, therefore, that neither of the amendments <span class="col_7525-7526" refersTo="page_1009"/>of the hon. member is supported by those people who are intimately concerned in this matter and consequently I cannot accept them.</p>

<p>To omit paragraph (<i>b</i>), as amended.</p>

<p>The amendment is to omit paragraph (b) of this clause. That paragraph gives the Minister the power to ban certain types of gatherings, gatherings of a particular kind in any area during a particular period. When this matter was discussed in Committee, the Minister removed certain words and added certain other words, and as the position stood before, the Minister could ban any meeting at any place if he was satisfied that there was one person in the whole of the Republic who propagated the aims of Communism. The Minister has seen the error of such phraseology and has therefore deleted it, but the words which he inserted in their place, although a little better, do not alter the principle of the matter, which is that the Minister no longer needs to apply his mind to the meetings which he intends to ban. The Minister has indicated that under this sub-clause now proposed to be omitted, he can ban all meetings on the Parade or on the steps of the City Hall.</p>

He could ban social events or any meeting in the City Hall. If the Minister had accepted in the Committee Stage an amendment which was moved, which would make it imperative for him to apply his mind to every meeting, this clause would not be so objectionable when viewed in the light of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Yes, but only in this respect, that he could ban any gathering <span class="col_7527-7528" refersTo="page_1010"/>at all regardless of whether it was connected with Communism or not. Now the Minister has exactly the same powers. He can still ban all gatherings without their being connected with Communism, and without his applying his mind to whether or not they are connected with Communism. I say the Minister can ban all future meetings at any place merely if he at the same time says he deems it necessary in order to combat Communism. How can the Minister apply his mind to every meeting which will be held on the Parade? Obviously he cannot. The Minister does not know who will call meetings there, or which societies will call what sort of meetings in the next month or year, but he takes power to ban all these meetings. How the Minister can say in future that he deems it necessary to do so in order to combat Communism, to ban all meetings that he does not know about, and how he can pretend that he is going to achieve the objects of this clause by banning, e.g., the Salvation Army&#x2014;and I am not just mentioning the Salvation Army because I am trying to be facetious, but the Salvation Army might have a meeting there, and then the Minister will be banning the meeting of the Salvation Army because he deems it to be necessary in order to combat Communism. The Minister is taking powers which cannot be applied for the objects of fighting Communism.</p>

<p>I have expressed my views quite clearly in the Committee Stage on this Bill and I do not want to reiterate the same arguments, but it was quite clear from the discussion at that stage that the Minister&#x2019;s reason for introducing this amendment, which he himself admitted in his reply, was the Zac de Beer case. Perhaps I had better tell the House what the Zac de Beer case was. Last year just before the proclamation of the Republic, there were signs that there would be some unrest in the Republic, and as the result of that the hon. the Minister simply banned all meetings throughout the Republic. It so happened that the then member for Maitland (Dr. de Beer) had a meeting scheduled, which had nothing particularly to do with the subject of the Republic, but an ordinary political meeting was scheduled in one of the suburbs of Cape Town, and he then fell under the ministerial ban. It was decided that this was completely unreasonable, even in terms of the very wide powers given to the hon. the Minister under existing law. It was therefore decided to oppose this ban and proceedings were instituted. The hon. the Minister was advised by his legal advisers that he did not have a hope of winning such a case; the case was settled and the State paid the costs. As the result of that the hon. the Minister now wants to take powers to do what he was not allowed to do then, and I think he is demanding very wide powers indeed. He now wants this blanket power, without the accusation being brought against him that he could not possibly have applied his mind to the banning of meetings in so far as they would further the aims and objects of Communism. I think that the hon. the Minister is going too far here in terms of any democratic right, and I certainly will oppose most strongly any further extension of powers.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (a), as amended.</block>

<p>Paragraph (a) will replace the existing subsection, and the effect of my amendment therefore is to restore the <i>status quo</i>. Sir, this clause has rightly been described as the harshest of a host of harsh provisions in a Bill which has disturbed a large part of the population of South Africa. It places in the hands of the Minister extraordinary powers to restrict the freedom of the individual, without trial. It is quite true that those powers are mainly directed at persons whose names appear on a list which is in the custody of the Minister&#x2019;s Department, but the list is 12 years old and the Minister has admitted that some of the names on it should not be there at all. These extraordinary powers enable the Minister to confine a person to a form of house-arrest and, in addition to that confinement, to impose certain final restrictions or limitations upon him as to communication with other persons, as to receiving visitors or &#x201C;performing any act so specified&#x201D; by the Minister in his prohibition order. Sir, this is very widely stated. Goodness alone knows what sort of normal business or domestic activities can be included in this term &#x201C;acts so specified&#x201D;. It is not a question as to whether the Minister will act <i>bona fide</i> or not; that is not an issue at all. The point is that wide powers are being given which should, of course, be defined more strictly in the legislation itself. The enormity of this new form of penal sanction is that by resorting to this Star Chamber method of criminal trial, the executive is clothed with all three functions of Judge, counsel for the prosecution and counsel for the defence. In legislating in that way, there is a breach of a long-standing tradition of legislative practice in this House. I know of no instance in which powers of penal sanction have been conferred on a court of law by Act of Parliament in which the Act does not lay down the maximum period which the court may impose in placing restrictions on the freedom of the individual who has been found guilty of some offence against the law. Here, Sir, no such limitation is prescribed; it is left entirely to the whim of the hon. the Minister. I feel therefore that a long-standing tradition of legislative practice goes out of the window. This new form of executive punishment has no bounds or restrictions. As I say, it is left entirely to the whim of the Minister as to how long the penal restrictions are to last. They can be renewed at any time, and neither the imposition nor any renewal of these restrictions is subject to any form of executive review or executive revision. Sir, it was ruled that amendments invoking the aid of the courts would not be moved. I am not now going to pursue that argument, except again to point out that as the provision now stands, the prohibition order is not subject to any form of executive review or executive revision, and it therefore goes much further than anything that has happened in this country before. One limitation and one limitation only to the whim of the hon. the Minister has been provided and that is by the proviso which the hon. the Minister himself moved to the new sub-section (1) (a). But, Sir, what is the real value of that proviso? Admittedly it will prevent the Minister from debarring the person concerned from communicating with or receiving as a visitor &#x201C;any advocate or attorney managing his affairs&#x201D;. To that extent there is a limitation but I say it has very doubtful value since it is most unlikely that any advocate in his professional capacity will be engaged in managing a person&#x2019;s affairs. It is true that the management of a person&#x2019;s affairs may be entrusted to an attorney, but it is more usual that it is left to a banker or to an agent or to some chartered secretary. Therefore the proviso itself is of very doubtful value and it also provides an additional danger in that it brings into play the axiom &#x201C;exception proves the rule Here the exception is &#x201C;advocates and attorneys managing the person&#x2019;s affairs&#x201D; and the inclusion of one is always the exclusion of others. In other words, the exception proves the rule in cases not excepted too. Therefore a medical practitioner, a parson, a banker, a businessman, are all by implication excluded from the provision. Whilst the Minister may say that he may put them in his prohibition order, I think as the clause reads, he may be debarred from putting them in.</p>

All those matters could easily have been inserted and then the legislation would have been clear. It is anything but clear now and I say that it is a drastic position, and I therefore move the omission of the paragraph.</p>

<p>I just want to reply to two arguments which we have again <span class="col_7531-7532" refersTo="page_1012"/>had from the hon. member. The first is the question put by the hon. member as to how long this provision will remain in operation. This provision will remain in operation as long as there is a danger of Communism in South Africa. In the second place I just wish to point out to the hon. member that similar provisions existed in Kenya; they were only much more stringent than our provisions. Had the hon. member read his newspapers over the past week he would have seen that similar territorial restrictions to those we are placing on the communists here, were placed on the former Mau-Mau leaders in Kenya. They are equally dangerous and both employ the same tactics. In that case, just because that person went beyond the area to which he was restricted, he was sent to gaol by a magistrate for four years, not even by a Judge. I did not notice any newspaper making a hullabaloo about that. I am surprised, therefore, that objection is raised to it here seeing that we are only making it 12 months if a communist commits the same contravention.</p>

<p>I am not at all convinced by the reasons given by the hon. the Minister for the inclusion of this paragraph in the Bill. I think, however, that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) stated that this power that the hon. the Minister is taking of confining persons to house arrest applies only to a listed person, but I do not think that is correct. It is even wider than that. It includes &#x201C;any person, if the Minister is satisfied, etc.&#x201D; So it is not confined to a listed person at all. It includes anybody at all in the Republic if the hon. the Minister thinks that he will do certain things. Such a person if he is likely to do these things can, on the order of the Minister, be confined to house arrest or to any other place that the hon. the Minister so designates. I think it is almost the worst clause in the whole Bill, and I shall certainly vote for the exclusion of this particular paragraph.</p>

<p>medical practitioner on a professional visit&#x201D;</p>

<p>The effect will be to add one more person to the exemption list already provided for by the hon. the Minister by his amendment. On representations by the Bar Council, the hon. the Minister has inserted a proviso that no prohibition under the existing clause shall debar any person from communicating with or receiving as a visitor any advocate or attorney managing his affairs, providing his name does not appear on any list, etc. Now the purpose of my amendment is to ask the hon. the Minister to give a further dispensation by inserting the words &#x201C;or medical practitioner on a professional visit&#x201D;; thereafter the same limitation will apply, that is to say that his name must not appear on any list &#x2026;, or who is not under any prohibition. The obvious reason for my amendment is that people who <span class="col_7533-7534" refersTo="page_1013"/>are confined to their houses under the house arrest clause may obviously need to communicate very urgently with their medical practitioner, and it is not possible at a moment&#x2019;s notice, or in the early hours of the morning, when somebody is ill, to get the necessary permission from the hon. the Minister. I think it would at least show some kind of reasonableness on the part of the hon. the Minister if he would agree to the insertion of these words.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to accept the amendment because the doctor is not the only person who has to have access to that person. Many other people have to have it and that will be specified in the notice to the person concerned. There will be a number of other people and we cannot insert a provision in this Bill that a medical man should be allowed. You have the dentist, the nurse, the midwife, and any number of other people who have to have access and it is not practical to insert it here. The only reason why the attorney and advocate are mentioned here is that the Bar Council insisted upon it that that should be stated very clearly; that no matter who else you refuse, the person should not be prohibited from having access to his attorney and his advocate. They wanted to make sure that in principle that would not be refused because, as they put it, that would have been in conflict with the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. But the moment we specify any person, we will have to specify his bank manager and a whole list of other persons. That will be done administratively and the person will be notified of it.</p>

<block name="quote">In line 12, after &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and for the purpose of furthering or in circumstances calculated to further the aims and objects of Communism or of an unlawful organization.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This sub-section makes it an offence to record, reproduce or print any speech, utterance or writing by a named communist, and the purpose of this clause is to combat Communism. The effect of our amendment will be to make it an offence to record any speech or writing by a named communist and to disseminate it if it is done with the purpose of furthering Communism, or if it is calculated to further the objects of Communism or of an unlawful organization. I submit that if the House accepts our amendment, we will be achieving the whole object of this clause. If the House does not accept this amendment, it will place the public generally, and especially the Press, in an impossible position. It will mean that the Press will have to keep long lists of named communists and study these lists before they report any speech or news which might involve them in criminal sanctions. I submit that it would put the Press in an impossible position. They may quite inadvertently report a speech or utterance by a named communist, not with the object of furthering Communism, and they may find that they are liable to a term of imprisonment of three years. Not only will it affect the Press, but every member of this House. As I pointed out before, it is often necessary to quote the speeches and writings of named communists in order to combat Communism. Every member here will have found at different times that he has had to quote speeches by named communists. I submit that is one of the best ways of combating Communism. But now we have the ridiculous position that we can quote any speech made by Mr. Kruschey or any foreign communist, any of the communists in the African states to the north of us, without committing an offence, but once we quote what a local named communist says we are committing an offence. I know from my experience that not only do politicians use speeches made by these people in attacking Communism, but also in attacking the other political parties.</p>

<p>Yes! The Progressive Party and even the Nationalist Party. We used these speeches to great advantage in attacking the Nationalist Party, and I have no doubt that the Minister himself and other Government members have used these speeches to attack the United Party. If any politician inadvertently uses a speech made by a communist to assist his own cause, not with the object of promoting Communism, or the Press inadvertently prints that speech, the politician as well as the Press will be committing an offence. I submit that it is quite unnecessary to tackle the matter in this manner. What is more, if they quote, not for political purposes, the utterances may be named communist, even for scientific purposes, they may be committing an offence inadvertently. I cannot see why the Minister refuses to accept this amendment, because if he accepts our amendment it will be an offence to disseminate a speech of a communist if it is done for the purpose of furthering Communism, and after all, that is all the Minister wants to get at. I therefore hope the Minister will change his mind and accept this amendment.</p>

<p>I second the amendment moved by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). I would like to say that since the Committee Stage apparently we have enlisted in our opposition to this Bill even the help of the <i>Burger</i>. It is significant that since the discussion in the Committee Stage when this matter was discussed and all the difficulties were pointed out, the <i>Burger</i> has come out in support of everything that we said on this side in opposition to this clause. Indeed, the <i>Burger</i> supports the amendment of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories. In a leading article on 7 June the <i>Burger</i> claims, exactly as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories has said, that they would have to keep a list of such named communists and carefully eliminate their utterances from their comments, and they went on to say even when those words include necessary information or can serve the anticommunist cause through critical repudiation of such statements. I do not understand why the Minister will not accept this amendment. Surely the object of this clause is to prevent people from disseminating or reproducing communist propaganda. We want to stop that, and no one will be more willing to help the prevention of the spread of communist propaganda than hon. members on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Of course that is so. But this clause does not do that. If the <span class="col_7537-7538" refersTo="page_1015"/>amendment of the hon. member is accepted, it would do just that, and nothing else, but quite apart from the difficulties which the newspapers will have, the <i>Burger</i> puts it as well as I can put it when it says: &#x201C;We ask therefore whether it is possible to phrase the clause in such a way that a distinction is drawn between factual and propagandistic publication of the words of listed persons.&#x201D; That is precisely what this amendment hopes to achieve. It hopes to achieve the position where the only persons who will be prosecuted will be those who publish the statements of named communists for the purpose of propagating Communism. It does not help for the suggestion to be made that obviously the Attorney-General will not prosecute in those cases, or that obviously it is not what the Minister intends. Obviously this is not what the Ministers intends, and this amendment is to bring the clause within the ambit of what the hon. the Minister in fact intends. It does not help to say that prosecutions will not be instituted against people who disseminate or reproduce statements by named persons for the purpose of fighting Communism. The point is that it places an unnecessary and unwarranted restriction on the use of statements made by such persons. How many people would dare, knowing that it was unlawful, to reproduce the statements of Luthuli when he was fighting, in an election, someone like the Progressive Party or the Liberal Party? How many people would dare to use a statement of Luthuli in those circumstances? Frankly, I would hesitate myself, if I were fighting an election against the Liberal Party or the Progressive Party, or a representative of the Congress of Democrats, to use a statement by Luthuli, because I would know that I could be prosecuted. I must say that it is perhaps because of my upbringing, or because of my profession, that I would not willingly do something which would be an offence, and if I quoted Luthuli&#x2014;and I have quoted him and I would have hoped in future to be able to quote him in the various by-elections between the United Party and the Progressive Party&#x2014;I will not now quote him because I know it would be an offence. That is the position in which the Minister has now placed everyone who wishes to fight these people and the ideology they stand for, and I hope that the Minister will have regard to this amendment. I think it is a reasonable amendment and it puts into law what the Minister intends, and puts into effect what the <i>Burger</i> itself hopes the Minister will achieve.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of substance in what the editor of the <i>Burger</i> wrote in his article. Before the publication of that article, as well as thereafter, I gave particular attention to this clause. I am aware of the problems which the <i>Burger</i> has raised. On the one hand my difficulty is that if you make any concessions, you are creating another loophole which the communists can use. I am convinced, having studied the amendment of the hon. member, although in essence I agree to a great extent with the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes), that this amendment does not cover the problems which both he and I have in mind. I cannot agree, therefore, to the acceptance of this amendment as it appears before us at the moment, because it will create a loophole which we will only have to cover at a later stage. I am still, however, continually giving attention to this clause and I am trying to find another formula whereby it will not be as wide as it is at the moment and if I succeed in finding such a formula I will with pleasure move an amendment in the Other Place to cover the position.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end of the proposed paragraph (b) &#x201C;in so far as may be necessary to deal with the emergency so proclaimed&#x201D;</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister already has full and complete emergency powers under the existing Public Safety Act to deal with any action, threat of action or circumstances which may seriously endanger public order or safety. The Minister simply has to proclaim an emergency in the area in question and then he can handle the situation by regulation. Moreover, under Section 4<i>bis</i> he has the further powers to detain anywhere in the Republic people who are arrested in the troubled area, and moreover under that section he has powers to apply the proclaimed regulations to such detained persons wherever they happen to be detained. Notwithstanding that, we are prepared to assist the hon. the Minister, as our amendment indicates, to give him certain limited extra powers which will then enable him to deal fully and effectively, even outside the area in which the emergency is proclaimed, with activities which may fairly be said to be connected with it, should they show themselves anywhere in the Republic. In other words, we are prepared to give him all the power to deal anywhere in the Republic with an emergency in any area in which an emergency has been proclaimed, and I suggest that that is a very fair attitude. The hon. the Minister in his Bill, however, asks for still further powers. Clause 16 provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201D;(b) Any such regulation &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say, the regulation which has been proclaimed under an emergency in any particular area&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; may, to such extent and subject to such modifications as may be specified in the relevant proclamation or in any subsequent proclamation by the State President in the <i>Gazette</i>, be declared to apply also outside the said area.</block>

<p>I suggest that that has two very serious consequences. One is that notwithstanding the fact that no emergency in fact exists in, say, 99 out of 100 areas in the Republic, notwithstanding the fact that no dangerous situation exists in all but one magisterial district, the Minister is taking powers to legislate by regulation in such areas. He can act, in other words, as if there is a dangerous situation or an emergency in all those other areas. He can wield powers as if there is an emergency, and those powers are extremely extensive. I suggest that when there is an emergency in, say, the district of Potgietersrust and when regulations have been proclaimed to deal with the emergency there, the Minister has the power, without declaring an emergency in any other area, to legislate or to rule as if there were emergencies in other areas, and I submit that that is going very far.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; this provision in fact gives the hon. the Minister the right to take emergency powers in that area; that is the point. I have already explained that if there is an emergency in, shall I say, Potgietersrust magisterial district, we are prepared to support the Minister completely in dealing with that emergency, whenever any manifestation of that <span class="col_7543-7544" refersTo="page_1018"/>emergency occurs, in all the other districts of the Republic. That we are prepared to do and our amendment underlines that position. But why does the hon. the Minister take these further powers that I have indicated he will have. If he does not want this power, why does he take it, because it only sets people&#x2019;s emotions going, it only does us harm elsewhere, it only worries people who are determined to see the maximum liberty preserved to people. Why does the hon. the Minister do it?</p>

<p>I say with respect that that is the one consequence which this new power that the Minister is seeking to take has. The other consequence is this, that notwithstanding the fact that there is in fact an emergency in a second district&#x2014;not only in Potgietersrust but in a second district&#x2014;the Minister is taking power here to pretend, as it were, that there is no emergency in that second district; in other words, instead of calling a spade a spade and saying, &#x201C;Look, there is unfortunately an emergency &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Instead of saying that there is an emergency and facing the fact squarely, the Minister will have the power under this clause to apply the powers that he has through the Potgietersrust emergency, in the other emergency areas and say nothing about it. While one concedes that one does not want people to be unnecessarily perturbed about a situation, if in fact there is a dangerous situation in a second or a third area, then let it be said and let it be faced. It is because this amendment by the Minister does these few things, which one would like to see him avoiding&#x2014;we would like to see that he takes no more powers than he needs&#x2014;that we cannot support his amendment. We suggest that our amendment is a very fair amendment. Indeed, the hon. the Minister at the second reading himself was considering the wording proposed by us here, and I hope that subsequent reflection may have led him to find it possible to accept this amendment. Let him take all the powers that he really needs and let him leave tempers as little ruffled as possible and let him leave the protection of the law as firm as is possible.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Let me concede at once that the hon. member is trying his utmost to help me&#x2014;from the frying pan into the fire. At the Committee Stage I explained to the hon. member that it happened during the recent state of emergency, where a state of emergency existed in Cape Town and Wynberg, that the circumstances and actions of the people responsible for the state of emergency were such that my predecessor was obliged to declare, firstly, Stellenbosch, then Paarl and subsequently Wellington and other districts as districts where a state of emergency existed whereas a state of emergency did not exist there and whereas it was not necessary to do so. If the hon. member were to read the Emergency Act which his party supported he will realize that we cannot declare a 50 per cent state of emergency in a district; we have to declare a 100 per cent state of emergency. This clause simply gives us the right, with a view to the circumstances which prevailed on the last occasion, not to declare a 100 per cent state of emergency in an adjacent district, but only to apply certain provisions as far as need be. That is why I say the hon. member wants to help me from the frying pan into the fire. He knows that as his amendment is worded at the moment the Minister will be vulnerable in respect of each regulation which is promulgated, in respect of every step which the Minister takes in a state of emergency, and one court case will follow upon another. Court cases are the last things you should have in a state of emergency; you cannot afford them. In normal circumstances you cannot afford it, far less so in a state of emergency and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member. As a matter of fact, what I am doing here is to ease the position because the Minister has the power under the Emergency Act to declare a state of emergency in all districts but he does not wish to do so. He wants to water it down so that only certain regulations will apply in respect of certain districts. With the best will in the world I cannot understand how anybody can object to this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I will attempt to explain to the hon. the Minister why we regard this as necessary. The hon. the Minister gave the example of the previous state of emergency which unfortunately arose down here and where it was necessary to proclaim an emergency in adjoining areas for the sole reason that the emergency existed here and that these powers were necessary, and the only way in which he could extend those powers was by declaring a state of emergency in a further area. I think that is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument. It is true that we wish to avoid that necessity, and there we agree with the Minister. I submit it is perfectly clear that if in respect of an emergency in the magisterial district of Wynberg, it is necessary to extend the powers which are taken in that emergency to adjoining areas for the purpose of dealing with the emergency situation in the magisterial district of Wynberg, that would be possible under this clause, with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pine lands (Mr. Thompson.)</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>But then every regulation can be questioned in court.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am all for the questioning of regulations in a court of law where it is in the interests of the public that that should be done in order to see that justice is done. The position is that if, as is set out in the amendment, the regulations are extended in so far as it may be necessary to deal with the emergency <span class="col_7545-7546" refersTo="page_1019"/>so proclaimed, then as long as the powers are used only for that purpose, quite clearly an application to the court would be of no avail. But the point that the hon. the Minister is overlooking and the point which we on this side of the House feel very strongly about is that in emergency powers should be dealt with as emergency powers and should be as limited as possible. Under the clause as it stands&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister will concede this&#x2014;even if there were an emergency over the whole of the Cape Province, for example, it would be possible in effect to proclaim a state of emergency over the whole of the Cape Province by declaring a state of emergency in one district only, because on the declaration of a state of emergency in one district only, it is possible to provide that all the regulations will apply to the whole of the Cape Province, for example. Sir, it is my submission to the hon. the Minister and to this House that it would be utterly wrong to do that. In other words, the effect of the amendment which has been moved would be to give to the Government of the day the power to deal with the emergency concerned but it would not give the Government of the day the right in effect to have an emergency throughout the Union without declaring it. We are dealing here with extraordinary powers, and I think it is a sound principle that they should be as circumscribed as possible, while at the same time making it possible for the Government to deal with an emergency. While there may be an attempt to upset the regulations before a court, that is no real answer to the amendment moved by the hon. member, because if the Government has acted only insofar as the necessity of the case required, the court would undoubtedly uphold the decision of the Government of the day.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) did not understand the problem raised by the hon. the Minister. I do not want to do him an injustice but I want to ask him whether he advanced that argument deliberately. The facts are simply these: It is necessary for the Minister to be able to declare a qualified state of emergency, and if the hon. member for Germiston (District) were sincere&#x2014;I ignore the hon. member for Pine lands (Mr. Thompson)&#x2014;he should have moved an amendment allowing a qualified state of emergency because he realizes that it may be necessary for the Minister to apply certain measures to a district adjoining the district where a state of emergency has been declared. And what do hon. members opposite do? They propose that emergency regulations may be applied there but subject to this proviso &#x201C;as far as it may be necessary to combat that state of emergency&#x201D;. What is the effect of that? The effect of that is that the moment the Minister takes steps under the regulations which he has applied there, the question will arise whether they are necessary in order to combat the state of emergency and the court will have to decide that question because the section clearly says &#x201C;as far as it may be necessary&#x201D;. If he were to say &#x201C;as far as the Minister may deem it necessary&#x201D; he will be solving the problem but he does not want the Minister to have that power.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to explain once again that the first thing which the hon. member for Pine lands will do when such a case comes before the court will be to ask for an interdict against the Minister restraining him from carrying on with the actions he was taking. And what will that mean? Say, for instance, the Minister were to take action against people here in Cape Town. Assuming there is a state of emergency in the Cape Town district and that the people responsible for it seek refuge at Stellenbosch. Let me state it simply: Assuming he takes action against the people in Stellenbosch; assuming he arrests them; in that case the hon. member as an advocate will on behalf of those people who are being detained, obtain a court order for their release. Or assuming the Minister introduced a curfew; in that case the hon. member for Pine lands will have the right in terms of this clause to obtain an interdict against the Minister restraining him from continuing with that measure until such time as it has been decided that that measure is necessary to combat the state of emergency. The hon. the Minister has already explained the position but it seems to me that you should not only state the case in general terms but that you must also give specific examples for that hon. member opposite to understand it. The hon. the Minister said:&#x201D;Your amendment is helping me from the frying pan into the fire because I will not be able to take quick and effective action if I accepted this amendment&#x201D;. They insist that the Minister should accept the amendment. In other words, they insist upon it that the Minister should exercise the powers which he is given and which the country expects him to have in order to combat a state of emergency, in an ineffective way. That is why I say that the hon. gentlemen are not serious because the hon. the Minister has given them the opportunity of reconciling their objections with his, if they really have objections, but they did not wish to avail themselves of it. What must we think of that, Mr. Speaker?</p>

<p>Sir, if that were so, we would not move the amendment, because we have said that we appreciate the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty. He has an emergency in one or two magisterial districts and he does not want to declare a state of emergency in the whole country, and so he wants the power to extend certain of the regulations to the other magisterial districts. Well, we understand that, but the effect of this clause, without our amendment, is to give the hon. the Minister powers that he would normally have only in a state of emergency over the whole of the Republic merely by declaring a state of emergency in one magisterial district. What we have suggested to the hon. the Minister is that he should only take that power in law in this clause for the purpose of doing what he says he intends to do. If the hon. the Minister now takes powers which he does not need to deal with an emergency, then why should the court not tell him that he does not need those powers, if in fact he did that, if in fact that happened?</p>

As the situation is now and there is a state of emergency in Pondoland, all the Minister has to do is to say&#x201D;Look, I would rather deal with this area under the Public Safety Act and not under the Native Administration Act&#x201D;. The moment he does that, the hon. the Minister has all the powers in the book, he has all the powers of Parliament. The hon. the Minister would not dare to introduce a Bill into this House to give him all the powers he would have under a state of emergency. But that in fact is what he is doing here.

<p>This is the clause which merely by substituting the word &#x201C;1962&#x201D; by &#x201C;1963&#x201D; re-enacts part of an Act which was debated at great length last year that the Attorney-General may detain for 12 days, without trial, without bail, without reason, any person at all. This part of the old Act which was passed last year has already lapsed on 1 June. The power was given for one year and on 1 June, last, it lapsed. We had the benefit last year of a long, somewhat tortuous statement, from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor as to why it was that this extraordinary power was required. He gave many reasons for it. But, Sir, this is a most extraordinary power to give to anybody. It is a very serious matter to deprive anyone of his liberty, even for an hour. It is an extraordinary matter to come before Parliament to ask Parliament to give the power to the Attorney-General to order the detention, without trial, without bail &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. the Minister did quote Strachan and Turok, and Strachan and Turok are the very reasons why this clause should not be in the Bill. Under this clause the accused cannot get bail at all for 12 days. The hon. the Minister quoted Turok&#x2019;s case. The Minister says that it is to deal with cases like that, cases of saboteurs that you want to be able to retain them for 12 days. Does the hon. Minister have no faith in our courts that they would refuse bail in a case like Turok&#x2019;s? I want to remind this House that in the case of Turok, there was an application for bail and it was refused by the court, for the very reasons that the hon. the Minister suggests. I hope the hon. the Minister will not throw up arguments like this any more. I think that our courts can be trusted to grant bail or to refuse bail in proper cases. Turok&#x2019;s case was a proper case and the court properly refused bail. And why 12 days? Why should a man be deprived of his liberty for 12 days without bail, without any recourse whatever to anyone at all? This is a most serious matter and this undermines the very basis of our society and the foundation of our civilization, the freedom of the individual. How can we pass powers like this so that one person, the Minister, can lock up a man for 12 days without him being charged for any offence whatever?</p>

<p>It does not say that in the Act. The Minister can reverse any decision of the Attorney-General. There are no exemptions from that. The Minister is the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is the Minister. There are no exceptions to this rule. So this is a power that is placed in the hands of the Attorney-General, is given to the Minister: If the Attorney-General does not exercise it, the Minister can make him exercise this power, and the Minister can do it himself&#x2014;to deprive a man of his liberty for 12 days. The hon. the Minister is asking the House to pass this without giving any real reason why this should be passed. Last year, it was passed because it was expected that on 31 May there was going to be a lot of trouble. Fortunately there was not. One would have thought that on 31 May the reason for this would have lapsed. That is why Parliament laid down that it should lapse in June this year. It has lapsed. Now the whole business is to be revived, and all we have had from the hon. the Minister are two names, Strachan and Turok, in respect of whom the courts have in any event indicated <span class="col_7551-7552" refersTo="page_1022"/>how completely unnecessary this clause is.

I myself made representations to the then Minister who tried to deal with these cases as expeditiously as possible, and in all the cases that I dealt with it was found that these Bantu were taken off the streets because they could not comply with certain demands made by the Police. We had dozens of cases. They were kept there in some cases for seven days before the Minister found out that they did nothing wrong. I can mention the case where the pass of a Bantu was held by his boss; he did not have it with him when he went on an errand. That man was in prison for seven days, completely innocent.

<p>It is not a question of an emergency only. The Minister knows that the ordinary procedure in law is an arrest. A man arrested may be detained for 48 hours before being charged. Then he can be remanded for 14 days, and the question of bail arises at the first hearing. The hon. the Minister must know from his own experience that a prosecutor can get up, as they sometimes do, and say: My investigations are not yet complete and I oppose bail. In that case the magistrate accepts that statement and remands a man for 14 days.</p>

<p>Very rarely a magistrate will not accept the statement of the prosecutor. Notwithstanding the right he has to grant bail, no magistrate will go over the head of the prosecutor when he says &#x201C;My case is not complete, and I fear that if the accused is not kept in custody, it may prejudice the case of the Crown&#x201D;. That means 14 days plus two days are 16 days in all. Why then does the Minister want these powers, when the existing law satisfies everything the Minister wants? Our procedure has stood the test of time and where the Crown has urged that bail should be refused, the Supreme Court in practically every case has refused bail. I feel that the hon. the Minister does not need these powers, and therefore I am going to vote against it.</p>

<p>I spoke against this clause in the Committee Stage of this Bill, and I therefore do not intend to repeat the arguments which I used then.

I am quite certain that next year we will have another amendment to extend this for another year, and gradually this will become a permanent part of the law of South Africa. In the course of the discussions in the Committee Stage, I asked the hon. Minister how many people had in fact been detained under this 12 days without bail clause and he said he would answer the question if it were tabled, which in fact has been tabled by the hon. member on my right, but the reply is standing over.

<p>He may also possess other information which I asked for, namely how many persons were subsequently charged.

The hon. the Minister seemed to think that that was a very small number of cases. Of course here again we show a complete divergence of opinion as to what are normal circumstances in a so-called democratic country operating under the rule of law. I think 30 people detained without right of bail is a very large number for one province, and I think the number is very much larger if the other provinces are included. Perhaps the hon. the Minister in the course of his reply can indicate to us how many of the 30 people who last year were detained for 12 days without bail, were subsequently charged with any crime and how many were found guilty?</p>

<p>I move the same amendment during the Committee stage of the Bill in an endeavour to restrict the power which the hon. the Minister is taking under this clause which enables him now to ban any meeting and all meetings, not only the particular gatherings which he could ban previously in terms of the Riotous Assemblies Act where he had reason to believe that feelings of hostility would be engendered between the various racial groups. I believe that the Minister has great powers already under existing legislation and I therefore do not wish to extend those powers. Furthermore, paragraph (b), the deletion of which I have moved, allows the hon. the Minister to prohibit the reproduction and dissemination of any speech or utterances of persons who are banned and persons who are prohibited under certain laws from attending or addressing gatherings. As stated earlier, I believe this to be a grave infringement of freedom of speech in a democratic country and I therefore move my amendment.</p>

<p>Duly authorized by the hon. member for Durban (Musgrave) (Mr. Hourquebie) I move the amendment as printed in his name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;concerned&#x201D; in line 8, page 15, to the end of paragraph (b).</block>

<block name="quote">No person shall be convicted of an offence under paragraph (a) if he satisfies the court that at the time of the alleged offence he had no knowledge of the prohibition concerned.</block>

<p>The reasons for this amendment were fully canvassed at the Committee Stage of the Bill and I do not, therefore, intend to elaborate on them, except to say this: The onus of proof is placed on the accused and he has to establish that, having made some utterance, he had no knowledge of the prohibition concerned at the time the alleged offence was committed. That onus on him is a heavy one and he will have to discharge it. It seems to me that it is elementary justice that if in fact he is quite sincere and honest about his lack of knowledge, he should not be convicted because of some technicality or other such as publication in a Gazette of a prohibition about which he plainly had no knowledge at all. The fact that the prohibition has been published could of course be used either to refute his statement or to discredit his evidence. That can take place quite fairly. But to me it is elementary justice that when the onus is placed on the person concerned, and he has honestly and sincerely discharged that onus he should be entitled to the benefit of it. I would urge the hon. the <span class="col_7557-7558" refersTo="page_1025"/>Minister to drop these two last lines of the Clause.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-sections (1) and (2) and to substitute the following new sub-sections.:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) Any person who by means of an explosive or with intent to cause insurrection or to seriously interfere with the operation of the affairs of State, or to seriously damage the national economy, or to seriously interfere with essential services&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) murders or attempts to murder any person; or</li>

<p>shall be guilty of the crime of sabotage and liable on conviction to the penalties provided for by law for the offence of treason;</p></li>

<li>(2) For the purpose of sub-section (1)&#x201D;essential services&#x201D; includes&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) any hospital service;</li>

<li>(b) any transport service;</li>

<li>(c) any service relating to the generation, supply or distribution of electricity or water;</li>

<li>(f) any fire brigade;</li>

<li>(g) communications.</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>The amendment is to omit sub-sections (1) and (2) and to substitute a new definition for the crime of sabotage. Like the amendment which was moved at the Committee stage, the main provisions in this amendment are taken over from the War Measures which were included in our law as a matter of emergency at that time. The hon. the Minister indicated that <span class="col_7559-7560" refersTo="page_1026"/>he was not very happy about the sabotage clause which did not define &#x201C;essential services We have accordingly defined &#x201C;essential services&#x201D; in the amendment which is now before the House.</p>

<p>We have tried to meet the hon. the Minister. We are hoping that as a result of this distinct improvement, as the Minister calls it, he will see his way clear to accept this amendment. The first part of the amendment has stood the test of time and found to be effective. The second part which defines &#x201C;essential services&#x201D; has been taken over from the references to &#x201C;essential services&#x201D; in the provision for which I am proposing to substitute the provisions of this Clause. I would like to say that there is no dispute between the official Opposition and the Government as to the necessity for the creation of the crime sabotage in the circumstances which exist. The dispute between us is what the form of the provision in regard to sabotage should be.</p>

<p>The Minister does not take the same view as you do, Sir, as to what the principle of the Bill is, because many of the things we are not allowed to do in the Committee Stage, because they are in conflict with the principle of the Bill, do not fall in any way within the definition of the principle, as the Minister has put it to the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The attitude of this side of the House in regard to the principle is clear. It goes far beyond what the Minister and his Press suggested is the position. If the Minister had brought a Bill and was prepared to put in satisfactory provisions dealing with this matter, he knows that we would have supported it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! We are dealing with the amendment now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I was hoping that by putting this point to the Minister, I was submitting a very good argument to him why he should accept the definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; as proposed in this amendment. I say that to the Minister in all seriousness, because if he accepts this amendment, we would have a satisfactory definition on the Statute Book of the crime of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; and one which is particularly satisfactory in this respect, that it includes nothing but what falls within the term &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; as ordinarily understood. That is certainly not the position in regard to the clause as it stands now. I do not want to go into a great deal of detail. In the earlier stages this matter was widely canvassed, but I think the Minister would be the first to admit again, as he did in the earlier stages, that sabotage as defined in Clause 21 of the Bill, contains matter which does not fall within the term &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; as generally understood. During an earlier stage of the Bill, when a particular case was put to the Minister, he said that an Attorney-General would not indict in a case such as that. What we seek to achieve is a definition of sabotage where it would not be for the Attorney-General to decide to indict in a case which falls within the words of the clause but not within the term &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;. We feel it is our duty to provide a definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; which is so satisfactory that any person who commits any of the acts complained of could properly be indicted for sabotage. That would also mean that there could not be an injustice. Attorneys-General can make mistakes, but it is the duty of Parliament not to make mistakes. I say to the Minister that in this definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; it would be to the interest of all if sabotage was circumscribed as it is in the amendment I am moving, because I do not believe that any hon. member can point out facts which in the normal use of the word &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; are not covered by my definition. On the contrary, it is perfectly clear that there are innumerable examples which could be given under the clause as it stands of matters which could probably be indicted under that clause as sabotage, which do not in any sense fall within the term &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; as ordinarily understood. I would ask the Minister to remember that whereas most of these provisions, we hope, are of a temporary nature only, and we hope the time will come when these extraordinary powers can be removed from the statute book, it seems to me that we must accept the fact that in creating the crime of sabotage, as we are doing here, we are establishing something which will stand on the statute book permanently as part of our law. If the clause is a satisfactory clause, there is no reason why it should not form part of the permanent law of the country. I submit to the Minister in all seriousness that as Minister of Justice he would be failing in his duty if he retained this unsatisfactory clause.</p>

<p>Then there is of course another particularly objectionable provision in the existing clause which would also fall away if my amendment was accepted. I refer to sub-sec. (2), which is objectionable because in terms of this Bill the onus is shifted.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Why not (2) alone?</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from><span class="col_7561-7562" refersTo="page_1027"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>If the Minister wishes to leave out (2), well and good, but it is not for us to tamper with the Minister&#x2019;s amendment. We believe it is wrong and that our amendment will improve it. (Interjections.) The objectionable onus is in sub-section (2) and the Minister can get rid of it by voting for my amendment. The Minister cannot get away from it in that way. It is perfectly clear that in sub-section (2) the onus is put on the person who is charged, because once he is charged he will be convicted for an offence under subsection (1) unless he proves that the commission of the alleged offence, objectively regarded, was not calculated and that such offence was not committed with intent to produce one of the following effects, as stated in sub-section (a) to (j), which are the matters which the accused must prove did not apply in his case. It is an enormous onus to put on the accused. It is utterly unnecessary to put such an onus on the accused if sabotage is satisfactorily defined. In the war measures which were found to be effective a method was adopted similar to that I have adopted in my amendment. It does not meet the case for the Minister to say: Why do you not delete sub-section (2)? What the Minister is asking us to do is to leave the absolutely unacceptable sub-section (1) there, and to confine our amendment to sub-section (2) only.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>But your argument is that the sting is in sub-section (2).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not say that at all. I say it is clear that taking (1) and (2) together, the provisions are far too wide and they contain matters which do not fall within any definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; which you can find in any dictionary, and in addition there is the objectionable provision that the onus is on the accused to disprove intent in respect of the matters set out in (a) to (j). So we reject (2) as we reject (1). We want both to go. I say that the Minister will be doing the right thing if he accepts this amendment. It is a form of definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; which has been found to be effective. It is obviously clearer than the provisions which the Minister seeks to include. There could be no conviction under the clause which I propose unless in fact sabotage was committed, and I submit that the clause is quite wide enough to cover all forms of the word &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; in its ordinary sense; and that is a crime which we are quite prepared to see created and which we realize is a serious crime because we provide that the accused on conviction for sabotage will be liable to the penalties provided for treason. By putting in that provision, we remove another objection to the Minister&#x2019;s clause, which is that there is a minimum sentence provided for. We do not propose to provide for that, but by providing that the person found guilty under this clause would be guilty of treason, the sentence will be in the discretion of the court, according to the seriousness of the offence, and the maximum sentence would be the death sentence. In a proper case of sabotage, where it is combined with murder or attempted murder, clearly a sentence of death is a proper sentence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Obviously if it was a simple case of murder, the indictment would be for the crime of murder, but I have confidence in the discretion of the Judges, that if there was a murder committed in the course of committing sabotage, I have no hesitation in saying that the Judges would impose the death sentence. I think the Minister knows that this is a mere quibble on his part that there may be only a five-year sentence. I believe that we should trust our courts and leave the sentence to the courts. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to move an amendment to the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) to read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after&#x201D;substitute&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the following new subsection:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) Any person who commits any violent and unlawful act with intent to&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) cause or promote general dislocation, disturbance or disorder;</li>

<li>(b) cripple or seriously prejudice any industry or undertaking or industries or undertakings generally or the production or distribution of commodities or foodstuffs at any place;</li>

<li>(c) cause, encourage or further an insurrection or forcible resistance to the government;</li>

<li>(d) cause serious damage to State property; or</li>

<li>(e) seriously interrupt the supply or distribution at any place of light, power, fuel or water, or of sanitary, medical or fire extinguishing services,</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>shall be guilty of the offence of sabotage and shall be liable on conviction to a sentence of imprisonment of such duration, or a fine in such amount, or to both such imprisonment and such fine, as the court convicting may deem fit.&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It is the same amendment I moved in the Committee Stage, but I wish to move it again for the following reasons. I do not want to create new offences as such, but I am perfectly prepared to have the existing offences defined and described as sabotage under certain circumstances. But I want to leave the punishment for that crime in the hands of the courts. If the offence, which already exists, is committed <span class="col_7563-7564" refersTo="page_1028"/>in circumstances which are sufficiently grave to impair the security of the State, such an offence in terms of our existing law could be charged as high treason and the death penalty could be imposed. Equally, if an offence is committed which causes the death of any person under the existing law, the person could be charged with murder and the death penalty imposed. I do not want to extend the death penalty to crimes other than those already prescribed in our law. That is why I have great difficulty in accepting the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District), because his definition works rather the other way. It brings sabotage, as defined by it, within the ambit of treason without making it necessary for a charge of treason to be brought against such a person. In other words, it is enough to be charged with sabotage, as defined by the United Party, for the court to impose the same penalty as that for high treason. So I find it difficult to support that amendment. Also, I object most strongly and voted in the Committee Stage against the Minister&#x2019;s definition of sabotage, which is far too wide and brings in all sorts of petty offences which by no stretch of the imagination can normally be described as sabotage. The hon. member for Germiston (District) said that his definition had stood the test of time. I am not sure what he means by that, because the only similar definition I can find was the one used during the war. Well, if it has stood the test of time it means that it is still being employed.</p>

<p>Then I should be grateful, because it does not happen very often these days. But right throughout this debate we have had members on this side of the House oppose other clauses on the ground that what was necessary in time of war is not necessary in time of peace. I hold that the same objection therefore obtains in regard to the explanation given to us by the hon. member for Germiston (District). In other words, what might have been applicable and acceptable during time of war in defining what was known as &#x201C;special crimes&#x201D;, rather than sabotage, although in fact they were related to sabotage, is not acceptable in times of peace. Therefore I do not want to accept an amendment which extends the death penalty in circumstances other than those we already have in our common law, and that is where circumstances are sufficiently grave for a person to be charged with high treason or murder, for which the death sentence can be imposed.</p>

<p>There being no seconder, the amendment dropped.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to support the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). It gives a definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;, and what stands in the clause cannot by any stretch of the imagination be called a definition of sabotage. If one examines the clause as it is, sub-sec. (1) states that the offence of sabotage is committed. I think it is common cause that that does not even look like sabotage, and the Minister has admitted it. He says he has had to cast his net very wide to catch everyone, but what he does in effect is to make the Attorney-General the court which decides on the facts whether or not the accused is to go to prison or not. I say so because the moment the man is indicted for sabotage and has committed one of these petty offences listed in sub-sec. (1), he will get five years.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not so. Our definition is in clear terms. It does not include petty offences. It says that offences which otherwise might be petty offences must be committed with a clear intention to sabotage. The intention is seriously to interfere with the affairs of State, or seriously to damage the national economy. If you do any of those things with that intention, it is what the public understands to be sabotage. The amendment of the hon. member also defines &#x201C;essential services&#x201D;, so that if anyone maliciously damages property in order to interfere with essential services then he is guilty of sabotage. That is precisely what this clause is aimed at. The only criticism the Minister had was that if you locked the Cabinet up in their room, then under our definition you would be guilty of sabotage. It may be that that was so, but it is not so any more, because the word &#x201C;seriously&#x201D; now appears. I do not think any court would consider that if somebody as a practical joke locked up the Cabinet it would seriously interfere with the affairs of State. The only other objection the Minister had was that there was no definition of &#x201C;essential services&#x201D;, and now there is one, and it is precisely the same one that is contained in the Rhodesian legislation which hon. members opposite are so fond of quoting, and in respect of which the Minister of Information made such a blunder. The other thing the Minister had to say was that under our definition, if anyone throws a fire-cracker, he is guilty of sabotage. During the war, under the war measures, there was a sub-section which said that explosives did not include fireworks. That is not here, and for a good reason, because I understand that with a firework one can do things which one cannot do with a match. You can throw a firework into a petrol drum, or <span class="col_7565-7566" refersTo="page_1029"/>into the petrol tank of an armoured car and blow up the vehicle. So sabotage could be committed with a firework if there were a certain intention, seriously to interfere with the affairs of State.</p>

<p>The Minister does not see the difference. If someone throws a cracker into a room, does anyone suggest seriously that he does so with the intention to murder someone? I do not think so, but let us go so far. What would happen then? The Judge would say: Do not be a silly boy; go home. [Interjection.] The Attorney-General has always had a discretion whether to prosecute or not, and he takes the circumstances into consideration and if someone threw a cracker into a room obviously the Attorney-General would not prosecute. But under the Minister&#x2019;s definition, if he did such a thing, if he did lock the Cabinet up in their room, that man would get five years and the court could do nothing about it. What is the Minister then going to say? Will he say that the Attorney-General will not prosecute?</p>

<p>I say that when the Attorney-General prosecutes he becomes the judge in the case because he and he alone decides what sentence the accused will get. He decides that he will get five years, and not the judge. And what does he decide upon? He decides upon a file which he has in his hand, and what is in that file? The depositions of his State witnesses. He has not even had the benefit of seeing or hearing the witnesses. All he has is their statements, and on that, without having heard any evidence from the other side, and without having regard to the personality of the accused and the circumstances, he decides that that man will get five years. That is what this definition means. I think the hon. member for Germiston (District) has made it abundantly clear that we on this side are as much against sabotage as anyone opposite.</p>

If a man commits sabotage, we believe that if the Judge feels he should impose the supreme penalty, he should do so.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Clause 21, to omit the proviso to subsection (1).</block>

<p>The sub-section as it now stands sets out to define the offence of sabotage and to provide that anyone found guilty of that offence shall &#x201C;be liable on conviction to the penalties prescribed by law for the offence of treason.&#x201D; But then comes the sting in the tail in the shape of the proviso which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that, except where the death penalty is imposed, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for a period of not less than five years shall be compulsory, whether or not any other penalty is also imposed.</block>

<p>I need hardly point out that the sting in the tail is readily directed at our courts and our judges. Treason is a capital offence and the gravity of that offence in the eyes of the law is not made anymore grave by the insertion of a provision of this nature. I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will accept my amendment, but if he should reject it, then this proviso as it stands will not aid the courts in the administration of justice, even though the proviso may appease the political appetite of Government supporters. But in considering my amendment the House should not overlook the fact that treason is not an unfamiliar offence to the courts in South Africa. One effect of that is that the judicial history does not lack evidence of the ability of our courts to handle such matters in the most difficult circumstances, even at times when attempts to overthrow the Government were being actively pursued by determined and dangerous men. But as I indicated our courts have always been equal to the occasion and they have left a record of the exercise of wise judicial discretion in the punishment of offenders, a record which is quite unsullied by political pressure and untrammelled by executive intervention. Therefore, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has also indicated, the matter can safely be left in the hands of the court. Sir, it has always been the prerogative of Parliament to express its assessment of the gravity of an offence by fixing a maximum penalty, but it has rightly always been the prerogative of the court to inflict whatever punishment it sees fit and not at the dictates of Parliament itself. For Parliament therefore to insist on fixing minimum penalties is an unwarranted invasion by the Legislature into the prerogative of the courts. One knows perfectly well that this has happened before. In the earlier stages of this Bill references were made to instances where it has happened before. References has also been made to where it has happened in neighbouring states. But, Sir, two or even more wrongs do not make a right. And I say that by reason of the past judicial record in the matter of the penalty for an offence of the nature set out in this Clause, the discretion to impose punishment can safely be left in the hands of the court. I would ask the hon. the Minister even at this late stage to accept that situation and to drop the proviso. The hon. the Minister saw fit during the Committee stage of the Bill to describe an amendment moved from this side of the House as an insult to the Attorneys-General. Sir, he was wrong in my opinion, but if he was convinced that it was an insult in that case, then surely he will realize that the proviso as it now stands is a very grave insult to the courts. I do not want to be a party to that insult and I therefore make a further appeal to the hon. the Minister to agree to my amendment and to drop the proviso.</p>

<p>I am rising merely because I have omitted to reply to one allegation by the hon. member, and that is the allegation that the proviso has been inserted in this Clause because I do not trust the courts. I reject that suggestion by the hon. member, and I wish to state very clearly once again to the hon. member that provision for this minimum period is made only so that Parliament&#x2014;and Parliament has that right&#x2014;can show its disapproval of these acts in that tangible manner. If the hon. member tells me that I do not trust the courts, then I reply: I trust every judge and that is why I am prepared to let every judge sit in respect of these acts. Under the United Party Government they did not trust every judge. They did not even trust Senator Fagan for he was not one of the picked judges who could hear those cases. I go further. In this case the minimum period is five years. In the period of the hon. member&#x2014;and I never heard him complaining about it&#x2014;it was compulsory for the courts in certain circumstances to pronounce the death sentence. They had no discretion at all in this connection. The hon. member may argue with me as to whether it is wrong or not to do so, but he must not charge me with not trusting the courts, for I can meet every charge he makes against me with ten others if it is necessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The first section which is proposed to be deleted here is Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides that the court upon convicting a juvenile, that is to say, anyone under the age of 19 years, can in its discretion, having heard the evidence for the defence as well as for the State, having considered all the circumstances, if it feels that it would be in the interests of justice that the juvenile, the child, should be sent to a reformatory or placed under the supervision of a probationary officer and so on, make an order to that effect, instead of sending this person to the ordinary gaol for hardened criminals. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he will say what the object of the functioning of juveniles is. Is the object to reform them? Is the object to make the punishment a deterrent or is it the object to cripple the child forever so that it will be a lesson to everybody else. If it is, I do not know why he does not take up the suggestion of the hon. the Minister of Defence and just provide that they should all be hanged.</p>

<p>The next section which is dealt with is Section 345, which provides for the whipping of male children. I think hon. gentlemen opposite, when they make all the fuss that they do about our raising these matters, do not perhaps appreciate exactly what is involved. I know the hon. the Minister does appreciate it but do the other hon. Ministers appreciate what will happen to a child of 14 if he were whipped with the cane that adults are whipped with? I do not think they can, otherwise they would have prevailed upon the hon. the Minister to do something about this. But, Sir, we have not heard a word throughout the whole of this debate from the hon. the Minister of Justice to justify this. We have only heard from his bloodthirsty colleagues; we have heard nothing from the Minister, and I do hope that he will speak about it.</p>

<p>The next section is Section 352 which gives the court the power to pass a suspended sentence, <span class="col_7571-7572" refersTo="page_1032"/>to suspend part of a sentence and so on. That is also to be abolished. This tightens up the question of the minimum sentence. The court cannot give a man a sentence of five years&#x2019; compulsory imprisonment and suspend four years of it for three years anymore. I want to ask the hon. the Minister again: What is the object of tying the courts&#x2019; hands like this. Why only for juveniles? Why does he want to treat juveniles in the same barbaric manner &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should like to confine myself to the matter which is of vital importance to the farmers of South West Africa, and that is namely the marketing of meat, but I should like first of all to refer to a few remarks made by some of the previous speakers. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town for instance said: &#x201C;If things don&#x2019;t improve, the farmers will go out of business.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It is a very old story that all the farmers will go under and that the farmers are all going insolvent, and that the farmers can no longer make a living, and now we hear &#x201C;They will go out of business&#x201D;. It has happened frequently in the past that some farmer has had to discontinue farming operations, but it is a fact that as soon as one farmer leaves the farm, another farmer takes his place. I know of no farm that has no owner, and it frequently happens that the farmer who comes in the place of the one who could not make a living, makes a very great success of farming on that farm. Of course it depends on his knowledge of farming operations, on the capital at his disposal, on his experience, his organizing ability and his administration, his methods of operation and his type of farming. And then I wish to add that many of the farmers should never have been farmers. He has no training, he has no experience, he has no knowledge, he is no farmer, and then he falls by the way.</p>

<p>It applies to all types of farming. The hon. member may be sure that the farmers in South Africa will never go out of business.

<p>Since when have the prices of the farmers dropped? It was in the time of the United Party r&#x00E9;gime that the prices continually dropped. I remember how we begged the then Minister of Agriculture on our knees to allow us an increase in the prices of meat, but it was only when the National Party came into power that the prices rose progressively.</p>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_for_south_west_africa_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SOUTH WEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. But is it correct that the costs of production rose while the producers&#x2019; prices dropped? Is it not the other way about? Must we not say that because the prices of the farmer&#x2019;s produce rose, the cost of living and the costs of production rose? Is it not a fact that when the prices of maize are increased, the price of maize land soars? Is it not a fact that when wool prices are increased, the price of sheep land rises? And when the meat prices rose, the price of pastoral land rose. Nobody will deny that when the price of any commodity rises, the price of the land on which you produce that product gradually rises, and land prices is one of the basic factors in your costs of production. It would be more correct to say that the rise in the prices of products has resulted in a rise in land prices and that in consequence there has been a rise in the costs of production, and this is one way in which increased prices necessarily force up the costs of production. It is a spiral that continues. The higher you make the prices of your products, the higher your costs of production soar. Sooner or later there must be a turning point. It happens to be a fact that when you want to stop the cost of living, you must start with the price of your basic food, that is to say, with the price of your milk, butter, meat, wheat, maize, eggs etc. It is cruel to say so, but it is a fact that the farmer is then affected first. When the consumer has difficulty in obtaining the necessaries he needs, he can still economize on such things as clothing or other necessaries in his home, <span class="col_7575-7576" refersTo="page_1034"/>but he dare not economize on food. That is why he must be met as regards the necessary things he must have and there the prices must be brought within his reach. It is apparently for that reason that the Government has decided, at the turning point we have now reached, to reduce the prices of wheat and maize slightly. I should like to thank the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for not having done so as yet with the prices of meat. Meat is one of the most difficult products to handle. We have heard here from year to year that the farmers are no longer going to produce meat because it does not pay to farm at the prevailing prices. What have we found? That there is a surplus of meat at the present time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Is there a surplus of wheat?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_for_south_west_africa_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SOUTH WEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>There is presently a great surplus of meat and that refutes the allegation that the farmers are discontinuing the production of meat because it is no longer remunerative to do so. Your farmer is not so stupid as to continue producing a commodity if it does not pay him to produce it. As I have said, I want to thank the Minister for not having reduced the floor prices of meat.</p>

<p>However, we have the difficulty that we cannot market our meat when we wish because meat is a very perishable product, because we are aflicted with droughts, because we are afflicted with diseases, and I wish to say that at the present time we are experiencing a terribly difficult time in South West Africa. That is why I should like to urge the hon. the Minister to do everything in his power to accommodate as much meat as possible on the market. He will know how to do it. He is engaged on an export programme, and I shall be pleased to hear from the hon. the Minister how we are progressing with the export of meat. I should like to see the quota of South West Africa on the South African market increased. I know how difficult it is. I am not asking that the South African meat should be kept away from the market. I am merely asking that measures should be taken perhaps by bringing more centres under control, by the expansion of abattoir facilities, by expanding storing facilities, in order to help us. I may tell you that at the present time we have thousands of head of cattle ready for the market, but we cannot get it out. I hope the hon. the Minister will at least be able to console us by saying that there is a prospect that the increase in the exports of our beef without too great a loss will probably be brought about.

<speech by="#swart">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SWART</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to follow the hon. the Deputy Minister, but he has made one statement here which I cannot allow to pass, for it is the first time I have heard such a proposition. I have never heard it made by an agricultural economist, I have never heard the proposition made by the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, and I have never heard any other hon. member of this House making it, and that is the peculiar proposition the hon. the Deputy Minister made here that the costs of production have risen because the prices of the farmer&#x2019;s produce have risen. It is the most peculiar statement I have ever heard in all my life. The only example the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned, is that the prices of land have risen and that it has now contributed to increased costs of production. But surely you cannot tell me that the increased price of say fertilizer is attributable to the increased prices of the produce of the farmer. Surely you cannot tell me that the increased prices of agricultural implements is the result of the increased prices of agricultural products; that the enormous increase in the prices of spares is due to the fact that the prices of farming products have increased. And what about fuel, tractors, and mechanization in general. Can it be said now that the increase in the price of the farmers&#x2019; products have caused the increase in the prices of those articles and that therefore the costs of production have increased? Among the items I have mentioned are the most important items in regard to the increased costs of production in farming. Nor have I ever heard the hon. the Minister or any agricultural economist doubt that there is a narrowing down in the cost price pincers. It is a fact that the margin of profit for the farmer as a result of the increase in his costs of production, and his agricultural requirements, and on the other hand the tendency of lower prices, not only in South Africa, but everywhere, that that narrowing down in the cost price pincers is one of the greatest problems we have to cope with. And then the hon. the Deputy Minister comes along here this afternoon and he wants to tell us just the opposite story, and tell us that it is dangerous to increase the price of farming products, for if you do so, you will increase the costs of production. I should like to say a word or two about what the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has said. He said that this side of the House is trying to break down the Marketing Act. The hon. member for Nelspruit (Mr. Faurie) also said by implication that this side of the House is no longer satisfied with the Marketing Act. He said that the Marketing Act is an authorizing Act, which of course no one doubts and that it is not the Minister who fixes the prices. Let me put it very clearly now: I do not believe there is one single responsible farmer in the country, or in this House, who wants to interfere with the principles of the Marketing Act, that is to say, with the basic principles of the Marketing Act. Any farmer worth his salt and any member of this House worth his salt, knows that the Marketing Act is an authorizing Act which enables groups of farmers who wish to have their products controlled under the Marketing Act, to apply for that and then an accommodation Act can be made to declare their product a controlled product. Let me put it very clearly that as regards this side of the House, and I think in the same way as the other side of the House, that we stand by <span class="col_7577-7578" refersTo="page_1035"/>the basic principles of the Marketing Act, and we shall stand and fall by it. If there is criticism from this side of the House, it will be criticism of the Administration and the application of control as exercised by the hon. the Minister, who is the responsible Minister who has to keep an eye on it and who has to administer the Marketing Act. He, together with the Marketing Council and the control boards must manage the whole matter. The Marketing Council is not here and the control boards are not here so that they may be criticised by us. The Minister is the embodiment of those control boards and we have to criticise him if we think things are not going right.</p>

<p>I have on more than one occasion already said that the Marketing Act is not an Act that is there merely for the benefit of the farmers. It has been introduced for the benefit of all the strata of the population, the consumers as well as the farmers. If you want to test the Marketing Act, you must inquire whether it was to the benefit of consumers in the days when the world prices of agricultural products were so high that it was a menace to the consumers in South Africa if those prices were maintained. That is the one test. The other test is when world prices of agricultural products have fallen so much that it is no longer profitable to the farmers and the country to produce at those prices. Then the test is whether the Marketing Act serves its purpose of giving the farmer a living price when the world price of agricultural products that are controlled in South Africa, have fallen to such an extent that the farmer can no longer produce profitably. Now I say without hesitation this afternoon, that in the days when world prices were so high that certain controlled products in South Africa, if sold internally at those prices, would not have been to the benefit of the consumers&#x2014;that in those days the Marketing Act passed its test and protected the consumer. To-day the Marketing Act has to pass its test in favour of the farmer. The picture is just the other way about. That is why I say, when I criticize the Minister this afternoon, that because world prices of agricultural products have fallen too much, he shows a tendency to allow the prices of agricultural products that are controlled to drop too rapidly. I add to that that if he does that, the Marketing Act will not be able to pass the second test it has to pass, that control has to pass, and then the Marketing Act will fail. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>In the few minutes at my disposal I do not wish to follow any former speaker in his arguments, for I should like to bring the few points I regard as of great importance, pertinently to the attention of the hon. the Minister, because I feel the time has arrived for us urgently to rectify matters there. I should like to confine myself to the maize position to-day. Surely there is not in South Africa at the present time a community of farmers that does not feel the pressure of the price cost pincers which is closing in through out the world, and breaking the farmer inside. I am thinking of the dairy farmers and other groups of farmers, but the maize farmer in particular to-day is feeling the pinch and received a terrific pinch this year. I should like to mention a few points which I think may help to bring relief in that position. I wish to mention at the outset what I regard as urgently necessary, and that is that where to-day we are subsidizing a bag industry in our country for the sake of the welfare and the benefit of the country as a whole, the cost of the establishment of such an industry is being imposed virtually only upon the farmer who uses bags. In normal times it would not be so bad, but if I as a maize farmer wish to buy a bag to-day, I have to buy one of the locally produced bags for 42c and at the same time I could obtain one at an import price which may be 27c or 28c. It means then that the average price of the bags amounts to 35c a piece, that is to say 3s. 6d. per bag. It is very hard when one section of a community is burdened with establishing a national industry, which is established in the interests of all. I mention a second point. We take fertilizer. The fertilizer industry in South Africa is an important industry. In the past we imported fertilizer. Fertilizer, raw phosphates, may be exploited at Phalaborwa to-day. Where in the past the fertilizer factories were built at the coast for the sake of the importation of the raw materials, we now have to move the factories to the interior. That requires enormous amounts of capital. I hope the Minister will be the mediator of the farmers who have to use that fertilizer, that that fertilizer industry will not be imposed upon the shoulders of only the farmers who to-day buy the fertilizer. We had the experience this year still that while prices have to fall considerably as a result of overproduction, etc., the price of fertilizer has risen. Those are the things in regard to which I should like to make a special appeal to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to mention another point, and that is railage. Here in Cape Town there is a grain elevator. The production of maize is 1,000 miles from here, but yet the maize farmer is expected to rail his maize to Cape Town&#x2019;s elevator, and to pay 50c per bag, whereas he can send it to other harbours at nearly 15c per bag cheaper. It is not right and fair that it is expected of that handful of maize growers in the interior to bear the cost of the establishment standing in Cape Town&#x2019;s harbour in order to make it remunerative. I once again want to appeal to the Minister of Agriculture that he should act as our mediator with the Government to see what can be done about it. I would suggest that we fix that railage at a fixed rate, irrespective of which harbour the maize is transported to. Mr. Chairman, we have to bear in mind what those export mealies are worth to the country. Last year we brought into the country about R45,000,000 or R50,000,000 which we needed urgently and direly. That was new money that came in. That is not all. As the maize industry stands to-day, it may <span class="col_7579-7580" refersTo="page_1036"/>be able to maintain South Africa&#x2019;s economic prosperity at a time when tremendous pressure is being exerted upon our economy. And if we are going to strengthen and secure that economy of the country as a whole at the least cost, then it is worth doing so. I should like to make a very strong plea to our hon. Minister and his colleagues sitting here, to assist the mealie producers and to see that these unreasonable burdens are removed. I am convinced that it would have been the wisest policy to-day to have reduced the export railage. To-day we are paying much more railage for the export of mealies than for internal consumption. But I should think that in these circumstances, and in order to keep the industry going and sound, we will very urgently have to do something in that direction, without causing a loss worth mentioning to the railways. For I say that the manner in which the Maize Control Board arranges exports, it is done in such an economic manner that not a single railway truck runs empty. We have a chain service, and as they go down so they return and they are loaded again. Full trains are running. It is not as if we couple up a few trucks here and a few trucks there. We provide the Railway system with full trains. That probably makes it possible to have the maize conveyed at a lower tariff.</p>

<p>Fourthly, I wish to mention that this is a time in which our farmers are seriously faced with surpluses and are looking for markets, and yet we find that there are restrictions, and you, Mr. Chairman, will be amazed there in the Chair to hear this, that we may not dispose of a refined product of the mealie. But our people and our Bantu can use imported meal coming from Canada to bake white bread. That the Bantu can buy and eat, but refined mealie products, e.g. baker&#x2019;s spread, may not be manufactured here in this country. We may not manufacture it. Are we not hopelessly behind the times, Mr. Chairman? The world is moving forward and the eating habits are also advancing, and that is why we are limiting our market if we do not permit this processing and refining. I should like to make another plea to our hon. Minister. We know how anxious he is to assist us wherever he can do so, but I would like to ask him to remove that limitation and to say to the mealie producers of South Africa: Go into the market and supply the needs wherever you can. Then it will be a good day for South Africa, if we could dispose of more refined maize products in our own country, instead of importing wheat from Canada and thereby sending our money out of the country. We can use our own food here, for which there is indeed a market in the country. I should like earnestly to bring these few small points also to the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister of South West Africa who is not here now, participated in this debate and told us that the cost of living should now be reduced in South Africa, and that the best way of achieving that, is to begin with the farmers, the poultry farmers, the egg producers, the dairy farmers, the wheat producers, etc. Having said that, he came along and told us that it would not however, be necessary to reduce the prices of the meat producers. And he wished to thank the hon. the Minister for not having done so. I cannot understand the argument of the hon. the Deputy Minister at all, namely that the cost of living should be reduced at the expense of the wheat producers, the dairy farmers, but it is not necessary to start with the meat producers. Let me tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that we on this side are not in favour of any reduction of the prices of any farmer, whether it be an egg producer or a dairy farmer or a meat producer, at all as long as there is a constantly rising tendency in the costs of production. That is our whole argument on this side of the House. That is the argument also&#x2014;if the hon. the Deputy Minister will not accept my word that it is so, he can look at the report himself&#x2014;of our own Secretary of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. In this periodical that was issued some time ago, namely &#x201C;Agricon&#x201D; he says what the position of the farmer is. I read from page 15&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the volume of production figures quoted above it is clear that with the exception of slaughter stock the rates of increased production had slowed down considerably over the five year period ending 1960-61. The price cost squeeze was having its effect, and the increased production, although at a slower rate over the past five years, must party be ascribed to increasing yields per morgen and per animal.</block>

<p>And then the interesting remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But it must also mean that the profits of many farmers have been considerably reduced.</block>

<p>According to the hon. the Deputy Minister for South West Africa the farmers are living in a wonderful land of milk and honey, and there is no question of their cost of living being reduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if the cost of living in South Africa is to be reduced, why then should a start be made with certain selected farmers only? We can understand that in the position we have, there is a surplus of produce, and that when there are world surpluses of products, a reduction in the price of the products must necessarily follow. But what is the position in regard to wheat for instance? Is there a surplus of wheat in South Africa? There is a surplus outside, yes. There may be a surplus in America. But in our country we still have to import a considerable quantity every year to provide for our own requirements. And what happens? The hon. the Minister gives his approval to the Wheat Control Board to reduce the price of wheat for the next ensuing season. No, the whole approach of the hon. the Minister and the <span class="col_7581-7582" refersTo="page_1037"/>Government to the farmer&#x2019;s problems at the present time is that they are experimenting with the welfare of the farmers, and that is definitely the wrong thing.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that the costs of production have been reduced. But here the farmers had a meeting at Malmesbury and elsewhere, and even an hon. Senator had to speak at that meeting, and they say that the returns that are made are quite incorrect. The hon. the Minister is a leading agriculturist in our country. He is a big wheat producer. Can the hon. the Minister mention one item in regard to the production of wheat, to show that the cost of producing wheat has been reduced in South Africa? Does the hon. the Minister mean to tell me that the price of his tractors has been reduced?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I know the hon. member will now hide behind that. I know the return per morgen has been improved. But the cost of production per morgen has not dropped. Here the position is such that the better you conduct your farming operations, the more you are penalized for those better methods of production you apply. Here we have it that Mr. de la Harpe de Villiers, the chairman of the S.A. Agricultural Union, tells us in his Chairman&#x2019;s speech&#x2014;at the congress of the Orange Free State Agricultural Union&#x2014;in October 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The better we farm, the lower are our prices.</block>

<p>That is precisely what is happening to-day under the National Party Government&#x2014;the better the farmer, and the more productive they are, the more they are penalized for their enterprise and efficiency they show. And, Mr. Chairman, a policy of that nature, or an approach of that nature, will not help us to keep our prospective farmers and our present farmers on the land.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the approach of this Government in respect of agriculture in South Africa, and in this connection I should like to mention something to the hon. the Minister, in the latest report of his Secretary that has been given to us, he says this on page 2&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Agricultural production has in recent years, however, continued to expand more rapidly than the internal consumption has increased.</block>

<p>Then a few sentences further on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of this, and the promising internal market for these and related products it will therefore be wise to take steps not to encourage further expansion of production for a few years, and to take active steps to stimulate internal consumption.</block>

<p>But if we look at the Report of the Secretary of Agricultural Technical Services, what do we find? What does he say about the position of agricultural production?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The only manner in which a nutritional catastrophe may be averted is to do everything possible to increase production per unit and to develop and utilize the natural resources of the country in such a way to remain of value to posterity.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is no policy. Nobody knows whether the utterances of the Secretary for Technical Services are correct, namely that we are heading for a nutritional catastrophe unless we increase production, or those of the Secretary of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, who tells us that in some cases production will have to be discouraged somewhat. That is the position we have in South Africa at the present time&#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I do not intend dealing with the negative speeches on agriculture which we have had from the other side of the House. Nor will it be any use giving the facts to prove to them what progress there has been in the agricultural field and how the production and the income of the farmers have increased; it will be useless to give those facts because their minds are attuned in such a way that they cannot grasp positive things. It is like a bullet against an armour plate; it ricochets off. They are attuned to deliver adverse criticism; they build on negative criticism. Nor do I wish to change those negative option of theirs. I want them to be as they are at the moment, because they are destroying themselves with <span class="col_7583-7584" refersTo="page_1038"/>their attitude. The germ of destruction has taken such a hold of them because of their negative approach to everything which is presented to this House, that the hon. member for North East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) had to call out in distress: If we do not get a shock from outside the United Party will never again be able to take over the government. I agree that that is the position &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#bootha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about agriculture. The hon. member has made his speech and I say that we also found that negative attitude in the speech which that hon. member made. However, Mr. Chairman, I want to get away from that idea. We are dealing with something serious. In spite of the fact that certain parts of our country are hard hit annually by droughts or hail or plagues the country has nevertheless treated us well. We have always had sufficient good food to feed our people. As other hon. members have said, we have had dairy products, maize and meat. There are many other products which I could mention but my time is limited.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself more in particular to the meat surplus. I want to know whether the time has not arrived for us to do something in this connection. I do not want to start a fight, unlike my hon. friends on the other side, but I want to know whether the time has not arrived for us to do something. There is a surplus. Something must be done. By increasing the price you will not change the position in regard to the surplus. That is why I want to know whether the time has not arrived for us to look for the reasons around our kraal, here where our stock sleep, why there is such a huge surplus of meat. Has the time not arrived for the farmers to decide to send a younger animal to the market than the animal which they put on the market to-day? Has the time not arrived for us to find out why it is not possible to market a younger animal? I know it will be said that it is not easy to have the animal which is best suited to our country, ready for the market at the two-tooth stage. I agree with that, but there is a reason for that, Mr. Chairman. There is a reason why that is not possible and we have to find that reason. The reason for it is simply this that there are certain periods in the life of an animal when he needs help. There are certain periods in the life of a calf when he requires more attention than he is getting. There are times during which he needs our help and if time allows me, Sir, I should like to refer to those times and in that regard I should like to make certain suggestions for what they are worth.</p>

<p>If we protect the calf properly during the time that he drinks on his mother, if we protect him during his weaning period, if we protect him properly during the time that he loses his teeth, there is no danger whatsoever that that animal will not be ready for the market at the four-teeth stage. If the calf remains with its mother for 24 hours out of 24 hours he will grow into the type of calf which we often see in this country&#x2014;he will be hard and long-legged with the shape of wild buck; his coat will be beautifully smooth but there will be no meat on his bones. If the calf looks like that you should know that something is wrong; he lacks body. Why does he lack body? Because the calf does not eat enough, not only not enough to make him lively and to make him grow, but not enough ultimately to make him fat. If that calf is kept away from the cow at least during the night, not caged off, but if he is kept in a proper camp, it will not be necessary for that calf to subsist only on the little milk which he continually tastes the whole day, milk which satisfies him with the result that he does not eat grass, but when that calf is alone with the other calves in the open veld it will start to eat grass, and when those cows go to the watering place the following morning that calf will be met by a full udder, he will empty it and be particularly full. That calf will drink enough to make him lively, to make him grow and to make him fat. I notice my old friend opposite shaking his head&#x2014;he knows nothing about cattle.</p>

<p>If we look after that calf when it is being weaned&#x2014;1 want to hasten&#x2014;and we see to it that a week before the weaning starts, he is enticed to the manger to see if there is something for him to eat and when the cow is taken away to another camp five or six days later when he has become used to the manger, that calf will know where to go for his food. The cow should be taken away, and not the calf, as used to be the practice. The calf should be left in the place to which he has become accustomed. At eleven o&#x2019;clock to-morrow morning he will expect his mother but the mother will be in another camp. A little fodder is put in the manger and that will attract the animal and reassure him.</p>

<p>Then you get to the stage where he loses his teeth. He loses two teeth and if the calf eats grass it chafes that gap. It makes his mouth sensitive an.d tender. The animal does not eat enough. To bridge that period fodder should be kept on the shelves, and a little concentrate should be added as well. The half a bag which was left over from the weaning period should now be added. If that animal is guided through those periods, you can be quite sure, Sir, that when it reaches the four-tooth stage, it will be ready for the market.</p>

<p>I now wish to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to test these suggestions properly at a few of our experimental farms&#x2014;also for the sake of that hon. member opposite who is laughing and who does not know anything about this. Let it be thoroughly investigated and then the Department can explain to the farmer what should be done to get the young cattle ready for the market. Mr. Chairman, if the young ox is marketed we will also be able to export that meat with the <span class="col_7585-7586" refersTo="page_1039"/>result that meat will not accumulate at our markets. That old ox is the reason why our markets are overstocked; that meat cannot be exported.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just wish to say this in conclusion. We have sufficient breeding cattle which must go to the market at a certain time for us not to allow the young cattle to become too old so that their meat cannot be exported either. We should ensure that the young animal which must still grow up, is in a proper condition to be exported, and the other animals will ensure us a sufficient supply of meat. In those parts of the country where they do not have the necessary facilities, they can continue with the existing system, but we want a sufficient number of young animals for export purposes because there is a surplus in the country.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down, told us one thing and another in regard to how animals will sooner be ready for the market and in a better condition. The hon. member also told us that one should lengthen the period during which the calf drinks on its mother. If we have to judge according to size and we look at the hon. member you would really think that the hon. member has not yet been weaned. I was saying that the farmers of South Africa did not know what the approach of the Government was at the present moment. I had quoted from the report of the Minister&#x2019;s secretary and also from the report of the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services. The quotations which I have read point to the vital spot of the problem confronting both Departments. But those are, however, two entirely different points, and that is precisely the difficulty with which the farming community is faced to-day. They do not know whether they should produce more. In the second place, they know that if they produce more the tendency on the part of the Government is to reduce the prices of the products. The farmers find themselves in an unenviable position at the present moment. I want the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite to realize that our agricultural industry is the most important sector which is passing through a very difficult period at the present moment. We must realize that there are approximately 120,000 farmers in South Africa. We must realize that there are approximately 8,000 White workers on the farms. We must realize that there are approximately 8,000 non-White workers economically active on our farms. We must realize that they, together with their families, total between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 souls. Those people are dependent on the agricultural industry. We must realize that approximately R4,000,000,000 is invested in the agricultural industry. We must also remember that the total income of our agricultural industry was approximately R800,000,000 last year. We must realize that plus minus 40 per cent of our total exports are still agricultural products. Nobody in this House should, therefore, underestimate the importance of this industry.</p>

<p>We are, therefore, asking not only the hon. the Minister, but all hon. members opposite, with all the seriousness at our command, to face squarely up to the problems which face the farmers to-day. We are tired of the patch-work which we have been getting from the other side of the House. We are tired of the experiments which have been conducted. I will refer the hon. the Minister to one experiment which he conducted last year. What experiment did he conduct in regard to the meat industry About a year ago he told us that he wanted to do away with permits.</p>

We were told last year that the permit system should be abolished. We had the position for months on end that thousands and thousands of sheep and cattle accumulated every week at the markets in the controlled areas. For months and months even the animal protection societies said that the position was untenable. For months and months the municipal authorities had to face a position where their own slaughtering facilities were insufficient to cope with the tremendous number of stock which was sent daily and weekly to the markets in the controlled areas. This happened to such an extent that last year, from the end of September to December, the position was untenable. The hon. the Minister knows about it; it is not necessary for me to give him the figures. He knows what the position was in Cape Town, that it sometimes took ten to 14 days before stock could be slaughtered. Lorries could not be off-loaded. The hon. the Minister has waited nearly a year and now he comes forward with a new quota system.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members will have another opportunity to speak and I shall reply again as well. But it has become clear to me that there are only one or two points of criticism which hon. members opposite can submit. One of these has been submitted by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren), namely that the <span class="col_7587-7588" refersTo="page_1040"/>Minister exercises certain powers over the boards which supposedly makes it impossible for the boards to act as they should act. A second criticism which he has submitted is that the costs of distribution of foodstuffs are extremely high and that it is the duty of the Minister to see to it that they are reduced. A third point of criticism related to the price policy, and this is the main point which various hon. members have made. Certain proposals have been made, and particularly one by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town with which the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Con-nan) has associated himself, namely that there should be a restriction of production or a quota system, as a means of remedying this position. They want to lay down what part the State should play during this period when there is a surplus of many agricultural products, and we have to compete with overseas prices that are lower than ours. In the first place I just want to associate myself with the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Swart) who has enunciated the principle underlying the Marketing Act. He has said that it is an enabling Act, and all sides of the House accept this legislation as the best arrangement which we can make for the sale of agricultural products under the prevailing circumstances. It is an Act which has been placed on the Statute Book in order to achieve orderly marketing. Under this Act we have the various boards. On these boards the producers are in the majority, but other interests are also represented, and the hon. member for Florida was quite correct when he said that the Act should be implemented in the interests of the producers as well as the consumers. One of the basic premises, besides the fact that we want orderly marketing, is that the ordinary channels of distribution for agricultural products should be retained to the largest possible extent. When hon. members criticize the boards, and especially the Minister, and blame the Minister for the high costs of distribution, especially as regards products which are not under full control, but also in many cases in respect of products which are under full control, it seems to me that hon. members consider that the board or the Government should take over the function of distributing foodstuffs. It seems to me that they are levelling the charge at the Minister that the costs of distribution are high and that they have in mind that the distribution should be undertaken by the board concerned under the authority of the Minister, and that he is responsible for distribution. I want to ask hon. members opposite: If that is their standpoint, then they must say so, because it will definitely be a change in our whole outlook and policy as regards the implementation of the Marketing Act. Hitherto the Act has always been implemented in such a way that the ordinary distribution channels have been used to undertake the distribution after the board has collected the product concerned through its agents and has delivered it to the distribution channels. When hon. members speak of a reduction in the costs of distribution, they expect the Minister or the control board, to effect that reduction, particularly when the prices are not fixed. But when there are floor prices, as for example in the case of meat, what then? If that is what they want, hon. members must be honest and urge that the agricultural boards should handle the distribution of agricultural products. But although hon. members have put forward this criticism, I am certain that is not what they want. Why am I certain of this? It is because in those cases where we have compulsory co-operation in various branches of agriculture and the co-operative societies undertake the distribution, there is always criticism of the powers exercised by such co-operative societies. The Marketing Act was in fact introduced because the compulsory co-operative system in the past, under which the co-operatives themselves undertook the distribution, was not a success, and because that system entails certain problems and eliminates certain persons in the distributive trade. That is the very reason why the Marketing Act was introduced, namely to keep these people in the trade. If hon. members want the Minister to undertake the distribution in an economical way, then they must also urge that the Minister and the boards should have the power to undertake all aspects of distribution. If they do not want to advocate that, they have no reason to criticize the high costs of distribution and to hold the Minister responsible for them. [Interjections.] Even in the case of products for which there is a fixed price level&#x2014;this does not apply to all the products under the Marketing Act, but only to certain, such as for example wheat, mealies, dairy products and certain winter cereal varieties&#x2014;the producer is assured of a fixed price and the product is controlled throughout until it reaches its destination, namely the consumer. Even the costs incurred by the distributor are controlled. We so often hear the argument that the boards can provide the surpluses at a lower price to the poor people, rather than withholding it from the market. Then it always seems to me that hon. members are under the impression that if the producer were to supply his product free of charge to the distributor, the consumer could still obtain that product for nothing or for practically nothing. But I just want to refer to one of the controlled products, namely fresh milk, and to show hon. members what the position is. As regards this product, the distributive margins are fully controlled, and only a minimum margin is permitted, to such an extent that the fresh milk distributors in Cape Town who fall under such a scheme, suffered losses last year on their distribution activities&#x2014;I am referring to some of the largest distributors. And then the House must remember that they only take that part of the milk which they can distribute. They need not take more than that from the board. They need not take the surplus. I just want to give a few figures to show what the costs of distribution entail in an industry which is fully controlled and the costs of distribution of which are fully controlled. Take the producers&#x2019; price in the case of fresh milk. The producer receives <span class="col_7589-7590" refersTo="page_1041"/>2&#x00BE; cents per gallon. The ordinary levy for administrative purposes is &#x00BC; cent per gallon, and the special levy here in Cape Town is 1&#x00BD; cents. In other words, the purchase price in the case of the distributor is 28&#x00BD; cents per gallon. The selling price in the case of the distributor, if he sells more than 48&#x215E; gallons per day, is 37&#x00BD; cents per gallon. In bulk he therefore receives a margin of 9 cents per gallon. If he sells from 10 to 15 gallons, he receives an additional 1&#x00BD; cents in respect of distribution costs, and this is already 39 cents. If we go further down the line and he sells between 5 and 10 gallons, he receives an additional cent in respect of distribution costs, and this already totals 40 cents. If he sells from &#x215E;ths of a gallon to 5 gallons he receives a further 2&#x00BD; cents. But if he sells the milk in 2-pint bottles, he receives an additional 3&#x00BD; cents per gallon, and this already totals 46 cents. If he sells his milk in &#x00BD;-pint bottles, as many people buy their milk, there is an additional charge of 10 cents and then the total cost is 56 cents. And these are not prices which have arbitrarily been laid down; the costs of distribution are carefully calculated by the Marketing Council and by a cost accountant, and the distributor is allowed the minimum profit margin. In other words, to distribute a gallon of milk in &#x00BD;-pint bottles, the farmer receives 26&#x00BE; cents, and when it reaches the consumer, it costs 56 cents. In other words, the distribution of milk costs more than the price the producer receives. And I am now referring to items the costs of which are controlled, to such an extent that in Cape Town last year one of the big distributors suffered a loss. It is so lightly said that the State or someone else should ensure that the surplus food reaches the public, but even if we were to give people in Cape Town their milk as a present, that milk would still cost the consumer 30 cents per gallon. I am merely mentioning this, and this is also the position which we find in the case of bread which is controlled and mealies which are also controlled. The distribution margin is calculated so finely that only small profits are permitted.</p>

<p>One can argue that these people need not make a profit and that the board should undertake the distribution without a profit margin. If that is their attitude, hon. members should be prepared to say that they want to change the policy embodied in the Marketing Act and they should then say that they are prepared to use the Marketing Act in order to abolish the ordinary channels of distribution. But if one advocates this principle, why do so only in the case of agricultural products which happen to be foodstuffs and why not do so in the case of all agricultural products? One Opposition member in the Senate advocated this principle the other day. He submitted the argument that vegetables sold on the Cape Town market should be bought up by the State and distributed by the State in areas outside Cape Town. But if one advocates such a principle, why not apply it throughout? I am certain that the K.W.V. will be able to supply us with liquor at a far lower price than the retail trade is doing so to-day, and it is also an agricultural product.</p>

<p>There we have two prices which have been reduced.

<p>What? I shall give the hon. member four examples: kaffir corn, groundnuts, meat and fresh milk. But the hon. member only knows about wool and he knows nothing about the others. When we discuss a price policy which is being implemented, we must determine which products we want to control under the Marketing Act. There are various products which are under control. The first category are products which are used mainly for domestic consumption, such as wheat, mealies, meat and milk. There are products which are mainly exported. There are others, a large proportion of which are consumed <span class="col_7591-7592" refersTo="page_1042"/>locally but in respect of which the export trade is also important. For these products the price policy has never been the same. In the case of wheat, mealies, winter cereals and dairy products, we have a fixed price to the producer. In the case of others we have floor prices for the producer. In the case of others again we have pool prices. They are pooled under the Marketing Act and exported and the price obtained overseas is pooled, and that represents the price paid to the producer. These are the three different methods of dealing with products under the Act. Our basic premise has always been that the price of a product in respect of which a fixed price is maintained, is determined more or less by the average costs of production, plus a reasonable wage for the entrepreneur. That is still the policy to-day. But we cannot close our eyes to realities. Every producer produces to supply a market, to supply a demand, and if the demand is not there, one has to do one or two things. One has to try to create a further demand, or one has to try to increase the local demand. We now have the position in which we find ourselves to-day, particularly as regards mealies and dairy products. There has been no change of policy as regards the determination of the mealie prices for our local market. As regards that part of the mealies which the local market can absorb, a price is still fixed and this price is paid to the producer in respect of the local market. But they are now producing 40 per cent to 50 per cent more than the local market can absorb with the result that a loss is incurred on the surplus. The board has to make a recommendation regarding the price determination to the Minister, and what recommendation can it make? It can only do one of two things. The one is to impose a levy on the local price, and then to use that levy to meet the export losses. The other alternative is for the State to subsidize exports.</p>

<p>It seems to me you are doing both.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>That just shows how little the hon. member knows about the whole business. I say these are the only two methods. Now, seeing that we have to pay R10,000,000 alone in order to encourage local consumption and seeing that we are exporting mealies on this scale, any producer can calculate what the State would have to pay in subsidies on 56 million bags if a loss of 5 cents per bag or a 5 cents increase in the general price has to be met from subsidies. The hon. member for Gardens has now said that the Minister has stated that the people must adjust themselves to the new circumstances and that the Minister should not say that; how can he expect the farmers to adjust themselves? He has criticized the Minister for doing so. But let us take other products such as dairy products. In the case of dairy products in respect of which there are serious marketing problems, the Government has in fact intervened and said that because we cannot create a bigger market and because such a market cannot be found either, it is pointless saying: We have a surplus and what of it. We must take action; the producer must be paid; and to pay him there is only one of two things we can do. We must reduce his price in order to reduce his losses in respect of that part which he can still sell abroad, and we must reduce the price in order to create a bigger potential market locally. The Government has intervened and said that we do not want to impose all the burden of a price reduction aimed at developing a larger market on the producer; we shall only burden him with half, and the Government will pay additional subsidies to meet the difference in order to reduce the price to the consumer. The Government already subsidizes butter consumed locally to the extent of 5 cents per lb., and approximately 90 million lbs. are involved. I am only mentioning these matters to show that when we do not have a foreign market, because the British market which is our only market has imposed quotas on all the countries of the world which sell on her markets, the only thing to do is to develop a local market. And how are we going to do so?</p>

<p>That is precisely my point, namely that he must adjust himself. The hon. member for East London (North) (Dr. Moolman) says that the wool farmer has had to adjust himself.

But then the hon. member for Gardens says: But the mealie farmer and the dairy farmer need not adjust themselves.

Can the House see where our agricultural economy is heading?

<p>I now want to turn to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) who has referred especially to wheat prices. He has said that the wheat prices have been arbitrarily reduced by the Minister. He has said that in cases where we do not have a surplus, as in the case of wheat, we should not reduce prices. In the first place he advocates a principle of the Marketing Act, namely that of prices being based on the costs of production plus a reasonable profit, and here we have fixed the price on the basis of the average costs of production. But the hon. member says that if the cost of production fall, the price should not be adjusted, but when the costs of production show a rising tendency the price should be adjusted. I just want to say a few words about the wheat price. I am also a wheat farmer and for years I served on the Wheat Board, while the United Party was still in power. I just want to say what happened at that time. At that time the price of imported wheat, landed in South Africa, was between R8 and R10 per bag. In 1940-1 the producers in this country received R2.30.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from> 

<p>I shall come to that. But I am now not discussing the costs of production. I say that at that time when we imported wheat at between R8 to R10 per bag, the price in this country was R2.30. Then the United Party Government did not say that there was a shortage and that we should encourage our farmers, but they paid the farmers R2.30. I now come to the costs of production. The price at that time was calculated on the basis of the costs of production of a bag of wheat together with an entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage of 4s. 3d., and the yield was 6&#x00BC; bags per morgen; in other words, 6&#x00BC; times 4s. 3d. Imported wheat can be landed here at R5 per bag, but the local price is R5.54. That is 54 cents higher, not R5 lower. But the price is also calculated on the basis of the costs of production, just as was the position at that time. But the yield to-day is no longer 6&#x00A3; bags per morgen, but 9 bags, and the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage is no longer 4s. 3d. but 9s. 3d.&#x2014;in other words, 9s. 3d. times 9.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to discuss mealies at all. When the United Party was in power, in 1948, they reduced the mealie prices, while there was a shortage of mealies in South Africa, and a National Party Minister, Mr. Le Roux, had to raise the prices. I do not want to reopen old wounds because they are so old that I do not want to discuss them. I just want to say that the hon. member should not expose himself to this type of argument.</p>

<p>I now want to tell the hon. member what the reasons are for the fall in the wheat price. The last survey of the costs of production was carried out in 1948; that is to say, more than ten years ago. When that survey was carried out, there were quite a few items which have now disappeared and which influenced the costs of production, items which have been adjusted over this period of ten years. The wheat farmers have asked for a new survey from time to time. Accordingly a new survey was carried out over the last two years and what has been the result of this new survey? A comparison between the new survey and the old shows that the costs of production of wheat have fallen by 20 cents per bag. [Interjections.] That shows how little the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) knows about the costs of production. In 1948 the wheat farmer still cut his wheat with a harvester; he still carried his sheaves by hand and conveyed them to the rick on a wagon. He still put his wheat into a threshing machine.</p>

<p>Of course we have less. I want to tell the hon. <span class="col_7595-7596" refersTo="page_1044"/>member that as far as wheat production is concerned, he cannot teach me anything. There has been an increase of 11.3 cents in the price of farm equipment; that is an increase in the costs of production. According to the old survey the costs attributed to draught animals, such as mules for example, represented 20.5 cents per bag. I now ask the hon. member&#x2014;I think he visits the Swellendam district occasionally&#x2014;how many farms he can show me to-day where they still use draught animals.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. In other words, these draught-animals have disappeared altogether. I have just told the hon. member what proportion farm equipment represents of the total costs and what proportion draught-animals represented of those costs. Let me give another example. Take the cost of threshing. In 1948 it represented 9.1c per bag. What farmer to-day still incurs threshing costs? They all use their own combines to-day.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. But it has already been included under farming equipment. Although the price of land has risen so greatly, the new survey still shows a reduction of 19c per bag on last year&#x2019;s price. Instead of transferring this whole reduction to the wheat farmers in one year&#x2014;and this is a survey which has always been accepted by the wheat farmers in the past&#x2014;the Government has not reduced the price by 19c, but by 12c. In other words, the price is still 7c higher than the actual fall in the costs of production. The hon. member is laughing, Sir, but if he is laughing about this, then he must reject the whole system which has been used hitherto. [Interjections.] Of course the wheat farmers will complain. Everyone in the country complains when his price is reduced. Have hon. members ever heard of a farmer who says: I am absolutely satisfied with the fall in price? It is nonsensical to expect it. If the hon. member received 150c for his wool during one year and 100c during the next year&#x2014;which is still far too much&#x2014;then he would say that he was receiving too little. After all that is human.</p>

<p>As far as the export of mealies is concerned, there is only one method that can be used, namely the subsidizing of prices. I now want to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s argument that the farmers should not adjust themselves. I now want to put this question to the hon. member: Where does he come by the argument that certain industries which produce mainly for local consumption need not adjust themselves? If other industries have to adjust themselves, why should these industries not have to adjust themselves? Then I put this question to the hon. member: Does the hon. member propose that our local mealie price should be based on the costs of production plus an entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage which has always been paid on a bag of mealies, and that the Government should subsidize the losses incurred on the export of mealies? Is that what the hon. member is asking? Just say yes or no!</p>

<p>I want to repeat once again to-night that, since, we have a relatively large surplus which must be exported in the case of certain agricultural products, producers will have to adjust themselves to the new circumstances. During the transition period the Government, as it has always done, will take the necessary steps by making contributions. It will also, as in the past, take steps to build up a larger local market for those products. If hon. members think there need not <span class="col_7597-7598" refersTo="page_1045"/>be any adjustment and that the State should intervene and meet these losses&#x2014;as hon. members apparently think&#x2014;the State will have to exercise far more control over the agricultural industry in South Africa. If the State has to exercise greater control, the basic liberties of the producers to which I have referred on a previous occasion, will inevitably be interfered with in this country. Because when a producer buys a farm and pays whatever he wishes for that farm, and when he produces what he likes and how he likes and how much he likes, the Government cannot be expected to ensure that he will receive a certain price without the producer needing to adjust himself. In such a case the Government will have to intervene and deprive the producer of those basic liberties; the so called free enterprise of the farmer will be curtailed. If the price of land is left to the free choice of the producer, and if the same applies to the way in which he farms, his methods of farming, and someone else is then expected to guarantee him a certain price, that body which must guarantee him his price cannot be expected also to allow him to retain his basic liberties, because land prices will always rise and the responsibility of the State will become ever greater.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) has discussed another method and has advocated it.

<p>The hon. member says he condemns the destruction of food, but in the same breath he advocates a quota system. And I say that a quota system in effect also entails the destruction of food. No farmer can produce exactly the quantity for which he has a quota. If the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town has a quota for 100 gallons of milk, then with the best will in the world he cannot only produce 100 gallons. He will never manage it. He must then destroy his surplus production or what is he to do with it? This quota; system which hon. members are advocating is perhaps a very fine idea. It is perhaps a very fine idea to say that we should introduce a quota system. There are of course products which are produced in certain areas, such as wine which is produced more specifically in the Western Province, or fresh milk which is produced around the large cities, which can be made subject to a quota system. But if we were to apply this system to the whole country, then I ask you, Mr. Chairman, what will become of our agricultural industry? Hon. members must not think that the quota system will solve all our problems. The argument is often submitted that the quota system should be introduced in order to protect the small farmer. There are one or two products in respect of which we do have a quota system. We have a quota system in the case of the sugar industry in Natal; we have the system in the case of fresh milk in Cape Town and the wine industry in the Western Province. Does it protect the small farmers? In all these branches of agricultural industry it has always been the small farmer who complains that he cannot make a living. Jf the quotas are in general reduced by 5 per cent, it is always the small farmer who is the worst hit. His livelihood is the worst affected. It does not matter to a person who has a quota of 20,000 if he is faced with a five per cent reduction, but a five per cent reduction on a quota of 60 is a big bite out of a man&#x2019;s income. But that is not all, Sir. If we introduce a quota system, that system must be introduced on a certain basis.</p>

<p><span class="col_7599-7600" refersTo="page_1046"/>And on what basis are we to do so On the basis of the people who are in production today? If we introduce it on the basis of the producers who are producing to-day, what of the new producer who wants to enter the industry? What of the person who started with his farming on a part-time basis? What of the person who has bought land and who was not in production when the quotas were laid down? What of the body which must administer all these matters? When we speak of a quota system and of interference in agricultural industry, I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, that the State will have to interfere to an ever-increasing extent and that ever more control will have to be applied to the agricultural industry, in other words, there will be considerably increased costs. Then there is this question: To whom must new quotas be granted in future? On what basis must they be granted? Must the people who are not in production to-day be brought in later? I want hon. members to understand clearly in what position we could find ourselves with a quota system. In all the large consumer centres in the country, except Cape Town where there is a scheme, there are quotas for the sale of fresh milk. Most of the persons entering the industry are only given a quota after being in production for a year. At Port Elizabeth it is after two years, while elsewhere in the country a quota is given to a new entry to the industry only when the existing quota holders cannot supply the desired amount. I now want to show hon. members what the effect of the quota system has been on the production of fresh milk in Port Elizabeth. The hon. member may be interested because he lives there or at any rate he represents a constituency there. The effect of the quota system in Port Elizabeth has for example been that a new entry to the fresh milk market who can produce 100 gallons of milk per day on a quota, must surrender an amount of approximately R7,000 over the two years in respect of milk prices in order to obtain a quota. In other words, to obtain a quota of 100 gallons of milk, it costs a person in Port Elizabeth, his production for two years which involves him in a loss over the two years of R7,000. In other words, that quota for 100 gallons of milk costs him R7,000. He will have to maintain a production of approximately 150 gallons per day for a period of two years in order to gain a quota of 100 gallons.</p>

<p>I have received a petition from small milk producers in Natal. I just want to read to the House what they have written regarding quotas. This illustrates the problems with which we are faced. They write as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our case we bought a large dairy farm in Natal with stables licensed for fresh milk production for Durban, from a deceased estate, on the basis that the previous owner now dead, had received R600 per month for his milk supply. On taking over the farm we were informed that even though the fresh milk licence was transferred by the Durban authorities, the quota could not be transferred. On making enquiries at the various fresh milk distributors we were informed that they were not interested in taking any more supplies. On the other hand it was indicated that if we cared to pay a sum of R40 per gallon for buying a quota we could do so. It appears to me entirely wrong in principle that a farmer producing a consumer product is required to pay very heavily for the simple right to be permitted to sell his product.</block>

<p>This shows you briefly, Mr. Chairman, the problems which can arise in connection with a quota system. Apart from the fact that under a quota system there is a tendency to protect inefficient farmers and apart from the fact that a quota which has been granted in respect of a farm tends to push up the value of land and make the farm more expensive, there are all the other dangers to which I have already referred. The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. Van Staden) has mentioned one of the industries in which the quota system works reasonably well. He has mentioned the K.W.V.&#x2019;s quotas in the case of the wine industry. The hon. member has given a few examples. These quotas were introduced as at a certain date, namely the 21st June, 1957. The person who was producing wine on his farm at that date was entitled to a quota. A person who was not producing wine was not entitled to a quota. And do hon. members know what the position is? One of the producers alleged that on 21st June, 1957, he had vines. The K.W.V. alleged that he did not. An arbitration court was appointed to investigate the matter and they found that he did not have vines. But for two years that person delivered wine on a confiscation basis. For two years he delivered wine to the value of R8,000 to the K.W.V. which was confiscated because the quota was not granted. In the meantime he had a Land Bank bond on his farm and interest totalling R1,600 is now payable. Because his products have been confiscated and he cannot get his R8,000, he cannot pay his interest to the Land Bank and what must now become of him? Must he now go bankrupt because there is a quota system? I am merely indicating the problems. The hon. member for Malmesbury has referred to another problem, i.e. where a member of the K.W.V. produced more than his quota which was also confiscated. When we discuss the introduction of a quota system, I repeat that a quota system can only be introduced on a large scale in the agricultural industry. Once one starts with it, one cannot see the end. If a man cannot obtain a quota to produce wine, he produces table grapes for export. And if a surplus of table grapes arises, must they also be produced under a quota? If there is overproduction of that crop, he produces fruit and then this production must also be placed <span class="col_7601-7602" refersTo="page_1047"/>under a quota system. And if there is over-production of fruit, then he produces milk and if there is a surplus of milk, it must also be placed under a quota system. Where are we going to end? There is no end under such a system. When we suggest the quota system as a solution, we must remember that the freedom of the farmer will inevitably be curtailed. A State or a Government will not be able to take such action without interfering with the private enterprise of the farmer.</p>

<p>We are faced with these problems. These problems are due to the fact that large surpluses of certain agricultural products are being produced. What assistance can be expected from the State in order to tide the farmer over this period and to make the necessary adjustment possible? There are various methods. One of the methods is that, when certain producers, such as the dairy producers, are faced with difficulties the State makes a contribution in the form of subsidies in order to increase sales. Another method is to exploit potential local markets. But these markets can only be exploited at a price. And someone must pay that price. And the producer will have to be prepared also to make his contribution. We have a big country with developing industries and expanding industries and expanding industrial production, in which our industries to a large extent must still be given protection. In such a case the State cannot subsidize production to an unlimited extent. It can only give encouragement on a small scale and provide assistance where circumstances require it. We are not like the big industrial countries of Western Europe which only produce a portion of their agricultural requirements locally and import the rest, and which then stimulate their local production by means of subsidies. I believe that with the new development in our industries, the protection which we are giving our industries, the employment opportunities which are being provided and the increase in wages, our local markets will expand to an ever-increasing extent and that there will be an ever-increasing demand for our agricultural products. We can only develop this market by adjusting prices. From time to time we have sent missions abroad to study the possibilities of the overseas markets and not only merely to study but also to bring about increased exports. Two years ago we still had a shortage of butter in South Africa. It is only during the past two years that we have had a surplus. Until a year ago there was still a shortage of meat. Now we periodically have more meat than the local market can absorb. But we must not think that a product which is sold at competitive prices will always be bought by the producer. We must not imagine if we fix our meat prices at a certain level, that the consumer will buy that meat. We had the example last year here in Cape Town&#x2014;a very good example. For a few months there were very good snoek catches. The price of snoek fell to 3s. 6d. and 4s. per snoek. Then the sales of meat by butchers fell by 20 per cent. This shows that the consumer replaces one foodstuff by another if the price of the second is lower. We have in creased our sales of cheese tremendously over the past year by means of advertising and other methods. As a result of the lowering of butter prices there has been a large increase in our local consumption of butter. As I have said, we shall have to make such adjustments. In this regard, Mr. Chairman, you must understand that while there are producers who have already adjusted themselves to prices which have been fixed at a level above that of the average costs, they will have to adjust themselves still further to the new circumstances. Many of them will suffer and many of them may fall by the wayside during the process. Because many of these farmers are good farmers and because it is in the interests of the country that they should remain on the land, the Government has taken measures to help these people by means of loans, etc. The hon. member for Gardens has referred to the loans and he has used those loans to show that it is due to the fall in agricultural prices that the Land Bank and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board have had to advance far bigger loans to the farmers. But this position has not arisen as a result of the fall in prices. This position has arisen over a period. It has arisen particularly as a result of climatic conditions. The hon. member has quoted comparative figures relating to the assistance provided by the Land Bank and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board to farmers. He has said that larger loans are now being granted and that this is proof of how much worse the position of the farmer is to-day. Bigger loans are being granted because we are following a new policy. A consolidation scheme has been introduced; existing debts have been taken over from other persons; the Land Bank is following a new policy. When the Minister of Finance announced the new policy of the Land Bank to this House, everyone welcomed it. But now members are saying that the bigger loans which the Land Bank is granting is proof of how bad the position of the farmers is. This is a nonsensical argument, Mr. Chairman. This adjustment will cause difficulties particularly for the small farmers who farm on small units. We are aware of that fact and the Government is prepared to play its part during this transition period, and it has already proved that it will do. A study group made recommendations last year and we are implementing those recommendations, particularly in the case of farmers who cannot obtain credit anywhere. The Government is making it possible for those farmers to obtain credit under certain conditions. If the Government must step in as a supplier of credit through the medium of the Land Bank, particularly to those farmers who normally cannot obtain credit, it will have to have greater control over the farming methods of those people. They will then have to farm on certain conditions. They will have to accept those loans on certain conditions. The Government cannot pump in money on the one hand and allow that money to be wasted on the other hand. Hon. members must also not be under the impression that the people who complain and say that <span class="col_7603-7604" refersTo="page_1048"/>the Land Bank or the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board or the Government is bringing pressure to bear on them, are all such angels or are so innocent. I just want to give hon. members one or two examples. I have examples of where the Farmers &#x2019;Assistance Board has come to me. I know of cases where people have obtained loans from the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board and could not pay their interest at the end of the year. Such a person is sent a reminder by the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board but does nothing. He is sent a registered letter but still does nothing. When he eventually receives a summons, he comes and tells one how badly the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board has treated him. Then one investigates the position. He could not pay his interest but during that year he built a wool shed costing &#x00A3;800; he built another building costing &#x00A3;4000; he made alterations costing &#x00A3;800 to his house and bought himself a new motorcar. But he could not meet his obligations to the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board. I had another case. The hon. member for Drakensberg is laughing, but I want to tell her about it. These are not exceptional cases. I have had a case of a person who, besides all his other products, delivered mealies to the value of R22,000 to his co-operative. But when the interest owing to the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board became payable, he could not pay. He then said that he had nothing with which to pay the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board. When his position was investigated, Mr. Chairman, we found that his wife had been overseas for four months.</p>

<p>The hon. member will surely realize that if a man has assets valued at R20,000 and liabilities totalling R30,000, his liabilities are bigger than his assets. I say the Government has played its part and will continue to do so. The farmers of South Africa know this and have had experience in recent years of how the National Party Government has stood by them. They know that when droughts or other difficulties hit the farmer, the Government has assisted them from time to time. They know that when there was a drought in the North-West, the Government helped the farmers by means of loans to survive that emergency. The Government is once again assisting the farmers. Does the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) want everything to be given to them as a present? Does he want that?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>When there was foot and mouth disease in the Northern Transvaal, the Government assisted the farmers by loans to overcome their difficulties, and when they were hit by a drought, they received further assistance in addition to the normal assistance. In the Eastern Free State, where the farmers had poor crops for a few years in succession, the Government took action and assisted them over this difficult period. The Government stands by the farmers when they are experiencing difficult times. But, Mr. Chairman, I do not think we must exaggerate the difficulties. When one listens to hon. members opposite, one would say that all the farmers in South Africa are going bankrupt. The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) has said: &#x201C;The farmer in the Karoo cannot farm with sheep any longer because a bowl of food costs him so much and a Coloured costs him so much and at the end of the year he has nothing left&#x201D;. And then he says that the Minister has acted wrongly in warning the farmers not to pay unduly high prices for their land. He says the Minister should not accuse people of paying unduly high prices for their land. I told our farmers that the land prices in South Africa under present-day conditions were too high and that we should be careful. The hon. member for Gardens knows that the land prices are too high. He has quoted examples of this himself. But why then does he not join us in saying that the land prices should not be forced up any further. We know there are farmers who complain and say that they are finding it difficult to make a living. But examine the prices of mealie land in the Western Transvaal to-day and see what they are to-day: &#x00A3;80, &#x00A3;100, &#x00A3;107 per morgen! To produce mealies! And if it is unremunerative? No, I repeat that while we have a stabilization policy under the Marketing Act and while prices are fixed on the basis of the average costs, there will inevitably be people in the industry who will become rich, and there will inevitably be people who will suffer, but we shall have to make these adjustments, and one of the main adjustments is to increase our efficiency in the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>The hon. <span class="col_7605-7606" refersTo="page_1049"/>member says that means nothing. Can we fix a price for dairy products on the basis of cows which produce poorly? And can we then expect the consumer to pay for a cow which only produces half a gallon or a gallon of milk per day? The hon. member says becoming more efficient means nothing. But of course, if the farmer is more efficient, he can produce at a lower price. If the farmer has a bigger yield per morgen, he can sell at a lower price. Does the hon. member want to tell me that he is so stupid that he cannot see that? If he shears 8 lbs. of wool from each of his sheep and he receives 2s. 6d. per lb. for that wool, he can after all make more money than he could at the higher price by getting 15 lbs. of wool per sheep and selling it at 2s. 3d. per lb! And then the hon. member pulls a face when one speaks of efficiency. No, this making of political capital in respect of the agricultural industry will not benefit the United Party. I think the United Party must simply accept that they will not gain anything by these tactics. Of course any farmer is dissatisfied when his price comes down. But I nevertheless say that the farmer in South Africa still supports the Government wholeheartedly because he knows that this Government is the friend of the farmers.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I have the privilege of half an hour, Mr. Chairman? Before I begin to reply to what the hon. the Minister has said, I should like to say something in reply to a remark made by the hon. the Deputy Minister for South West Africa Affairs. He and several other hon. members opposite virtually intimated that when we say that the farmers are having a hard time, or that half the farmers are having a difficult time, it is so much nonsense. The hon. the Deputy Minister for South West Africa Affairs said that there are so many unproficient people in agriculture that it is probably better that they leave it. for, he said, there are no farms without owners. All right, there are no farms without owners. But the tragedy of it is that there are so many small farmers who have left, while the old land owner without debts acquired more and more land and formed a monopoly. But that is not the manner in which agriculture can continue on a sound basis. The small farmer is a necessary cog in our whole organization and he must be kept going. He should not be bought out by the large farmers. The Deputy Minister knows that in South West Africa there is a greater danger than in our other provinces of the people going under, people who farm there. If they did not have the wonderful market in the Union on which to sell their beef, many of them will go under. Hon. members opposite say that there was under-production under the Smuts Government up to 1948, but now there is over-production, and now it is supposed to be the wonderful National Government that has brought that about. Do not let us be so naive. Come let us analyse the position. In which agricultural country is there no over-production at the present time? In countries such as America, Australia, New Zealand, Canada&#x2014;everywhere there is over-production. In spite of the fact that the population of Australia has nearly doubled since the war, its wool production has nearly doubled, its exports of wheat has not decreased, its exports of meat have not decreased, and its exports of dairy produce have risen. Surely they did not have a National Party Government that was so good. The reason is simply that science and mechanization, and the industry of the farmers and the impetus of demand in the immediate post-war period led to increased production in all the agricultural countries of the world, irrespective of what Government was in power. There was increased production all over, and surpluses developed, and in our country there would really have been much bigger surpluses to-day than there are. But when I say that, it is nevertheless peculiar that Australia in the postwar years could step up its wool clip from 3,000,000 bales to 4,500,000 bales, that New Zealand pushed up its clip from 900,000 bales to 1,750,000 million bales, and in South Africa the pendulum here continued to fluctuate from between 800,000 bales and 1,100,000 bales during the past 25 to 30 years. What is the reason that our production has not been increased?</p>

Many cases of this nature may be mentioned. There are many other recommendations also, apart from the price basis the Minister has not accepted, heaps of them. When the Meat Board comes along and says: Mr. Minister, there is an excess of retail butchers trading licences, and no further licences should be granted, the people&#x2019;s margin is such that they cannot eke out any longer, there ought to be less of them, and in this centre or that centre there are hopelessly too many, and in a very small town you get as many as six, then the Minister goes along, on the personal representations of people, and grants licences, and then the margin has to be so big and then the great cost of distribution also comes into the picture.</p>

<p>This Government has had the most favourable period in respect of agriculture from 1948 to 1952. It was a favourable period for agriculture not only in our country, but throughout the whole world. The price structure was high, and the Government had the most wonderful opportunity to consolidate the position in our country that any Government has ever had, and we are now going to put the blame squarely upon the shoulders of the Government, that the Minister now at this stage comes along and for a whole hour levels destructive criticism at the whole agricultural structure, and then he has only two suggestions at the end of it all to rectify the thing. You must subsidize on a short term basis when there is a surplus of a product, and the producer should contribute his share to that by making the price of the product so much less that the internal consumption increases to such an extent that the surplus may be absorbed. No what, Mr. Chairman, we cannot just go along and tell this to the maize farmer in view of the surplus of maize we have now. The prices now have to be reduced on a short term basis and on the other hand the consumption must be encouraged in the country in such a way that we may absorb the whole surplus. At what price will we have to sell the mealies if we have to sell those 28,000,000 here also.</p>

Shortly afterwards the market began to show a downward trend and agriculture quickly adapted itself and to-day, if you were to get R25 for grazing for sheep, you will be doing well, for the prices of land and capitalization had to adjust themselves to the price of the product&#x2014;wool.</p>

<p>There the prices have been brought down. It happened in the case of countries producing agricultural products, after the war. They had to accept the adjustment of a measure of parity with world prices. As regards wool, the ratio of prices was maintained with overseas countries, and it could not be otherwise. The Minister is not concerned with the price of wool nor is that hon. friend, thank God. The price of wool depended upon what overseas countries paid for it. That is why also what the man could get out of his land was relative. But because a fictitious price existed internally for agricultural <span class="col_7609-7610" refersTo="page_1051"/>products, land values were permitted to soar so high. If this Government were as good as it pretends to be, and it knew that production would increase progressively, why did they not take steps? The Minister rightly says that there is over-production now as regards maize and dairy-produce and meat. It will not stop there. It will continue like that. What is the position in regard to maize. The reduction in the maize price looks like this: It is 27.5 cents on some kinds of mealies and 25 cents on other kinds, and calculated on this crop (I am now referring to the producers&#x2014;prices) it is only the considerable little sum of R15,000,000 less the maize producers have to accept.</p>

<p>I repeat and say that with the amount per bag less they have to accept it amounts to the considerable sum of R15 million less the maize farmers have to accept this year, apart from what the Government has to subsidize them with in connection with the export market. The Minister said it is only those three commodities. But apart from the wheat prices, the oats price is lower, the barley price is lower, the rye price is lower, oil seed is lower, dairy produce is lower. Everything is lower. Now the Minister says in his Annual Report&#x2013;</p>

<block name="quote">Our agriculture is largely in competition with that of other countries. Our farmers necessarily compete with one another mutually and also as a group with the other sectors of the national economy for the necessary means of production, such as labour and capital.

However, it is necessary also that in the case of products for which the overseas market is unfavourable at the present time, a better balance between production and internal consumption and between internal and overseas prices be established.</block>

<p>The Minister himself says that prices cannot be unrealistic and that reserve prices or fixed prices can only deal with short term graphs. But these things are water under the mill; it is gone. Can we now in these times where costs of production are still rising and agricultural prices are dropping, do something?

<p>If we have these large surpluses of maize and the price is depressed and it becomes uneconomic, then I ask hon. members opposite, what are we going to farm with then? Must we now go and farm with cattle in the maize lands? And there in the warm parts, are we going to produce dairy products or pineapples? But there is overproduction of that also already. It is no good saying that at the present time there are big surpluses of maize and dairy products only. The moment we bring down the maize production, the people switch over to something else, to meat, or to dairy produce or to oil seed, and then there is a still larger overproduction of those things. I ask whether we can continue to export and subsidize the large quantity of maize from our country with the prices we are getting? We have such a great need for it internally, in the first instance for feed in time of drought. If the person who requires it for drought feeding could get it at the subsidized price, he will buy it. I know the Minister&#x201C;problems. I have already been asked by the officials: How must they distinguish between the maize that should be made available for drought feeding, and that which should be used for human consumption? Has the one kind to be red and the other white? Or what must be done? But irrespective of what method is adopted, I submit that if we want to export and subsidize 23,000,000 bags of maize, while we could save the drought-stricken parts of our country with the subsidized maize at the cheap price, it will be worth while to overcome the problems. I have said repeatedly that one of the most dangerous ways of feeding maize is to spread it on the ground and to have the animals pick it up there. We should process it in cubes. Is it not better to consume the maximum quantity of that subsidized maize in the country? I ask further: Are we doing the right thing by our own economy and our industries when we sell cheap maize overseas so that they can feed their people more cheaply and that they can produce industrially for export to our country and so squeeze our industries to death? Is that a sound kind of economy, if when you could use the maximum quantity of a product of which you have a surplus and which you subsidize, in your own country for your own people and your own animals. But as against that we are going to help other people in other countries to eat our cheap food and to enable them to compete with our industries and kill them here?</p>

<block name="quote">Control Boards no longer fulfill their functions. They are struggling too much to cut out short term fluctuations instead of finding markets for surpluses and advertising.</block>

Now I ask whether the Chairman of the Meat Board and the Minister of Agriculture have already approached the Minister of Commerce and Industries and have exerted pressure to say: There are countries that may buy from us, our mutton and our dairy produce, while the markets there are not yet exploited, and while there are no commercial representatives there. Now I should like to refer to some of these countries specifically, and then I ask whether we do not merely have a colour prejudice and whether we do not try to find markets there on that account only. In particular I should like to ask the Minister or the Meat Board, whether he has said to the Minister of Commerce and Industries: Please appoint a commercial attache in Beirut because it is the gateway to the Middle East. And if we are thinking of a consulate in Egypt, we must not think that Egypt has no other influence than in Syria alone.</p>

<p>The Minister must not try to confuse me now. I should like to refer to Lebanon, to Turkey, to Greece, Cyprus, Iraq, Iran and then the Minister must not tell me that all the sheep will have to be taken there alive and slaughtered there. He knows as well as I that is not so. You can send carcases there and certainly to Greece. And now I am not thinking of our meat alone. When you go there, you find that Australia not only has large sales houses there, and not only has consulates, but you enter a shop and what you see are Australian and New Zealand goods, whether it be tinned meats, jams, butter or whatever it is. But you can find nothing there that is South African, except cigarettes I managed to get in Cyprus. Are we developing markets where we can develop them? Are we really trying to build up our exports? The other day I said the exports to Britain last year were R320,000,000 and in my absence the Minister of Commerce and Industries said I was wrong. It is R311,000,000 and of that 40 per cent or 50 per cent is in danger, our wine, our butter and that kind of thing. Are we really trying to develop other markets, or do we only want to look around internally, as the Minister of Agriculture has said, to see whether we cannot build up a bigger market here.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from> 

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) (Mr. Moolman) is a person whom I have known for a long time. In his O.B. days he made good speeches, but I have never heard him speak as badly as he did to-night! He spoke for half an hour and in that time discussed almost every imaginable commodity, but in respect of no single product did the hon. member make a constructive suggestion. Let me give a few examples of that. He made a great fuss about lamb being exported to Rhodesia at a loss of approximately 8 cents per lb. He wants to know how long that will continue. Now I want to ask him whether he wants us to reduce the floor price of one lamb so that the price will be nearer to the export price? How else does he think a price can be maintained in the country? The <span class="col_7613-7614" refersTo="page_1053"/>hon. member must give us a reply now. He knows that under the Marketing Act the procedure followed is that there is a fixed price for internal consumption and that the surplus has to be disposed of in some way. That is why we have levy funds as a stabilizing factor. The hon. member has attained a doctor&#x2019;s degree, and one could therefore expect him to be acquainted with this basic standpoint adopted in the Marketing Act, and particularly in respect of the marketing of meat.</p>

</speech> 

<p>The hon. member said that the Minister asked him for advice as to what should be done in connection with our surplus maize. Well, the hon. member has been made use of for many things before, and often his advice was asked. Now he says that the surplus made should be used as dehydrated fodder, in the form of cubes. That is his learned advice, and I have not heard of it before. I take it those are the hexagonal cubes he referred to. In any case he says that we should dehydrate our surplus maize and compress it and then use it as fodder for stock. What assurance is there that this will not reduce our consumption of maize? What assurance is there that the maize at present used as fodder will not be replaced by this dehydrated maize, thereby reducing the ordinary internal consumption of maize?</p>

<p>The hon. member said in regard to our wool production that for many years it has fluctuated between 800,000 and 1 million bales. But the hon. member surely knows that in recent years we have been faced with the most serious droughts. Is the hon. member aware that this year we will produce the second highest weight of wool we have ever produced? Because we have come through the greatest drought this country has known we are going to have that great production, and the hon. member should surely know it. For many years he was the Chairman of the Wool Board. The hon. member further complained about the fact that the Minister had spoken for one and a half hours, but what about the hon. member himself? He spoke for half an hour and what he said in that time he should rather have tried to say in five minutes. It will be best to leave the hon. member at this stage so that he can have an opportunity of preparing himself better. I think the hon. member for Ventersdorp was correct when he said that the expectations his party had of him were too high!</p>

<p>I want to come to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher). That hon. member and other members of the United Party had many complaints and said that we did nothing to try to solve the problems with which the farmers are faced. The greatest of these problems, they said, was the problem of surpluses. If we ask them what solution they suggest, their reply invariably is:&#x201D;A change of Government &#x201C;That is the only solution they can think of.</p>

<p>Yes, it would perhaps have been a good solution if the farmers had not had previous experience of that party. Unfortunately the farmers have had experience of them and that is why every farmer on the opposite side, except for the hon. members for Albany and King William&#x2019;s Town, represent urban constituencies.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, we will include the hon. member for Drakensberg amongst the exceptions. All the rest represent urban constituencies. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) quoted from an article to the effect that the surpluses could no longer be handled and that the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing suggested that the farmers should produce less. Why does the hon. member not read what the recommendation of the Department really was? I shall do so. The hon. member does himself an injustice by making the sort of statement he did. The Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing says the following on page 1 of his annual report for the period 1 July 1960 to 30 June 1961&#x2013;</p>

</speech>

<block name="quote">The extent to which the local consumption of food will increase will, however, also depend largely on the country&#x2013;s development in the mining and industrial spheres. The prospects in this respect are fortunately promising and therefore justify a certain amount of optimism&#x2013;especially in view of the general policy &#x2026;</block><p>and that is the policy of the National Party&#x2013;</p>

<p>&#x2026; to increase still further the productivity and purchasing power of the Bantu. In this connection it should also be borne in mind that the natural increase in the total population of the Republic is slightly above 2 per cent per year. With a population of nearly 15,750,000, this means that somewhat more than 300,000 additional mouths have to be fed each year. South African agriculture, therefore, faces an exceptional situation. From a long-term point of view, the prospects of an expanding local market are favourable, provided that the economic growth of the country continues favourably, with an increase in standards of living, especially of the more representative strata of the population. During the past few years, however, agricultural production has continued to increase at a faster rate than local consumption.</p>

<p>That is precisely what happened. The Secretary reports further&#x2013;</p>

<block name="quote">This phenomenon did not represent any serious difficulties, whilst the surpluses could be exported fairly favourably.</block>

<p>The hon. member must also agree with this. Formerly, we could profitably export surpluses <span class="col_7615-7616" refersTo="page_1054"/>of any product, but now the world price for maize and various other products has fallen and it is no longer possible to do so. The hon. member surely knows that there are Commonwealth countries, and also other countries to which we exported, which are now faced with problems which no longer make it possible for them to offer a market for our surplus maize. The Secretary then goes on to say this&#x2013;</p>

<block name="quote">It would, however, appear as if the markets of Western Europe have reached such a stage in the disposal of grains, dairy products and eggs that we must expect increasing problems in the marketing of large quantities of these products without considerably decreasing the average price to the South African farmer.</block>

<p>And then he makes this recommendation&#x2013;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of this and the favourable local market for these and other related products, it would be wise not to encourage further expansion of production for a few years and to take steps to stimulate local consumption.</block>

<p>That is what is actually recommended, but the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) alleges that the recommendation is to stop production. Surely that is a gross misrepresentation of the facts! The hon. member knows that the market overseas is lower than the one we maintain in this country. That is the problem. Then we are landed with surpluses which we have to dispose of in some way. The hon. member and others on his side ask that prices should be increased and say that everything will then be fine again. As against that, it is he standpoint of the Department, of the Minister and of this party, that internal consumption should be stimulated. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West), however, wants to do it by increasing prices. Surely that would be one of the most foolish steps to take. The United Party are the people who say that they provide higher prices in order to give the producers larger profits. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I have been listening to-night for 1&#x00BC; hours to the hon. the Minister, and now again for ten minutes to the hon. member for Somerset East, but on the part of neither of them did I discern any hope for the farmers of South Africa. The hon. member for Somerset East quoted from the report of the Secretary of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department, but got no further than that. And what did the Minister have to say in his speech?

<p>I have not the reports of all the control boards with me. However, I have the report of the Mealie Control Board for the financial year ending April 1960, in which it is stated&#x2013;Representations were received from the South African Agricultural Union to consider the possibility of giving financial encouragement, by means of a special compensation, to those farmers who try to restore the fertility of their soil &#x2026; In view of the fact that the entrepreneur&#x2019; wage has remained unchanged at 9s. 2d. a bag since 1956-7, whilst the cost of living and land prices have risen in the meantime and the provision made for interest, tractors, etc., is insufficient, the Board felt that the time had arrived to increase the entrepreneur&#x2019; wage. Although the actual increase is appreciably higher, the Board recommended an increase of only 3d. in the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage, but the Minister, however, did not see his way open to accept this recommendation.</p>

</speech> 

<p>Note that the Minister did not see his way open to do it. The report continues to state that production costs in the Transvaal have risen to 23s. 7d. a bag, without even taking the price of the bag into consideration. If the price of the bag, i.e. 3s. 6d., is taken into consideration, it brings the production cost per bag up to 27s. 1d. Yet when these facts were submitted to the Minister, he decided not to increase the price of mealies, but to reduce it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister stated to-night that the farmers should adapt themselves to falling prices, then consumption will increase. Prices, he says, will fail. As an example, he took the dairy industry. But surely that is not so, and the Minister knows it. He knows that when the price of butter, for example, was reduced, more butter was produced. He also knows that during the first few weeks there was a small increase in the sales of butter, and that <span class="col_7617-7618" refersTo="page_1055"/>thereafter it fell back again to the former level.</p>

<p>Very well, I accept that. But then the Minister said that we on this side are telling sob-stories in regard to the position of the farmers to-day. A greater sob-story than the hon. Ministers&#x2019; speech I have never heard before. It gives the farmers no hope or prospects. I am just sorry that every farmer in South Africa could not have listened to his speech.</p>

</speech> 

<p>I have here the annual report of the Board of the Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa for 1961. This report contains something different from what the Minister professed in regard to the position of the farmers. The first paragraph of the report reads as follows&#x2013;</p>

<block name="quote">The past year was characterized by diverse problems in the agricultural industry. Not only did the farmers have to cope with droughts and floods in certain areas and with widespread hailstorms, but also with economic problems in agriculture itself and in the marketing of natural surpluses in an economic situation of falling prices and rising production costs.</block>

<p>Therefore, what is the use of the Minister always telling us what the position was in 1943? I find it interesting to note that in 1943 .857 per cent of loans was outstanding, whilst in 1959 this percentage was 1,620, in 1960 it was 1950 and in 1961 it was 3,397.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>That is how the percentage of outstanding loans has increased. But now the Minister tells us of the case of a certain farmer whose wife went overseas whilst during the year concerned he delivered mealies to the value of R22,000 to the co-operative. But it is in that year that he obtained a loan from the Farmers&#x2019; Relief Board.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>The farmers are given eighteen months in which to pay their interest and redemption. Does the hon. the Minister perhaps think that I do not know that? Of course the position of this farmer had to be investigated at the time the Farmers&#x2019; Relief Board gave him a loan.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from> 

<p>But such an investigation did take place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Then the Board should have been aware of the fact that he had been able to harvest such an enormous crop. The Minister may use that argument, but then we must take it that this particular farmer was not a good farmer and that his wife spent too much money. But are all the farmers bad farmers, because here we have the report of the Land Bank which shows that the percentage of outstanding loans is rising, and not only by 50 per cent but by 150 per cent, and that in a period of three years!</p>

</speech> 

<p>The Minister held out no hope for the farmers to-night, and also no plan. He spoke, inter alia, about improved production, that the farmer should apply more efficient methods. Let us accept that there are efficient and less efficient farmers in the country. The less efficient farmers must now push up their production and become just as efficient as the most efficient farmer in the country. He must do so because, as the Minister said, only the efficient farmer gets a reasonable return, because of his efficiency. What kind of an argument is that? It is true that greater efficiency will reduce the cost per unit, but on the other hand it results in over-production! The position then arises that the farmers who at first were not so well off now endanger, through their prosperity, the position of all the other farmers, because as a result of it prices will be reduced. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#keyter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KEYTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend replying to the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Drakensberg. I am told that when you argue with a lady the only reply you get is &#x201C;perhaps &#x201C;and that takes you no further than where you were. I want to come to the hon. member for East London (City). He has shown us that it is also possible for a doctor to talk nonsense at times and to be very stupid in some respects. He said, for example, that during the r&#x00E9;gime of the United Party there were shortages and that it was only under the r&#x00E9;gime of the Nationalist Party that we have had surpluses. Surely that is a wonderful recommendation for the Nationalist Party! <span class="col_7619-7620" refersTo="page_1056"/>But in spite of the fact that there were shortages during their r&#x00E9;gime, prices already started to drop. The hon. the Minister has already pointed out that there was a shortage of mealies in 1947 in the country and that the price rose from 19s. per bag to 22s. 6d. per bag. The farmers did not have mealies to sell at that time. The following year, however, when there was a sufficient supply of mealies in the country and when the farmers had the mealies to sell, the price was reduced to 21s. 3d. The overseas market was much higher than the local market. We are now faced with a drop in the overseas market whereas the local market has remained constant. We are, therefore, still selling mealies on the local market at the same price for which we sold it last year.</p>

</speech> 

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) also said that the mealie farmer is paying R15,000,000 into the stabilization fund this year. That is true. A stabilization fund has been established and the farmer&#x2019;s levy does perhaps amount to approximately R15,000,000. But let us consider the days when they produced 35,000,000 bags and received &#x00A3;1 12s. per bag. Their gross income was R112,000,000 at that time. At the moment they are producing 55,0, 000 bags at &#x00A3;1 8s. per bag and their gross income is R154,000,000. Subtract the R15,000,000 levy to the Stabilization Fund and you are left with a balance of R139,000,000 as against the R112,000,000 at &#x00A3;1 12s. per bag. The hon. member also asked why the mealies which were being exported at such a low price could not be made available to the stock farmers. To begin with the consumer of yellow mealies is subsidized to the extent of 5s. by the Government. He, therefore, pays 5s. less for his mealies. Over and above that the consumer receives a railway rebate of 37&#x00BD; per cent. The subsidy and the rebate together amount to approximately R13,000,000 per annum. As far as the mealies which are exported are concerned, the Government does not pay a rebate nor the 5s. subsidy. In order, therefore, to compare the price of the export mealies and the mealies consumed locally, the 50c subsidy and the rebate of 37&#x00BD; per cent should be deducted from the price of the former. At the moment yellow mealies are being sold at the coast at 340s. per bag. In other words, if the export mealies were subsidized to the same extent as the mealies which are consumed locally, no loss would have been suffered. Mealies which are exported, however, are not subsidized as members opposite would have us believe, but the mealies which are consumed locally are.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that we were exporting mealies cheaply so as to place overseas people in an advantageous position to compete with our own farmers. Let the hon. member calculate for himself at what price the mealies which we export are being sold overseas considering the price of 340c. per bag at the coast, plus the ship loading charges, plus the transportation costs and plus the profit which the overseas importer wants to make.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren)&#x2013;somebody whom I always thought knew the ins and outs of the matter &#x2019;said that we were exporting mealies while thousands of head of stock were dying in this country. On the other hand hon. members opposite complained and said that the price of mealies to the producer were too low, whereas the farmer who has to buy mealies and mealie products to feed his stock, complains that the prices are too high! How can you reconcile those two reactions, Sir? How can you increase the price to the producer and at the same time enable the stock farmer to pay a lower price?</p>

<p>I take it that the hon. member wishes the Government to subsidize the stock farmers in this respect. We are living in a world of declining prices for products, and we cannot remain isolated from world prices. Nor must we think that we can maintain an artificially high price for those products of which there is a surplus. The longer we try to do that the harder the farmer will ultimately be hit.</p>

<p>The Marketing Act is there to ensure orderly marketing of our products and to prevent prices from dropping as suddenly as they dropped in 1919/1920. At that time the price of mealies dropped from &#x00A3;1 7s. 6d. to 10s. per bag. That gives the farmer a great set-back and that is what the Marketing Act wants to prevent. When the production of a certain commodity reaches that stage, however, where a greater quantity has to be exported than is consumed locally, the overseas price plays a very important role as far as the price to the producer is concerned. The basic price to the mealie producer is 305c. Of that 25c. is deducted for the Stabilization Fund. The consumer also pays 121 per cent into the Stabilization Fund to assist export. The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Swart) said to-night that the Marketing Act had assisted the consumer in the past and that that Act should now show that it can also assist the producer.

<p>I am pleased that this debate has now come down to a more reasonable level. The bright side about the farming industry to-day is that it is producing surpluses and building up the fertility of the soil at the same time. The Minister is faced with the problem that agricultural production has increased to an extent where it has bypassed consumption. Because there is a surplus of agricultural products on the world markets, we are faced with the necessity of placing greater reliance on our own local market. If these are developed, any surpluses can be used to the benefit of our own people. I believe that the problem is quite a simple one. What is actually happening under this Government, however, is that we have surpluses of food but three quarters of the population are suffering from malnutrition! We have surpluses of maize and lucern but cattle and sheep are dying of starvation! There must be something wrong and it is, consequently, quite right that we should ask the Minister what he is doing about it. We, on this side of the House, think that as far as agricultural <span class="col_7621-7622" refersTo="page_1057"/>matters are concerned, this is a fair weather Government. It cannot weather the storms of adversity. The United Party rehabilitated every farmer in this country. It is all very well for the hon. member for Somerset East to laugh. He himself was a ruined man during the gold standard debacle. As a matter of fact, no farmer at that time could say that he was not a ruined man. The United Party, however, rehabilitated every farmer, i.e. the large and the small farmer, and brought about stability and prosperity at very little loss to our Treasury. And the farmers know that we will be called on again to rehabilitate them. The hon. Deputy-Minister of South West Africa Affairs said the farmers had only themselves to blame for their present state because, he said, many farmers to-day were not worthy to be farmers. It is clear that the Government does not realize what practical difficulties confront our farmers. The hon. member for Rustenburg had a lot to say about the amount of milk a calf drinks, but his real problem is a surplus of tobacco in his particular area! And yet he had nothing to say about&#x2019; that!</p>
