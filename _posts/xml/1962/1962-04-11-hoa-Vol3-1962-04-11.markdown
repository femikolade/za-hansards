<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask your ruling. I should like to discuss the behaviour of certain journalists in the Press gallery and the shocking way in which certain of them harm the safety of the country and its good name, and abuse their position in the gallery. Am I allowed to discuss it under this Vote?</p>

<p>Since we last debated a Budget in this House certain changes have been made in this Chamber. The portraits which hung on the wall have now been removed. I now want to ask whether an extra bench cannot be built above the gallery. I make this request because I find that certain of our newspapers and publications cannot be represented here as the result of a scarcity of seats. It is essential that all our newspapers should have representatives in this House. I am thinking, e.g., of <i>Landbouweekblad</i> and the <i>Farmer&#x2019;s Weekly</i> which can never publish agricultural debates because there are no seats available for them here. I want to ask whether we cannot provide more seating so that certain newspapers and publications may have their representatives here.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the halfhour? The ground that I would like to cover with the hon. the Prime Minister in the course of the discussion on his Vote may be conveniently divided into three groups of subjects. The first would concern South Africa&#x2019;s relations with countries and bodies outside of South Africa. The second would concern the particular aspects of the policy of separate development which are of a national character. I shall be careful, Sir, not to trespass on your ruling in respect of how far one can go in regard to the discussion of the ultimate independence of those areas which are to be separately developed. The third group of subjects deals with certain other matters of internal policy which are, in my opinion, of national importance.</p>

<p>In the field of external relations, the first group of subjects, I think there is one issue above all others which is exercising the minds of the people of South Africa and this is the problem of the mandated territory of South West Africa, a subject on which the Government has now for some considerable time&#x2014;and in my opinion far too long&#x2014;been frighteningly silent. It is a subject in respect of which I would suggest that Parliament and the nation have a right to be better informed. The background to this issue is well known to members. South West Africa was granted to the Union of South Africa as a C-mandate by the Associated Allied powers after the 1914-18 war to be administered as an integral part of South Africa. And it was accepted that administration was to be subject to the supervision of the old League of Nations. We all know that the old League of Nations has ceased to exist; that there have been cases before the International Court of Justice; that we have changed from the Union of South Africa to the Republic of South Africa, but the mandate is still with us and it has been made use of to launch a two-pronged offensive against South Africa, one in the legal sphere and the other in the political sphere. I do not want to say much about the offensive in the legal sphere because there is at present a case pending before the International Court of Justice in which certain of the issues which will concern whether or not that territory has been administered in accordance with the terms of the mandate. But I would point out that this case has been pending for some 18 months already; that the Government apparently have been extremely active behind the scenes, but so far there has been no clear statement in this House, either from the Prime Minister or the Minister of External Affairs, either as to the attitude of the Government or as to what the consequences will be in the event of our either being successful in that case or in the event of judgment being given against us. I have said before, and I want to repeat this afternoon, that in this case the Government is not acting for itself. It is acting for the people of South Africa, and the people of South Africa, like any client, who are involved and will have to pay the bill one way or the other, are entitled to know what is to be expected, what to hone for and what to be prepared for. What will happen if our defence is successful in this case? Will it put an end to much of the criticism that is being levelled against us at the United Nations Organization? Will it mean that judgment will be accepted by that Organization and put an end to much of the discussions concerning South West Africa? What will happen if we are not successful? How is a judgment of that kind implemented? What will be the consequence if we do not accept the judgment? I think these are matters which the people of South Africa are entitled to be forewarned about, to be told about, by the Government.</p>

<p>So much for the legal sphere. Now we come to the political sphere. Here the Government record seems to have been a miserable one of one diplomatic defeat being piled upon the other. It would seem that the Government believed that by disregarding the legal opinion of the International Court of Justice given in 1950, and its subsequent acceptance by the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization, it would be successful in preventing UNO exercising any supervision at all over its administration of South West Africa. In fact. Sir, what has happened? The United Nations Organization has exercised virtually exactly the same supervision over South West Africa as it would have done had we accepted that judgment originally. The effect of that original judgment was merely that administration was subject to discussion, subject to the force of public opinion, and really nothing more, and it is subjected to exactly that now. But by refusing to accept that judgment, it would seem that we have created a great deal of ill-will which we have not lived down and which has been with us ever since. Let me give another example. The Government apparently also believed that by declining to submit annual reports on its administration of the territory to the United Nations Organization, even as an act of grace, not accepting that it was legally bound to do so, it would succeed in preventing discussion of its administration of South West Africa, and particularly by the Afro-Asian bloc and the communist countries and certain South American states referred to from time to time by the Minister of External Affairs. What has been the result? The exact opposite has been the result. Through the South West African Committee reports have been before UNO on the administration of South West Africa&#x2014;comprehensive annual reports&#x2014;and these have led to a full public discussion, whether we have liked it or not, whether we have participated or not, in the very manner in which it was hoped that it would be avoided and by the very members who it was hoped would not be able to participate in discussions and criticism concerning <span class="col_3687-3688" refersTo="page_0470"/>this subject. The Government has refused to transmit petitions from inhabitants of South West Africa to UNO, but nevertheless that Organization has received petitions from inhabitants of the territory, almost as fully as it could have done had the Government been transmitting them itself; almost as fully as it could have been done had the Government transmitted those petitions in accordance with the advisory opinion given by the International Court of Justice on this very issue. Sir, when one looks at the position to-day it seems that the only real effect of the Government&#x2019;s action over the past 10 or 12 years has been that these reports and petitions have been debated; our administration of South West Africa has been debated without the Government being present to explain matters in regard to which there could have been doubts, to point out errors, and to show up unjustified complaints by petitioners. I believe there have been far too many unjustified complaints by petitioners. But what has been done by this Government to show up their inaccuracy and the error of their ways, except on a few rare occasions?</p>

<p>Are you being serious?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am very serious indeed. In fact I go so far as to say that as a result of the inaction of the Government on these issues, an image has been created of our administration of South West Africa which is probably far from accurate and which I believe bears very little relation to the truth, but an image which is reflected on us internationally and upon the opinion in which we are held by the important countries of the world, and the result has been that hostility directed towards us, because the image created in respect of South West Africa has spilled over and had an effect upon our relations with other countries in other spheres, quite apart from this issue. I know that there has been a measure of change of late. The Government has taken to the United Nations Organization an individual&#x2014;I believe now the hon. Under-Minister&#x2014;to be available to give information, I believe on the basis that he be not questioned. I believe that in effect we have gone so far that we have virtually accepted the opinion given by the Court in 1950, in many respects, but nevertheless on this issue we find ourselves to-day utterly isolated and with virtually no support whatever from any other country in the world except Portugal, and we find our position becoming more serious daily. I do not think that the position has been helped by the Government&#x2019;s stand that it was not prepared to discuss this issue on certain occasions because there was a case before the International Court of Justice and because the matter was in its opinion <i>sub judice</i> and therefore should not be discussed, because whatever the opinion of South Africa has been it is quite clear that the nations of the world do not accept that opinion. They do not regard the issue as being <i>sub judice</i> and the fact is that virtually unanimously they have continued to discuss the matter regardless of the fact that a case is pending at the International Court of Justice. In fact, despite the pretension that the matter is <i>sub judice,</i> yet another committee has been appointed, this time a committee of seven, with terms of reference more severe, more unacceptable, more unfavourable to us and more urgent than any previous committee&#x2014;and there have been a number of committees on this issue. It seems clear that UNO is more determined than ever to bring this matter to a head as soon as it can. And yet up to now, when May the 1st, a critical date in so far as this committee is concerned, is only a few weeks off, we have had no authoritative statement from the Government as to its attitude, nor have the people of South Africa been taken into its confidence, either as to its plans or what the consequences may be to the country. Sir, it is no good underestimating the seriousness of this matter; it is no good adopting an ostrich-like attitude and hon. members trying to bury their heads in the sand. This is one of the occasions where statesmanship is necessary, where perhaps a new approach is necessary. I hope that to-day we shall have a statement from the hon. the Prime Minister on this issue, and I hope that statement will be of such a kind that it will be possible for this matter to be approached in the future on a non-party basis. I hope it will be possible to forget about the blundering of the past and to take this matter out of the field of party politics in the interests of the future of South Africa. Sir, that is going to involve a somewhat different attitude on the part of certain members of the Government.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>And perhaps a different attitude on the part of members of the Opposition. I quite agree that they will have to be prepared to forgive and to forget. However, if we can get away from these petty interjections for a moment, I do hope sincerely that it will be possible on this issue to reach a stage where this matter is moved out of the sphere of party politics. Sir, we are not only isolated in respect of this issue at UNO; we are not only isolated on colour issues in respect of world opinion, but we seem at the moment to be entirely cut off from the rest of the Continent of Africa, outside of the Federation and perhaps Portugal, in a way which we have never been before. We on this side of the House remember a speech made by the hon. the Minister of External Affairs some five years ago at the University of Pretoria where he spoke on the role of South Africa on the Continent of Africa. I must say that we thought at that time that he had advanced a sound basis, that it would be the basis for Government policy. We approved of what he said and we said so at the time. Now, Sir, what has happened in the meantime? The hon. the Minister suggested that there were three important steps. Firstly, suspicion about our colour policy had to be removed. He <span class="col_3689-3690" refersTo="page_0471"/>showed that would be a gradual process. Secondly, African states would have to accept South Africa as an African state. Thirdly, the Union (now the Republic), as the most developed country in Africa, had a big contribution to make in the treatment of matters of common interest to all the other states of Africa. What has happened in so far as the Government is concerned in respect of those three steps? We are faced to-day with a Continent of Africa which is fermenting and with which we seem to be entirely out of touch. We do not seem to have any knowledge of the trends, political or economic, which are taking place in the rest of Africa; and the need to do something about it is intensified by the fact that now that we are out of the Commonwealth we have no means of ready information concerning those countries through diplomatic channels. In the past we were kept informed by London, as a member of the Commonwealth, as to the developments in those emergent countries of Africa, as we were kept informed of developments in other parts of the world. Now we are completely cut off. The trade side also is important. There are tens of millions of pounds being poured annually into those territories by way of equipment, by way of other capital goods, and the question is whether we should not be getting our share of those markets.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>We would like to know; perhaps the hon. member will tell us. As far as we know the Government has done nothing in respect of the steps outlined by the hon. the Minister. We are even out of the C.C.T.A., of which so much was made by Government apologists. If we want to be realistic, surely some attempt must be made to break this deadlock somehow. If the Prime Minister is right in the thesis that he advanced the other day that nations disapproving of our colour policy are nevertheless prepared to be friendly with us over other issues, then this should not be impossible. The first step quite obviously is that we have to get rid of prejudice, prejudice based on ignorance, and here probably personal contact is the only way in which a better image of South Africa can be created amongst those emergent Africa states.</p>

<p>Ones sees that the Federation is establishing diplomatic relations in certain of those other states of Africa, and one wonders whether the time has not come for us to consider establishing embassies at strategic points.</p>

<p>Are hon. members opposite suggesting that there is no state in Africa to-day in which an embassy from the Republic would be accepted? Is that what I must accept from them this afternoon, five years after the hon. the Minister of External Affairs outlined his policy? I want to pose the question whether the Prime Minister of Nigeria has not perhaps given us an opportunity to be considered. I would like to know whether the Government is considering his suggestion that he would visit South Africa if he were invited. So far as we can see nothing seems to be happening at all. Instead we are arming; we are building up our Defence Force. The Minister of Defence has told us of the danger of an Afro-Asian army of liberation. When he spoke to the B.E.S.L. on Monday it was a communist threat. The hon the Prime Minister has said that big talking may lead to big doing and should be discouraged. The Minister of Finance not so long ago told us that one of our biggest dangers was from a Commonwealth nation but we could not encourage him to tell us which one. We have heard that there has been a statement by Gen. de Guingand that he has knowledge of an Afro-Asian plan concerning South Africa. The Minister of Defence, in reply to a question, says that he has not been informed by the General as to what that plan is or as to which countries are involved. Is that the situation with which we are faced in Africa, instead of friendly relations, instead of steps being taken to advance common interests and trying to work together; or must we accept that as long as we have this Government in power we are going to be entirely isolated on the Continent of Africa?</p>

<p>I do not want to pose this question for Africa only. I want to pose the question in respect of the countries of the Far East as well. We recently had a trade mission going, at considerable expense, to the Far East to consider the question of markets there and the prospects of selling our goods. The hon. the Minister of Transport is sending a mission to Japan to study the working of their Railways; yet so far as I know our only representative amongst the Eastern countries is a trade commissioner at Singapore. I know we are doing quite a bit of trade with Japan, but I think the thing we should remember is that all these countries in the Far East are members of UNO; they are people who can vote for or against us when it comes to decisions which are taken in the General Assembly. What is our view; are we going to have diplomatic exchanges with certain of these countries? What is the position in respect of Japan?</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Is an attempt going to be made to have diplomatic exchanges with Japan? You see, Sir, the position is really a parallel to that on the Continent of Africa. We are out of touch, although perhaps not so <span class="col_3691-3692" refersTo="page_0472"/>much out of touch. We no longer get the information we did when we were members of the Commonwealth. We no longer have the courtesy of the diplomatic despatches which go through those other countries, and I think we are entitled to know from the hon. the Prime Minister how he visualizes our relationship with those people in the future. Cannot we break this deadlock? Is there nothing that can be done to find further markets, further friends, further support for South Africa? How do we stand with countries like India and Pakistan now that the Prime Minister has at least evolved a policy for the Indian, a matter which we will have to discuss with him again later on? Or is he satisfied that we should stay completely cut off from the rest of the world, completely cut off with no attempt whatever to improve the situation?</p>

<p>Sir, I have raised this issue in respect of UNO and with South West Africa, in respect of the rest of Africa and in respect of the countries of the Far East. But there is another issue on which the House is not informed, and that is to what extent there are negotiations taking place between the United Kingdom and the Republic as to our future relations. Since we have left the Commonwealth Great Britain has introduced legislation which is before Parliament and which I think has already passed its third reading. We would like to know whether negotiations are taking place between our Government and the British Government on this subject at the moment, and whether the Prime Minister can give us any report on these negotiations? We want to know whether they are covering the question of the Protectorates; whether in the future citizens of the Protectorates are going to be aliens in South Africa; whether we are going to be aliens in the Protectorates when we visit them; whether some hon. members opposite who own property in the Protectorates will be regarded as aliens in those territories?</p>

<p>At last I am getting positive response from the hon. member. I think we should like to know from the Prime Minister whether he feels that it is possible for the ambassador of the United Kingdom here to remain High Commissioner for the Territories. We also want to know what our relationship with the Federation is going to be now that we are out of the Commonwealth. Are they going to be aliens here and are we going to be aliens there? Are we negotiating? What is happening about South African interests in Swaziland? We have had exactly the same time as Great Britain to deal with this issue. What are we doing? We seem to be fiddling around while they have gone ahead and got legislation before Parliament, which has proceeded quite a long way. I would be very glad if the hon. the Prime Minister would give us some indication of what is taking place on those issues. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Normally I would have got up and resumed my seat immediately again in order to give the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to complete his speech, but I do not think it is in the best interests of the country to allow him to carry on the irresponsible way in which he started talking this afternoon. I have often heard him make irresponsible speeches before, but seldom has he been more irresponsible than he was to-day. He asks why we do not make friends with India and Pakistan. It is arrogance on his part to ask for something like that&#x2014;he and his party who do nothing else but revile this country to those nations, he and his party and his Press who do nothing else but sow suspicion against South Africa in the minds of those countries and of all the countries in the world, and then he still has the temerity to ask whether there is not some method by which we can break this deadlock, and make friends with those people. Yes, there is a very good method of doing it, and that is that he and his party and his Press, who have a much stronger voice abroad than we have, should reveal a little responsibility and patriotism. That would be a very good beginning.</p>

<p>Then in regard to the South West Africa problem, the Leader of the Opposition says; &#x201C;It is no good under-estimating the seriousness of the position.&#x201D; I quite agree with him, but if it is unwise to under-estimate the importance of this matter, why is he so irresponsible as to mention the matter in this House and to have it discussed in the way in which he did? And then he asks such nonsensical questions! He puts this question to the Prime Minister: If we win the case in the International Court, will you then accept it? How can the Prime Minister know that? Nobody can predict what UN will do to-morrow or the next day. How can the Prime Minister do so? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows that this is a very delicate matter. What good does he think can result from dragging a matter like this into a political debate? What will happen if a member like the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) starts talking about this matter, or members like the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) and Sea Point (Mr. J A. L. Basson)? One would require a thousand Eric Louws and Prime Ministers to remedy what they would destroy here in one afternoon. They are regarded as members of Parliament; it is not generally known that they are not taken seriously either in this House or in South Africa. If this matter is discussed here they will be the first to enter the debate. There is only one front-bencher on that side who is irresponsible enough to participate in a debate like this, and that is the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), and it appears to me that he wants to do so. No, I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is just being mischievous in regard to this matter; he should reveal a greater sense of responsibility. What is he doing now? He is playing the game of the so-called petitioners. He now wants to know from the hon. the Prime Minister why <span class="col_3693-3694" refersTo="page_0473"/>he did not, in terms of the judgment of the International Court, submit the petitions of these people to UN. The Leader of the Opposition knows that those petitioners who have taken action hitherto are nothing but a lot of agitators in South West Africa. He knows that the main petitioner has hitherto been the arch agitator, Michael Scott; that he is the per son who led those people. Why does he now want to make available to Michael Scott the channels of this Government? Because that is what he asked for! Why does he want to make available the channels of this Government to that other lot of agitators who fled from South West Africa and then made all kinds of false accusations against the South West African Administration and the Government of the Republic of South Africa at UN? I now challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He asks that the Government should have sent the petitions of those petitioners to UN! I now challenge the Leader of the Opposition to say where he or any responsible member of his party at any stage opposed those petitioners. When did he ever tell UN that they should not listen to the lies of Michael Scott and his associates? On not a single occasion has he done so. and on not a single occasion has he opposed those petitioners. The Oppositions plays along with those people. The Leader of the Opposition is regarded as a responsible man, but instead of telling UN, &#x201C;Do not listen to Michael Scott, because he knows nothing about South Africa and conditions here&#x201D;, instead of saying, &#x201C;Do not listen to those other petitioners because what they say is not true&#x201D;, the Leader of the Opposition acts here as the apologist for those petitioners. No, the channels of the Government must now be made available to them.</p>

<p>Then the Leader of the Opposition says that we are now isolated in two respects. We are isolated as the result of the policy of the present Government. I want to ask him whether we are in any way more isolated than Portugal is, Portugal which follows precisely the opposite policy from ours? I ask him whether we are any more isolated than Rhodesia is, which follows precisely the opposite policy from ours? In Rhodesia one does not find an Opposition which continually supports the enemies of the country and which acts as the apologist for the agitators against our country.</p>

<p>And then the Leader of the Opposition comes along with this further bit of irresponsibility in wanting the Prime Minister to make contact with the African States, and he blames the Prime Minister for the fact that there is not a better relationship between us and the African States. Is he not ashamed of himself? Why does he not blame Nkrumah for it, Nkrumah who boycotted us? Why does he not blame Nehru who, whilst we were willing to have his representatives in South Africa, recalled that representative and sent back our representative there? Why does he blame the Prime Minister for this? The Leader of the Opposition recently said at Florida that his chances of coming into power have never been better than they are now. Now I want to take him at his word for a moment, and I want to assume that he comes into power to-morrow, and then I want to challenge him. He asks that there should be better relations with the African States. When he gets up to speak again, if he still has the courage to continue further with the foolish statements he made here, let him then tell us, or let the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), that old prophet of doom, tell us &#x2026;</p>

But he now alleges that he has a chance to get into power, and I want to ask him to get up and to tell us whether he, if he gets into power, will immediately enter into diplomatic relations with Ghana, with Ethiopia, with Liberia and with Nigeria? He cannot accuse this Government of not entering into diplomatic relations with these countries which without exception and without any provocation on the side of South Africa and of this Government, broke off diplomatic relations with us. May I remind the Leader of the Opposition that there was a standing invitation to our Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Eric Louw, to visit Ghana, and that invitation was withdrawn in the most discourteous manner. Merely in order to hurt our Minister of External Affairs Dr. Nkrumah said he was cancelling the invitation. Has there ever been a word of condemnation in that regard by the Leader of the Opposition? No, we must crawl on our knees and tell Nkrumah: &#x201C;Please, may we send a deputation to your country?&#x201D; after our Minister of External Affairs was insulted in this way. That shows how irresponsible the Leader of the Opposition is. And then he says it is our policy which does us so much harm economically on the Continent of Africa. He says that we are losing business worth millions of rand. But who started the boycotts against us? The Leader of the Opposition should stop talking about economic matters. He knows much less about it than his younger brother. He says it was due to our economic policy. But what has the Lombard Bank now decided to do? To withdraw every penny it has invested on the Continent of Africa. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Prime Minister will agree with me that it is a bit early in this debate for comic relief to be introduced into it. I am sorry for the hon. the Prime Minister, because apparently the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) does not trust his Prime Minister to reply to the questions put to him by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition made a plea this afternoon that these matters which affect not only hon. members opposite, but every person in this House <span class="col_3695-3696" refersTo="page_0474"/>and every person in the country, should be discussed in a serious manner, and he expressed the hope that the particular issue of South West Africa if it was to be discussed, should be discussed on a non-party basis. The hon. member for Vereeniging does not seem to think much of the idea. But the key to my Leader&#x2019;s remarks was the isolation in which South Africa finds itself at the present time. The hon. the Prime Minister has sought to minimize that question of isolation, and I must say I do find it alarming to see such apparent complacency in regard to the situation in which we are placed at the present moment. The hon. the Prime Minister in minimizing the question of isolation, depended on two things. First of all he relies on our anticommunist views and our strategic position to secure our position in the event of a hot war. I think there is a good deal in that argument, but at the same time as an argument in respect of the broader questions, its value may have been exaggerated. In the second place he denies that we are isolated, except in the matter of race policies. He told us on a previous occasion during this Session that in respect of our colour policies in isolation lies our strength. I have thought over that phrase and I cannot see what he means by it.</p>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;in regard to our colour policy, our strength lies in isolation&#x201D;. I say that I cannot see the force of that argument. If we were geographically or even economically isolated, well away from the rest of the world, there might be something in the argument, but unfortunately we are not&#x2014;we are part of a very much integrated world today, a world that is becoming more integrated politically and economically every year that passes, and I say that I do not believe that isolation in any aspect of our national life, from influences throughout the rest of the world, can be anything but a source of weakness. But, Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister having pointed out that in respect of our colour policy there is possibly isolation, went on to say that in most spheres of our life &#x201C;we are popular partners and friends in the community of nations&#x201D;. One asks: If that is the case that we are popular partners and friends, why are we politically and economically barred from the rest of the Continent of Africa and from most of Asia? Why are we apparently in great danger of being barred from international sport, almost every aspect of it? Moreover, I think the hon. the Prime Minister will agree and will concede that this vexed question of South West Africa has been further complicated by the fact that we are isolated from the rest of the world. The hon. the Prime Minister argues that race policies can be kept quite separate from other spheres of life. Is that true? Does not the very fact that in every sphere of our national life, every aspect of our national life vis-&#x00E0;-vis the rest of the world to-day, this question of colour policy overlays and colours the whole of the attitude of the rest of the world towards us, gainsay that argument? The Prime Minister went on to say that apart from our different colour policies, on which we do differ, we are great friends, great friends with the United Kingdom and various other countries. He said that was just as true in the case of the United States. Well, let us take the United States. What does the United States say about us? In addressing the Community of Nations, to which presumably the Prime Minister referred as good partners and friends, only five or six months ago, the senior representative of the United States on the political committee at New York made a long statement on the subject of South Africa. I do not proposed to read it, but to quote one or two passages to give an idea of what the argument is. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All of the governments represented here to-day know that the United States has in the Security Council and in this Committee expressed its uncompromising opposition to the policy of racial discrimination summed up in the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;. What is not so well known is that the United States has in private diplomatic approaches to the Government of the Republic reinforced the depth and strength of the public views on apartheid by vigorous, private, unofficial representations that a change in policy is called for.</block>

<p>Whilst those discussions were private of course, nothing could be said about them, but now that public reference has been made to them, I think we are entitled to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether such approaches were in fact made, what were they, and what reply, if any, did our Government make to them? Speaking on behalf of the United States Government and people he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We rejoice in the bravery of the men and women of South Africa who, believing profoundly in the rights of men, fight on day by day for racial justice. My delegation is happy that one of the most distinguished sons of South Africa, Chief Albert John Luthuli, has just been awarded the Nobel Prize for his fight against apartheid, and all of us can profit by his wisdom, his vision and his moderation.</block>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I have been listening to the hon. member and particularly noted that when he was asked what his standpoint was he said, &#x201C;I am not expressing my views&#x201D;. That is the trouble with this Parliament. Everything wrong said about South Africa abroad is repeated to us by the Opposition, but we never get them to adopt a standpoint on any matter. This afternoon the hon. member and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made certain suggestions in regard to our relations to the outside world, but I think the very least we can expect from them is that they should give us a single example of what we should do which has not yet been done. To tell the truth, I think that if there is one party which is a danger to the diplomatic relations of South, it is the United Party. And, you know, Sir, they are becoming a danger to all of us in regard to our relations with Britain, because as we heard again yesterday, if the United Party nowadays wants to vilify the National Party, it compares us with Britain and says we are doing what Britain is doing in Kenya. That is now the swear-word hurled at the National Party. But in contrast with what the hon. member has said in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s isolation, I want to say this: We have been hearing this story about isolation since this Government came into power. Day after day we hear that South Africa is so isolated. Now I want to state as a fact that in regard to the diplomatic relations South Africa has never been in closer contact with the world than it is to-day. We are less isolated than ever before. The isolation to which the United Party refers is the standpoint adopted by other countries in regard to our colour policy. But in regard to all other relations, the relationship of South Africa <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> other countries is just as good and even better than it ever was before. Our relations with the outside world in respect of economic affairs, South Africa&#x2019;s trade with the outside world, has never been on such a high level before. Now hon. members will say that this is not the case in regard to the African states. But now I ask where any country has acted more responsibly in regard to any matter than South Africa has acted in regard to this matter? Boycotts are launched against South Africa at UNO, particularly by African states. What does South Africa do? As a responsible country, South Africa has not launched a boycott against any of those countries, nor will we do so. That is the difference between a responsible state and some of the young states which have now been established. South Africa has handled its foreign relations honourably, and in the past it earned high regard as the result. I have referred to economic affairs. Let us take another matter. In regard to our foreign relations, South Africa has given increased status to our representation in certain other countries by opening embassies. Let us pause for a moment to deal with the diplomatic history of South Africa since this Government ha been in power. The Nationalist Government has always earned the greatest praise and honour on every great occasion in our diplomatic history. In 1949 when the matter of India becoming a republic was discussed the late Dr. D. F. Malan played an honourable and great role on behalf of our Government. When negotiations were in progress in regard to Simonstown, South Africa handled the matter, as all hon. members must admit, in an honourable and responsible manner. Our relations to-day with the U.S.A. and Britain in respect of defence are on the highest and soundest level possible. There is absolute co-operation and we see it every day. Where does the hon. member get the idea that we are isolated?</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Not only are those hon. members isolated, but their party is becoming a fossil. But let us leave the matter there. Our relations with all the Western countries, including Britain, are excellent. Take, e.g., the handling by the hon. the Prime Minister of our withdrawal from the Commonwealth. Where in the world is there a nation and a Prime Minister which could have handled it more honourably than our Prime Minister did? After three days of consultations our Prime Minister did not walk out. He has told us that he went to the Prime Minister of Britain and said to him: Do you now see the matter as I do? I do not want to cause you embarrassment, and therefore I am withdrawing our application. Britain was not embarrassed.</p>

<p>Sneering references have been made to the Budget now before us. This Budget does not provide only for our internal safety. The <span class="col_3699-3700" refersTo="page_0476"/>Prime Minister has quite clearly said, and has informed the world, that if trouble arises with Communism, the world will know that South Africa by means of this Budget is preparing itself to play its part. Let us take our actions at UN. South Africa conducted herself honourably in the Korean episode. Coming to membership fees, if there is one country which can be relied upon, it is South Africa. When it came to paying for the Katanga episode, there were many countries which said they would pay but did not pay. What did South Africa do? She stood up like a man and honourably gave notice that she was considering the matter, and that perhaps she would not pay part of the expenses, and later on she said definitely that she would not contribute towards the costs. Let me mention another matter, our relations here in Africa. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the C.C.T.A., South Africa. South Africa contributed more than its share right up to the end. We have left it, not because we wanted to, but as the result of their actions. Now I put this simple question to the Leader of the Opposition. When he talks about diplomatic relations and returning to certain of these organizations, let him not give me five or ten or 20 examples, but let him tell me what his policy is, the advice he wants to give to the Prime Minister. With which countries must we have diplomatic relations? Mention just one. Must we do so with Ghana? Must we do so with Nigeria? The Leader of the Opposition referred to the rumours of a possible visit by the Prime Minister of Nigeria, Balewa. Is it his advice to the Prime Minister that we should extend an invitation to the Prime Minister of Nigeria to visit South Africa? Then the United Party would be adopting a standpoint.</p>

<p>I shall clearly state my standpoint. The hon. the Prime Minister will, on behalf of the Government, say what we will do, but just let me remind hon. members of the circumstances. We have no diplomatic relations with Nigeria, and secondly, it is to us an unheard of thing in the Western world for a man publicly to state that he would like to be invited to visit another country. In the third place, Nigeria is one of those countries which not only launched a boycott against South Africa at UN, but actually applies a boycott against us at present. Now I have the statements of the Prime Minister of Nigeria here, and I want to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether it would be unreasonable of us to say no, we cannot invite such a person. Commenting on reports that he was invited to visit the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and South Africa, Balewa said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any country in the world, including South Africa, decides to exchange ambassadors with Nigeria, we shall do so. That does not mean that we agree with their policy. My visit to such a place, if I am invited, will help to make the South African Government change its policy of apartheid.</block>

<p>Nigeria also said at UN that South Africa should adapt itself to changed circumstances or else find ships to emigrate elsewhere. Does the United Party want such a guest in South Africa? Let the Leader of the Opposition mention a single African State in regard to which his party will go out of its way to have diplomatic relations. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Just over two years ago, Mr. Casey, Australia&#x2019;s Minister of External Affairs, said in a speech on Australia and her neighbours&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Foreign policy is generated by conditions, some of which are social and traditional, others again military, and all are overshadowed by geography. In terms of geography, Australia is an Asian country. It follows that we have to develop policies which take full account of our desire to maintain friendly relations with our Asian neighbours. We can no longer take the passive attitude towards them that we took when their affairs were guided by our European allies.</block>

<p>I am sure, Mr. Chairman, that the hon. the Prime Minister agrees that statement could be made by him with the substitution of the word &#x201C;African&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;Asian&#x201D;. In other words, we have to develop policies which take full account of our desire to maintain friendly relations with our African neighbours, and as the hon. the Prime Minister is at present the supreme arbiter of our destinies it is his duty to tell the country what his policies are towards our African neighbouring states. The hon. the Prime Minister must surely admit that all avenues must be explored to bring the African States onto a reasonably friendly basis. If they are reasonably friendly with us, there can be no question of our being left in the lurch by the Western nations. Surely with so much at stake, everything must be done at least to temper their enmity towards us. These new states have many problems of their own, and they will take many, many years to settle down to the new way of life they are going to reach through much travail. They are united at present only in their hatred of us. The Prime Minister and I have different views as to the cause of this enmity, but we both know that it exists. The hon. the Prime Minister cannot sit back and wait for things to develop. That way lies eventual destruction for us all. We are spending R120,000,000 on Defence this year, apart from globular sums on the police. Will the hon. the Prime Minister, I wonder, please tell me later whether he does not think that every possible avenue should be explored therefore to brighten our relations with the <span class="col_3701-3702" refersTo="page_0477"/>new African States, because that would reduce the expenditure that is necessary at present? Practically nothing has been done to establish any kind of reasonable relationship with these states at all. In 1960 the Minister of External Affairs admitted that the only contact with the North at ministerial level had been that the Minister of Defence landed at Ghana for an hour or two and was shown around. He said further &#x201C;our relations with Ghana are good, our relations with all African States are good&#x201D;. There must have been a very quick deterioration! This is what he said too&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would point out that when I was in London I had a long talk with Dr.Nkrumah lasting almost two hours. It took place in the very best of spirits. Cordial relations were then established. I think Dr.Nkrumah understood our position in regard to a number of matters.</block>

<p>And that was the sum total of consultation at ministerial level at that date. There has been nothing since. We have given the states to the north of us considerable technical advice and help. A very great deal has been given by our Government Departments. Every day now this help is being spurned. They refuse it. Relations grow worse and worse and dangers grow greater and greater. We all know it.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the House what Australia is doing under similar geographical circumstances. To the date of Mr. Casey&#x2019;s speech they had contributed &#x00A3;30.7 million to the Colombo plan; 6,500 Asian students were at Australian universities; 830 Asian students were given Government scholarships to attend universities; there were 500 technical trainees which number was increased later to 1,000; 340 Australian advisers were seconded to Asian governments. And Australian and Asian Ministers were continually paying reciprocal visits to each other. Under this Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy few of these things can be done by South Africa. Even the thought in those days that we could not afford to provide money to help these new emerging states in Africa must have disappeared to-day in view of the enormous sums we have to find for our own defence.</p>

<p>I want to know and the country wants to know from the Prime Minister how he intends to tackle this question of our relations with the people to our north. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has failed completely, he has failed completely even to break the ice. He had to fail under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policies. He cannot offer scholarships to Africans; he cannot offer technical training to Africans; he cannot offer funds to help. We can offer technical advice but this is now refused by those states. Words only cannot bring friendship, Mr. Chairman. We have got to reduce the enmity of these people. I hope the Prime Minister will tell us what action he proposes to take in order to break down some of this enmity. High defence costs, loss of markets, loss of free movement, loss of all friends are too high a price to pay for the policy of this Government. If the Prime Minister feels that a storm is inevitable please let him tell us. We have faced storms before&#x2014;on this side anyway&#x2014;and if another storm comes we will face it again.</p>

<p>All the speeches of hon. members opposite have thus far had a single theme&#x2014;we must do something to gain the friendship of the African states! But not a single one of them could tell us what to do. Not one of them is prepared to tell us what we should do. They are the Opposition. Our policy is well known throughout Africa and the world. Our Government has stood on that policy for 13 years, and it has obtained increasing support from the people of South Africa. Hon. members opposite have hitherto not been able to formulate any policy, and it is no wonder that the people of South Africa are abandoning them increasingly.</p>

I think the Leader of the Opposition ought to devote his serious attention to this. He continually asked us: Let the Prime Minister get up and tell us what his plans are.

<p>But there are other matters. If the Opposition should land in the impossible position&#x2014;I am talking theoretically now because this is pure theory, and they know it as well as I do&#x2014;but if they should come into power tomorrow, what will they negative of the things this Government has done during the past 13 years? What will hon. members opposite negative? In the past you have opposed everything done by this Government; without your consent, without your co-operation, these things became the law of the land and the practice during the past 13 years, and gradually you supported and accepted every one of the things you opposed. Just think back. We had one general election after another; you opposed everything. Hardly had it become the law of the land when you got up and said you accepted it for the sake of South Africa. If you accepted it for the sake of South Africa, why did you not help us to make it the law of the land? Why create all that disunity and why have these continual quarrels if you are going to accept it in any case? Now I want to predict that you will also accept these things which you now oppose. The day they are put on the statute book, the day they become policy in South Africa, you accept them in the same way that you accepted all the other things in the past.</p>

<p>The question of South West Africa has always been a delicate one and a year ago when a formal charge was laid against the Government in the International Court in regard to its political management of the area, it became even more so. You can, therefore, quite understand the embarrassment in which the Government finds itself in respect of this question. Parliament would, however, be failing in its duty if for this reason it did not give its attention to this matter. Had it only been the legal offensive which Abyssinia and Liberia instituted at the International Court against the Government, it may perhaps have been just as well not to discuss it. But alongside that legal offensive is a much wider political offensive, a political offensive which is much more dangerous because it is accompanied by so many wild emotions. That is the political offensive which is being carried on at UNO against the Government and the Government&#x2019;s racial policy and in which South West Africa is really nothing more than simply a stick with which to beat the Government. This offensive, apart from the legal offensive, is being continued at the same pace and is increasing daily in vehemence and is becoming more systematic and Parliament must go into the question as to whether the Government&#x2019;s actions are such that the country may feel confident that its interests and the interests of South West Africa will be looked after successfully. Parliament at least always owes this duty to the country and it owes that duty to itself as a Parliament. As a matter of fact, I believe that the greater the crisis the more alert and active should it be, naturally always, we hope, Sir, retaining its own sense of responsibility. If the Government wish to be consistent, they will agree with me wholeheartedly. In the midst of the last war, a war which was of particular interest as far as the future of South West was concerned when the Government was in opposition, they conducted the most far-reaching discussion on the country&#x2019;s war policy. In one respect the then Opposition exceeded normal custom and regarded it as its duty to seek and to plead for a separate peace with a fighting enemy of South Africa. The country can rest assured: There is nobody, I believe, in the present Opposition who, as far as the question of South West is concerned, will allow any party political nationalism to undermine his broader patriotism to that extent. However, it is inherent in the spirit of the parliamentary system, a system which we ourselves have chosen, that national matters should be discussed in public in a candid manner. To give a well-known example, we found that in the midst of the Suez crisis the British Government showed its reactions voluntarily and immediately and what is more, vehemently as well and the question of the embarrassment of the Government of the day was never used to interfere with Parliament&#x2019;s rights of discussion or to try to limit them. That is why there should be a full-scale and proper debate regularly and in all circumstances in this Parliament on the question of South West Africa and the Government should be prepared to give an account of its stewardship as best it can.</p>

<p>I also think we should go further. In the <span class="col_3705-3706" refersTo="page_0479"/>difficult and abnormal circumstances which are descending upon us under this Government, a comprehensive parliamentary committee should be brought into being where plans and counterplans can be submitted and discussed more regularly between the Government and the Opposition. After all, South West is the concern not only of the Cabinet or of all six members who represent that territory in this House, but of the whole Parliament.</p>

<p>However, to return to the crux of the matter. I think, Mr. Chairman, that the time has arrived that the country was told clearly that there is every reason to feel worried about the ability of this Government to deal successfully with the problem of South Africa. The Government has had its party political successes in the country. Nobody can quarrel about that. Its main weapon to attain those successes was small apartheid and the various emotions which that so easily stirs up and all the unreasonableness which follow upon that. Internally that has yielded the necessary fruits to the Government party, but externally the country has had to pay a colossal price, namely the total expulsion of South Africa from the friendship of the nations. Every friend we had turned into a public opponent. Every opponent we had turned into an inspired enemy. As recently as last year the <i>Burger</i> of 30 November 1961 still tried to teach the Government by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We should differentiate between the various degrees of enmity and sympathy which exist at UNO, and then try not to push semi-friends and indifferent enemies down the scale in the direction of extreme animosity.</block>

<p>The advice which the <i>Burger</i> gave was ignored. After that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs returned from UNO and reported and disclosed the final failure of the Government and the absolute impotence of our diplomacy. He said the following to the Press&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The people of South Africa should not be under any illusion. The forces which are building up against South Africa are becoming greater and stronger &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not smaller and weaker, but greater and stronger&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are signs that with the passage of time it can assume vast proportions.</block>

<p>(The <i>Burger, 4</i> November 1961.) What a message of collapse, what a message of despair and of lack of planning on the part of the Government! The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s wife returned before he did and reported to the Press as follows&#x2014;the <i>Burger,</i> 2 December 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Delegates from countries which were not well disposed towards South Africa, did not want to be seen in the lobbies with the South Africans. Whereas previously there used to be a measure of friendliness at functions, Minister and Mrs. Louw did not attend many of them this year because the unfriendliness was too tangible.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what a terrible position for a Government, for his delegates and for a country, to be in! Even the diplomatic channels, the ordinary channels of friendship, are no longer open to our Government. Mr. Chairman, a country&#x2019;s diplomatic front is its first line of defence. Its military front is its last line of defence. The fact that we are practically daily being called upon by the Govern-to hold ourselves in readiness to go into the trenches stands in direct relationship with the total collapse of its diplomatic front. The Government finds itself in this unfortunate dilemma: In the outside world its position in doomed because the evil lies in this country, and here the Government cannot do what is the most difficult of all tasks to any Government, that is to put right those far-reaching mistakes before the eyes of its own people, which it has made in respect of human relations. In such circumstances no other road remains open to Opposition members than to put the facts before the people and to state its own alternative policy.</p>

<p>In the first place we should not continue to make the mistake of regarding all criticism from outside as malevolent. There are malevolent attacks. There is evil and unfounded criticism but it is not difficult to recognize those. I am convinced that the responsible Western nations do not base their conceptions on these grounds. They at least have their own competent representatives and observers here in South Africa. There is also well-intentioned criticism which is justified and which rests on sound foundations and we can only gain if we take a little more notice of that kind of criticism and put our own house in order as so many of the Government&#x2019;s own newspapers have already asked it to do. Not for the sake of other people, but for our own sake.</p>

<p>Had the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) still represented a constituency in South West Africa it might have been worth while paying some attention to what he has to say. But had South West Africa treated me the way they treated that hon. member&#x2014;treatment which he deserved&#x2014;I would not have let the name of South West Africa pass my lips again. The last occasion on which the hon. member spoke in this House I asked him what interest he still had in South West Africa but I am even more justified to-day in asking him that question. I think it would be more fitting for him to confine himself to his interests in Bezuidenhout than to drag South West Africa into the debate in this House.</p>

They realized that other ways would have to be found.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the object of Parliament&#x2014;and if the hon. member as a young member does not know it he should rather remain quiet&#x2014;and the responsibility of Parliament is that when you are dealing with contentious and delicate matters you do not discuss them across the floor of the House, but that there are other ways in which they can be discussed. I merely wish to say this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and to everybody opposite, members whom I regard as responsible and who indeed have the interests of South West Africa at heart: Do not let us drag this question into the public or across the floor of the House; let us discuss it in a fitting manner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>To continue with what I was saying earlier on: We must first of all put our own house in order in respect of those things which affect ordinary human relationships. We have those humiliating practices which unnecessarily affect and insult the dignity of people. However, you do get the impression on occasions that the Government is beginning to realize the damage which all these small unnecessary apartheid measures have done to our country&#x2014;all those demonstrative and provocative small apartheid measures which were introduced during the first wild days of apartheid. I wish to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he does not think the time has arrived for us to remove these unnecessary burdens from our political economy. He need not answer publicly. He can simply do it. I wish to ask him, if he refuses to do so in the four provinces, not to delay doing it as speedily as possible in South West Africa. The fortunate part is that the Government has not as yet gone too far with the introduction of its negative apartheid measures in South West Africa. I am saying that in its favour. Such a morally indefensible measure as job reservation, and other measures with nasty stings in them such as for example the Group Areas Act and race classification, the Government has fortunately consistently kept out of South West Africa. There are members, however, such as the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) and my successor at Namib (Mr. Cloete) who did their utmost to have those measures introduced in South West Africa. But very propertly the Government&#x2014; and I wish to thank the Government for this&#x2014; has prevented that. The Government has stopped some of its own members in their activities. I wish to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that it will considerably strengthen the future of South West Africa if the Government acted speedily and put an end to those humiliating forms of small apartheid which are practised in public buildings of the country.</p>

<p>In the second I think it is essential that in respect of our general overseas problems and that of South West in particular, we adopted a less tense approach. Perhaps the expression &#x201C;a more relaxed approach&#x201D; is more fitting. Mr. Chairman, the Government is making a very big mistake to be always bad tempered and to respond irritably to anybody who looks askance at it. That has no positive value. If others with to do so, good and well, but it does not promote the dignity of South Africa. Least of all does it create an impression of selfconfidence. Whether our hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs will be best able to adopt such a relaxed approach, he will be best able to say. I wish to state that the Minister in question has admirable qualities, but it worries me to read about the unnecessary personal attacks which he sometimes makes on prominent representatives of other countries. He said the following straight out in a newspaper interview about the Netherlands delegation at UNO: &#x201C;I do not take any notice of them and treat them coolly.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The <i>Sondagblad</i> of 29 October 1961. That is the newspaper of the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The Minister said that during an <span class="col_3709-3710" refersTo="page_0481"/>interview which he gave to Mr. Beaumont Schoeman. The hon. the Minister said: &#x201C;I do not take any notice of them and treat them coolly.&#x201D; I always think it is a pity when a foreign representative takes the political struggle too much to heart. We deprecate it in others if they do it towards us and I do not think we should adopt the same attitude towards others. The people overseas are after all not against the South African nation. They are against a political system and what we should not forget is that nearly 50 per cent of our own Whites are equally strongly against the Government&#x2019;s compulsory apartheid policy as a system. One naturally appreciates, Sir, that any foreign representative sometimes finds himself in the position where personal feelings come into play. That is the reason why leading Western countries follow the policy of changing their Ministers from time to time, their Ministers who are charged with the difficult task of foreign affairs or with matters dealing with colonies. We do not have the same flexibility in our Cabinet system and for that reason our Minister, whoever he may be, should try his utmost not to allow his political struggle to develop into a legion of bad friends at the diplomatic front.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has a tremendous responsibility towards South West Africa. South West Africa is nearest the fire, and not as a result of her own actions. The nation is dispersed in such a way and general circumstances are such that it should really not be so difficult to find a solution to the problem, a solution which will at least satisfy the West. As far as the legal aspect is concerned, we have the strong advisory opinion of the International Court of 1950 to the effect that South Africa is under no legal obligation to hand the Territory over to the guardianship of the UNO. I believe we can create a less tense atmosphere on either side; if we adopted a more relaxed approach in our general attitude towards foreign affairs it should not be impossible to solve this difficult problem of South West Africa. I wonder whether we in South Africa should not set the example and take off our hats and sincerely thank our ambassadors who have hitherto been putting up such a brave fight and nominate a fresh, selected team, a team which is not committed to the old standpoints of the past, a team which is free from the old disputes which have characterized the scene so far and who will then be able to approach the matter afresh and evolve and submit fresh solutions to our problems. And Heaven knows, Mr. Chairman, South West urgently requires that an end be put to the quarrels and that finality be reached as to its future.</p>

That was the time when the hon. member objected to one Bill and when he came on to the head committee he objected to all of them and I was the person who asked him why he had voted for all the other small apartheid measures. There are more people in this House who were present at that meeting of the Head Committee. He first of all voted for all the small apartheid measures and then he looked for trouble with the hon. the Prime Minister because the English-language Press had built him up in South Africa as a big giant and now he is sitting there as the small dwarf from Bezuidenhout. He voted for all those laws, but to-day he is talking against them. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is the person who accompanied me on all the platforms throughout South West. He is the person who agreed with me personally that it would be in the interest of South West if the Government&#x2014; any government, the United Party or the National Party Government&#x2014;would make the fullest use of its rights under the mandate. He was the hon. member who pleaded with me that our fiscal system should also be incorporated <span class="col_3711-3712" refersTo="page_0482"/>with the Union, but to-day, in an open discussion, he talks about the affairs of South West. What responsibility has the hon. member towards South West after they have dropped him like a hot potato? What responsibility has he ever had towards South West?

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister in his reply to take the matter of the defence expansion of the country somewhat further than he took it in his speech to the House about a week ago. I want to ask him to clarify the confusion which is being caused by the very widely conflicting statements which are being made with regard to the reasons for this expansion, particularly with regard to the threat of external aggression. Apparently, from the information we have, both from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, our defences are being expanded to deal mainly with external aggression in some shape or form. I want to have no misunderstanding in regard to the position of the official Opposition in regard to our defence. That was made perfectly clear in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition on 28 March, and that position stands. So there can be no misunderstanding in regard to our position. But I feel that the Prime Minister owes it to the country to give a much clearer statement. In his speech on 29 March the Prime Minister said in regard to the three points on which external danger could threaten us, three points which were raised by the Leader of the Opposition, that he agreed with the Leader of the Opposition that there were three directions from which danger threatened. We then dealt with these three at considerable length, the first being in the event of an anti-communist <span class="col_3713-3714" refersTo="page_0483"/>struggle, probably a world war in which we became involved and in which South Africa would be on the side of the Western powers. After giving a number of reasons and going into the matter in fairly full detail, the Prime Minister said that it was his personal opinion that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think that in the immediate future we will be faced with that type of war. I believe that sufficient is happening in the world to lessen the chances of that happening.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I merely want to give the Prime Minister the background to the questions I am now asking him, because the line taken by the Prime Minister in dealing with the defence of the country was that this depended on three factors and those three factors are vital in regard to the questions I wish to ask. Other than that, I do not propose to deal with it. The second danger the Prime Minister dealt with was an unprovoked aggression by other states who wished to impose their will on South Africa and who were supported financially and otherwise by the communist states. The Prime Minister dealt with that aspect very fully and said it would be irresponsible on our part not to take notice of what was happening in that direction, and he said &#x201C;that at the same time I would not like our public to be driven into a panic in this way and to begin thinking that such attacks are on our doorstep&#x201D;. The Prime Minister went on to say clearly that the preparations proved that we were on our guard, but it was not proof that any immediate emergency could be seen coming. The third statement was the one with regard to international intervention in the affairs of South Africa. Here the Prime Minister said that he did not believe that there was any possibility of international military intervention. The Prime Minister then clearly stated that whilst there was threatening talk he did not accept that there was any danger of any early aggression or military intervention in the affairs of South Africa. This is just a short summary of the salient points in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s remarks, and I assume that in making those statements the Prime Minister based his views on up-to-date official information available to him and to the Government, and not available to the public or to Parliament. It is only 11 days ago since those statements were made to the House, but on 9 April, addressing the Congress of the Commonwealth Legion of Ex-Servicemen in Muizenberg, the Minister of Defence, whom one assumes has access to the same information as the Prime Minister, made a most important speech and announced not only that the Republic was being placed on what was practically a war footing, but by direct implication, to a great extent contradicted the more optimistic views expressed by the Prime Minister on 29 March. On that occasion the Minister of Defence also largely changed the reasons for which South Africa is re-arming from those that he gave in his Army of Liberation speech in the Other Place a few weeks earlier. You will remember, Sir, that the Minister of Defence has given several of these speeches, the &#x201C;blood up to the horses&#x2019; bits&#x201D;, the &#x201C;army of liberation&#x201D;, and now the &#x201C;holy war&#x201D; speeches, and in each of those he changed to a considerable extent the grounds on which defence preparations are being made. In the war of liberation speech he said we were expanding our defence organization to meet the threat of aggression by an army of liberation close outside our borders, the threat which the Prime Minister said that although we must be on our guard against it he did not want the public to begin thinking such attacks were actually on our doorstep. Giving Congress his reasons for the expansion of the armed forces, the Minister of Defence, after summing up the communist policy of infiltration and the cold war, said according to the <i>Cape Argus</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But this is not the reason why the Army is being expanded and its equipment modernized. There remains the threat of aggression by forces of countries which are the tools of Communism and it is my duty to ensure the security of our country against these ruthless rapists of democracy.</block>

<p>I think everyone can support the idea behind the Minister&#x2019;s thought, but there again, he is at cross-purposes with the statement made by the Prime Minister in which the latter emphasized that he would not like the public to be driven into a panic and to begin to think that such attacks were on our doorstep. In his speech at Muizenberg the Minister of Defence made the statement that after four years, in 1966, South Africa would have 33 battalions, including 28 A.C.F. battalions and five full-time Permanent Force battalions, which would be kept at full operational strength, in addition to a much expanded Navy and Air Force. Dependent on the numbers on which the Minister based his battalion strength, because they vary considerably in accordance with the type of warfare envisaged, the Minister&#x2019;s figures reveal that the Republic will have an army of anything between 20,000 and 30,000 fully equipped men maintained at full operational strength. It is normally accepted that to maintain an army in the field at least 12 persons&#x2014;14 is the usual figure given&#x2014;have to be behind the army in order to maintain each man in the field. Taking only half this number, not 12 but six, it means that if the Minister&#x2019;s figures are correct and we will have 33 battalions at full operational strength, the supporting strength inside the Republic will be anything between 120,000 and 180,000 persons who will have to be diverted from their normal occupations in the economy of the country and diverted into <span class="col_3715-3716" refersTo="page_0484"/>some form of maintaining defence. It must be clear to anyone that to justify those figures &#x2014;and they are really startling figures in peacetime, that in this virtually placing South Africa on a war-time footing both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence must be acting on information regarding the possible dangers to South Africa which is much different from what they dealt with when they made their previous speeches in this House, because there was nothing in those speeches to justify this provision. In view of the grim picture painted by the Minister at Muizenberg, I feel it is essential that the Prime Minister in reply should give us more information on any danger threatening us which calls for this far-reaching expansion. There is the effect of this expansion not only on the security of the nation but on the national economy of the country, the diversion of so many men both to the armed forces and to the supporting services. Every man has to be fully equipped and armed and they have to be maintained in that condition, and although a large number of the men in the A.C.F. will, I assume, be following their normal occupations in the periods between their training periods, they will still be on call all the time, will have to be kept equipped, and kept in training to a much larger extent than hitherto, so there must be a tremendous amount of dislocation in the ordinary life of the country. One accepts that you cannot be prepared to resist an attack and you cannot have an army ready to resist it without having some dislocation in the normal running of the country. But from the figures announced at Muizenberg, figures incidentally which the House has been trying to get from the Minister and his predecessor for a number of years without success, both in regard to the numbers to be under arms and the equipment supplied&#x2014;it is startling to realize that in time of peace, even with the best intentions and with the utmost desire to support the Minister and his Government in the protection of this country, they are figures which cannot be described as anything else but startling as a peace-time defence force.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to make an appeal to the Opposition. It is no good our closing our eyes to the facts which are looming on the international horizon for South Africa to-day. The Opposition have a very important role to fulfil in this House. We do not begrudge them the opportunity of criticizing the Government, but when it comes to a debate on the external policy of the Government, I think all we can do, as a result of the measure of responsibility which we think the Opposition has, is to make an appeal to them to face up to the facts with which South Africa is confronted to-day.</p>

<p>They blame the policy of this Government. They wish to place the responsibility for the emnity which exists in the world to-day, on the policy of the National Government. It suits the Opposition to forget something which we have repeated time and again, namely that even when the United Nations were differently constituted in 1946 the policy of that party could not satisfy UNO and it could not satisfy the Asiatic nations&#x2014;at that time there was not as yet a bloc of Afro-Asian nations. To-day the Afro-Asian bloc has developed to such an extent at UNO that even Britain did not have sole say in the recent debate on Rhodesia. If they could not satisfy UNO in 1946 what right have they to-day, where we are conducting a serious debate and discussing serious threats to South Africa, to ignore those facts and to lose sight of them? I make bold to say that there is no party in the country, neither the Opposition nor the Progressive Party, which has a policy which will satisfy UNO and the Afro-Asian nations. Where we must face up to our problems and find solutions for them, why must the Opposition adopt this one-sided attitude which they have adopted to-day? We will never find solutions if we adopt this attitude, and let us be very clear on that. That party, as well as the Progressive Party and this party, every South African, is subject to the same criticism and same condemnation on the part of the world outside, we are all faced with the same challenges and the same enmity. There is not a party here who can contend that his policy offers a solution. That is why I say we cannot learn a better lesson than the one we learnt last week in the case of Rhodesia. I have no axe to grind with the British Government. On the contrary, I wish the British Government could achieve more success with its policy in Rhodesia than it is achieving at the moment, but in spite of all the concessions which are being made they are still having trouble. The Opposition wish us to make concessions, but they know as well as we do that one concession will lead to another and having paid one instalment we will also have to pay the second and the third until the final payment has been made and that is absolute equality. That party is not prepared to do that, neither are the Progressives; why must we argue on this basis?</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). For years, through the hon. member for Simonstown, the Opposition has been pleading with us to expand our defence force. At the beginning of the 1950s we were preparing ourselves for another eventuality. We were then preparing ourselves to bring a task force into being, a force which would fight on the side of the West in the case of a war between the East and the West. At that time the Opposition was anxious for us to expand our forces and to spend more money. Must we take it to-day, Sir, that because the position has changed in the world and because we are preparing ourselves for another eventuality, they are no longer as anxious as they were that we should embark upon that expansion and spend that money? We are told that we are to-day more isolated than ever before, but let me state this fact. If we were to fight on the side of <span class="col_3717-3718" refersTo="page_0485"/>the West in any war, South Africa will not be isolated; in that case South Africa will be standing on the side of the West and whether we are inside or outside the Commonwealth, the West will welcome us as before. In other words, the fact that we have withdrawn from the Commonwealth has not made us more isolated in this respect. If we had to face a possible threat by an African State, a local war between one or other state in Africa and South Africa, I do not believe that had we remained a member of the Commonwealth Britain or any other country would have acted on our behalf. Britain would not have been willing to run the risk of inviting the odium of the non-Whites in Africa on to her head for the sake of South Africa, because they are courting the friendship of the non-Whites in Africa. Whether we are inside or outside the Commonwealth, we are also no more isolated in this respect. Hon. members plead that we should try to enter into alliances. I merely want to know this from them: Will any country in the world not be more prepared to enter into an agreement with a strong nation than to enter into an agreement with a weak nation which cannot defend itself and which will only be a burden on its shoulders? When a nation is strong and capable of defending itself, that is the nation which seeks other nations with whom to enter into agreements. If we have to look for agreements and defence alliances, that is the very reason why we should strengthen ourselves in order to be able to do so. There is no doubt about it, as the hon. the Minister of Finance has said, we are expanding our defence force to serve as an insurance policy. The West is to-day spending greater and greater sums of money; even this year America has placed a larger defence vote on her Statute Book; Britain is in the process of placing a larger defence vote on her Statute Book, Rhodesia is doing the same thing. Why? Because each one wishes to have a deterrent to aggression. And where we are also trying to-day to expand South Africa&#x2019;s defence force as a deterrent to aggression, we are pleased to note that in some respects the Opposition is supporting us. They supported us when we passed the legislation last year but now that the law is being applied, now that we are training 10,000 men per annum, they want to know from us what aggression is on our threshold. When we passed that legislation last year the Opposition supported us. That is why I want to make this plea to the Opposition this afternoon. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite prepared to continue further in Afrikaans. After the hon. members for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) and Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) have had to put up a smoke screen to evade the difficult but nevertheless absolutely reasonable questions put by this side of the House, we have had a constructive contribution by the hon. member who has just sat down. I want to devote a little more time to it than I perhaps should. In the first place I wish to say at once that, were he has asked us to face up to the facts, we have indeed asked what the Government&#x2019;s plans were in respect of the future of South West Africa and in respect of our own relationship with Africa. Those are the very facts which we are asking the Government to bear in mind; and then we are asked what our replies are to those questions. I wish to suggest immediately that not one of the hon. members who has spoken so far really had a great deal to say under this Vote. I wish to say that we on this side of the House have been at the helm during many difficult times in South Africa. We had the answers at that time. And when we handed over to hon. members opposite, our name was held in as high esteem as at any time in the history of South Africa.</p>

<p>I also wish to reply briefly to the point raised in regard to Rhodesia because that has often been raised by hon. members opposite. There is a vast difference between our position and that of Rhodesia. In their case the British Government is in a position to force a constitution on to the two northern states of the Federation and that is the very thing which is causing the difficulty there because the Government of Southern Rhodesia have said that they were not prepared to remain within the Federation if the two northern states were to fall into the hands of the Black man. That is exactly the difficulty. In respect of their position at UNO they are in a much stronger position than we are. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) said in his reply to the hon. the Prime Minister that when a vote was taken at UNO the voting was approximately 56 against 22 and I fervently wish that had been the position in the case of South Africa.</p>

<p>I may be able during the course of my speech to say a few words in connection with the Commonwealth, because that is the part of my speech which I should like to make. Where my hon. Leader and other members on this side have asked questions in regard to the future I should like to devote some time to a certain policy of the Government for which <span class="col_3719-3720" refersTo="page_0486"/>we have paid very dearly. I refer to the policy of the Government to withdraw from the Commonwealth. It is exactly a year ago that step was taken and I think that the results of that step have been much more serious than we on this side warned. I want to say at once that it is no use crying over spilt milk; we definitely wish to do our utmost to save what we can save and to do what we can do. I suggest that a great deal remains to be done, especially if we can have a change of government, but I think it is important that the electorate should know for what they have paid so dearly and who is really responsible for it.</p>

<p>Let me just deal briefly with our economic position. Immediately after our withdrawal from the Commonwealth there was a flight of capital from the country, a fact which we regretted but it resulted in the fact that shortly afterwards we had to place a prohibition on the export of foreign capital, a step which no Government in the history of South Africa ever had to resort to in the past.</p>

<p>And the share market rose immediately.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>We are a strong country in the economic sphere and in other respects. Never before has it been necessary to take this step and it is still necessary to-day to retain this prohibition. I was pleased that the hon. the Minister of Finance was able to announce that our reserves had risen, but where he suggested that proved how good they were, we wish to remind him immediately of the fact that this prohibition is still in force, and no reasonable comparison can therefore be drawn. It is difficult to say what effects this prohibition has had on our economic life. I definitely think that it has led to unemployment, something which we should not have had. Nor was the Government in a position to increase wages whereas they should have done so. I suggest that the tragedy of South Africa is that we do not know what we have missed as far as progress and prosperity are concerned as a result of the Government we have.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with the international front, seeing that the hon. member who has just sat down spoke about our withdrawal from the Commonwealth. As far as the international position is concerned, we think that we are in a much weaker position to-day than we were in the past. It is very possible that this question of action against South Africa may sooner or later come up before the Security Council.</p>

<p>What was our position in 1946?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Nobody can convince me that countries like Britain, Britain especially, will adopt the same friendly attitude towards us there which she would have adopted had we remained a member of that family circle. I admit that the attitude which countries are adopting towards us is a marginal question. Where the hon. member has referred to 1946 I wish to say that the voting against us at UNO at that time was not at all what it is to-day.</p>

<p>I also wish to add that it is very important to note that now that we have withdrawn from the Commonwealth our expenditure on defence has soared sky-high. Why? Hon. members opposite could not mention any new dangers which they could not have foreseen earlier. They did not mention any new dangers. In other words, they must have realized that we were in a much weaker position to-day in respect of the old dangers than we were previously, and that can quite easily be due to the fact that we have withdrawn from the Commonwealth. I just want to say this that where we talk about other shortcomings as far as defence is concerned, the hon. the Minister of Defence said the following a short while ago in the Senate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our departure from the Commonwealth has cut off one of our major sources of information about defence research.</block>

<p>We can mention one thing after another in respect of which we have been adversely affected as a result of our withdrawal from the Commonwealth. The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs mentioned some of the disadvantages when he made his statement in February of this year. The same conclusion can also be drawn from the fact that recently it was stated in the British House of Commons that there were 40 Acts under which we formerly enjoyed benefits, benefits which we will no longer enjoy. I refer to our citizens, etc. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) tried to launch an attack on three or four fronts. Let me first make a remark in regard to Defence. It is quite clear that the Opposition is only now recovering from the shock they received when the hon. the Minister of Finance made his Budget speech, because the main point in that Budget was that we were spending R120,000,000 on Defence and only had to find R35,000,000 by way of extra taxation. That was a shock which the hon. member suffered, and now he makes this speech here which he should really have made some days ago during the Budget debate. He is a little behindhand. I want to suggest to him that he should discuss the matter again under the Defence Vote, where it belongs.</p>

<p>Then it surprises me that the hon. member blames the hon. the Prime Minister and this side of the House for the fact that we have left the Commonwealth. We ourselves left the Commonwealth and he should not say to-day that by doing so we did something we should not have done. I just want to quote to him what the Prime Minister of Australia said. Mr. Menzies <span class="col_3721-3722" refersTo="page_0487"/>said that if he had been in the position of our Prime Minister, he would have done precisely the same thing. But that is what we have from the Opposition. Whenever there is an opportunity to be unpatriotic, they are the first to make use of it. That is also what this debate to-day reveals. Against the background of the cold war we have the situation that pressure is being exerted on us from abroad. Some exert pressure on us from abroad to change our policy because they cannot tolerate our presence in the southern part of Africa, because they have communist tendencies; others again because they want to use Africa as a place to unload their emigrants; others again have different reasons, but in any case they have common ground for attacking the Government of the Republic of South Africa. The method of attack is by applying pressure from abroad; the one organizes a boycott, the other initiates litigation in the International Court of Law and the other tries to initiate a case at UN, but everything is calculated to exert pressure on us from abroad.</p>

<p>When one reads the foreign newspapers, one finds that during the last year there has been a new trend in the reports emanating from South Africa in the foreign Press, namely that the people there are being praised for the pressure they are exerting on us. It takes the form that they are praised for exerting this pressure, which results in encouragement to them to increase the pressure and to make further trouble. What the Opposition is doing here to-day is nothing else but inviting that pressure from abroad still further. That is the light in which we should regard the nonsensical questions put by the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister: What will he do if we lose the case; what will he do if we win the case? It does not matter what replies the Government gives to those two questions. If it were to give a reply it would simply be creating two further fronts on which pressure can be exerted on us. And that is what the Leader of the Opposition wants. Whenever the Opposition gets an opportunity to say or to do something unpatriotic, it does so, and that is the whole reason for the attack here. Hon. members opposite asked why the Prime Minister does not reply himself; why he leaves it to us to speak in this debate. Let us just see how nonsensical the questions are which were put by the Leader of the Opposition. No person concerned in a lawsuit&#x2014;and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has surely appeared in court at least once&#x2014;will surely tell the Opposition what he is going to do. Surely a litigant is not so stupid as to tell his opponent what he will do, or to tell the outside world: Whatever the Court does, I will give a reply to it now. It is madness to put such a question. But let us go further.</p>

<p>I withdraw it. Sir, let us now analyse the nonsensical questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition. We behaved very correctly by saying that immediately the case is discussed in the Court we will not comment on it. That is a rule in all civilized countries. By asking that question, the Leader of the Opposition creates the impression that he disapproves of us behaving so correctly. Does he want to side with those uncivilized people who deny the existence of all international law? Then we must be living in a mad world when, our own people in this country co-operate with people who no longer recognize international law. And then we find a person like the hon. member sitting next to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), who blames the Minister of External Affairs for standing on a law point when we refuse to submit reports to UN. So also the Leader of the Opposition. He asks why we did not report because in fact there were reports and petitions. But does he not realize that in international law the position is the same as in any other section of the law, namely that when one makes an admission, when one agrees to something, one is held to it, when one says A one must also say B, and that one will be blamed if one has said A and then refuses to say B.</p>

When they get an opportunity to attack this side and to give ammunition to people abroad to exercise more pressure on us, they fall over each other to make use of that opportunity.

<p>I do not want to follow the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) in his remarks about the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, although I will have something to say about that at a later stage when I discuss the question of South West Africa, because I certainly do think that we have made many mistakes in regard to our behaviour at UN and in dealing generally with the whole question of South West Africa.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the question of our relations with the rest of Africa and the outside world at the present stage. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) exemplified a common tendency amongst members on the Government side when they talk about the relations of South Africa with the rest of the world. This tendency is to lump the entire outside world in a solid phalanx of enemies against this country. Sir, that is not so at all. There is a considerable distinction between what the Western world demands of this country and what, for instance, the Afro-Asian group demands of this country. There are differences even within that group itself and there are differences too between what the Afro-Asian nations and communist Russia demand of South Africa. It is a common fallacy for Government members always to say that complete and utter capitulation is demanded of this country as far as its racial policies are concerned. That is certainly not the case as far as the Western world is concerned. The Western world has consistently demanded that this country should turn its face against the direction of racial discrimination. It does not demand that the Whites in South Africa should hand South Africa over to a Black Government. That is quite different from the demands that hon. members say are being made on South Africa by the rest of the world.</p>

<p>What about Rhodesia?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Obviously the policies of Rhodesia may be open to objection and they may be criticized, but nevertheless none of the Western countries, at any rate, have demanded the complete abdication of the Whites in Southern Rhodesia, nor have they demanded that everything that is asked by the Blacks in Rhodesia be granted. [Interjection.] I do not know. It was never demanded by Great Britain of this country and it was never demanded at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x2019; Conference.</p>

<p>The point that I want to make is this, that even amongst the Afro-Asian group itself there is no complete consistency of thought. Everybody objects to our racial policies&#x2014;that is perfectly true&#x2014;but Africa is not one solid group; the independent nations are not grouped together in one solid group. If hon. members would study what is happening on the Continent of Africa a little more closely, they would see that there is a very sharp division. There is a division of interests between what is known as the Casablanca group of African states and the Monrovian group of African states, and the latter are, of course, much more benign in their attitude towards this country than the Casablancan states, which stands for direct intervention. The Monrovian group of states are not for direct intervention at all. They object to our racial policies but they are not nearly as extreme in their attitude towards this country as the Casablancan group. Hon. members must also realize that the Afro-Asian group must not be identified with the communist group. If they would study the voting at the United Nations they would see that there are many occasions when the Afro-Asian group votes solidly against the Soviet bloc, and therefore hon. members should not simply, as is the tendency on that part of the House, always link together the Afro-Asian and the communist bloc. They do it consistently and it is incorrect. Hon. members opposite should know a little bit more about international affairs before they commit these major diplomatic blunders, which they are constantly committing.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not saying that we must give in to the demands of these different groups. I say that there is a tendency to assume that the same demands come from everybody in the outside world, and they do not. That is why I say that there is room for manoeuvre for this country, and its whole diplomatic attitude should change. It is absurd to play tit-for-tat diplomacy in these difficult times. Where there is room for manoeuvre we should use that to our advantage and we should manoeuvre. I would take the case of the Nigerian Prime Minister as an example. I say that I believe that we should invite Balewa to visit this country. He is the head of one of the most moderate of the independent African states, and it is a very powerful state, containing some 35,000,000 to 40,000,000 people. It is the largest of the independent states and it is one of the most moderate. It is true, as hon. members have pointed out, that there is a boycott in Nigeria against this country. It is also true, for instance, that Nigeria refused a visa to a South African doctor to attend an international conference, but nevertheless gestures have been made in the past by this Government and gestures are being made now. As I have said earlier, it is absurd for this country to isolate itself further by this type of childish tit-for-tat diplomacy. We should be looking for friends, and if the Prime Minister of <span class="col_3725-3726" refersTo="page_0489"/>Nigeria, the largest of the independent African states and belonging to the Monrovian group, which is much more favourably disposed towards this country than the Casablanca group is, wants to visit South Africa, I think it would be sensible for us to invite him here and to show him the many advantages that the Government is always claiming it has given to the non-Whites of this country, and perhaps in some way it will soften his attitude towards this country.</p>

<p>This country is doing itself a grave disservice by not looking for markets in the rest of Africa. At the present stage our diplomatic and consular and trade representation in the rest of Africa is scandalously small. I asked the hon. the Minister of External Affairs this Session&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In what territories in Africa has the Republic (a) diplomatic and (b) trade representation?</block>

<p>The answer was that we are represented by a High Commissioner in the Federation and a Consul-General in Kenya, Mozambique and Angola, and that is the total scope of the diplomatic and trade representation in the rest of Africa. I say that this country which should be the industrial hub of Africa, which should be looking for markets and looking for friends is doing itself a grave disservice by childish tit-for-tat diplomacy in not inviting representatives of other countries to visit us and, secondly, in not broadening our representation in the rest of Africa. Sir, we have seen other nations practise the same sort of isolationist tactics; we have seen other nations embarking upon a sort of defiance campaign in Africa, and in each case it has led to grave repercussions. South Africa cannot simply proudly talk about isolation, spend money on defence, increase its army and its police force and hope thereby to insulate itself from the whole tide of events in the rest of the African Continent. I say quite emphatically that the hon. the Prime Minister will be doing this country a service if (a) he displays diplomatic maturity and does invite the Nigerian Prime Minister to visit this country and (b) if he takes immediate steps to attempt to win the friendship of the other independent states in Africa by making concessions on racial policies, which I believe would be to the great advantage of this country in the future.

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) now wishes to tell us that there is a difference between the demands of the West and the demands of the Afro-Asian nations which are made of the Republic of South Africa. However, she forgets to tell this House that the Western nations are compelled by the majority of the Afro-Asian nations at UN to fall in with the demands made of South Africa. She forgets to tell this House that even from to-day&#x2019;s news at 1 o&#x2019;clock it was very clear that the UN Committee of Inquiry which also wishes to go to Rhodesia told the British Government, after the British Government officials had given them an interview and had said that they could not interfere with the Southern Rhodesian constitution because they had made these provisions 40 years ago&#x2014;this same UN Committee told the British Government: &#x201C; We have only one demand and that is, one man one vote.&#x201D; They said that they were not concerned about conventions of 40 years ago. They demanded one man, one vote. The members of the Opposition prefer not to notice these things. It is convenient for them to leave them on one side. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) does perhaps want this, just like the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) who told us here that if we were a member of the Commonwealth when the Black states and the Black communistically orientated states made demands of South Africa, our position would be far better. They conveniently forget that Mr. Macmillan told us here in South Africa that we are a harmful burden to them, a burden which embarrasses them; that we are expendable to them because they wish to satisfy the large Black majority. The hon. member forgets this. The hon. member wants us to make concessions. What concessions? Must we make concessions which will eventually lead to one man, one vote, concessions which must eventually result in the disappearance of the White man? The hon. member for Houghton says that the African states are not unanimous in regard to their demands. The one section wants direct interference and <span class="col_3727-3728" refersTo="page_0490"/>the other does not want direct interference. But that is not the point. The purpose which they have is the same in both cases; it is only the method which differs. Both of these groups ask for one man, one vote; both of these groups say: &#x201C; Away with the White man in Africa.&#x201D; The one merely follows a different method from the other. The method of the one is direct interference and of the other indirect interference. The hon. member for Houghton wants the hon. the Prime Minister to invite the head of a certain state to this country, the Prime Minister of Nigeria. Perhaps they do not say that they want direct interference but they state emphatically: &#x201C;One man, one vote,&#x201D; in all respects. They say that Africa as a whole belongs to the non-Whites, to the Africans, as they put it. It does not help to try to tell us that there is a difference. There is only a difference in method but the aim is precisely the same. There is no difference in the eventual aim. The hon. member for Houghton says further that we must invite the Prime Minister of Nigeria because he is the most important and the Prime Minister of 40,000,000 people.</p>

<p>Is it &#x201C;a moderate man&#x201D;, if I may use her words, who sets a boycott against South Africa in motion because he is not satisfied with the internal policy of South Africa? Is this the modern manner in which foreign states interfere in the domestic affairs of other states, so much so that they apply boycotts against another state? Is this a moderate man? Is he a moderate man? Is this a man whom she wishes to accept as a leading spirit in favour of peace and love? Are the Progressive Party and the hon. member living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise? Do they forget this? However, the hon. member goes further and says that the exports from Europe to the African states now amount to R2,800,000,000. This is the annual buying power of the African states and we have to try to get into their good books. I want to put two questions to the hon. member Why does she not also admit that the exports of the Republic to the African states have increased and not decreased over the past year? Why does she not also admit that our exports have increased notwithstanding our difficulties? But what is more, has she not read over the past two days that the Lombard Bank has withdrawn all its money from Africa?</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>What does it prove? It proves that the Lombard Bank is concerned about the money of its shareholders and no longer has any confidence in the policy of handing over Africa to the non-White. But she wants to hand us over. The hon. member must not take the one amount of R2,800,000,000 and say that for the sake of these exports we have to forfeit our entire survival and crawl before the African states and say &#x201C;Let us for a short while derive benefits from all these exports, even though we perish afterwards.&#x201D; The Lombard Bank already realizes that it is going to perish in Africa if this policy continues in this way. It is because the Progressive Party merely wishes to live for brief economic advantages and does not want to look any further at the survival of the White man and of South Africa and peace that it acts so irresponsibly. This is merely a revelation of what we have once again experienced in this debate on the part of the whole of the Opposition, an unpatriotic action the like of which we have never before seen in South Africa. I want to refer back to a few examples in this regard. The hon. members for Benoni and Constantia hold up Luthuli to us as a great example, a man to whom the world has presented the Nobel Prize, who can bring about peace, and they want us to approve of his policy. By implication it boils down to that. Why otherwise would he cite Luthuli if he does not want us to accept Luthuli&#x2019;s policy? He is a moderate man, his priest of peace; this is his priest who will ensure the survival of civilization in South Africa. Our party can rightfully tell South Africa that through the medium of the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Benoni the United Party wishes to approve of the policy of Luthuli as being the policy which forms an alternative to the apartheid policy of South Africa.</p>

<p>What sense is there then in mentioning Luthuli as an example here? In order to show up the action of the Opposition very clearly I want to refer again to the State which was mentioned by the hon. member for Houghton, namely, Nigeria. I wish to put our problem in South Africa through the medium of this one single example. On 30 September 1960, at 12 o&#x2019;clock midnight, Nigeria obtained independence, a country of 40,000,000 people, and there was no doubt on their part, there was no argument on the question as to whether they wanted it or not. Everyone asked for it and accepted it unanimously and wholeheartedly. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure I am not the only member in this House who was astonished to hear the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) say that the hon. member for <span class="col_3729-3730" refersTo="page_0491"/>Constantia (Mr. Waterson) had advocated that we in South Africa should adopt the so-called moderate policies of Luthuli, because, Sir, that is a misconstruction which I would say, with respect to the hon. member, is as unforgivable as it is inexplicable. What the hon. member for Constantia did, in fact, was&#x2014;in the course of reading extracts from a speech made by Mr. Francis Plimpton at the United Nations&#x2014;to refer to Mr. Plimpton&#x2019;s statement that Mr. Luthuli was a moderate man. By no stretch of the imagination, however vivid that imagination might be in the case of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, can anybody suggest that it was said by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>However, I want to deal, if I may, with other matters which I think are far more important. It appears, Mr. Chairman, that the Government has three lines of defence against the dangers that threaten South Africa, and we must bear in mind that on the very day that Parliament opened, it was the hon. the Prime Minister himself who warned, and in fact assured, the House and the people of South Africa that we are living in grave times. Now it appears that up to now, the gravity of the times in which we live has created in the minds of those responsible for the government of South Africa the idea that they can shelter, and so can all of us in South Africa, behind three lines of defence. The first, oddly enough, is the Parliamentary majority of the Nationalist Party. It seems that all that has to happen and must continue to happen in South Africa is for the National Party to have, say, a two to one majority over the Opposition; then they will protect themselves and everybody else in South Africa against any of the external pressures which are only too well recognized on that side of the House. That is the first apparent line of defence, which, I suggest with the utmost respect is so flimsy that even they themselves do not believe that it can do more than give them a certain sense of comfort&#x2014;and a very temporary comfort, in my opinion&#x2014;in this House. The second line of defence, which, of course, was brought about as a result of the introduction of the Defence Budget, is the new military preparedness and the planning of that preparedness for South Africa. It was said over and over again that whereas R120,000,000 was a very large sum of money for South Africa to vote for its defence, it was, in fact, a drop in the ocean by comparison with other countries in the world. That was said, and yet we seem to be forgetting that all the time. But let us assume that we do not need to use all the weapons that will be acquired in terms of the R120,000,000 spending programme. It was said over and over again that we all hope that it will not be necessary, but we must assume that it is the intention to make that military preparedness as efficient as possible. Yet, if we on this side of the House suggest for a moment that there may be doubts about the efficacy of the planning and the efficiency of our preparedness, we are immediately accused of sabotage.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like the hon. member to listen to this. In regard to &#x201C;Defence&#x201D; there is a statement to which I would like to draw the attention of hon. members. I quote: &#x201C;We are told that the Government is making adequate preparations to defend the country, but if this is proceeding with the speed of most Government Departments, then we will manage to be prepared 20 years after South Africa ceases to be a sovereign state.&#x201D; I would like hon. members to listen to this. Somebody will be very quick to say that is United Party propaganda, that is our Press, the so-called United Party Press. So before they come out with such interjections, like &#x201C;Lombard Bank&#x201D;, which now appears to outdo &#x201C;Soapy&#x201D; Williams in the Hit Parade, I want to say that statement, that &#x201C;we will manage to be prepared 20 years after South Africa ceases to be a sovereign state&#x201D;, comes from a man who favours me with his broadsheet fairly regularly; certainly not a friend of mine, or of this side of the House, Dr. J. M. Haldeman, of 259 Zoutpansberg Rd., Rietondale, Pretoria&#x2014;probably well known to the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt). That is one point of view about preparedness.</p>

<p>The last line of defence, of course, is the certainty&#x2014;apparent certainty&#x2014;that regardless of what we say and regardless of what we may do, regardless of whether we do or do not amend our policies, &#x201C;the West needs us&#x201D;. That has been said three times this afternoon: &#x201C;The West needs us, we are the bastion of the West on this Southern tip of Africa.&#x201D; Regardless of what we are, how we behave, and how we support the Western powers, for example, they need us so much that the moment we are under pressure&#x2014;the argument runs&#x2014;they will immediately come to our assistance. This, regardless of the fact that we have no alliance with any of the Western powers. I want to suggest that sort of thinking, which is encouraged very greatly by the hon. the Prime Minister himself&#x2014;and, of course, what he says and does is never questioned by his side of the House&#x2014;that sort of thinking leads to the further and next step, the most dangerous of all, that the United Nations is a world forum about which the less said the better; in fact, it is not efficient; in fact, it is not likely to survive much longer. Outside of this House there are many people who can confirm what I am saying this afternoon&#x2014;there is the general attitude that we need not be perturbed about what is said about us or against us at the United Nations, because we all know that it is liable to fall on its face any day. That is a very dangerous state of mind, and unfortunately it is encouraged, as I say, by the hon. the Prime Minister and those who support him. For example, Mr. Speaker, on the day that Mr. Speaker reported the State President&#x2019;s speech at the opening of Parliament, he reported that His Excellency said the following in that speech&#x2014;I only refer to those excerpts in, shall I say, the first three hundred words, which are relevant to my argument. He said, to begin with&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_3731-3732" refersTo="page_0492"/>Parliament&#x2019;s deliberations during the coming Session will no doubt take into account the present international situation.</p>

<p>The outstanding feature of the present international situation is the progressive deterioration of the United Nations.</p>

<p>The defects of the United Nations clearly came to light.</p>

<p>There is the weakened position in the United Nations &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, I want to read another two extracts&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The latest instance of the ineffectiveness of the United Nations &#x2026; <br/>In the light of the sorry position in which the United Nations finds itself.</block>

<p>The hon. member over there says that those are facts. What is a fact is that the United Nations is not a perfect organization. What is a further fact is that it is subjected daily to criticism from any of its member-nations. But what is not a fact is the argument which those hon. members over there would like us to accept: That it is about to collapse. That is a very different thing. In order to support that, it is relevant to remind the hon. member of what another member of the United Nations thinks of the United Nations, and perhaps with a better right to form an opinion. I refer of course to the man who pays the piper, or the man who gives the piper the biggest instalment on his payment, the United States of America. Here, for example, as compared with the opinion of the hon. the Prime Minister and the opinion of His Excellency the State President, is the opinion of the President of the United States about the United Nations. In his address, known as the &#x201C;State of Union&#x201D; message, a very well-known feature of American political custom, at the end of last year, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Arms alone are not enough to keep the peace. It must be kept by men. Our instrument and our hope is the United Nations, and I see little merit in the intentions of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument, for the troubles of this world organization merely reflect the troubles of the world itself, and if the organization is weakened, those troubles can only increase.</block>

<p>Remember that. Far from taking the view that it would be a good things if this trouble-making body, the United Nations, were to disappear, the President of the United States reminds us that if the organization is weakened, those troubles can only increase. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We may not always agree with every detailed action taken by every officer of the United Nations, or with every voting majority, but as an institution it has in the future, as it had in the past since its inception, no stronger or more faithful member than the United States.</block>

<p>Yes, Sir, I wish to warn the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. There is more political ingenuity in the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that there is in the rest of the United Party put together. I say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must be careful. He will not be able to say that I was not magnanimous in warning him in time While warning the hon. the Leader of the Opposition I want to say that we are now becoming sick and tired, and I think that people throughout Africa and also abroad are now becoming sick and tired of this sickly sentimental humanism which has once again been revealed here to-day. If you sit and listen to their speeches, Mr. Chairman, you will find no hint or sign of a plea on their part for the cause of the White man. To my mind this is an impossible position in which we find ourselves but the Opposition is the victim of this post-war morbidity which has already had a corrosive affect on various continents and chiefly on the Continent of Africa. We are living in very serious times in which we have to think very soberly and realistically. We are also sick of these dream politics which we experience from the other side. I listened to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. During the debate on the motion to go into Committee of Supply certain questions were put to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and I want to repeat one question with emphasis; I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: What will you and your party do to remove these various fronts on which South Africa is attacked and frustrate the various efforts which are made to open more fronts on which they can attack us and to satisfy the <span class="col_3733-3734" refersTo="page_0493"/>attackers? The hon. the Leader of the Oppotion must answer that question. I and my bench companion started counting and we counted 30 questions which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition put to the Prime Minister. However, he himself has not yet answered one single question.</p>

<p>We are living in serious times, in times in which the cold war is beginning to assume serious proportions. These proportions throughout the world, the Western world, are such that everyone is engaged on an intensive armament programme. Everyone is arming. I think that our country is one of the few countries which spend such a small percentage of their national income on armament. All the countries spend a great deal of money in strengthening their defence forces. This is a cold war which in my personal opinion, and I think that I am correct, is strategically aimed at Africa, and all these fronts which are opened against us at UNO, to the north of our border, here in the interior, are all fronts which are opened because they are seeking an opportunity to enter the country. With Africa as the first primary strategic aim, the White man in Southern Africa, who is still a stable element, has to be removed. If we are removed they then can conquer Africa strategically. Now the Opposition come along and they ask us about and try to create suspicion in connection with our defence programme. They ask questions such as: Why did the hon. the Minister of Defence say this at Muizenberg, and why did the hon. the Prime Minister say that?</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you. You are trying to sow suspicion. I think that the purpose for which you are striving is a contemptible one. While we are trying to prepare ourselves just as all the other countries of the world are doing, you come along and create suspicion. We see what is going on and are convinced of the fact that we are the last stronghold which they wish to conquer in Africa. We have to go; the White man in South Africa has to go if they are to achieve their purpose. If Africa falls and the White man disappears completely from Africa and the White man loses in Southern Africa as he has lost in the rest of Africa, then I tell you that the group and the combination controlling Africa will control the entire world. Africa is a strategical necessity in this entire cold war as a prelude to the eventual conflict which must come. This strategy which is used against us on as many fronts as possible, at UNO, on the economic front, here in the interior, has to be overcome. Just see how the Opposition are trying to force an entry here. I am sure that they are not acting of their own volition but they are acting under duress. If a newspaper says something to-day or if some or other agitator says something outside, the Opposition repeat it in the House of Assembly to-morrow. Now our Group Areas Act has to be watered down; we have to forego minor apartheid matters; we have to undo what is causing the irritation. You see the tactics. The tactics are that we have simply to open fronts so that they can come in. We have to break down our front so that they can effect an easier revenge. It is because of this too that the cry now arises from the other side that we must foster diplomatic relations. It is not that they are so much concerned about diplomatic relations. They know that the standpoint of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs is absolutely correct but they wish to throw that spanner into the diplomatic works because this is one of the fronts which they wish to open in order to gain entry. Where do we find ourselves in these serious times? I want to say this. In our entire political evolution to where we are to-day we have had to deal chiefly with five important active factors. In this regard I wish to give every credit to the hon. the Prime Minister to-day in that in respect of these five factors he has stood his ground and given a clear lead. I want to mention them: The first factor which played a deciding role in our entire political evolution was the colour problem. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The speech just made by the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) is rather typical of I think all but one of the speeches which have come from the Government side this afternoon. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition put a number of very serious questions affecting the future of this country to the hon. the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will no doubt answer but in the meantime what have we had? We have had example after example of defeatism which would make me fear for the future of South Africa, were it not for the fact that I have abundant faith in the South African people. [Interjections.] That hon. member must not try to distract me, Sir. I repeat, that I have never heard such defeatism as I heard this afternoon from the Government benches. Member after member opposite, and even the hon. member for Ventersdorp who is usually a realist, have in effect said that there was no hope for the White man in southern Africa. That is the effect of what they have said, Sir. No country can exist for all time in the situation in which South Africa finds herself to-day, a position where she has lost the vast majority of her friends throughout the civilized world. The hon. member for Ventersdorp&#x2014;I shall deal with my subject by referring to him mostly as he was the last speaker&#x2014;referred to the future of the White man in this country. Let me say this to him that viewed from a long range the future of the White man can be secured in southern Africa. We on this side of the House are just as determined that there will be a future for the White man in southern Africa, as hon. members opposite are. But what we do say is that we who have the privilege of being White in South Africa must be very careful to see that our policies are based on fairness and on justice. If we can do those few simple things we can create an <span class="col_3735-3736" refersTo="page_0494"/>abiding future for the White man in southern Africa but not otherwise.</p>

<block name="quote">The strength of a nation lies in its friends and not in its armies.</block>

<p>I would go further, Sir, and say, that I do not believe that the strength of this nation can rest on the type of legislation which this Government has put on the Statute Book over the past 12 years of its control in this country. Hon. members, one after the other&#x2014;the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) among others&#x2014;have shown how deeply concerned they are. If they are so deeply concerned I would like to beg this of them that instead of looking to the outside world and what is being said in Nigeria and what is being said elsewhere, we should rather follow the Biblical injunction to look first to the mote in your own eye before looking elsewhere. I believe, Sir, that there are very many things in this country that could be put to rights quite easily and thus change the opinion of the whole outside world in regard to South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to take him up at once on that point. We have recently had the case of Portugal. Portugal is England&#x2019;s oldest friend. That has been proved in the past few hundred years. Portugal had a small possession, Goa, in the East. It must be remembered that Mr. Nehru was presented to the world as the great apostle of peace. He now comes along, because it suits him, and takes possession of Goa at an inopportune time for Portugal.

<p>That is what it amounts to. What does the hon. member want to insinuate then? Must Portugal be rejected now because of what she did during the war? What he is advocating here now is retaliation. Then we come to this other great friend who is supposed to mean so much in the world, namely America. What did America do to check India? When it suited America she told England, France and Israel not to enter Egypt. But did it suit her to check India? Oh, no. Mr. Chairman, I have said before that a time comes in the life of a nation when it dare not allow itself to be deflected from its course. Even if it has to die fighting, it still behoves it to do so because then at any rate it dies honourably. South Africa is in that position to-day. Hon. members make a song about isolation. Let me point out to this Committee this afternoon that we are not children; we are adults, and there is a history still to be written. Let me ask this Committee what has happened to the White man to the east of us? He started, just as hon. members in this Committee want to start, by making concessions in Indonesia, Burma, and Central Africa, and throughout the world, and to-day the White man is out of those countries. Before Africa can fall, this southern tip of Africa must fall first. And now I want to put this pertinent question to hon. members, a question which every White man in this country would ask himself because our skins are White: Into whose hands did those countries fall? This is a truth that we cannot get away from&#x2014;and this is the point that I want to put to my hon. friends on the other side. They fell into the hands of the communists. That is a fact that we cannot get away from; they fell into the hands of the communists.</p>

<p>The lot. If my hon. friend over there does not know it he ought to go into history a little more and then judge objectively where those states would stand in the event of war, as far as the position of the White man in the world is concerned. These two cries which are being raised by certain people for political gain, namely isolation and colonialism, are cries which have been raised by Russia; Russia has been using this cry of colonialism for her own gain. Colonialism has been echoed like a parrot-cry over the length and breadth of Africa, and for what purpose is it being used? I am afraid that my hon. friends on the other side of the House are allowing themselves to be misled. I want to take this matter a little further. I have been sitting here for some years. Every year when we come to the Defence debate we have heard that our Defence Force is too weak, that it is too small, that it is ineffective, etc., etc. And now that South Africa is going to spend R120,000,000 on defence, now that she is going to prepare for eventualities, this same Opposition, who in previous years have said just the opposite, attack this increased expenditure and sow this suspicion. We are arming to-day&#x2014;with what purpose? Just think for a <span class="col_3739-3740" refersTo="page_0496"/>moment what has been said in this House in recent times by the Opposition in connection with the arming of South Africa. I cannot help expressing my disappointment at the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude in this case. I thought that we as a nation would eventually stand together in this country, that we would speak with the same voice and together try to do great things so that the public will realize that when it comes to the defence of our fatherland we stand united and that we speak with one voice. I want to express my disappointment this afternoon in the Opposition.</p>

<p>Then just one final observation to my hon. friend on the other side. I must say that he is a person for whom I have great respect. When he refers to the defeatism revealed in the speeches which have been made on this side and views our attitude in that light, then I cannot help saying to my hon. friend that the interpretation that he places on speeches from this side is entirely erroneous. I believe that the public is very grateful to the hon. the Prime Minister, to the hon. the Minister of Defence, for the fact that we are preparing ourselves so that if anybody should be foolish enough to attack us we shall be ready for it. That is how we accept the position, however regrettable it may be that is the position. But do not imagine that, because we are sorry and because we deprecate that position, we have already hoisted the white flag.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I knew that somebody was going to take the bait but I did not expect that poor hon. member to take the bait so soon. I am very fond of him. He has improved; the Nationalist Party is improving. Gradually they are adopting the policy of the United Party. That is all to the good, but the trouble is that it has both embarrassed and annoyed them. And there is only one emotion&#x2014;I think it was said here once by the Minister of Bantu Education&#x2014; which is worse than this combination of embarrassment and annoyance, and that is alcoholic remorse. For many years we have been warning the Government that it cannot continue to follow the path it is pursuing. We warned the Prime Minister. Some members did, from time to time, show an understanding &#x2014;like the hon. member who has just raised so many objections. He has come to our assistance now and then but as soon as there is an election and he has to fight a nomination, he is in trouble again. But in their hearts they know the policy indicated by the United Party is the only policy that can get South Africa out of this sordid mess again, they know that.</p>

<p>This afternoon I listened to the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) trying to make the House, believe, in the kind of speech which one would expect from him outside this House, that South Africa&#x2019;s relations with the outside world have never been better. He says this in spite of the fact that his party political mouthpiece, <i>Die Burger,</i> says that South Africa has become the polecat amongst the nations of the world. Whom is he trying to bluff? Since when has a polecat been such a sweet-smelling animal? Let us get down to the truth and let us no longer have the type of accusation which we heard from the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, and of course also from the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), namely that we on this side of the House are imitating the agitators in South <span class="col_3741-3742" refersTo="page_0497"/>Africa. That is not the case. I would like to say here to-day on behalf of the United Party that no one condemns more than this side of the House does the irresponsible and sometimes untruthful utterances of persons such as Michael Scott and various others who libel South Africa and harm her good name. [Interjections]. And now that I have said this the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) is annoyed because I have said it. Why? Because they would like to make political propaganda out of this kind of thing and because they are more interested in political propaganda that they can make than in the service which they can render to South Africa.</p>

<p>If those hon. members and the hon. the Prime Minister seriously intend to have our support, then the hon. the Prime Minister should curb those backbenchers of his and not constantly allow them to accuse us of being disloyal to South Africa and of echoing the anti-South-African agitators. That is not what we are doing and I would like the hon. the Prime Minister to know that when the time comes when he really needs help to defend South Africa and to uphold the reputation of South Africa, he can rely on the whole-hearted support of this side of the House. And the hon. the Prime Minister knows that. It seems to me that the Chief Whip on the other side does not like my saying this. He feels despondent. I do not know what his stand will be, but I know where we are going to stand. Because although we do not agree with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy and ask him respectfully to renounce that policy and not to be stubborn, we will nevertheless stand by South Africa. Mr. Chairman, to compromise is not a sign of weakness.</p>

<p>It has been said here this afternoon that the Nigerian Prime Minister should not be allowed to visit this country because he has stated that if he comes here he will attempt to convince the Government of the wrongness of its policy. And for that simple reason he is to be permanently debarred from visiting South Africa. If countries like Britain and America were to adopt such an intransigent attitude, then no member of the Cabinet, from the Prime Minister to the Minister of Foreign Affairs would have been allowed to visit England or America because at some time or another all of them have said offensive things about America.</p>

<p>I do not want to produce evidence now. I think it is time we stopped making that type of accusation. But I want to say this to the Prime Minister. He knows as well as I do, and as well as any other responsible person does, that we cannot continue in this way, with feelings as they are at the moment in Africa. He also knows as well as the whole of the party on this side that we cannot have the system of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; and that we do not want it in this country. If we had that system in this country there would be chaos. I ask him to be honest with the Republic of South Africa and to tell this country, just as he does overseas, that the United Party, like all other parties including the Progressive Party, does not stand for the system of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. Let him stop his adjutants from running around in the rural areas telling people that the United Party stands for &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. I think that is a fair request. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to make a political speech here to-day. (Laughter.) I have not come out with the worst yet; I am just starting. Greater people than the Prime Minister or I or anyone of us have said in the past that when you have enemies and you want to defeat them, the most effective way of doing so is by making them your friends. I wonder whether the hon. the Prime Minister will not be magnanimous and big enough to say, &#x201C;I am the Prime Minister of South Africa and I am not afraid to have the Prime Minister of Nigeria, with whom I want to live on good neighbourly terms, visiting South Africa. I shall receive him here as Prime Minister of another Africa state; I shall show him what is going on in South Africa, and I trust that he will be magnanimous enough to say to the world that the Native and the Coloured are not being oppressed in this country. We have a different method, but our aim is the same, and that is to help and to uplift the whole of the community.&#x201D; What is wrong with that?</p>

<p>No, the hon. member can speak again later on.

There is not a single person who does not agree with that. And what hope, what solution, is the Prime Minister giving us? He cannot come along and say that he believes that a world war will provide the solution for us. I hope I am wrong but the impression I get is that the Prime Minister says that a world conflict will take place and that there will be chaos, and whether we then win or lose, at least the blame cannot then be placed on his shoulders. Is it a statesman-like policy to hope for chaos so as to be able to save your own country? [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw. In any case, he made a clear admission of the policy of the U.P. in respect of arming Natives. He referred <span class="col_3743-3744" refersTo="page_0498"/>to the speech of the hon. member for Pretoria-District (Mr. Schoonbee), the contents of which were not admitted by that hon. member, but he said the hon. member had helped &#x201C;us&#x201D; by his speech, and if that does not prove that the U.P. supports the policy of arming the Bantu then I do not know what does. It also agrees with their federal policy which will result in Bantu representation in this House, of whom one may possibly be the Minister of Defence, and then the arming of the Bantu may possibly take place.</p>

<p>In regard to a statement made by the hon. member for Germiston-District (Mr. Tucker), I just want to say that he said that the White man in the Republic and in Southern Africa could only continue to exist if a policy was applied by the Whites in respect of the non-Whites &#x201C;based on fairness and justice&#x201D;. Now I want to put it to him that this Government is in fact applying a policy based on fairness and justice. That is precisely what the Government is doing in terms of its policy of separate development. But I want to ask the hon. member where in Africa the implementation of a policy of fairness and justice helped the White man in any way. He really gave a definition of his policy of fairness and justice and we are grateful to him for it. He said that if we replace the Coloureds on the common roll and bring the Bantu representatives back to this House and amend the application of the Group Areas Act in such a way that it will have no meaning any more, because he says it must be applied in such a way that it will not hinder anybody, and if we amend the Population Registration Act, or in other words, do away with the colour bar, that would be a policy of fairness and justice.</p>

<p>On a point of order, the hon. member is misquoting everything I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that if the Government were to restore the mixed universities and abolish job reservation it would result in more goodwill and it would make friends for us abroad, because that would be a policy of fairness and justice. I want to ask him where such a policy ever helped the White man in Africa? Did it help the Hollanders in Indonesia, or the Belgians in the Congo, or improve the position of the White people in the Federation? And they did not apply any of the measures which he says we must repeal. Nevertheless there is no assurance that they will be able to continue existing as Whites in those states. In other words, his application of a policy of fairness and justice will mean the beginning of the swamping of the Whites in this country.</p>

<p>I just want to say this to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). She alleges that this side of the House does not differentiate between the attitude of the Western countries and that of the Afro-Asian states against South Africa. I want to say that our attitude on this side is that basically there is no difference in their attitude, because they are all guided by just one idea which I call the exaggerated granting of human rights to non-White nations which are not yet ripe for it. With that they link the granting of full, unqualified political status for all, in terms of the principle of one man, one vote. There is therefore no basic difference in principle between the Western Powers and the Afro-Asian group in regard to their inimical attitude towards our colour policy.</p>

<p>In so far as the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) is concerned, he said that side of the House came out with their flags flying after the time of crisis they experienced during the Second World War, and everybody was their friend. But there is a very big difference between circumstances just after the war and to-day. After the war South Africa was one of the Allies which had achieved victory and had fought together with the communists and had blessed their arms and had prayed for Russian successes. Then there was not yet this rising Black nationalism. The winds of change had not raged over Africa then as they are doing now. The communists had not yet extended their sphere of influence into the very heart of Europe. UN did not have a majority of non-White states, nor did the Commonwealth. Circumstances were very different. The Government is fighting here against a wall of prejudice born out of the post-war conditions. The new circumstances are the struggle between two world powers to gain the friendship of the Black man of Africa, which puts the interests of the White man in issue. It has nothing to do with having emerged from the crisis of war honourably.</p>

<p>Then just a final remark in reply to the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel), who says that we rely on it that we are so important to the Western world and therefore we believe that they will not leave us in the lurch. But is that not the truth? Do we not in fact mean so much to them? Does he want to suggest that the Western world will benefit by it if South Africa eventually has a Black Government, particularly if their policy should be implemented, as the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) recently admitted, namely that it would take just ten or 15 years before the Black man is in the majority if the United Party policy is implemented. If this Republic were to stand under a Black Government, would that be to the benefit of the Western Powers? If South Africa were under the control of the communists, would that benefit them? Has the Republic of South Africa an exclusive and selfish task in respect of its own interests if we arm ourselves in order to protect ourselves against the threat of attacks emanating from the north, or do we also have a task and a duty to perform in regard to the Western Powers, and vice versa?

<p>Apparently the hon. member over there assumes that the moment I arise the end of the debate has come, but he is very far wrong, as he will discover very <span class="col_3745-3746" refersTo="page_0499"/>soon. It is a pleasure to answer the very courteous question the hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) has just put to me and my party, and I will do so immediately. Dealing with my statement that the Government is obviously determined to assume that because, in their opinion, the West needs South Africa, they will under all circumstances come to our aid in an emergency, he asks whether I think that the Untied States will stand by and allow this country to be ruled by a Black majority.</p>

<p>Having referred to the Western states, he then referred to the U.S.A. It is a little too early for me to quote from his Hansard, where he will see what he said. He asks in effect whether I thought that the U.S.A. would stand by and see this country ruled by a Black majority. Surely he is not so naive as to believe that the U.S.A. or any Western power is concerned with the complexion of a Government as far as pigmentation is concerned? It is only concerned with its methods and form of government. In other words, the U.S.A., in my opinion, will certainly deal with any government of any country provided it is, in the opinion of the U.S.A., a democratic government and supports the mutual policies and interests of the two countries. That is the simple answer which I would like the hon. member for Marico and other hon. members opposite to ponder carefully. They assume that under all circumstances we in South Africa can rely on the West to come rushing to our aid, because we are a &#x201C;White&#x201D; country with a &#x201C;White&#x201D; government. I think the hon. member for Marico thinks that one of the reasons why they will come to our aid is because we are governed by the National Party. [Interjections.] What I would like the hon. member to bear in mind is that the complexion of a democratic government is of no significance in this world. You can be White or Black or Yellow or Green. But I do not wish to pursue this argument because if that is one of the illusions held by hon. members opposite, our dangers is even greater than I feared it was.</p>

<p>This question of our defence as dealt with in the Budget is a remarkable situation in many ways, because on 28 March the Minister of Defence told us, in Col. 3414 of Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Let me say this. South Africa cannot prepare itself against a war of that type, a war of projectiles and atom bombs. That is so, but by the time those weapons are used we will be involved in a world war and then we will inevitably be on the side of the West.&#x201D;</block>

<p>He said &#x201C;We will be on the side of the West&#x201D;; he did not say that the West would be on our side, and there is a big difference between the two, I submit.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to see that on the one hand there are statements about the gravity of the situation, whilst on the other hand we see the smiling faces of members of the Government. Everything in the garden is lovely. They have never been so happy in their lives, and all these threats of danger are insignificant. The outside world will one day realize who is wrong and who is right. The Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Let me say that we on this side of the House are fully aware of the dangers. We all know there are dangers. We all know that there are circumstances which South Africa cannot combat.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Now, if that is the position in fact, what have we been offered to combat these dangers? We have been offered by the Minister of Finance what he calls an insurance policy, and that was subsequently taken up by the Prime Minister when he referred to the insurance that the people of South Africa were getting by spending this money. But I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of Finance to the fact that before you take out an insurance policy, you want to satisfy yourself fully about the probity of the company, the integrity of its directors and the ability of the company to pay out your claim on due date. Those are very important considerations. But what do we find? The Minister of Finance asks, who will begrudge the premium if the accident does not happen? That is a very bland way of putting it, because if you insure against something which does not happen, normally you would not begrudge the premium if the accident did not happen; but that will only be the case if in fact you have insured yourself with a company which has the undoubted ability to meet your claim if the accident does happen, and regarding our defence that is a matter for serious doubt. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of Finance to the fact that his colleague the Minister of Transport not long ago had to issue a public statement in the Press drawing the attention of thousands of people in South Africa to the fact that one of the insurance companies through which they had taken out policies for a certain purpose was in such a position that those policies were no longer valid, because the company was in very serious difficulties. He knows which company I am talking about. Therefore, the important thing is for the Government to assure the country that in paying this <span class="col_3747-3748" refersTo="page_0500"/>premium which it demands of the country, it is in fact providing an insurance policy which will be effective under all reasonable circumstances; and that is the test, reasonable circumstances. That is the point I want the members opposite to understand&#x2014;that as far as the attitude of this Government to UNO is concerned, we are in no sense strengthening that insurance which we hope to obtain through the premium of our defence budget, but we are in fact weakening it, and we may even be running a serious risk of invalidating the entire policy; because as I pointed out earlier, those who pay the largest share of the cost of running this very much criticized organization take a view which is diametrically opposed to that of the Government of this country, about the needs for and the efficacy and the future of UNO.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to reply to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) who has expounded a curious philosophy of life here this afternoon, one which I cannot allow to pass unnoticed. He started off his speech by saying that the strength of a nation lay not in its weapons, but in its friends. But there is also another very famous saying which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Houdt eers den vyand van het lijf <br/>Door skerp te mikken En maakt u dan een trouwen vriend <br/>Door slechts te schikken.</block>

<p>The hon. member has evidently never read that. The hon. member said we would have had many more friends to-day had we restored the Coloureds to the common voters&#x2019; roll. In that way you will acquire international friends. Restore Bantu representation in Parliament; change the Group Areas Act and you will acquire international friendship; repeal the Population Registration Act. But I want to ask this: Having obtained that friendship and having the eight representatives of the Bantu, which is their policy to-day&#x2014;there were always three&#x2014;how long will you retain that friendship? In 1946 an Act was piloted through this House by General Smuts in which he did exactly what the hon. member asks us to do to-day. What was the reply? The reply given by Mrs. Ballinger was that kind of concession would still cause civil war in this country&#x2014;and that is recorded in Hansard. That was not the end of the matter. Those words of Mrs. Ballinger&#x2019;s were quoted at UNO. However, the hon. member is again asking for that type of legislation to-day.</p>

<p>I say that type of legislation will undermine your own position and strengthen that of your opponent. Why does the hon. member want it? The hon. member for Germiston (District) has advanced that as his solution. [Interjections.] Please be quiet. I say that if the hon. member thinks our friendship will be strengthened by those examples which he has quoted, he is making a big mistake because he will be sacrificing his own position. Because, in that case, he will be proving that he had been wrong and he will be proving that those people ought to have representation. In that case he will be asked at UNO whether he considered eight people in this House to be adequate representation for millions of people. By saying you admit that there should be representation for the non-White, you are opening the whole argument at international level. That is why our course is the straight and honest course, namely that representation for the non-Whites of South Africa should be given in those areas where they will not in any circumstances run the risk of a majority group oppressing or dominating a minority group. That can only come about on the basis on which we are continuing to-day. However, it seems as though hon. members are concerned because it appears as though we are nearing the end of our struggle and as though the eyes of the world are gradually opening, because the time may come when UNO will compare the countries which are governed by us in this way with other countries and that we in South Africa will outshine the others and be regarded as the model. The people who criticize us to-day, including the Opposition, will then realize that the only way in which you can confer full human rights on groups living in one country, is to confer them in such a way that you can always guarantee that no majority group will oppress a minority group.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the time has arrived when we can reasonably expect the hon. the Prime Minister to take part in the debate. After all, it is his Vote. We had the experience this afternoon of having various members on the Government side criticizing the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, so much so that one got the impression that this was not the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote but the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s Vote. The Leader of the Opposition put various points to the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister to deal with the question of South West Africa and international <span class="col_3749-3750" refersTo="page_0501"/>relations. Although we did not expect the hon. the Prime Minister to answer immediately, it is quite clear to us on this side of the House that a good deal of home-work has been going on in the meantime. We only hope that the home-work has been well done. On the other hand, we have not had any contribution by any member on the Government side under this Head. All they have done has been to criticize the Leader of the Opposition for having raised the matter. There was nothing constructive; no suggestions; no solution; no advice whatsoever. All they wanted to do was to stifle criticism and to have secret meetings. One wonders what Parliament is for when one hears members of the Government side speaking, or the lesser lights on the Government side.</p>

<p>Another point raised by the Leader of the Opposition was the relationship between the Republic and the other states in Africa. We have had no contributions by members of the Government side in that regard. There has only been a suggestion that the rest of Africa did not want us. Is that their attitude that they have written off the whole of the rest of Africa? [Interjections.] The hon. the Chief Whip opposite is interjecting. Has he lost all his personality? Does he think that even if the Prime Minister sent him, the Chief Whip, to the rest of Africa, he will not be able to do something for the good of our country? Mr. Chairman, if we are going to win friends and influence people in the states to our north, please do not send the Chief Whip, but send somebody responsible, somebody who will win friends and influence people. I even want to suggest that they might send you, Mr. Chairman. I know that when you have had the opportunity of going north you have been able to make a good contribution.</p>

<p>We do hope that the Government will realize that since it has come into power virtually nothing has been done to strengthen our representation in the states to our north. It was only towards the end of last year that Tanganyika got its independence and what did we find then? We found that the nations of the East as well as the Western nations were bidding for property in Dar-es-Salaam in order to establish their embassies. Judging by the interventions of Government members in this debate to-day they have written off Africa. They say that Africa will not be satisfied with anything less than one man one vote. They have written Africa off. Surely that is an irresponsible attitude, Sir.</p>

<p>Let me deal with the next heading raised by the Leader of the Opposition. He asked what the relationship was between the Republic and the Eastern countries. What we expected was that some members on the Government side would tell us something about our relationships with the East. Surely some of those hon. members know about the visits to Japan. We have representation in Malaya, but we do know that the trade with Malaya has not grown anything like as much than the trade with Japan. Surely, Sir, we can expect some contribution on the part of the Government side. Surely they can give us some information as to how our trade is developing and how our relationships are developing with the East, what bases have been established and what further developments are contemplated. We have been sitting here since quarter past two and in the main we have had nothing but soap-box speeches from that side; playing for time until the Prime Minister was ready.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance is the last man to interfere. The Minister of Finance failed completely when he dealt with legislation as Minister of the Interior. I hope the Prime Minister is not going to make him the next Minister of Foreign Affairs. He has certainly not made a success of finance so far. Legislation is being passed and is pending in Great Britain in regard to the Republic, but we have had no contribution whatsoever in that regard from the Government side. [Interjections.] I expect interjections of the kind from the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). The hon. member for Vereeniging has made no positive contribution to this debate. That hon. member reminds me of a small boy putting up skittles in a convenient position so that he can roll them over easily. That hon. member puts up his own skittles to suit his own case. I think it is high time that the Prime Minister intervened in this debate and gave answers to the questions put by the Leader of the Opposition, questions put in an objective manner, questions demanding an answer and questions which should be answered before this debate proceeds any further.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down is usually very serious-minded but this evening he was quite amusing. Immediately after he had ascertained from us that I would shortly enter the debate he made this very strong appeal to me to rise! Let me assure him that he has not forced me to my feet. He also said that I had had to do some home-work, whereas I was only trying to help his hon. Leader by remaining seated. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us this afternoon that he had three points on his mind, but he dealt with only one of them. So I thought that in order to enable him to get the rest out of his system, because he seemed to be worried in those three directions, I wanted to give him an opportunity to do so, an opportunity which he did not take. I can understand however that he wants this first aspect to be dealt with first, but there was this very good reason for me to wait on him to finish the whole speech which he had announced in advance. He did not take that opportunity. Now I wish to follow his various arguments. This may prove slightly tedious but nevertheless I have to do <span class="col_3751-3752" refersTo="page_0502"/>so, because after all it is my task to reply to the debate.</p>

<p>The first point with which I wish to deal is the plea which he apparently made for a non-political basis on which the South West African question had to be approached in the future. I must say that I too feel very strongly that this matter should not have been raised at this stage, namely this question of South West Africa. This is a time when of necessity one has to be very cautious in everything that is said or done if the interests of South Africa are to be truly observed. For that reason I do not intend going further in making my reply than I think is justified in present circumstances. However, the point which he raised as to whether we were prepared to deal with the South West African question on a non-political basis, does need some discussion. Firstly I must say&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will not take such a disclosure amiss&#x2014;that I have taken up the attitude in the past, and the Government with me, that, seeing that one does not know to what these matters may lead, it was necessary to keep in touch with the Leader of the Opposition to the extent to which it was possible. Therefore, a little while ago, I did have discussions with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition although I could only tell him that there was nothing new to divulge at the time. I also made the offer that I would be prepared to keep him informed as further information was received by the Government. That means that we did take the Opposition into consideration. That at least has been done. I wish to restate very clearly however that up till this week-end nothing of any importance was received from UNO which I could convey to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Therefore the two occasions on which we discussed these matters could not have been very enlightening to him, but that was only due to the fact that neither I nor the Government had further information. When we talk about dealing with the South West African question on a non-political basis I want to ask what exactly is meant by this statement. The attack which was made upon us to-day was not a very auspicious introduction to such a plea. I do not know why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition saw fit to start a dog fight on what had happened in the past, and on the question of whether the Government had acted wisely or not in the past, if he intended to lead up to such a plea. I should say that if people want to face a dangerous future together, they should build on a better foundation that such reproaches and recriminations as we have had from him. I feel that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not lay a sound foundation for good co-operation in this matter, especially after I had shown my willingness by these invitations, to which I have just referred, to confer with him from time to time.</p>

<p>I want to take this matter away from the type of discussion which we have had this afternoon and ask very definitely what is meant by the request that this South West African question should in future be placed on a non-political basis. Does that mean that we as a Government who remain responsible to the public, should only discuss with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and through him with his party, the various stages of developments as they come to pass? Or does he suggest something more? Does he suggest that the Government should not be entitled to act unless it is with the full agreement of the Opposition? If the second alternative is his intention then I cannot see that this is practicable. After all the Government very often has to act at short notice. For instance, the only communication on which we can base a decision at present was received over the week-end and the reply must go forward practically immediately. Even in a case like that I could and would be prepared and was now in fact prepared, to give the Leader of the Opposition the information at my disposal. But if we were to differ, perhaps differ strongly, on what attitude should be adopted by the Government then there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that it is encumbent upon the Government to come to a decision and not to allow itself to be led by the Opposition into compromise action, with which it did not agree and with which it could not face the public. I also believe that it is encumbent upon the Government not to allow a retardation of action to take place because of such discussions. It is therefore not an easy suggestion to accept if it means that joint decisions have to be taken that is to say if that is the meaning of dealing with South West Africa on a non-political basis. It would on the other hand be something quite different if I were asked to keep the Leader of the Opposition well informed on behalf of the Government as to what is happening from time to time and also to obtain his opinion&#x2014;which I take it would be the opinion of his party as he knows it&#x2014;on what should be done. If the Government could see eye to eye with the Leader of the Opposition one would only be too happy to act on such a joint opinion. I could not however, make a Government decision dependent upon, shall I say, Opposition policy in this connection especially if that policy differed greatly from ours. That must be very clearly understood. Perhaps when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition rises again he will inform me on what his idea is of a common non-political basis for dealing with the South West African question.</p>

<p>The reproach was made by the Leader of the Opposition that the Government was frighteningly silent, as he called it on what had happened in connection with South West Africa. I must confess that I do not understand what he meant by that. What was there to say? I have told him before, and I am telling him again in public, that during all these months not a word was heard from UNO. The first news came when the Committee was appointed on the eve of the adjournment of the General Assembly. That is well known. There was nothing in this on which to be silent; there was nothing on which anything could be said. Shortly <span class="col_3753-3754" refersTo="page_0503"/>after that the membership of the Committee was announced. That was also announced in public. It appeared in the newspapers at the same time that the Government received the information because it was immediately made public on the other side of the ocean again. There was nothing on which one could be frighteningly silent; there was nothing on which one could say anything at all. Thus as far as that matter is concerned there was nothing for the Government to make public until this week-end when a certain approach was made to the Government. Furthermore, after this approach had been made in this very delicate matter, an approach to which a reply must be given quickly, it would be quite wrong for the Government to make any public announcement at this stage on what reply was sent to the Committee at UNO before the reply has been received by them. Only then should this jointly be disclosed. I am therefore not prepared&#x2014;and I hope the Leader of the Opposition accepts my view that it will not be diplomatically correct on my part to do so&#x2014;to make any further statement in that regard at this stage.</p>

<p>The reproach was also made that we were apparently frighteningly silent not only on this matter with which I have already dealt, but also on two other matters. The one was in regard to the court case which, the Leader of the Opposition said, had been pending for 18 months. He said that the Government had acted but had made no statement on the case. He said that the people of South Africa were entitled to know not only what our defence was going to be but that they were entitled to know what outcome we hoped for. In prophesying the verdict we should also prophesy what UNO would do about it if the verdict went against their desires and what we would do if it went against us. We should also say of what use it would be to us if the verdict were in our favour. Surely a more foolish number of questions than these cannot be asked of a Government. I think it would be utterly wrong and dangerous to South Africa&#x2019;s case if we dared to do what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has requested. I think it is the duty of the Government to fight this case on behalf of South Africa and to do so in a perfectly correct manner without in any way acting against the interests either of the court or of our own case. For that reason I am not prepared to say anything more or to make those deductions or to give that information which the Leader of the Opposition has asked for. I do not think I would be serving the best interests of South Africa if I were to do so.</p>

<p>The next point which the Leader of the Opposition made was in connection with the more political sphere. In this respect too he said that we had been frighteningly silent after we had suffered one diplomatic defeat after the other. Surely the Leader of the Opposition must know that is not a true statement of fact. South Africa has been under attack for the past 14 years and more. The attack started during the period in office of the late General Smuts. On every occasion throughout these years both Governments, the one which was in power up to 1948 and the present Government since then, have met the increasing attacks with great care and I think with great honour. Far from having suffered one diplomatic defeat after another, I think the very fact that we are still in the position in which we are to-day, is the result on one diplomatic victory after the other. It is quite true that the position has worsened during the years. But what else could have been done than to sacrifice South Africa&#x2019;s case at some stage? And what would have been South Africa&#x2019;s position to-day had we done that? When one small nation has to stand up for its rights against the encroachments of large numbers of nations banded together for their own reasons, and with some others prepared to support them in their own interests, even without believing in the justice of their case, and such a nation holds its own, like South Africa has done throughout the many years, I think we have everything to be thankful for. Far from indirectly praising the others and stating that they have inflicted defeat upon us, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should have proudly lauded the way in which South Africa has stood her ground.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also reproached us because we did not accept a former judgment of the International Court, and said that all this ill-will had been created as a result. In the first place, as everybody knows, that judgment was an advisory opinion. There was no obligation on us to accept it.</p>

<p>I said it was an advisory opinion.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, quite true. But I say again that there was no obligation on us to accept that advisory opinion. And we did not accept it. Do the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party wish to insinuate that, in order to obtain the support of the Afro-Asian nations and others, we should have sacrificed our stand? Because, after all, if we did allow UNO to bring pressure to bear upon us in the direction in which it wanted to do so, and had we allowed ourselves to be forced into delivering reports&#x2014;irrespective of the fact that one could add that this is being done voluntarily since this would be ignored&#x2014; the Leader of the Opposition should realize that we would have been in far great difficulty than we are to-day. It is also foolish to say that the present ill-will against us was caused by our refusal to accept that advisory opinion because the ill-will which exists is not based on a purely technical matter like that. The ill-will which exists, has grown up in the course of time due to continuous communist instigation and due to the fact that the Afro-Asian nations are all shadow-boxing and looking for somebody to blame for something when anything goes wrong in their own countries. They have banded together against the White man and South Africa is attacked as the symbol of <span class="col_3755-3756" refersTo="page_0504"/>the White man. For those reasons ill-will has gradually been blown up to the present size at UNO. The Western nations should have supported South Africa had they adhered to their own principles in respect of many matters, and thereby could have contained the ill-will, but they gave way because they sought the support of these Afro-Asian nations in their struggle against Communism at all costs. The basis of whatever ill-will exists is to be found in much larger issues than our non-acceptance of this particular advisory opinion. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition should allow himself to be led astray and to make such remarks which do not rest on a foundation of fact.</p>

<p>The next point which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made was that the Government in declining to submit reports even as an act of grace, thought it would prevent discussion by the Afro-Asian nations. Surely he knows that we believed nothing of the sort. Whoever thought that by declining to submit reports we would prevent discussion? Of course we knew they would go on; of course we knew that the attacks would continue. But we certainly did believe that if we did submit reports we would not be upholding the principle on which we had always based our case, namely that UNO had no jurisdiction with regard to the South West African situation. That was the foundation on which we based our stand.</p>

<p>The point was also made that the Government had refused to transmit petitions. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that had we done that we would have found favour. But must we sacrifice our rights by making useless gestures? Should we have passed on misleading petitions from Kozonguise who went to Red China in order to show what a good communist he was. He spoke at Peking and put up a strong case for his communist friends. Should we have sent through petitions by Michael Scott as was suggested to-day &#x2014;petitions on behalf of Hosea Kutako but not actually emanating from him but from those who egged him on? We would have achieved nothing on earth for South West Africa by doing that. We would however have created the impression that we acknowledge that UNO had a right to intervene.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition also suggested that the present situation was due to the fact that the Government was not present in the Fourth Committee to defend South Africa against unjustified accusations and that it was the Government&#x2019;s inaction which was responsible for an image of South Africa having been created which was far from the truth. But surely even in General Smuts&#x2019;s time in 1946 this hostility already existed. It has been built up since at UNO, but the basis was there. General Smuts foresaw that this wrong image would develop more and more in the course of time. He had no illusions, as far as I can read between the lines, about what was going to happen afterwards. He returned to South Africa fully disillusioned. Furthermore this image cannot be a result of the fact that the Government has done nothing to expose the unjust accusations since, in fact, the opportunity was taken to do so during the sessions of 1948, 1949, 1954, 1955, 1959 and 1961&#x2014; even if it was only by way of illustration to answer accusations and to show how unfounded they were. It is true that during other sessions for various reasons this course was not followed, either because it was not necessary or it was not possible or it would have been wrong due to special circumstances. South Africa&#x2019;s case has indeed been fully heard. Because certain nations do not want South Africa&#x2019;s case to be dealt with impartially, because they want to oppose South Africa without restraint, this struggle continues. It was not because South Africa&#x2019;s case was not put and was not put well by our representatives, amongst whom our present Minister of Foreign Affairs was the one who put our case the strongest, that this unjust image has been created.</p>

<p>I now come to a further point made by the Leader of the Opposition namely that another Committee has been appointed with more unacceptable terms of reference which shows that the United Nations are determined to bring this matter to a head, and that it must be deplored that the public have had no authoritative statement as to the Government&#x2019;s attitude or its plans. As I have already said: it was only during the last few days that we received a definite request&#x2014;over the week-end &#x2014;and I do not think that it will be either wise or useful or in South Africa&#x2019;s interests to make a statement at this stage as to the Government&#x2019;s attitude. At this stage we are in the process of negotiation. Therefore I am not prepared to say anything further with regard to this matter.</p>

<p>The further point that was made was that we were cut off from the rest of Africa, bar the Federation and Portugal. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs had spoken about South Africa&#x2019;s role on the Continent of Africa five years ago and that he had mentioned three steps which should be taken, firstly to remove suspicions, secondly that the African States should accept South Africa as an African State and thirdly that the Union, as the most developed country, had a great contribution to make to Africa. It was said that we had now abandoned this attitude. That of course is not correct. The fact is that it is the States of Africa, in their eagerness to demonstrate against South Africa, and in trying to achieve their own purposes within the sphere of their struggle amongst themselves&#x2014; sometimes for greater support: the one group against the other&#x2014;that are not prepared to co-operate with us. They make it impossible for us to remove these suspicions although we try to do so. They do not accept aid from us. However, I will return to this point a little later in connection with the attack made by another member. All I wish to add at this <span class="col_3757-3758" refersTo="page_0505"/>stage is that surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not suggest that with his policy of White domination, as he states it to-day, the situation would have been otherwise? How could the situation have been different? Had the United Party been in power and had they told Ghana or Nigeria or Liberia or Ethiopia or any other African State that they, the United Party, believed in the domination of the White man in South Africa, does the Leader of the Opposition suggest for one moment that South Africa&#x2019;s situation would have been different? Surely that is what is nowadays defined as the policy of the United Party!</p>

<p>I would not take the risk because I know that the standpoint of the United Party, as put before the public from time to time, deviates according to what is expedient from time to time. I therefore refer emphatically to &#x201C;the standpoint as they state it to be to-day&#x201D;, but I do not believe for a single moment that the United Party if it were in power, and were brought under pressure, would not slip all the way down to &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; ultimately. Therefore I would not try their form of integration. The role of South Africa on the Continent of Africa would not be improved in the least by such a change of government and such a change of policy. There is no doubt as to what the people of the African states want in South Africa&#x2014;they want Black domination of South Africa, and they want that because the conditioning by the communist powers has taken place over a long time and the communist countries see in White South Africa the one big bar to their domination over Africa. Consequently, pressure will be brought to bear from the North, through Middle Africa, along the East and the West coasts, down to South Africa, if they can have their way. The sooner the Western world realizes this and begins to resist, not for our sake alone, but for their own sake, the better it will be for them. Therefore I say: If we are cut off from the rest of Africa at the present moment, so would any government be which was prepared to stand for White man&#x2019;s rule.</p>

<p>I must also add that when we are reproached with being out of touch with the world and when it is said that because we are now out of the Commonwealth, we do nothing (as was said by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition) and that we are even out of C.C.T.A., then all the hon. member&#x2019;s facts are not correct. For instance: we are not out of the C.C.T.A. What is true; however, is that it is being made very difficult for South Africa to operate within the C.C.T.A. But if that is true, then it means just this: that while South Africa is prepared and was prepared and will remain prepared to make its facilities available and, to allow the knowledge accumulated in South Africa on all technological matters to be used by other states of Africa, it is refused by these people against their own interests for other reasons than economic or technological reasons. Our assistance is refused for political reasons. Therefore it is not just to say that the Government did nothing and does do nothing. Why put all the blame upon us? Why not for a change get up in this House on the Opposition side and say: We are glad that the Government remains prepared to provide all the technical assistance that Africa needs and we, the Opposition think that it is wrong of those states to refuse to co-operate with the Republican government in spite of political differences. Why not for once take South Africa&#x2019;s side instead of the side of attacking African states?</p>

<p>Then the hon. Leader of the Opposition said that personal contacts would be useful, and in particular he referred to the statement of the Prime Minister of Nigeria that he would like to visit South Africa provided he was invited. Now I have met Balewa and have spoken to him privately and at the conference table while in London and tried to get a fair outlook from him on the South African situation, particularly in view of the discussions at the Prime Ministers&#x2019; Conference. My opinion is that he is not a moderate (as is suggested so often) with regard to relations between White and Black. I think he is wrongly described as such. He is a fanatic in respect of his own cause. I am not blaming him for that. Many of us are fanatics in our own cause. (Hear, hear!) If hon. members of the Opposition do not believe in their own cause to such an extent as to throw all their energy behind it and be fanatic to that extent, they will never achieve government. Only people who really believe in their cause and work for it and fight for it with everything they have, will achieve something. When I say that this man is a fanatic in his own cause, that is nothing to laugh about. It is foolish laughter. There are certain factors which we have to take into account. One is that this man did not either wait for an invitation in the ordinary way, nor did he approach us through diplomatic channels as one would expect from the head of a government. He threw out a public suggestion &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>What diplomatic channels could Balewa use?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He could, through his ambassador in London have approached the South African ambassador in London. In that way South Africa could have had the information that Balewa would like to be invited. The channels are open. But the Nigerian Premier did not follow that road. He threw out a suggestion, and not in a sympathetic manner. The Nigerian head of state threw out the suggestion, daring South Africa to invite him, while he was still continuing to <span class="col_3759-3760" refersTo="page_0506"/>show enmity towards South Africa in many ways. By his boycott movement, by even refusing the visit of a South African representative to the Conference on Tuberculosis which was held in Nigeria ten days ago. The Nigerian Premier exposed his attitude and this in spite of the fact that we were prepared to give of our experience to Nigeria notwithstanding the enmity shown towards us. We were prepared and are still prepared to let our experts go there and help. They refused to receive them. This same Prime Minister who refused expert technical assistance from South Africa and who instigated trade boycotts, who spoke scathingly of South Africa&#x2019;s policy, and who was prepared to say even now: &#x201C;If I go to South Africa, I go to help to turn the Government away from its policy&#x201D;, that type of man must be invited and brought to this country in order to achieve friendship! Have hon. members opposite no sense of what is practicable and of value? Have they no sense of the honour of their country and don&#x2019;t they realize that an invitation cannot be issued under such circumstances? I repeat now what I said to him and to others on London: If there are African states which would like to establish friendly personal contacts with us, we would like to establish contact with them. If they depart from the present attitude of enmity and give an indication of a desire for friendship, then it would be possible for us (at first not on an ambassadorial basis but through direct contact from time to time) to build up goodwill and co-operation. The form of contact could move further and further ahead as friendship grew. The African states are not prepared to follow that line as yet. When the Prime Minister of Nigeria says that he would be prepared to exchange embassies, it only means that we would have to accept (under those circumstances) not an embassy from one friendly state to another friendly state as is usual, but an embassy, with whom the same problems might develop which the Russian Consul-Generalship created formerly. We are not prepared to endanger South Africa and her relations with other people by introducing a source of discord and we are not prepared to endanger our relations with our own non-European people in South Africa by subjecting them to detractors in our midst. We are prepared to cultivate friendship with the other states in Africa, but it must be on a proper basis and as can be expected from nations who honestly wish to be friends.</p>

<p>Then I was asked: What about further African missions and further missions in the East. I am not going to reply to those questions. After I have dealt with this general principle of our readiness to build on a basis of friendship with such other nations and to face facts which might flow from that&#x2014;after I have given a clear statement of general government policy in regard to this matter&#x2014;I do not think I need enter into details of missions either from Africa or in the East. That falls within the scope of the hon. the Minister of External Affairs, and I think such matters should be brought forward under his Vote, if they are to be brought forward at all.</p>

<p>A further question put to me was: To what extent are discussions on mutual relations going on between South Africa and other Commonwealth countries? Are any further negotiations taking place with Great Britain and do they cover the protectorates? And then we had certain questions in regard to citizenship, etc. In regard to all this I want to say that at the present moment discussions are still continuing with the United Kingdom on our relationships, both those between us and with regard to the Protectorates, or rather the High Commission territories. Those facts that could be disclosed so far with mutual consent were disclosed some time ago, I think on 26 February, in a statement by the hon. Minister of External Affairs. It is quite true that since then the United Kingdom has placed legislation before the British Parliament in connection with matters on which they have to decide, particularly in regard to certain aspects of citizenship. It was necessary for the United Kingdom to deal with these matters soon in accordance with their Parliamentary Rules. In our case the situation is somewhat different. We were not forced to bring this matter to a head within the first few weeks of the Parliamentary Session. We are drafting the necessary legislation, but need legislation only in respect of certain matters, whereas the United Kingdom needed legislation in respect of more matters. That deals with the one factor. Another aspect of the matters raised is that we are first exploring the whole position with the United Kingdom in order to base on that our negotiations with the other old members of the Commonwealth such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc. When our legislation comes forward, it must deal not only as the British legislation does, viz. with relations between one country and another&#x2014;that is the United Kingdom and South Africa. Our legislation would have to cover the situation between us and various states. For that reason too we required more time. There are however, certain problems still outstanding. On those outstanding problems we cannot make any statements without the concurrence of the United Kingdom and until these matters have been fully settled to the satisfaction of both sides. We are at present also discussing with Rhodesia the matter of citizenship. All these negotiations do not call for a statement at this stage, but I do not think it will take very long before we will be able to place before the country an exact statement on the standpoint of the Government. Much of this will in fact be dealt with in legislation to be introduced here. Certain of these aspects must be dealt with under legislation of various departments, but a number of matters will be contained in an omnibus Bill which will also be placed before Parliament this Session. All this legislation is in the state of preparation even while negotiations are still continuing. More than that surely cannot in fairness be expected from me at this stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_3761-3762" refersTo="page_0507"/>The question was also asked whether the ambassador of Great Britain can remain High Commissioner for the Protectorates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I asked whether it would be desirable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is for the United Kingdom to say. My personal opinion, and I think that is the opinion of my Government too, is that it is not advisable. But it is a matter for Great Britain to decide on as she thinks fit. The reason why I think it is not advisable is that there may be clashes of interest. These High Commission Territories are now on the road to independence. They will have their separate legislative bodies. It may be that their interests and the interests of South Africa differ from time to time as so often happens between neighbouring territories. The Ambassadors of Great Britain, as all ambassadors, have the function of keeping up and developing friendship with the nations where they are stationed. If in exercising that function in respect of the nation to which he is accredited, an Ambassador is embarrassed by certain duties he has to perform in exercising other functions, this cannot be in the interests either of the country that sends him or of the country which receives him, or of those territories on whose behalf he sometimes has to operate. For that reason I say that I think the double function is not advisable, but it is for the United Kingdom Government to decide; he is in their service, not in ours.</p>

<p>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. There were some minor points, but I think they have been covered by my remarks. The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) asked whether I did not say that in isolation lies our strength in colour policy. I certainly did say that, but I am not sure that the hon. member gathered the import of my remarks quite correctly. I will try to repeat what I believe I said, and in any case intended to say. My attitude is this: If other states, all the other states or most of the other states, stand for integration and wish to force upon us a policy of integration, whereas we see our salvation, the preservation of the White man in Africa in some form of segregation, then most certainly it would be best for us not to try and satisfy, or link up with, the colour policies of these other people who differ from us so greatly, but to stand on our own two feet. Then we must, as far as that is concerned, accept the fact that we can only gain by isolating ourselves from those policies in which we do not believe, and which we believe will mean the disappearance of the White man&#x2019;s rule in South Africa. Our strength lies in isolating ourselves from such policies. If it could be said by the Lombard Bank that the British policy in Africa is dangerous, breaks down relations and is disadvantageous for their economic future and that therefore they wish to withdraw from Africa, then I say we should certainly isolate ourselves from that type of policy. I too condemn the British policy in Africa with regard to the White man, and I certainly would wish to isolate my country&#x2019;s policy in colour matters from that of the United Kingdom. I am convinced that our strength for ensuring our survival lies in that isolation. I have no hesitation in saying so. But that does not mean that we will be isolated as a state from all those other states. As I said before, I am prepared to take up the standpoint that you can have isolation in certain matters, with full co-operation in others. When the hon. member for Constantia says that if we have friends in other respects, why are we economically isolated from Africa and most of Asia, then of course it is quite clear that he is confusing two separate issues. We do not have friends in economic affairs in Africa apart from Portugal and the Federation. We do not have the friendship of Great Britain in terms of its Kenya and Tanganyika policy, and they do not have ours, and this cannot be because we disagree with them as much as they disagree with us. But that does not mean that if the Republic differs on such policy and is economically isolated in Africa or Asia at the moment&#x2014;or rather in respect of certain nations there, not even all&#x2014;that we have no friends in any context or anywhere. I think that was a wrong deduction made by the hon. member for Constantia, if I understood him correctly.</p>

<p>I also did not argue, as he thought, that colour policy can be isolated from all other matters. I fully realize that one&#x2019;s attitude on colour policy very often intrudes in other matters. We see that happening in sport now-a-days. We have seen that happening in the field of amusement; we see the outlook on colour and integration penetrating in various directions. But what I do say most emphatically is that in spite of such differences, or clashes on matters of colour, we are still basically friends with many nations and governments. I state as emphatically as I can that we are still basically friends with the U.S.A. and Great Britain, and I dare anybody to say that is not true.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia said that he was going to test whether this is correct, and he tried to test it by quoting what Mr. Plimpton said at UNO. He suggested that he would, by reading a number of quotations, indicate that the U.S.A. was officially against South Africa. In fact, the hon. member for Constantia, I think wrongly, said that these were the official views of the United States of America on South Africa. I do not think even that was correct. At most it could be fairly said that was an official&#x2019;s view on the colour policy which he was attacking at UNO. There is therefore a tremendous difference between these two evaluations of what happened, and in addition every single quotation he laid before us dealt with colour policy only and did not deal with our co-operation in technical, economical and many other matters. In fact it has been quite clearly stated in this country, I believe even by the U.S.A. ambassador in this country, that his country values the <span class="col_3763-3764" refersTo="page_0508"/>friendship between our countries in all those matters on which we do see eye to eye. That was the wise, generous and sympathetic standpoint to take. I think that in this Chamber we South Africans should repeat that attitude rather than to cast suspicion upon this friendship.</p>

<p>Then I think the hon. member for Constantia also said that we have not replied to this U.S.A. statement.</p>

<p>I asked whether you had replied.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, then I can make the statement that we certainly did give a reply through the Minister of External Affairs, and this very morning a report was laid upon the Table in which that reply can be found.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) asked me: What is the Government&#x2019;s plan in regard to the development of goodwill and friendship towards the states of Africa. He asked what action the Prime Minister would take, without having said what he thought might be feasible methods. I do not want to evade that question. I have already dealt with it to a certain extent by saying that when South Africa has to deal with the African states to-day, it must be under most inauspicious conditions. It is not very easy to develop goodwill, even when you wish to do your utmost for them without any advantage to yourself. It is very difficult to get in touch with them and to aid them. Therefore we have to take up this standpoint that we cannot concentrate to-day on trying to achieve direct contact and make trade or other agreements, or burden them against their will with the many forms of aid that we would be prepared to give. We cannot force that upon them. What we can do is to keep our own spiritual balance even if they are temporarily out of balance. In other words, we must remain prepared to give aid whenever they change their mind and their attitude. Whenever they are prepared to receive our assistance, we will therefore still be there as a mature state which, in spite of all that has happened before, will be prepared to co-operate or to give assistance, technically or otherwise. We have announced more than once through the Minister of External Affairs and myself our continued preparedness to co-operate once the other states give up the enmity in practice which they exhibit to-day, as well as their attempts to interfere in our internal affairs.</p>

<p>But then there is something else that can be done. That is: Let conviction as to the good intentions of South Africa towards her own non-White people, particularly its Bantu, grow by being seen in its actions. When hon. members attack us in connection with our Transkeian policy, or whatever it might be called, they must realize that they are attacking one of the only channels open to us through which to create goodwill in the rest of Africa. When our friendship and co-operation with our own Bantu increases as it is doing&#x2014;I say this with great conviction, especially after my recent contacts again with some leaders of the Bantu people&#x2014;I have no doubt that will gradually penetrate the minds of other people in Africa. Thereby a foundation will be laid which will help to retrieve any co-operation or friendship which has in the meantime been lost. Those are the lines on which I am sure we can accelerate progress in creating goodwill. We certainly cannot seek this by sacrificing our policy. There is indeed this one way in which we could get the support of all Africa immediately and that is to give one man one vote. Nothing less would be deemed satisfactory now. But if we were prepared to grant &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; in South Africa, we would thereby sacrifice the very existence of Whites, Coloured and Indians, and also sacrifice the masses of the Bantu people to the black dictators which would then arise. We would also in this way sacrifice the whole prosperity of South Africa as we know it to-day, and so harm all workers and families of all races, and all investors throughout the world. Then one could achieve friendship with Africa at one blow, but by doing that, nearly everybody would be losing all. We certainly are not prepared to pay that price for the friendship of Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) asked me to clarify what he called conflicting statements on the reasons for defence expansion &#x2014;supposed conflicting statements of the hon. Minister of Defence and myself. I cannot agree with him that our statements were conflicting statements. I dare say that I described the situation in calmer and less flowery language than the hon. the Minister of Defence did, but basically there is no difference of standpoint whatsoever.</p>

<p>There was a difference in the form in which I analysed the present situation and the way in which the hon. Minister of Defence sought to impress upon people what hon. members on the other side had been pleading for for years, namely, that it is necessary to build up the Defence Force to a greater extent. The hon. Minister of Defence expressed himself very vehemently in support of that desire. That is understandable. After all it is the task of the Minister of Defence to get the people of South Africa to realize the need for the development of a strong Defence Force. Hon. members on the other side have pleaded for that so often that they should surely support his strong appeals rather than attack us. But it is not correct to say that there is a fundamental conflict of opinion between us. Indeed I think the hon. member for Simonstown understated my standpoint and overstated, or over-interpreted the hon. Minister of Defence&#x2019;s statement. [Laughter.] I do not think there is anything amusing in suggesting that. For instance, I did not say that there is &#x201C; no possibility of attack &#x201D;, which were the words attributed to me, so I <span class="col_3765-3766" refersTo="page_0509"/>understood, by the hon. member for Simonstown. In fact I said that there always is a possibility. Otherwise the world would not be arming itself. There is the possibility of a communist world struggle developing. I said candidly that I did not believe it was imminent. But I did not say that it was not a possibility. In fact if it is not even a possibility, then the United States, the United Kingdom and France and all the other Western nations would not be arming themselves to the extent they are doing to-day. We are all arming ourselves against the possibility of such a conflict. It would therefore be an under-statement of my attitude if it were said that I expressed the opinion that there was no such possibility. On the other hand, the hon. Minister of Defence certainly did not try to indicate, by showing the extent to which South Africa was preparing itself, that there is an imminent danger of attack. When he gave certain information to a convention the other day, that information did not imply, as the hon. member for Simonstown apparently thought, that a large number of young people would be taken out of civil life and kept on a permanent basis in the army. All that he said was that there would be a certain number of battalions &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, 34 battalions at operational strength. This means that the number of young men who are trained each year and will be in different training camps, will be roughly 7,500. The other battalions would consist of those young men who had already passed through that course and who could, if mobilization took place, be immediately called upon and could immediately take part in operations. The expert opinion given me on this matter is that the training which took place before, when young men were trained, I believe, for a month or two or three months per annum in a training camp, was not sufficient and that they therefore had to receive six months&#x2019; training after mobilization before they could take part in operations. But my information is that the young men who go through the present-day full training course of nine months can upon mobilization at any time during the next five years immediately take part in operations. With the aid of short courses each year they are kept up to standard. I accept this expert opinion as more valuable than the opinions of interjectors, and therefore contend that in this particular case too, the hon. member came to a wrong conclusion. In counting our battalions for the future, we are not dealing with a large number of people who are taken out of civil life thereby decreasing their value to our economy. It is therefore also not correct to say that South Africa will continually be on a war footing. It will, however, be in a state of continual preparedness without at the same time detracting from the value of our young men in their civil occupations. I must also emphasize, together with other members on my side, that I am amazed that while we have always been attacked in the past for keeping South Africa in a state of unpreparedness, the Government is now all of a sudden being attacked for being over-prepared! How I am to understand that, I do not know.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) talked about the consequences of our departure from the Commonwealth and said that the cost thereof to us was not fully understood. These are generalities to which we are now becoming accustomed. When one analyses what South Africa&#x2019;s position either in or outside the Commonwealth could have been, this cannot be justified. Take, for instance, the economic position and the flight of capital to which the hon. member referred. The United Kingdom itself has had its balance of payments problems and also Reserve problems. It had to take special measures in order to save the country from great troubles in the same way that we here had to do. The United Kingdom&#x2019;s presence in the Commonwealth could not save her from that. How could it then have saved us? The hon. member said that our reserves increased &#x201C;a bit&#x201D; and that he was glad that the hon. the Minister of Finance could announce that our reserves had increased &#x201C;a little bit&#x201D;. That type of derogatory remark shows, I think, that hon. member cannot have thought very deeply about these matters, because the sensational increase in our reserves, which is to the greatest credit of South Africa, should not be underestimated in that manner. Another point he made was that South Africa&#x2019;s international position was worse than it would have been were she still a member. He said that if anything should happen and the Republic had to appear before the Security Council, it would not have the same support from the United Kingdom as it would have had, had South Africa still been a member of the Commonwealth. On that argument I beg to differ. The very simple reason for that is that we have a proven fact on which to base our opinions. This fact is well-known, namely, that when Mr. Macmillan came to South Africa both before we became a Republic or had left the Commonwealth he told us that the United Kingdom would not, in her own interests, be able to support us at UNO any longer as before. We were, in other words, given a fair warning before we had even become a Republic, let alone before we had left the Commonwealth. Our presence in the Commonwealth would, therefore, have been no safeguard for us. But what safeguard is it to Rhodesia to-day that she is in the Commonwealth when UNO seeks to attack her? To what extent is it not perhaps a danger for her to be a member, especially in view of the fact that a decision in her case is now not only taken on the value a certain line of action will have for herself, but also with full consideration of the implications any line of action will have for Great Britain as the backer of the Federation and guardian over parts of it? For this reason I say that, as far as the international position is concerned, we <span class="col_3767-3768" refersTo="page_0510"/>would have been no safer through being in the Commonwealth. There are other facts which prove this very clearly. I have already said before, that it was Ghana, India and other members of the Commonwealth, who were mainly responsible for much of our troubles internationally. Our presence in the Commonwealth gave us no protection against their attacks whatsoever. To say, therefore, that our position in the international world has become worse because of the fact that we left the Commonwealth, is I think patriotism of the wrong kind towards the former fatherland of the hon. member.</p>

<p>It was also alleged that our defence expenditure had to be increased as a result of our leaving the Commonwealth. But the Federation is within the Commonwealth and yet its expenditure on defence has increased! Is that because it is in the Commonwealth and has our expenditure increased because we are out of the Commonwealth? Take the case of Australia and of Canada. Their expenditure on armaments is increasing as well! And what about the U.S.A.? Surely the U.S.A. was compelled, just as we are, by world circumstances to increase defence expenditure? There is, therefore, no logic in the arguments of the hon. member as far as this subject is concerned. He also alleged that following upon our withdrawal from the Commonwealth, our sources of information have fallen away. That is true; but if, on the other hand, we had to submit to the aims of the Afro-Asian nations in order to remain in the Commonwealth and thus have certain sources of information left to us, then the price for that would surely have been too high. Moreover; the hon. member is a little pessimistic about the information we do get and possess. I am afraid that he does not realize that although information obtained through British sources in the past was of great value, we have since seen to it that other sources of information became available to us so that we do know what is going on in the world and are not left in the lurch to the extent that hon. member as well as the hon. Leader of the Opposition seem to think. The fundamental point, of course, is that if we had to purchase our membership of the Commonwealth at the price of doing what the Afro-Asian nations tried to compel not only us to do, but also tried to compel the United Kingdom to demand from us, while the latter did not want to interfere in our affairs, then our membership would not have been worth while. In actual fact, South Africa has picked up wonderfully in all directions since having left the Commonwealth and we need not despair of the future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) said that the Western world did not demand the handing over to Native rule of our country, but only wanted to act against racial discrimination. If the latter is true, however, then the Western World will not be satisfied with the United Party or the Progressive Party either, because in both parties&#x2019; policy there is flagrant discrimination since neither of them wants to accept the only principle which will remove all racial discrimination, namely, the principle of one man, one vote with absolute political, social and economic integration throughout. You cannot avoid social or economic discrimination, or political discrimination in some form or other under the policies of these two parties. Both of them have remnants of discrimination to a greater or lesser extent. There is no doubt about it that the Western World will not be satisfied with that, if her statement is correct. Let me add to this one more point, namely, that when only some political concessions are made, which is what she means, the Afro-Asian nations will not be satisfied. The Western Nations who are supposedly asking us only to make certain concessions, in order to make it easier for them to pacify the Afro-Asian States, will when they find that they cannot pacify these nations with limited concessions, not draw a line and say that they are now prepared to make enemies of the Afro-Asian States because they ask too much of South Africa! No; they will come with further demands for concessions. As a matter of fact, as much has been intimated to us. It is not a question of making room within which to manoeuvre. Rather is it a case of manoeuvring yourself into trouble. That is exactly what the hon. members opposite are doing. It is better, therefore, not to try these lady-like tricks because you are bound to get into trouble sooner or later!</p>

<p>I should like, finally, to deal with points made by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). He said that we apparently had no hope for the White man and that we exhibited a distressing form of defeatism. That must either be a casual remark, or a silly accusation, because nobody has any doubts that we on this side not only have the greatest confidence in South Africa, but that we are not prepared to make concessions which would sacrifice the White man&#x2019;s future, in order to entice others to support us now, as the defeatists opposite wish to do. Everybody on this side who has taken part in the debate to-day, took up the attitude that we must courageously make a clear stand in regard to what we believe in, and in doing so make quite sure that South Africa be saved, not only for the sake of the White man or for the sake of civilization, but also for the benefit of the other population groups as well. That has, basically, been our standpoint throughout. How anybody can call that defeatism, is beyond my understanding. I am afraid that the hon. member realizes that he and his colleagues are on slippery ground because every time they plead for concessions of whatever kind, they show that it is they who do not believe that South Africa can stand on her own feet. They are afraid and want to get others to support them and bolster up South Africa&#x2019;s defence. We, on this side, believe in South Africa and we know that the Republic is progressing in all directions beyond many of the expectations of our friends on the <span class="col_3769-3770" refersTo="page_0511"/>opposite side. We believe that South Africa has a great future, and that this future will become much greater much more quickly if only hon. members opposite would show a little less defeatism and more support for South Africa and the South African point of view and not always try to run her down as they were doing again in this debate to-day.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It was most interesting to listen to the reply of the hon. the Prime Minister and to hear him as the knight in shining armour coming to the defence of South Africa apparently against the Opposition. It seem to me, Sir, that it is time that we have a little more realism in this debate, and that it is appreciated that it is because we wish to defend and preserve South Africa, that we find it necessary to criticize the very bad Government we have to-day. We have heard the hon. the Prime Minister expounding his theories as to, I might almost say, the advantages of being outside the Commonwealth! In fact, he was trying to give us to understand that there have been no disadvantages in consequence of that fact. I suppose that is why our sugar growers have lost a couple of million rand and I suppose that is why the hon. the Minister of Defence has declaimed in the Senate about the difficulties he has in getting defence information! Or is this another case of disagreement between the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Defence? I suppose, Sir, that it is not because of our leaving the Commonwealth that certain sources of military information are no longer available to us and that Great Britain is not negotiating also on our behalf for participation in the common market. I also suppose that the various educational and technical exchanges which were available to us, are still available? You know, Sir, that when the hon. gentleman takes up an attitude of this kind, I find it a little difficult to appreciate that he is the Prime Minister of South Africa and not just a politician. I want to say that there seems to be quite clear differences between him and the hon. the Minister of Defence in regard to the dangers of an attack on South Africa. I should like, however, to thank the hon. the Prime Minister for having acted in a more responsible manner by having stated the position in regard to this issue more clearly and with a great deal more realism than was done by the hon. the Minister of Defence, For this the country is, I think, grateful to the hon. the Prime Minister. I also like to express to him my personal thanks for the replies he has given me in regard to the negotiations between the Republic, on the one hand, and the United Kingdom, the Federation and other Commonwealth countries, on the other hand. At the same time I should like to state that I appreciate that it is not possible for him to make a more detailed statement at this stage. We are, however, glad to learn that those negotiations are proceeding. In regard to the issue relating to relations of friendship between the Republic and other African states and states in the Far East, or in the eastern part of the world, it seems to me that we must conclude from the statements made by the hon. the Prime Minister that he accepts that while the policies of his Government are being followed here, there is no hope whatsoever of friendship with any state in Africa and also very little hope of friendship with any state in the Far East. The Prime Minister has said that his Government is ready and willing to enter into relations of friendship with states who are anxious to be friendly with the Republic and who have shown their willingness in that respect. At the same time, however, he said that there were no such, states so far. It seems, therefore, that we must accept that so long as this Government is in power, our worst fears will be realized, namely, that there is no hope whatever of the admirable policy statement which was made by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs five years ago, being carried out in so far as the Continent of Africa is concerned. The Prime Minister, however, went even further and suggested that if the Opposition was in power, there would also be no such hope. Well, Sir, if I am to judge from what the Tunku of Malaya said, that is just not true.</p>

But let us leave this matter and try to deal with some of the points made by the hon. the Prime Minister.

<p>Mr. Chairman. I do not think it is necessary for me to say more on this issue. The position to-day is worse than it was and the hon. the Minister will be the first to admit that this is so. He explains that on one ground, but there may be others. I believe that certain of these grounds are the actions of this Government committed during the period during which it has been in power. Let us now go a little further. The hon. the Prime Minister has also said that our case is continually being put. He knows very well that it is not continually being put because there have been occasions when we walked out of the Fourth Committee, when we have not answered, or criticized the evidence which was led on petitions which were submitted. In short, our case has gone by default on a number of occasions. This the Minister knows very well.

He suggested that if we had agreed to transmit petitions to UNO about S.W.A. we would have endangered our rights. I want to suggest that we were bound to transmit petitions to the old League of Nations and I want to suggest that it would have been perfectly possible for us to do that and save our rights. The tragedy with which we are faced, however, is that because we did not submit reports, the Committee was given an excuse to hear oral evidence because it was only in that way, it said, that it could get proper reports on South West Africa. To that extent we suffered a diplomatic defeat. I should like to go further and say that the suggestion was made that had we accepted the judgment of the World Court in 1950, we would have endangered our position as the attitude of South Africa all along had been that the UNO had no jurisdiction in regard to South West Africa.

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not only showing a smaller sense of responsibility every day, but also less courage. He came here this afternoon and asked the Government to enter into diplomatic relations with the states of Africa. He asked what the Government intended doing in that respect. From this side of the House he was questioned over and over again as to the African states with which he wanted to establish diplomatic relations and how he proposed to accomplish it. I am now charging him with a lack of courage to answer. For example, he lacks the courage to say whether he will enter into diplomatic relations with Ghana or whether he would like to see such relations entered into. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is now pretending to be reading. If he would only listen we may perhaps have more respect for his courage. However, he is not prepared to answer one leading question. That is why he is emerging from this debate with disgrace.</p>

He is not even prepared to mention one single African state with which he would be prepared to establish diplomatic relations. Then he comes along and says that the Afro-Asian countries are quite satisfied with the policy of his party. In this connection he mentioned the Tunku of Malaya because he had said that he would be satisfied with 10 representatives for the Bantu in Parliament. But was that all that he said? Did he only say that he would be satisfied with 10 Bantu representatives in Parliament, or did he also say that he would only be satisfied with that as a start? I challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to deny that his policy&#x2014;his latest policy&#x2014;is based on discrimination on the ground of colour.

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition lacks the courage to reply to that. Of course his policy is a policy of discrimination on grounds of colour. The Opposition also say that it does not matter very much whether the countries of Africa accept it, as long as it is accepted by the countries of the West. In this connection I also want to challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition <span class="col_3773-3774" refersTo="page_0513"/>to mention one Western country which is prepared to accept his policy of racial discrimination.

<p>I challenge him to tell us why that bank intends withdrawing its investments. Is it as a result of the policy of this Government? No, Mr. Chairman, it is as a result of the policy which that Party want to introduce in South Africa. What did the manager of the bank concerned say? He said he was withdrawing his bank&#x2019;s investments as a result of the mess in which Africa had been landed because of the policy of the British Government. And while such a big financial institution is going to withdraw its investments as a result of a policy which that Party also want to apply in South Africa, we find that other big financial institutions are prepared to make investments under the policy of the Verwoerd Government. Think of all the loans which were granted to the Union Acceptance Corporation, and think of the loans which Anglo-American obtained in Switzerland. In the rest of Africa, however, investments are disappearing directly as a result of the policy of the British Government. Is it responsible of the Leader of the Opposition to come here and to make such allegations in these circumstances? Mr. Chairman, during the past 14 years the discussion on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s vote has always been one of the most interesting discussions. But never before have we witnessed a more pathetic performance than that which we had from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and Party to-day.

<p>When my time expired, I was saying that the attitude of the Government was that UNO had no jurisdiction whatever in respect of South West Africa. If that is so, is it then a wrong quotation where Mr. Leif Egeland is reported to have said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moreover we have already conceded at the final assembly of the League of Nations in 1946, that the mandate would continue until other arrangements have been agreed to between the United Nations and the respective mandate powers.</block>

<p>Is it correct, or incorrect, that he stated that on behalf of South Africa at the final meeting of the League of Nations? In the judgment of 1950 we had a judgment which said that we were under no obligation to enter into a trusteeship agreement in respect of South West Africa. It also said that the United Nations was not the heir in law of the League of Nations, and that we should continue to submit reports concerning our administration of South West Africa and that the United Nations was a proper body to which these reports should be submitted. It seems to me that judgment conceded virtually everything we wanted, except the power to annex without further discussions at the United Nations. Here we are in a position, some 12 years later, where it does not seem as though our position has improved as the result of all the efforts of the hon. the Minister and the very fine efforts of certain of our representatives from time to time at that place, other than the Minister himself, whose work, I may say, we appreciate very much. But I do not believe that the position has improved or that it is as favourable to us to-day as it was at that time.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has asked me what I mean by a non-party or a non-political approach in respect to this matter. What I mean is this, discussion first and action afterwards, rather than action first and then recriminations from us because of the action taken without discussion. In other words, the position is this, that I think in every country of the world attempts are made as far as possible to get a bi-partisan approach in respect of foreign policy. That has not been possible in South Africa for many years and over many subjects because of the big differences between that side and this side of the House concerning membership of the Commonwealth. I had hoped that on this issue it might be possible for us to reach the stage where there could be discussion before action was taken.</p>

<p>Yes, I think it was an excellent foundation, for this reason, but I think that had there been discussion before many of the actions taken by this Government had been entered upon, it is quite possible that the Government might have been persuaded to see this matter in a different light.</p>

<p>But one point does remain outstanding, and that is the position in respect of the legal action. The Prime Minister has once again, as he has done before, said nothing on the issue, except that he regards it as unwise in the interests of South Africa to make any statement at all. In other words, we are now in this position that the Government is fighting a case for South Africa in respect of which the people have not been informed what the possible result can be either way, or what the possible effect of the judgment can be. Always we are told that should the Prime Minister give us that information, as any client could expect from his advocate or attorney in any law suit, that we shall be endangering the position of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am not asking what the attitude of the client will be if he wins or loses, but what will it mean if he wins and what will it mean if he loses, and we do not know that at this moment from the Government. We have never been able to get it from the Government, with the result that many interpretations have been put upon what the possible result of this case may be. I do not want to suggest the various interpretations at this stage, but I can tell the hon. gentleman that he would be most distressed if he knew some of the possible interpretations that are being put on the possible result of this case. And he is in a position to clear away those doubts and difficulties by making a clear statement to the people who, I suggest, are entitled to know what the result could be for South Africa. The hon. gentleman, I fear, is going to be silent on that issue again, I believe wrongly, and I believe that he is doing an injustice to the people by the attitude he is taking up. Now that clears the main issues which I raised this afternoon concerning the relations between South Africa and states or organizations external to the country.</p>

<p>I want now to pass on to certain particular aspects of the policy of separate development which I believe are of national importance. In respect of that policy the Prime Minister is the person most concerned, the person who has given form to it, the surgeon who presides at the dismemberment of the Republic of South Africa into a number of independent states. He has made his first incision in the Transkei area, but quite clearly incisions will not only have to be made there but also in other parts of the country. I wonder whether the public realizes the exact extent of those incisions and I wonder whether the Prime Minister can give us any idea as to what the extent of his activities is going to be. You see, Sir, there is not only the Transkei or the Ciskei to be dealt with in the Eastern Cape. There are also steps to be taken in the north of the Cape Province near Kuruman and Taungs, near the Kalahari. There are steps to be taken in Natal in the Umzimkulu-Harding area, around Umlazi, in the Tugela Basin, in the area of the Drakensberg, and at Thaba&#x2019; Nchu in the Free State and in the Transvaal where there are large areas which will still be affected.

Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition comes along again and asks that the hon. the Prime Minister <span class="col_3777-3778" refersTo="page_0515"/>should tell the people, and particularly the Opposition, what the result will be if the court decides against us or for us. How on earth can any person know to-day what the reaction will be?</p>

<p>I say that this is a clear sign to our enemies at UN: Go on, because it is the fault of this Minister. It is merely to encourage them to be far more hostile to South Africa because it is not their fault; it is not due to their prejudice and hatred but to the inefficiency of this Minister of ours. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition realize what a dangerous thing he is saying when he insinuates something of this nature? Does he know what harm he is causing South Africa? He must be able to realize it and yet he continues with this sort of propaganda. I want to lay this at their door. If there is more hostility towards South Africa then it is not the fault of this Minister; it is not due to our policy or because of the action of the hon. the Prime Minister, but it is as a result of the action of that party on the other side, and I want to prove it. I would like to mention a few examples.</p>

<p>When the Minister of Foreign Affairs went to Paris in 1948 to represent South Africa, what did the party on the other side do? The Minister joined battle there particularly with Mrs. Pandit Nehru, our strongest attacker, and what did the then Leader of the United Party do? He made a speech at Randgate and he told the world that the disturbances at Durban where the Zulus attacked the Indians&#x2014;and they gave the reasons why they attacked them &#x2014;were the first fruits of apartheid. And what was the result? The next morning Mrs. Pandit Nehru quoted that speech of General Smuts in order to attack the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>I want to mention a second instance. I am sorry that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) is not here. Dr. Malan rapped Nehru over the knuckles at the time because he interfered in our domestic affairs, by telling the Indians: Your only justification for being in South Africa is to make common cause with the Bantu against the White man. Dr. Malan rapped him over the knuckles and said that he should keep his nose out of South Africa&#x2019;s internal affairs. One would have expected every member of the Opposition to support the Prime Minister because he did not speak on behalf of the National Party but on behalf of South Africa. But what did the Leader of the United Party in Natal do? He attacked Dr. Malan. I am pleased that the hon. member has now returned to the Chamber. For the information of the hon. member for South Coast I contend that their party is the cause of the tremendous animosity towards South Africa, and the second example that I mentioned was the action of the hon. member when Dr. Malan rapped Nehru over the knuckles because he encouraged the Indians to make common cause with the Bantu against the White man. Then he did not as an honourable citizen of the country support Dr. Malan. No, he chose sides with Nehru and he warned Dr. Malan: You must not act in that way against Nehru because then you will be looking for trouble. Is this not grist to the mill of our enemies? Is this not telling Nehru: Attack South Africa because the Prime Minister is wrong?</p>

<p>I want to mention a third example. When the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs was on the point of leaving last year, or the year before last, one after the other hon. members on the other side stood up and asked the Prime Minister not to allow that hon. Minister to go alone; they asked that someone should be sent with him.</p>

<p>The speeches which they made at the time were not in the spirit of his needing assistance. They belittled him, in advance, in the eyes of the world, and I say that was a shameful action. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition comes along again and insinuates that it has been <span class="col_3779-3780" refersTo="page_0516"/>since this hon. Minister has been representing us there that the animosity has grown. In other words, they tell UNO and our enemies there: Carry on; this animosity towards South Africa is not your fault; it is not because of your hatred of South Africa but because of the inefficiency of this Minister. What is the purpose of this action? The United Party has utilized its machinery to put the National Party out of office. That is their purpose. They have not, however, succeeded in doing this in the usual way and they are now framing other plans. They wish to put us out of office by means of a conflict from outside. That is what they want. The hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) said straightforwardly: &#x201C;We see no chance of getting rid of the Nationalist Government. What South Africa needs is a jolt from outside.&#x201D; That is what they want. He let the cat out of the bag. Therefore they besmirch this Government and do not hesitate to undermine us. That is why they have no scruples in inviting foreign enemies to give South Africa a jolt so that they can come into power. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I was pointing out that if the policy of separate development was to be carried out, there would have to be certain large areas in the other provinces and also in other parts of the Cape which would have to be separated for the purpose held in view by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has taken the line that the areas set aside for the Natives have been theirs historically and that we have been fortunate, perhaps, in the fact that they have existed. But it does seem to me that the overwhelming majority of those who support the policy of the hon. gentleman, regard the Transkei as the testing area. I wonder whether they realize that the population of the Transkei is approximately only one-tenth of the Bantu population of South Africa, so that if the matter in respect of the Transkei can be brought to a successful conclusion they have only got one-tenth of a policy and there are the further nine-tenths which still have to be solved in the other parts of South Africa. It should be pointed out that the density of the population in the Transkei is already 82 per sq. mile, compared with 27 per sq. mile for the rest of South Africa as a whole. It should also be indicated that the population of the Bantu areas as a whole is approximately 63 per sq. mile. I know that many of the areas concerned are, or could be, profitably farmed; that they are areas which, were it not for neglect, would be fertile. That gives some idea of the very deep problem with which one is faced in regard to this matter, and it seems clear that the Prime Minister is going to have to step into the various other provinces perhaps to a far greater degree than the public realizes. I wonder whether the public realizes that in the Cape, when all the areas already indicated have been acquired, only 10 per cent of the Cape will have been set aside for Native areas? When you come to the Transvaal the figure will be 24 per cent, and in Natal it will be 35 per cent. The trouble is that the public is in the position to-day where it has little knowledge as to where those areas are to be found. In the Transvaal already there are some 84 separate Native settlements scattered in a northerly are between east and west. If this policy is to be carried out, they have to be consolidated. The Prime Minister is leaving a very large section of the country in complete uncertainty as to what is held out to them for the future, not only in the industrial sphere but the farming community as well. The question is whether our economy can afford any more strain or more uncertainty than we have already had to put up with in the past. It is no longer fashionable in Government circles to speak of no more development in the established areas and limiting the development to the borders of the reserves, as was the case in the past. It is no longer fashionable because they find out that the voters supporting them do not like it and they are finding it a very tricky problem to disperse industries to the borders of the reserves and at the same time keep the areas in which there are declining mines and failing industries happy and supporting the Government.</p>

<p>Let us take one example. What is the future of a little town like Wakkerstroom, a town with a wonderful water supply, near the sources of about five rivers, the population of which in the last ten years has fallen by approximately one-third, an area in which industrial land is available at about R2 per morgen. Here you have an area that is not within 30 miles of a Native reserve, the limit apparently accepted at the moment for the establishment of border industries. What sort of attitude will be taken up by the Government in order practically to deal with the problem of that kind when vast sums have to be spent for the development of industries both on the borders of the reserves and inside the reserves themselves, to carry anything like the population envisaged by the Prime Minister? The Prime Minister made it perfectly clear that he is prepared to stand rock-fast by his policy in the face of external pressure. I presume that means that he will stand rock-fast also in the face of internal pressure, no matter how much the economy of the country has to be bent and broken to carry out that policy. But what are the effects already? There is uncertainty in the industrial areas and also in the agricultural areas. There are many areas where the farming community are unwilling to make permanent improvements because the Prime Minister is quite incapable of defining the boundaries of those future Native areas. I wonder whether that has anything to do with the fact that in the Transvaal the building plans have fallen from over R50,000,000 in 1959 to a mere R32,000,000 last year? Such estimates are incalculable, but it is quite clear that they must be playing a part. You find yourself with manufacturers all over the country who have no certainty that what is outside the reserves to-day will be outside the reserves to-morrow. What certainty have they that a border industry to-day will be a border industry to-morrow? The boundaries <span class="col_3781-3782" refersTo="page_0517"/>of these areas have not yet been defined. Despite our pressure on the Minister concerned and the Prime Minister, we have as yet had no clear indication of what the position is. How do the farmers stand in areas like Louis Trichardt, Tzaneen, Nelspruit, Zeerust, Lichtenburg, Pietersburg and the borders of Rustenburg, where nearly 500,000 acres will have to be bought? In the Cape the farming community has incentives because of the Orange River Scheme, but you may find that because of the tremendous labour force required that scheme may result in far more economic integration than we have at present. In fact, welcome as that scheme is, we may find that it itself is another factor rendering it difficult for the Government, if not impossible, to carry out this scheme. If there is uncertainty in the Transvaal, there is also uncertainty in the Cape and in Natal. In regard to Natal, we find that no less than 35 per cent of that province will be under Native control when the areas are finally indicated. That is, of the 33,000 odd square miles, some 12,500 square miles will be under the control of the Native population. What one is faced with there is 113 separate units covering over 3,000,000 morgen of land. It includes Native areas, White areas, Crown land, game reserves, all grouped together cheek by jowl, and it will take great trouble to sort it out. What we want to know also is what is the future of the Tugela Valley, perhaps potentially South Africa&#x2019;s richest industrial area, if it could get a proper scheme of development.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I will be pleased if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will give me his attention for a few moments. He asked a series of questions which have often been asked in connection with what he calls the boundaries for the future. He knows very well that this is a matter of a process which will take place over a period of time. He also knows that process can be accelerated and hastened and facilitated when we also have authorities there such as we now have in the Transkei, and that with the co-operation of those authorities we will be able to effect consolidation in this regard very much more easily. However, I want to put this question to him very clearly. Sir, I object to the custom by which a member is always prevented from listening when one wishes to discuss something with him. With a view to the questions which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has asked, I want to ask him whether he wishes to suggest that he is of opinion that the amount of land which will eventually be needed for the Bantu people is too small? From his questions I deduce that this is what he contends. I also want to ask him whether the objection which they raised at their congress when they broke with the Progressives is one which they have now dropped and whether they now agree with the Progressives once again? In other words, must we continue to comply with all the requirements of the 1936 Act? Is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition prepared to reply to this question? We must know where we stand with the Opposition in connection with this question because there is something else which emanates from the policy propounded by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville which disturbs me. They advocate a strong middle-class, a land-owning class of Bantu who must own land in the White areas. The Leader of the Opposition must tell us very clearly: In the light of the objection which they lodged at their Bloemfontein Congress, that not one further inch of land should be purchased to give effect to the 1936 Act &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, I know about the tail which they added to it, but that was only a bluff; the Progressives cut off that tail. With a view to that standpoint which they adopted, that not one further inch of land should be purchased to comply with the provisions of the 1936 Act, they now state that they wish to bring a land-owning middle-class Bantu into being who must own land in the White areas. We must have clarity. They do not wish to buy one more inch of land to give effect to the provisions of the 1936 Act but they wish to bring a strong, land-owning middle-class of Bantu into being in the heart of the largest industrial area in South Africa. These are things which the United Party, and in particular, the hon. Leader of the Opposition, has to reply to, because when one listens to their back-benchers, there are so many policies that one does not know where they stand. I hope that while this question is under discussion and while the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has asked all those questions in which he makes out that amount of land is too small, he will give a clear reply because the questions which he asked are again going to be used at UN to prove that we are committing an injustice toward the Bantu. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must give us clarity in regard to these two matters before this debate ends. Then we will also know where he stands. We have every right to ask this because while he has expressed the most severe criticism in respect of these Bantu homelands, on the other hand he must put his own policy and the only policy which has as yet been put is that which I have just mentioned. They object to the implementation of the 1936 Act but at the same time they wish to bring a strong, land-owning Bantu class into being in the heart of the White industrial areas.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the second half-hour. Last night we had passed over to certain aspects of the policy of separate development which we regarded as being of national importance and worthy of the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister. I had indicated that the Prime Minister, in his capacity as surgeon presiding at the dismemberment of the Republic, should define the areas for us on which he intended to operate with greater accuracy and that he should also indicate to us the boundaries of the areas to be affected, that is the boundaries of the future Bantustans. I point out, Sir, too, that the Transkei involved only about one-tenth of the Native population and therefore only one-tenth of the policy, and that nine-tenths were still to be implemented. I also indicated that while the area of the Cape which would be affected would be only about 10 per cent, that of the Transvaal would be about 24 per cent and that of Natal about 35 per cent and I touched on the difficulties of consolidating the various areas involved. I pointed out that in the Transvaal there were 84 separate units, and 113 in Natal. I indicated that for these very reasons there was tremendous uncertainty in both agricultural and industrial spheres, more particularly in the areas with undeveloped potentials such as the Tugela Valley in Natal. I was promptly taken to task by the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg), who does not seem to be here this afternoon, who wanted to know whether I was implying that the areas set aside were too small because the population density was so high and who wanted to know whether <span class="col_3785-3786" refersTo="page_0519"/>the United Party was for or against the further purchase of land for the Native population. He knows as well as I do what the position is and that is that it depends on the purpose for which the land is to be bought. But while this party stands by the undertakings given at the time of the 1936 legislation, we are so opposed to the creation of independent Bantustans and the dismemberment of the Republic that we are not prepared to support the purchase of land for that purpose. He said nothing to dispel the many uncertainties in which Government policy is still shrouded, uncertainties which in our opinion are having a serious effect on the economy of the country at the present time.</p>

<p>It was for that reason that I wanted to raise with the hon. the Prime Minister how he viewed the future of the Tugela Basin under the authority of an independent Zulu state&#x2014;the basin of a river with a mean annual run-off twice that of the Vaal River at the Vaal Dam. It would be unwise to ignore the possibility that such a Bantu Authority might give priority to the employment of its own people should development take place there, either with South African money or money raised, as envisaged by the hon. the Minister of Finance in reply to the Budget, from external sources. These matters may be dismissed as hypothetical but an answer to them must be sought and an answer must be given if uncertainty is to be avoided, because the hon. the Prime Minister has made it clear that he is serious in the dismemberment operations with which he is engaged, and nobody would have foreseen ten years ago the extent of the growth of African nationalism or the growth of virility in the emergent African states. Sir, I have indicated that the consolidation is a serious matter creating uncertainty in the Transvaal and in Natal, perhaps more than in any other province, and therefor perhaps the remarks of a businessman in the Cape as to the difficulties in this province, which is to be the least affected, may be indicative of the concern which must be felt in the other provinces. Here we have a speech from the President of the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce only last week&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why is it that with such favourable attributes, South African businessmen are not yet prepared to project their ideas into the long term and put into operation large-scale development plans? My object is not to attack the Government&#x2019;s basic policies, but I must point out as a businessman that developments within the framework of that policy are creating uncertainties and apprehensions which can and do become serious deterrents when a man contemplates expanding his business or embarking on a new project. For in addition to the normal risks involved the businessman must assess a set of abnormal risks, and it is by way of reducing these abnormal risks that I believe the Government can do much more than it is doing at the present time.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to outline Government policy and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This move has raised many questions and uncertainties in relation to future business policy in South Africa, the answers to which the Government shouldn&#x2019;t leave in abeyance.</block>

<p>Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was by no means unconceivable that the not too distant future would bring about an African common market from which South Africa might be excluded. In that event independent Bantu territories might well decide or be compelled to ally themselves with hostile African states.</block>

<p>Sir, these are the uncertainties which are worrying the business world, and the question is what the Prime Minister is going to do about them. Then in an article in <i>South African Industry and Trade</i> in this very month they speak of the lack of confidence and the vital necessity for the development of our economy, and they say that can only be obtained by putting the policy into effect and by giving it in detail with all the relevant facts of cost. &#x201C;Giving it in detail with all the relevant facts of cost.&#x201D; May I underline that statement as one of the biggest causes of uncertainty and one of the issues which we have raised time and time again with the Prime Minister without getting any satisfaction at all. They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is the language of the businessman. Every business project begins as an idea, but it is not until the details of the operation are available that a decision can be made whether or not it is a practical proposition.</block>

<p>Sir, I know what the reply of the hon. the Prime Minister will be. He will say there is no complete security, that there is no infallible stability in the world to-day &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; But how many of the difficulties of the President of the Chamber of Commerce mentioned in this article are not being created by the hon. the Prime Minister himself? I think that is the point that we are up against. Where in the world do you have to ask questions such as those of the following type: What White entrepreneurs will be allowed into the reserves to help in their development and which will not? Will the Bantustans be ceded a share of the customs revenue of the Republic, like the Protectorates, if we continue to enjoy a complete customs union? Will Bantu industries in the reserves be free to import White technicians and skilled artisans, if they need them, from outside South Africa if necessary? Will Native workers in the Bantustans be free to organize into trade unions? More important still, will Native workers in the border industries <span class="col_3787-3788" refersTo="page_0520"/>be allowed to form trade unions? Will goods, produced perhaps under privileged conditions in the reserves or on the borders, undermine the markets of our established industries? Sir, let us take another query which arises. Will job reservation be applied in border industries? Will job reservation be applied in industries in the reserves or will it not, and what is the effect going to be?</p>

<p>You see, Sir, the businessman has to make his forecasts; he has to consider what his profits are going to be, and when he does not know what the position is, it is extremely difficult for him to estimate for the future; and in dealing with his profits, one of his big problems is taxation. One wonders in what direction the Government&#x2019;s policy is going to lie in the respect of taxation in the future. There is no doubt at all that millions will be involved in developing the reserves and in developing border industries. We have already had a very large additional sum this year to be devoted to Defence. We know that in a country like Swaziland, for instance, &#x00A3;80,000,000, invested in the last 20 years, has only given employment to about 15,000 males in mining, timber and sugar. Our problem is to give employment to at least 50,000 men each year inside the reserves in non-agricultural industry alone. That is now accepted as a conservative estimate. It is estimated that will cost approximately R2,000 per head. On the borders of the reserves it would seem, if the plan is to be carried out, that we have to absorb 28,000 Natives annually for 10 years. That is not my figure; that is the figure of Dr. S. P. du Toit Viljoen, now Chairman of the Special Committee dealing with border industries. This is how he put it a few weeks ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The major problem in the development of border industries is whether the development will be rapid enough for secondary industry to absorb 28,000 Native workers annually for the next 10 years and prevent stagnation.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, 50,000 Natives a year inside the reserves, 28,000 Natives a year outside the reserves. Just what investment potential is left for the rest of South Africa, when the South African taxpayer is responsible very largely for his contribution to the development of border industries and of the reserves? I think one has to ask in which direction is the emphasis of Government spending in the future going to be&#x2014;Bantustans, Defence, Orange River schemes, Education, Social Welfare? This year Defence is taking the lion&#x2019;s share and it will have to take it for some years to come unless the money which is being spent at the present time is going to be entirely wasted. We know that the hon. the Prime Minister has admitted to plans for the development of the Bantu areas, of which he has only touched on the fringe so far; we know also that he has indicated in the past that apartheid would have advanced adequately if after 50 years approximately equal proportions of Whites and Bantu have been reached in the European territory. I think we are entitled to know from the Prime Minister something which we have never been able to get out of him before, and that is his estimate of the progress that is being made towards that target. I think we want to know his estimate of the future rates of absorption of the population in Bantu areas. We also want a more detailed estimate of the costs involved. He has differed from the estimates given in the various reports; he has given his own estimates, and we still do not know where we are. I think when people are called upon to pay out an extra R40,000,000 for Defence, they have the right to know what sort of future it is that they are expected to defend.</p>

<p>We know that there is going to be competition for spending in the future between Defence, between development, between the Government&#x2019;s big plans, and the Orange River scheme. Sir, if you look at what has been happening in Australia, a country with much less in the way of natural resources than this country, you find that they are at least 25 years ahead of South Africa in both science and industry.</p>

<p>Not enough money is being spent on education and technical services to meet these difficulties.

We know that the development of the Native reserves was underspent by about R5,000,000 last year, but I have a very shrewd guess that it is due to the fact that the hon. the Minister was short of trained people and technical services.

<p>Sir, listen to these childish interjections which are indicative once more of the fact that they realize that their Government has failed in this sphere, has failed completely in this sphere. We had a motion from a Government member only a week or so ago drawing attention to the shortage of technical people in South Africa, but he limited it too much because he did not make provision for the question of administrative people; he did not deal with the difficulties we have in other spheres. Sir, this is going to be one of the greatest problems with which we shall be faced, because the rate of development of our standard of living has not kept pace with the rate of development of standards of living in other Western countries, and the result is that not only are we unable to attract men from overseas, but they are attracting away some of our best brains in South Africa and we are not getting them back again.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, you have the claims of social security. We have not even got a national pension scheme, and the taxpayer is being faced with a stiffer and stiffer hill to climb every year. What are the answers of the hon. the Prime Minister in his scheme for development in respect of those matters?</p>

<p>May I sum it up? I have asked him for a clearer exposition in respect of the development of the Bantu areas, particularly in Natal and the Transvaal. I have asked him for a more detailed estimate of the rate of absorption capacity of those Bantu areas; I have asked him for his latest assessment of the rate of progress towards the target of equal proportions of Black and White living in White areas by the end of this century. I want to know something about the rate of development of border industries and the possibility of their absorbing the number of Native work-seekers annually which was envisaged in his scheme. I want to know what is being done to combat the depopulation of the platteland, with the lack of attention of development in underdeveloped areas away from the reserves.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member speaks of the Orange River scheme. I would hate to disillusion him, but he knows what the total population is that is involved in new farming areas; he knows probably how much work that will give and he knows that will nowhere near meet the requirements of South Africa&#x2019;s growing job-seekers annually. Or has he not studied the scheme?</p>

<p>Sir, I have asked the Prime Minister to give serious thought to the question of manpower and how that is going to affect the development which he envisages, particularly the crippling shortage of skilled workers. I pointed to the uncertainties which it is creating and in view of all these difficulties I wonder whether I can ask the Prime Minister or urge him to take a less rigid approach to this problem in South Africa. Sir, wisdom is simple; folly keeps a groove, and with the vast problems with which we are faced in South Africa it is more than possible that no one system will offer a solution. It is more than possible that we will have to seek an answer to our race problems that combines the most constructive elements of self-administration and co-administration. I would say that our problem was to try to reconcile steadfastness with change, unity with variety and realism with high idealism. But where do we get with the hon. gentleman? He has recently been having a conference with the representatives of the Territorial Authority of the Transkei over their new constitution. I pointed out before in this House the danger that along the road which he envisages for them he will find that these developing areas will fall within the purview of Article 73 (e) of the Charter of the United Nations. I have had a reply from the Prime Minister which seems to indicate that he was taken by surprise, and it seemed to me that he had not seriously considered the issue. It seemed to me to my amazement that the Government had not seriously considered the issue and that they did not really know what the position was in that regard. What was most interesting was the reaction of the Minister of Finance when he replied to a debate a little later in this Session when he seemed to have second thoughts on the issue and said it would need reconsideration. I think what we should inquire is whether this matter was considered when the constitutional talks were held. I think we should know whether it was considered and taken into account and whether the new constitutional proposals were examined against that background. Must we understand that the Government approved these proposals which are now to be placed before the Territorial Authority; must we understand that it is satisfied that development on that road will not involve this particular article of the United Nations Charter? I think that anyone who has <span class="col_3791-3792" refersTo="page_0522"/>studied that particular constitution will be struck by the extreme vagueness of the provisions providing for the compensation of the present White inhabitants of the reserves. At no time so far have we had a satisfactory answer from the hon. the Prime Minister on that issue. The most that we had was an interjection from the Minister of Transport that they would be compensated, and that is about what their constitution says, that in certain circumstances they will be compensated, but that is all. We are left in a state of complete uncertainty as to the future.</p>

<p>I would like it, I think, to the last Coetzee.</p>

<p>Sir, that concludes the main issues connected with the policy of separate development but I would like to refer to one or two other issues of national importance which are having an effect internally.</p>

<p>The first of those concerns the possibility of Great Britain joining the European Common Market and our representation at those talks. We have had the reply that the diplomatic representative of the Republican Government in Brussels is a trained economist and that he is going to be assisted by another economist on his staff. But, Sir, there is no indication of the direction in which the Government&#x2019;s thoughts are moving. Are they still obsessed with the idea that we might get associate membership? Is the idea to move in that direction with all its difficulties, or are they seeking separate treaties and a separate consideration for certain of our articles which will be covered by that agreement? I think the hon. gentleman could do much to relieve the uncertainty and worry of many of our businessmen and industrialists if he could give us an idea of the direction in which his mind is working on that issue.</p>

<p>There is one other issue which I feel I should raise at this juncture and that is the issue of Radio South Africa. We heard complaints before in this House about the policies being followed by that Corporation. We have had replies which we have regarded as entirely unsatisfactory from the Minister who is connected with that issue. Now we have seen reports, which we believe to be accurate, of the resignation of a large percentage of the staff engaged in that Corporation&#x2014;trained and experienced men who have been with it over many years&#x2014;and once again we seem to have received no satisfaction whatever. Other speakers can expand this issue, but it seems to me that a stage has been reached where we have to consider what the future of that Corporation should be in South Africa.</p>

<p>I think one should get some idea as to what the plans of the Prime Minister are in that regard.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we have two new ministerial appointments. The Minister of Finance in his memorandum indicates that the following new Votes have been included: A Minister of Indian Affairs and a Department of Community Development. I think we should have from the Prime Minister exactly what is envisaged by the creation of these two new Departments, and exactly what their functions are going to be. He has tried to tell us from time to time, most unsatisfactorily, what his plans are in respect of the Cape Coloured people, but we have had little or no idea as to what his plans are in respect of the Indian population. We now have a new Minister of Indian Affairs and I think it is incumbent upon the hon. gentleman to tell us what the functions of that Department are and what his plans are for the future development of the Indian people.</p>

<p>Then we hear of this Department of Community Development. &#x201C;A Department of Community Development has been established for the purpose of settling fully-fledged communities in their respective areas.&#x201D; What are &#x201C;fully-fledged communities&#x201D;? To whom does this apply? Does it apply to Europeans, to Coloureds, to Bantu, to Indians? What are &#x201C;fully-fledged communities&#x201D;? I think we are entitled to know.</p>

<p>Then a new Department of Information has been created which has taken over all information services previously provided on Vote. [Interjections.] I think that the &#x201C;hear, hears&#x201D; of hon. members opposite indicate how dissatisfied they were with the way information services were run in the past. I think they welcome a change, any change, rather than what they had before. But I think we are entitled to ask whether there is any hope of success from this Department while the Government continues to follow the policies it is following at the present time. I think we are entitled to ask whether there is any hope of the restoration of confidence overseas while we have statements such as we had from the Minister of Defence over the past few weeks. I think we are entitled to ask whether information services will ever do the country any good at all while Ministers continue to make the statements they do and this Government follows the policies which it has been following. I think we are entitled to ask the Prime Minitser in this regard what he hopes to achieve with this Department, and whether perhaps it would not have been best to forget about it altogether and to save the money for the people of South Africa.

<speech by="#luttig">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LUTTIG</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday I listened attentively to every speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. We noted that last night he announced that he had come to the second point of his attack, namely the consequences of separate development and, as he called it, the dismemberment of the Republic. I was under the impression that he would continue discussing that subject this afternoon and <span class="col_3793-3794" refersTo="page_0523"/>expatiate further on it. But when towards the end of his speech this afternoon he dealt with the Common Market and Radio South Africa and the portfolios of the new Ministers, I did not know with what point of attack the Leader of the Opposition was then dealing.</p>

<p>However, I want to confine myself to the first statement he made yesterday, in regard to the so-called dismemberment of the Republic. There he had in mind the important policy announced during this Session by the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to self-government of the Transkei. In the past we in South Africa have performed great deeds, and mistakes were also made, but a wise Providence wove those mistakes and those great deeds into a colourful pattern which we call the history of South Africa, and from that history we derive our strength. Not only in respect of the Whites of South Africa is it of the greatest importance to us, but also in respect of the non-Whites, and for that reason I want to advance an argument this afternoon which has not been used here yet in regard to the constitutional development of the Transkei, namely the so-called historical argument, to prove that what was said by the Leader of the Opposition, namely to accuse this side of the House of being responsible for the dismemberment of the Republic, is a matter which had its origin in the dim and distant past. What is of importance is that when the challenge was issued to this Government and to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister did not retreat in the face of that challenge but accepted it and gave heed to the course indicated to us by history. I may almost say that if there had to be partition in South Africa, it is only the implementation by this side of the House of a policy determined by our history. When in 1866 the Transkeian Territory was abandoned and it was decided not to incorporate it in the Colony, Theal, the well-known historian, in Volume V of his well-known work on the history of South Africa, exclaimed in surprise that by means of this step the then Governor and the Colonial Secretary &#x201C;have thrown away a golden opportunity of pushing forward the border of the White immigrants without doing the slightest harm to the Black immigrants&#x201D;. To this subjective conclusion arrived at by Theal, the well-known Prof. Walker replied in his &#x201C;History of Southern Africa&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Theal might lament that the Governor and the Colonial Secretary have thus thrown away a golden opportunity, but others would rather rejoice that they have virtually saved for the tribesmen the vast bulk of the present-day Cape Native Territories that lie between the Ciskei and the Natal frontier, the one and only really extensive Native reserve area at the disposal of latter-day exponents of the policy of racial apartheid.</block>

<p>This is what Prof. Eric Walker said in the latest edition of his well-known work, &#x201C;History of Southern Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the chapters in which Theal dealt with the annexation of the various Transkeian Territories, he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The whole territory abandoned by Sir Philip Woodhouse had thus come under the government of the Cape Colony.</block>

<p>But then follow these very significant words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The three blocks of land termed magistracies (Transkei, Tembuland and Griqualand East) could more properly be termed dependencies of the Colony than parts of it They were not represented in Parliament, their civil laws, except when Europeans were concerned, were not those of the people living west of the Kei and there was no possibility of settling White men in them in sufficient numbers to raise the Bantu occupants to a state of civilization.</block>

<p>In despair he then exclaimed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That opportunity had been lost for ever.</block>

<p>In other words, even after the annexation of the Transkeian Territories it never became part of the Colony as such.</p>

<p>The next important step in the constitutional development of this to us very important area was the putting into operation of the well-known Glen Grey Act of 1895 by Cecil John Rhodes. He called it &#x201C;A Native Bill for Africa&#x201D;, and in regard to the effects of this measure Walker states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Transkei Native law was fully acknowledged and there good administration and a steady expansion of the Glen Grey council system had given the Bantu security for their lands and training in local government.</block>

<p>Thereupon followed the measures by General Hertzog and his Government, and on that again followed the measures applied by the present Government, viz. the well-known Bantu Authorities legislation. Therefore what I want to indicate here is that what happened in regard to this territory in the past was aimed at its eventually becoming a self-governing area. And what this Government has done was to recognize that was the trend of history and to give implementation to it Now I want to mention one further instance to prove how deeply in earlier years this impression had already taken root in the minds of our statesmen. In a very important speech made by General Smuts in 1917, which has not yet been quoted in this House, he used these significant words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More than 20 years ago, as many of you may remember, an experiment in Native self-government was begun by Rhodes in the old Cape Colony, which gave local institutions to the Natives in the Glen Grey Reserve. That principle has been extended over a large <span class="col_3795-3796" refersTo="page_0524"/>part of the old Transkei territories, and so successful has it been that when we came to framing the Act of Union an appendix was added about the future administration of the Protectorates when they should become incorporated in the Union. This appendix was largely the work of our chairman, Lord Selborne. He fought with extraordinary tenacity for that appendix, and I am not sure, although I did not see the importance of the matter in those days, whether in the distant future the South Africa Act will not be remembered as much for its appendix as for its principal contents.</block>

<p>In other words, what General Smuts says here is that the Protectorates which were established set an example for future policy in the Union of South Africa. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I am not going to deal with the laboured argument of the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig), who tried to show how General Smuts supported the idea of sovereign independent Bantustans years and years ago. He might even have gone further back into history. The truth of the matter is, and those of us who lived with General Smuts know it, that the old gentleman would turn in his grave, and so would his confreres, if they realize the kind of arguments that are being adduced to-day to support this Government&#x2019;s policy and the meaning that is being attached to speeches which he made in a different context and under different circumstances entirely. Indeed, Sir, I find it curious to-day, the intense enthusiasm and support for the late General Smuts which is being kindled in the breast of National Party members as we hear their speeches from time to time, how they realize how wrong they were during the General&#x2019;s lifetime, and how they failed him instead of supporting him. They clothe him now with all the virtues with which he can be clothed, but they still don&#x2019;t follow his creed and his policies. They still oppose his policies and they can find no good reason why they follow this wretched policy they are following to-day.</p>

<p>I was pleased, however, to see that after my hon. Leader sat down, he was not followed, as usual, by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) with his Nkrumah diplomacy, because that is how we have become to view his contributions to some of these debates. Sir, we feel that it is not by chance that he follows the Prime Minister. We don&#x2019;t know whether the hon. the Prime Minister arranges for him to speak immediately after him so that he shall act as a foil to the Prime Minister in the speeches which he makes. It certainly is a wonderful comparison which we are able to make when we listen here in a quite objective manner to the fulminations of the hon. member of Vereeniging, many of them of very little consequence and not appertaining to the issue before us. But what we are concerned with is this that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speeches and the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s speeches shall be read and that they should be followed by an hon. gentleman like the hon. member for Vereeniging and that the eyes of the world shall be directed at the Nationalist Party and its philosophy, not only through the words of the hon. the Prime Minister, but also through the words of the hon. member for Vereeniging. What a picture to paint to the world of the viewpoints of the Nationalist Party.</p>

He is no blushing back bencher when it comes to putting forward his point of view.</p>

<p>In my limited time I should like to develop a few points and I want to come again to this question of the boundaries of the proposed Bantustans. We have tried to get some information from the Prime Minister in this regard in the past and we have failed completely. We see in the Estimates this year an amount of R2,000,000 for the acquisition of further land for the purpose of the Bantustans. It is suggested that there be 500,000 or 600,000 acres of Crown Land taken over, but that land be purchased to the extent of R2,000,000, purchased to add to the Government&#x2019;s concept of future independent Bantustans. Where are the boundaries to be drawn? You see, Sir, in South Africa we hope to have, and it is the policy of this side to have, one economy&#x2014; that the various people, whatever their race, whatever their station in life, whatever their social status, may contribute to the economy of South Africa, one economy, and that the Bantu in the reserves or the Bantu on the farm, the Coloured people, the Indians, the White man, will all contribute to one economy for South Africa. But when the hon. the Prime Minister comes with his proposals in regard to the Bantustans and fails to determine where the boundaries are to be set, and we get an hon. member like the hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) telling meetings of farmers that they should sell their land to the Native Trust &#x2026;</p>

<p>We are in this position that continually we get information, reliable information which we test here in Parliament, of the offer of farms here and farms there and farms somewhere else, and as these farms are purchased and as negotiations <span class="col_3797-3798" refersTo="page_0525"/>proceed, so do we see vast areas becoming imbued with the idea among the White farmers that their days are numbered, that they will have to go, and the Government does nothing whatever to set their fears at rest. This is again a case of the creeping paralysis and this Government&#x2019;s Kenya policy. The White people and the White farmers in those areas are expendable. This Government is doing nothing to set their fears at rest, or to show them that here in South Africa they can find their own permanent domicile, develop their farms, spend vast sums as some of them have already done, and others proposed to do so as to develop their farms without the fear that their farms are going to be taken over, not necessarily through direct negotiation, but because someone in the vicinity may be hard up for the time, perhaps not being able to pay the taxes to the Minister of Finance, finds that he has to sell a part or all of his farm, the Native Trust takes it over, and the rot has set in. The moment that first step is taken, the neighbours immediately get frightened. We. have seen it happen over and over again in South Africa. They are going to be on the edge, on the boundary. I have a boundary with a Native reserve, I have lived on that boundary all my life. I know exactly what it is to be a boundary-farm between a White area and a Native area. I know all the petty nuisances and so does the hon. member for Vryheid and other hon. members&#x2014;the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) who does not live in his constituency any longer. He knows the petty annoyances and serious difficulties that those farmers have to deal with. I ask again: Where is the boundary to be drawn? If one looks at Natal, as my hon. Leader has pointed out, 25 per cent of the province is to be handed over to the Bantu. What a jig-saw puzzle of Black and White! With more than 250,000 Indians thrown in! They will be looking for a Hindustan. Of course the Coloured people are rather like the nursemaid&#x2019;s baby, very small in number, and it does not matter very much what happens to them. I think that is the Government&#x2019;s attitude. They do not worry about the Coloured people in Natal. The Coloured people in Natal are getting no consideration whatsoever. They are simply ignored because they only count 30,000. Now the Government says &#x201C;Consolidation&#x201D;. There can be no consolidation; it is absolutely impossible in the jig-saw puzzle of the various landholdings under the ownership of the various racial groups in Natal. There can be no consolidation at all except in the case of Zululand. I want the Government to tell us quite frankly where they propose to draw the boundary, particularly in the case of Zululand. Is it going to be south of the Tugela? Are they putting the Tugela basin in a Bantustan? The Tugela valley is the biggest potential industrial undeveloped area in South Africa. Where does the Government intend to draw the boundary? What is to be the relationship across the boundary when once the boundary has been established? We saw recently the case of Ganyile. Are we to have perpetual Ganyile boundary cases between the Transkei and Natal for example and the Transkei and the Cape and the Transkei and Basutoland? Or will the Transkei and Basutoland be permitted to get together and form a Bantustan of their own? Will they be allowed to join up? Let me repeat what we all know, the point of contact is the point of friction. Your boundaries are the point of friction and they have been so since 1877, since the old boundary wars here in South Africa. And the Government is going back again to create the very conditions under which those boundary wars were fought. The hon. members for King William&#x2019;s Town and Albany know all about these boundary wars in their immediate past history. Those conditions are being re-created by the Government deliberately. They even go so far as to create a separate citizenship for the people who will be on the other side of the boundary. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat blamed me for having quoted from a speech made by Gen. Smuts, and the hon. member says it was made under totally different circumstances. But now I want to put it to the hon. member that although I am quite aware that in his well-known speech in 1946 before the Institute of Race Relations Gen. Smuts adopted a course which to-day we regard as having indicated the course of integration, I want to challenge the hon. member to prove where Gen. Smuts ever deviated from the basic views he expounded in the speech he made in 1917. He never deviated from them until the end of his life. Therefore I have the greatest liberty in quoting Gen. Smuts. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The appendix laid down that the Native territories in South Africa should be governed apart from parliamentary institutions of the Union and on different lines which would achieve the principle of Native self-government.</block>

<p>And then he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus in South Africa you will have in the long run large areas cultivated by Blacks and governed by Blacks &#x2026; while in the rest of the country you will have White communities, which will govern themselves separately according to the accepted European principles.</block>

<p>These views expounded by Gen. Smuts in 1917 are now being further implemented as the result of the practical application of the policy of this Government as announced by the Prime Minister, by a speech made by the well-known Lord Hailey, who on 23 February in London expressed himself as follows in regard to the announcement of the policy of granting self-government to the Transkei&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are no longer under any form of compulsion to hand them (the Protectorates) over <span class="col_3799-3800" refersTo="page_0526"/>to South Africa. We had an understanding that we should do so, and there was such a promise, but never a contract. All that has now come to an end.</block>

<p>And then follows this important sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless I think there is a new possibility for the future, because South Africa is now giving one of its large Native areas, the Transkei, a form of self-government. If it is a satisfactory form of self-government to the people of the Transkei, and not unsatisfactory for the inhabitants of the Protectorates, we may possibly arrange for them also to be placed on such a basis. <br/>I know that will require adaptation on both sides, and in the beginning there will be opposition to it in the Protectorates, but I think that with goodwill on both sides it may possibly be arranged that they will in future stand in the same relationship to South Africa as the Transkei will stand.</block>

<p>I have therefore indicated how from the very earliest times in so far as this particular area is concerned history has indicated the course in the direction of self-government, and I have shown how it fits in with the views now expressed in the speech of Lord Hailey.</p>

<p>What about the policy of incorporating the Protectorates?</p>

<speech by="#luttig">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LUTTIG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has repeatedly expressed his opinion on that point, and surely it is not necessary for me to repeat it. I just want to advise the hon. member to read more of the speeches of the hon. the Prime Minister, and also the Leader of the Opposition. A whole number of the questions put to-day by the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister have already repeatedly been replied to by the Prime Minister in this House. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said to-day that he shared the anxiety of the industrialists in South Africa in regard to the development of self-government for the various Bantu areas. But all the Leader of the Opposition has done was to increase the uncertainty by repeatedly putting questions the answers to which have already been given in this House. He has contributed nothing towards removing the uncertainty.</p>

<p>I want to give an example of that. We are now only in the initial stages of the constitutional development of the Transkei. Now the Leader of the Opposition already wants to know what is going to happen in the Tugela Basin. We still have to discuss the Transkei constitution in this House. There are quite a number of matters which still have to be arranged in that regard. But now the Leader of the Opposition wants to know what will happen one day with regard to the Tugela Basin. Much of the uncertainty which exists will be removed as soon as the relations between the Republic and the Transkei have been cleared up, which will happen in the near future. One simply cannot go faster than the Government is going now. Will not the Leader of the Opposition abide by it, knowing that many of the problems will in fact be cleared up? He again had much to say about the demarcation of the borders. That point has repeatedly been dealt with by the Prime Minister who clearly stated that it was a matter to be determined between the two states. We will be guided by the same principle when we negotiate with the other areas. But now already the Leader of the Opposition wants a blueprint for the whole of South Africa in respect of what may happen during the next 50 years. That is a very unreasonable question. As I said in the beginning, we are giving expression here to the voice of history and morally we have done the right thing, and therefore I believe that all the uncertainty and doubts which the Leader of the Opposition sought to create to-day will disappear like mist before the morning sun, and this step will prove to be the soundest step which could be taken in the interest of South Africa as a whole, particularly because it had its origin in the dim past.</p>

<p>Nothing the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig) has said will convince this House or the country that Gen. Smuts in fact envisaged these separate Bantustans and the Transkei being a separate state. The hon. member took my Leader to task for ask-ink questions as to the future of the Bantustans, the position of the boundaries and their relations with the Republican Government. He says that the hon. the Prime Minister will give us the answers in due course after negotiations with the new state. But what we fear is that not only the Nationalist supporters, but the whole country will find they have bought a pig in a poke if they accept this Bantustan plan of the Prime Minister. Sir, the initial stages of the carrying out of the policy of establishing these separate states, these Bantustans, have now been reached, and a constitution has been prepared for the Transkei, and although we have not been given the terms of this constitution by the hon. the Prime Minister, the Press apparently has managed to get the details from the Recess Committee appointed by the Territorial Authority to go into the question. Now we know that not only have Government officials been assisting the Recess Committee in the preparation of this draft, but the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and also the hon. the Prime Minister have interviewed this committee, and have no doubt given them some guidance. In fact the Recess Committee in its report thanks the officials and the Government for assistance given and the patience shown. I have the full details here now of this constitution. In considering the constitution, I just want to say that it is all very well for hon. members opposite to view this matter in a detached way, as an experiment to be carried out in some foreign country. But it is impossible for me or anyone living in the Transkei, or for any White or Coloured person living <span class="col_3801-3802" refersTo="page_0527"/>in an area which may fall within the boundaries of a future Bantustan to view this matter in that detached way. Sir, the Africans through their Territorial Authority, their chiefs and their headmen, have been consulted in regard to the terms of the constitution, but the White people, the Coloured people and the Africans living outside the Government locations in the Transkei have not been consulted at all. The White people have their associations, their civic associations and their farmers&#x2019; associations, they have their municipalities, but no Minister has consulted them at all as to their position in this future independent state. We, the White people, and the Coloured people will have to accept what is agreed to by the Prime Minister and the chiefs and headmen of the Transkei. It is impossible and difficult for even educated Bantu to discuss this matter in the Transkei amongst themselves while the emergency regulations prevail. They do so with dire consequences.</p>

<p>He should make himself better acquainted with the position there before he opens his mouth. This is a matter affecting people vitally. How is the constitution going to affect the White people and the Coloureds? As far as limited control over their own affairs is concerned we have no quarrel with that. In fact, that is the policy of the United Party under our federation scheme. That was also the policy of Gen. Smuts when he led the United Party. [Interjections.] Of course it was his policy. His policy was to allow the Bantu to develop local government and Gen. Smuts stated that in no uncertain terms. In fact, Gen. Smuts&#x2019; policy was to give the Representative Council executive power; he said so before he went out of power; he was going to give them more executive power; he was going to give the former Bunga more and more control over their own affairs. This history of the policy of the United Party as related by the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig) who started with the Glen Grey Act&#x2014; was quite right. But the Glen Grey Act was not passed by the Nationalist Party. The old Bunga system was not established by the Nationalist Party. That was the policy introduced by the governments long before the Nationalist Party was thought of. Dr. Hertzog, Dr. Malan and Mr. Strydom, the other leaders of the Nationalist Party, never suggested to the country that their policy was the eventual independence of these states. The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) asked the hon. member for Mayfair, if this had always been the policy of the Nationalist Party why did Dr. Verwoerd, the present Minister, or the other leaders of the Nationalist Party want to incorporate the Protectorates in the Union? What was the good of incorporating them if you were just going to make them independent again? Obviously the intention was to bring the Protectorates in to the Union and to keep the Union as one whole. Where the policy of my party differs to-day from the policy of the Prime Minister is in this respect. [Interjections.] Of course it is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;it was not Dr. Malan&#x2019;s policy. Our two policies differ in this respect: Although we are prepared to allow the Bantu in the reserves to develop self-government they will at all times remain an integral part of South Africa and that is why we offer them representation in this House of Parliament. We want to give them representation here because they will always remain full citizens of this country and they will always come under the sovereignty of the Union Parliament. Where we differ also is in regard to the development of the reserves. We propose practical development, Sir, and our policy is to encourage White capital and White initiative to take part in that development on a permanent basis so as to enable the area to carry a much larger proportion of its population, and incidentally to bring prosperity to all the inhabitants of the area. The more development the Whites are able to encourage the happier will the future of the Africans be. With our long and happy association with the Africans we are sure that we can proceed together along lines of co-existence to a bright future to our mutual benefit. But what are the prospects under this Government&#x2019;s policy? To begin with I do not believe that there will be any appreciable industrial development. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development himself has admitted that in no country can more than 25 per cent of the population exist on the land. That has been the experience in all countries. If that is so, to make the Transkei viable and not dependent on the Republic for its bare existence, employment must be found in secondary and tertiary industries for over 1,000,000 people and for their natural annual increase. With the assistance promised by this Government under the five-year plan and under its Development Corporation scheme, I cannot see that happening for many, many years to come. Admittedly under this Government&#x2019;s plan of assistance some of the Bantu will reap benefits. They will be able to open shops and small industries. But the tempo of development will be slowed down and the masses of the people will not benefit at all. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was tempted to rise at this stage to tell the hon. member who has just resumed his seat how little he knows about the Transkei where he evidently lives. He started off here by making a plea for the Bunga as really being an excellent system, which was not the creation <span class="col_3803-3804" refersTo="page_0528"/>of the National Party, but on which the Opposition wanted to base all their ideas for development. Now, what was the Bunga? Was the Bunga really a sort of Bantu Parliament? Was that the method by which the Bantu of the Transkei were enabled to govern themselves? Nothing of the sort. Not only was it an advisory body, although it could be developed into a controlling body if that was the intention, but its composition was such that it was largely a body controlled by the Whites. The Bunga had the Chief Native Commissioner as the chairman. It also had the Native Commissioners as members &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But it was Gen. Smuts&#x2019; plan to reform it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Gen. Smuts intended to retain the Glen Grey Plan, if what the hon. member says here is true. The Bunga itself had to develop in so far as its functions were concerned. The Bunga therefore had to develop on the basis on which it was established. I repeat that the Bunga consisted of a White chairman, the Chief Native Commissioner, and in the front benches were all the Native Commissioners, and on the back benches sat the Bantu themselves. I myself attended it, and on those occasions it was very clear that it was the White administrative officials of the Department and of the Trust who exercised control. Those hon. members opposed it when we introduced development (which the hon. member now says would in fact have taken place), namely in the direction of a body controlled by the Bantu! He himself opposed it. He opposed the system of Bantu authorities. But what has the Bantu authority system done? It really brought about a stage of development which the hon. member now wants to tell me Gen. Smuts had in mind, namely by the Bantu having their own chairman there, by the Bantu becoming the exclusive members of this body and by this body, apart from advisory powers, being given certain administrative powers of control. That hon. member was even opposed to that development. I am therefore not surprised that he is opposed to the further stage of development. But what I want hon. members to understand very clearly is that this Bunga was nothing else but a mixed body in which the officials had most of the say. That was probably good enough when the Bantu were completely undeveloped at the time the Glen Grey system was established, but in this modern era it is certainly not good enough.</p>

<p>That is the first thing I wish to point out to the hon. member, namely that his plea for the Bunga rests on a very weak foundation. Then the hon. member further said that the information which the public has obtained thus far in regard to the so-called constitution &#x2014;which, however, is not a constitution yet but a draft report&#x2014;they obtained from the Recess Committee. That is quite correct, but it had to be so. Because what is happening at the moment? What is happening is that the Territorial Authority of the Transkei appointed a Recess Committee to direct a request, or rather, to work out the details and to submit them to the next meeting of the Territorial Authority, on the basis of which it could direct a request to the Republican Government for further constitutional development. In other words, what is happening at the moment is that the Recess Committee, like a Select Committee which is changed into an ordinary committee during the recess when Parliament is not sitting, is busy preparing a report for submission to its own parent body. In the process of framing the proposals which it wished to submit to its parent body, that Recess Committee consulted us. The members asked us for the assistance of our officials; we did not give them that assistance of our own accord. We gave them that assistance at the request of the Committee. The Committee also asked for an interview with the hon. the Minister and with me to obtain advice on the proposals which the members of that Committee were to submit to their own body. If this body approved of those proposals, they were then to be submitted to the Government as an official document for the first time. I advised them. For example, at their most recent meeting I advised them to have a larger percentage of elected representatives as against chiefs than that provided for in their previous draft. I therefore gave them advice which I thought was in their own interests. But this fact does not make that document of theirs mine to make public, either in Parliament or anywhere else. Moreover, this is not necessarily the final request which will be made to the Government and which will then form the basis of what I shall have to submit to Parliament. Because what they have drawn up thus far as a provisional report is a report of what they are asking the Territorial Authority to submit to this Government as a request. If the Territorial Authority accepts it just as it is, that automatically constitutes their request. On the other hand, if the Territorial Authority wishes to change it at all then that amended document will be submitted to us as the official document for the first time. For this reason I have no document at my disposal which I can reveal to Parliament or to anyone else. If the Recess Committee wishes to make its proposed report public, that is its own affair. After all it is its own report and if before submitting its report to the body which appointed it, it makes its report public in advance, then that is also its affair. However, I can well understand why the Recess Committee is doing this. It is doing it because it is consulting its own people. To the best of my knowledge the Recess Committee is consulting the Bantu of the Transkei, both within and outside of the Territory and obviously therefore the document must become public since the members themselves are engaged in mutual consultations. It is not my function to consult either the Bantu of the Transkei or those outside of the Transkei on behalf of that Committee. That <span class="col_3805-3806" refersTo="page_0529"/>is their affair because it is their report. All that I did was to advise them when they asked me for that advice. The hon. member has also levelled the accusation&#x2014;or so at any rate it appears to me&#x2014;that as far as the Government is concerned it has not yet consulted the Bantu either within or outside of the Territory. That has nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>Then the reply which I have already given covers that allegation of the hon. member, and that is that it is not for me to consult them. This Recess Committee is working on its own report and it consults those whom it considers should be consulted. However, as far as my knowledge goes, now that it has reached the preliminary report stage, it has announced its intention of consulting the Bantu in its own area as well as the Bantu in the White area&#x2014;whether it be in Umtata or Port Elizabeth or in Cape Town&#x2014;before it submits that report to the Territorial Authority.

<p>I do not intend answering that question because it is not my wish to interfere in the deliberations of the Territorial Authority or those of the Recess Committee. I was quite prepared to advise these people on the question which they put to me. When that body makes its request to the Government the Government will then consider the request and if on the grounds of that request the Government frames a Constitution for the Transkei for submission to this Parliament, that Constitution which it submits will then show the extent to which it is prepared to comply with that request. It is obvious that this is the only correct procedure and if hon. members think that I am going to allow myself to be tempted by their questions to depart from the correct procedure by anticipating that request and the deliberations of the Authority in some way or another, even before any request is forthcoming, then they are making a very big mistake.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said, however, that the Whites and the Coloureds in the Transkei were not consulted. In the first place, if the Recess Committee wished to consult the Whites living in the Bantu-controlled area&#x2014;that is to say, the traders and similar people living there over a wide area&#x2014;that was its affair. For that matter, there was no reason for me to consult them. Moreover, all our voters have been consulted on this policy through the medium of elections. Furthermore the Whites within the White area, including Umtata, are not affected by this situation because, judging from all the statements made, those areas will remain White areas. We have stated very clearly that future developments may affect them in the course of time. However, everyone has known for years that the Bantu policy of the Government will result in the Europeans in the Bantu areas being affected by these developments because, for the sake of White civilization generally in South Africa, we can no longer allow a continuance of the higgledy-piggledy state of affairs that we have had to deal with in the past. It was always stated clearly and in a completely candid fashion that in the process of development the Bantu areas would become Black more and more because the Bantu would obviously take over the positions amongst their own people in order to do the work which the Whites are doing there at the moment. The rest of South Africa, White South Africa, needs that White manpower so badly that there can be no doubt as to what will become of those Whites. There is a very great need of their labour, of their co-operation and of their services, no matter in which sphere they may be employed, and they will be well looked after. It was quite wrong of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) therefore to do what he did, namely, to say that what we are applying here is a Kenya policy.</p>

<p>We are not applying a Kenya policy in the Transkei. There is a radical difference between the manner in which the British Government has summarily left the Whites of Kenya to their fate and the way in which the Republican Government in its estimate of all that the future holds takes into account its White citizens. After all, not only has the White man in Kenya had to put up with the constant decline in the value of his assets but where he was given certain assurances regarding compensation for those assets he is uncertain to-day whether those assurances will be met and, if so, how many of them will be met. Moreover, those people will have no real say at all in the government. What is the position here? In the first place we are in the fortunate position that because of the way in which this development <span class="col_3807-3808" refersTo="page_0530"/>is taking place, the Bantu leaders of the Transkei do not express themselves as do the Black leaders in Kenya by saying that they actually want nothing to do with the Whites. We find that these Bantu say, &#x201C;These Whites have been living amongst us and near us for a very long time; we need one another so much that we want to remain on the best of terms with these Whites.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I believe it and I want to ask the hon. member for Transkeian Territories whether he does not believe it too. I want to come now to what the hon. member for South Coast has just said. He is the man who accuses us of oppressing the Bantu. He is the man who objects when we say that we do not believe in an integrated community. He trusts the Bantu. He even wants to absorb the Bantu masses into one state together with him; he wants to sit with them in one Parliament; he wants to sit with them in one Government. He will trust them under all those circumstances. However, when the Government gives them independence and accepts them as neighbours, then he looks upon them as enemies. What confidence can I have in the sincerity of the hon. member for South Coast in respect of the Bantu?</p>

<p>I contend, therefore, that in the first place we have to deal with this one factor that the Bantu of the Transkei wish to associate on a friendly basis with the Europeans living there. In the second place, however, unlike the United Party and the hon. member for South Coast, I accept the fact that one will not be able to maintain permanent harmonious relationships if the European in the Bantu area remains a co-controller and co-governor of the Bantu area and its people. In terms of our policy, therefore, we provide that all those Europeans, other than in the case of Kenya, will continue to exercise their rights as voters but only as citizens of the Republic. They will continue to cast their vote for this Parliament and not for the Transkeian parliament although they are living in that area.</p>

<p>Not off the hon. member. She will never take care of them. It is a fact, therefore, that in this way, in contrast to the Kenya policy, provision will be made for these persons to exercise the vote in respect of an area as long as their destinies and survival remain bound up and connected with that area.</p>

<p>The next question that is of importance is what will become of them if they have to clear out. The persons in that territory who are officials will not, as under the Kenya policy, simply be left in the lurch if either they have to resign or if they are dismissed or whatever the case may be. They all remain public servants of the Republic and will receive promotions and transfers in the service of the Republic. When their services become redundant in the Transkei, their employment within the Public Service of the Republic will be assured. We need all these people. There is therefore no uncertainty in this regard at all. In the case of farmers who still have farms within that area or in White spots, as at Umtata, the hon. member for Transkeian Territories knows very well that, just as in the past, the manner in which such land will become Bantu land has been determined. That method is one of purchase, under arbitration if need be, although this has never become necessary. They receive fair compensation. When land is bought from a farmer in a White area which is surrounded by a Bantu area, or in a released area, that land is valued in the proper way. The owner of that land is even paid a percentage above the market value. That is usually added to the price as compensation for inconvenience and loss. In other words, the farmers are also being looked after. Those people who are serving in other spheres, in professional spheres or whatever it may be, if they can no longer practise their profession there, can always return and occupy similar posts in the Republic of South Africa. As distinct from the Kenya policy, therefore, under which Britain left the Whites of that area completely in the lurch, as the process of substituting the Bantu continues, the Transkei policy &#x2014;as it is called&#x2014;will afford complete protection to the Whites who are remaining behind there in the meantime. In the meantime the White person retains his civil and political rights and exercises those rights in the neighbouring area throughout the whole period. He can submit his interests for safeguarding to the Republic through his representative. To maintain, as the hon. member for South Coast has done, that we are dealing with a Kenya policy, a policy of leaving in the lurch, is correct in so far as he is criticizing Britain, but is incorrect in so far as he tries to level the same criticism at the Republic.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast went on to allege that we were trying to claim General Smuts unto ourselves and that he found it interesting that we were protecting General Smuts. I am afraid he did not understand fully what members of my party meant when they referred to General Smuts. We differed and will continue to differ from General Smuts in respect of a great many things. However, in respect of certain matters concerning the colour policy General Smuts now and again said something which is in complete conformity with our approach.

We do not quote General Smuts in an attempt to claim him unto ourselves but it is an attempt to get hon. members opposite to measure their present-day ideas with the yardstick which they say they hold in such high regard.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member and Helen Suzman were once members of the same party. I am therefore talking about their joint inheritance. The attitude which General Smuts adopted in the past forms a common background to those hon. members. They are like the human being who descended from the baboon&#x2014;they subsequently developed in different directions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast also placed great emphasis on something which fits in with one of the principle points raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. member said that they wanted to know where exactly the boundaries of the Bantu homelands would be&#x2014;not only in the case of the Transkei, but in the case of any other area which may become a homeland. I shall deal with that point in a moment. Before I do that I wish to deal with one of the reasons which the hon. member for South Coast advanced. I have to do so because that reason is completely false and warped. He said the farmers, particularly the farmers of Natal, were in a miserable position. For example, provision is made in the Estimates for R2,000,000 for the acquisition of additional land. He says they want to know where the boundaries of the future Bantu homelands will be, otherwise land will continually be purchased on a loose footing adjacent to the Bantu homelands, something which disturbs the farmers greatly because nobody knows when and where he may become a boundary farmer. Had boundaries not existed already, the policy of establishing Bantu homelands would not have existed.</p>

<p>Even if the United Party had been in power, it would have been necessary, under the 1936 policy, to purchase land in the released areas in order to fulfil the promises. Not a penny of the amount which appears in the Estimates, and not a penny of the amount which it is intended to place on the Estimates for the purchase of land, may be used for any other purpose than the purchase of land in the released areas or, in conformity with existing legislation, as has been done all these years, to remove Black spots and to pay compensation. In other words, we are not dealing at all with the purchase of land within areas where, since 1936 when the United Party was in power, the farmers did not know to what they would be subjected. It is absolutely incorrect, therefore, to suggest that land will be sold and that the farmers should be frightened because it will be done under the policy of establishing Bantu homelands. What is happening&#x2014;and I repeat this&#x2014; is that every penny which is spent, is being spent in terms of the 1936 legislation, legislation for which they are responsible and for which the hon. member for South Coast is co-responsible. He knows that land is only purchased within released areas. He is therefore trying to frighten the farmers of Natal unnecessarily. I am strongly under the impression that since the hon. member for South Coast has had the fall out with the Progressive Party about the purchase of land, he is levelling charges left and right so that people will perhaps think that he had good reason for his unwise actions at that time.</p>

<p>What about consolidation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that. At the moment I am dealing with the accusation&#x2014;and I wish to rub it in hard&#x2014;that R2,000,000 has been made available for the acquisition of additional land, but that this is to be used in order to place farmers in an uncertain position because those purchases will include purchases which they could not have foreseen until the policy of establishing Bantu homelands came into existence. I emphasize that is not the case at all. Any land with which any Member of Parliament has been concerned by trying to persuade people to make their land available had to be in a released area particularly. Members of Parliament are, therefore, only doing their duty when they persuade farmers who live in a released area to do their duty in terms of the 1936 Act. They have to exert themselves to let these sales take place, to point to the advantages which will accrue to the country, what the obligations are, and that the prices which the farmers will get are reasonable. In other words, any recommendation which is made is not an attempt, in promoting the policy of Bantu homelands, to exert unfair pressure on the farmers, which is the impression which the hon. member for South Coast is trying to create.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for South Coast were to say that approximately one-third of Natal will be handed over to the Bantu, that is one of those unfortunate facts which we have been talking about all these years, namely that there is such a large Bantu area in Natal. We are not creating a Bantu area there; it is there. When the hon. member causes confusion between Zululand in the broad sense, including the White and non-White areas, and Zululand in the sense that it is the area which is really claimed and occupied by the Bantu, I cannot help it if he confuses those two conceptions in order to make people suspicious. When we talk about the area of the Zulus which has to be managed by the Zulus, in other words, the area which falls under their territorial authority today, <span class="col_3811-3812" refersTo="page_0532"/>we are only dealing with the actual hereditary area of the Zulu as it exists to-day, and we know where its borders are.</p>

<p>That brings me to the question of consolidation which the Leader of the Opposition has asked me about. The way in which Bantu areas can be consolidated is not to join all Bantu land together, wherever it may be, by purchasing all White-owned land in between and thus obtaining a unit. As in the case of the removal of Black spots, the method is to purchase an area which already borders on to a Bantu area and to exchange it for those areas which are situated further away, as in the case of a Black spot which is again converted into a White area.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Even though it is not a released area?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but let me just finish my argument. The method is not, therefore, to deprive the White man of large sections of South Africa and to add those on to the Bantu area, but consolidation will take place by joining Bantu areas together by means of exchange and in co-operation with both White and Bantu. It has been exceedingly difficult to do that in the past because as far as the sale of areas which constituted Black spots was concerned, the Bantu have often strenuously opposed that. However, when a Bantu community wishes to have its fellow Bantu near to it and advocates the exchange amongst its own people so that suspicion and incitement are avoided, our chances are much better. If that happens, as we have already experienced, it is easy to effect consolidation. Consolidation of the Bantu areas is not a new conception; it has been taking place over the past 30 years.</p>

<p>To-day the hon. member for South Coast talks about the miserable position in which the border farmers live. It is true that the border farmer is faced with problems and difficulties, but when you are dealing with a Black spot or a relatively small isolated Bantu reserve, you find White farmers all along the boundary of that area. When that area is taken away and is compensated for by means of land of an equivalent value adjacent to a Bantu area, it is true that new border farmers are created, but there will be fewer of them than the number of border farmers whom we had round the previous Bantu area, an area whose borders have now disappeared because it has become White. In the long run, therefore, the problem of border farmers is not worsening on account of consolidation, but improving. Hon. members have obviously not thought about that. [Laughter.] I find it difficult to understand why the Leader of the Opposition is laughing now, but I know that in the Western Province he is not and cannot become a border farmer, and he is perhaps laughing because he is glad that he can never become one.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition, in the beginning of his series of speeches, briefly reverted to the reply I gave last night. I do not want to go into that further, except to say that on a few occasions he misquoted me, or repeated what I am supposed to have said whilst I think that he did not repeat it correctly. I do not want to do more than just to give a few examples to clear up what I meant. I understand that he said that I had alleged that &#x201C;while his Government&#x2019;s policy is there, he says there is no hope whatsoever of friendship&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is how I wrote it down. Let me just explain what I said in fact. I have not his speech available and the Leader of the Opposition put so many questions that I could not make a note of everything. What I said was this. As our policy progresses and can openly be seen for what it is, and as its effect is accepted, the atmosphere and the relations between Whites and non-Whites will change and improve. In other words, my standpoint is not that our policy will result in all hope of friendship disappearing, but just the opposite, namely that I believe that our policy will in the long run in fact lead to friendship and goodwill.</p>

<p>Another allegation which I understand he made is that I said the &#x201C;hostility&#x201D; was the same at UN in 1946 as it is to-day. I did not say that either. What I said was that I admitted that the hostility revealed to-day is much worse under the changed circumstances than it was at that time, but I allege that there was already hostility towards us in 1946 and that General Smuts returned to South Africa from UN a disillusioned man, so serious was the hostility he experienced there. I admit that thereafter it became worse, but that is due to circumstances. I still used the words &#x201C;I admit it has worsened&#x201D;. My standpoint was that there were other reasons for it, such as the emergence of the Afro-Asian nations and the whole atmosphere which has pervaded the world during the last ten years. Nor did the hostility become worse on the part of the Western nations towards us as the result only of our policy, but the new attitude which developed on their part was the result of the increasing eagerness of the Western nations to get the African and Asian states on their side in the face of the increasing threat of Communism, which was also not as great in 1946 as it is now. Therefore I admit the position has worsened, but not so much as the result of what we did as in consequence of the world situation.</p>

<p>That brings me to a few of the other points raised by the Leader of the Opposition. He says he wonders whether the public realizes to what extent we want to split up South Africa through our policy. This matter has already been discussed repeatedly. I cannot see that the public can be under any illusions as to what lies ahead. The public knows, as we all do in this House, that the Native areas are spread over the whole country. They even think that the position is worse than it is. because during the elections the United Party published maps <span class="col_3813-3814" refersTo="page_0533"/>on which larger areas were painted Black than are in fact Black.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is the map of the Tomlinson Commission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no. During the elections I demonstrated from public platforms the difference between the United Party maps and those of the Tomlinson Commission. That is why I say that the impression the public has of the non-White areas is actually worse than the position really is, if in fact they believe the United Party. They know that it is our policy that those areas are Bantu inheritances which they can retain, except in so far as through consolidation some areas may become White and other areas have to compensate for it. Therefore the public is under no illusion. The public realizes the magnitude of the problem and the difficulties with which we are faced, difficulties which the Leader of the Opposition wanted to exploit by sowing panic and dissatisfaction amongst the people by means of his series of questions. However, the public also realizes something else, namely that there is only one alternative for a White-controlled state with Black-controlled neighbouring states, and that is a mixed state such as the United Party wants. It is when faced with that choice between these two possibilities, which both contain problems, that they choose the one, as we do, which contains the least problems. Because the Leader of the Opposition surely realizes that any reason for hatred or lack of confidence which the hon. member for South Coast may have in the Bantu will constitute just as serious a problem, or a worse one, for the Government of a mixed South Africa as it does to a White Government in respect of its non-White neighbours. I want to emphasize that in the case of a mixed Government there will be greater dangers. The United Party imagines that everything we call Bantu areas will become Bantu-controlled in terms of its policy, including Zululand. I am referring now to Bantu-Zululand. The United Party says that will also be Bantu-controlled, but it says: as local governments. However, it does not only say that it will be exclusively Bantu-controlled under local government, but adds that those Bantu-controlled areas will also send their representatives to this Parliament if it becomes a federal Parliament. In other words, in the first place all those Bantu areas, of which they say they are so afraid now, will have co-authority in the Government of a federal South Africa. Apart from that, all the Bantu living in Durban and in all the other urban areas, and whom the hon. member for South Coast surely also mistrusts if he mistrusts the tribal Natives, will be given representation in this Parliament if it becomes a federal Parliament. Then the Indians, in regard to whom he never seems very happy, will also receive representation in this Parliament, and the Coloureds will have the franchise together with the Whites on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and control the Cape Province in this Federal Parliament. In other words, the question the public of South Africa should have asked itself was this: Where is there less danger and more safety for the continued existence of White civilization, and in what type of country will the economy be safer so that investors will invest their money, in a country which will clearly continue to be dominated by the Whites and which will do its best to live on a good footing with its non-White neighbours but which will at least give a guarantee as to what its character will be, or will the position be safer and better for the continued existence of the Whites and for the economic progress of the country in a mixed country where the non-White groups will increasingly be able to exert pressure to obtain full control&#x2014;i.e. the process we see in Kenya and the Federation and Tanganyika? Between these two possibilities there is no doubt as to what the voters chose. The election has proved that. Therefore all this scaremongering and all these attempts to undermine the strength of the Government in the eyes of the public are in vain. All this has already been done before, and the fact that the Leader of the Opposition tries to do it again will not avail him. I therefore do not intend to deal in detail with all the scaremongering in which the Leader of the Opposition indulged in regard to our colour policy. I just want to say that in so far as he alleges that businessmen feel that they are now living in uncertainty unless they can get clear demarcations of all the borders of all the potential Bantu areas, that is an exaggerated argument. Those businessmen may say so, but to me what is much more significant is the fact which hon. members are trying to laugh away, namely that the type of policy favoured by the United Party also, viz. integration, was regarded by the British Lombard Bank as fatal to investment. The reason why there has been such an increase of confidence in the future of South Africa, which is being revealed every day&#x2014;every day we receive new messages from people who visited South Africa and who want to invest their money here&#x2014;became evident whilst this Nationalist Government with its policy is in power. They could see the difference between the prosperous conditions here as contrasted with the deterioration in the British territories in Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member is disappointed because South Africa is prosperous, and he thinks that by being funny he can make the Government&#x2019;s policy ridiculous in the eyes of the public, but the public does not judge by words alone. They do not judge by the hon. member&#x2019;s laughter. They judge by the results and the visible confidence which exists in South Africa and of which he reads every day in his own newspapers. He tries to laugh it away, but does not succeed in doing so. All he succeeds in doing is once more to expose his own prejudice.</p>

<p>Therefore when the Leader of the Opposition says: &#x201C;Will the Prime Minister stand rockfast by his policy if the economy creaks and bends?&#x201D; then I say I shall certainly stand rockfast by my policy because I see that the economy in fact is not cracking. On the contrary, I see that our economy is busy making progress as the result of our rocklike policy. Nor am I going to reply to such nonsensicalities as the allegation that as the result of the general economic deterioration the number of building plans approved has decreased. I do not think that is a true diagnosis. The number of plans approved did in fact decrease temporarily, but there was a general downward trend last year about which we all know, and everybody can see how there is again, even in the sphere of building, a new upward tendency now. Therefore I say that it is no use criticizing and generalizing in this way with reference to a coincidental period. One should look at the picture over a longer period. When one does that, it is really a pity that the Leader of the Opposition has once again allowed himself to be used to try to belittle the new climate which has arisen in South Africa and which has been so eagerly awaited by all industrialists and business men for so long, because in that climate our economy can flourish again. It is a pity that he is trying to spoil that new climate. I believe that few people doubt that there is a new climate in South Africa to-day, although some people belittle it for political purposes.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked what the future of the Tugela Basin was. I am surprised at such a question. I do not have the map of Natal before me, but surely all the development potentialities of the Tugela Basin do not lie in the Bantu area. On the contrary, as far as I can remember, the greatest development plans drawn up by various bodies in Natal in respect of the Tugela fall within the White area. In addition, appreciable areas of it are so comparatively near to the Bantu areas, if I remember correctly, that our border industries plan will be of great importance to those areas. Whilst I was still Minister of Native Affairs, I always considered that the Tugela Basin was one of the greatest assets of White Natal. I shall again study the maps, but I cannot understand at all what gives rise to the suspicion of hon. members that we will hand over the whole of the Tugela Basin to the Bantu for their own development and deprive White Natal of it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me to give full estimates and calculations in regard to every particular of our Native policy. I am not prepared to react to that challenge, because it is nonsensical and I have already dealt with it before. I have already pointed out how, in regard to many of the developments which have taken place in this country, one would not have been able to give details and estimates of costs for a long time in advance. One can provide the great ideal, but the experience in this country and in every other country shows that the detailed development of it takes place according to the potentiality of that country. No man and no Government can anticipate the budgets for future years. If I am asked for details it would mean that I must now say beforehand what the Government will spend on specific matters in future years, and that is a nonsensical request. It has never been done in any country in the past. I have also previously pointed out that, if somebody had asked 50 years ago what the South Africa of 1960 would look like, nobody would have been able to say so in 1910. Who could at that time have visualized that there would be a Sasol and a Vanderbijl Park and an Escom? Who could then already have calculated what these undertakings would cost?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<p>What about the estimates of the cost of the Orange River scheme?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is another foolish question. Here one is dealing with a purely technological project which will take several years to complete and in regard to which there will be quite a number of adaptations and changes in the calculations of the cost, but this scheme is based on a broad plan according to which certain dams must be built and certain hydro-electric plants have to be erected, the cost of which can in fact be calculated on the basis of present-day prices. But that is quite different from the calculation in advance and in detail of the large-scale development of the whole country or of portions of the country, in all its diversity. What I am therefore doing now is to draw a parallel with the development of South Africa over the past 50 years and the question put to me by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to advance estimates for the whole of the development of South Africa and for every one of the Bantu areas for the next 40 years. Therefore the comparison I am making is a justifiable one, whilst the one he is relying on, as indicated by his interjection, is not justifiable.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made reproaches in regard to our economy by comparing it with <span class="col_3817-3818" refersTo="page_0535"/>Australia. He said: See how far ahead of us Australia is; it builds ships and television sets and it has an automobile manufacturing industry of its own, etc. But is that not ridiculous also? If I had said: &#x201C;Look at South Africa and see how badly Australia compares with us; look at our gold-mining industry and our uranium industry, and see all the great development which has taken place in regard to coal, diamonds and minerals, and why has Australia nothing like that?&#x201D; the Leader of the Opposition would perhaps say, &#x201C;Yes, but they do not have those minerals&#x201D;, and I would quite agree with him that is so and that my reproach was ridiculous. But the fact nevertheless is that if we were so bad, if we had so little initiative, if our country could not attract enough capital, all those minerals would also have remained undeveloped here. It is because the initiative and the energy of South Africa were particularly directed to the development of the real assets we have that our attention and our knowledge of engineering and our &#x201C;knowhow&#x201D; have been spread over a series of other undertakings than those they have in Australia. At the same time, having developed these great assets, our coal, our diamonds and our gold, through the initiative, the capital, the manpower and the technical &#x201C;know-how&#x201D; of our citizens, we have also in addition had a very appreciable industrial development. To belittle one&#x2019;s own country in this way and to revile it for being weak and for comparing badly with other countries, and for being without initiative and for not having developed technicians, I think is terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Then the Leader of the Opposition also said that South Africa does not spend enough on technical services and education and that therefore we have a lack of trained persons.

There is an undoubted lack of technicians and scientists, and I do not intend trying to make out a case that we have enough of those people. We do not have enough, but no country in the world has enough. There is not a single country in the world, not even the greatest and most powerful countries, neither Russia nor France or England or Germany or the U.S.A., which has enough technicians, scientists and engineers. It is therefore our duty, just as it is the duty of each of those countries towards themselves, to devote special attention to this need. I fully agree with that.</p>

<p>The fact has been somewhat ridiculed here that our Railways want to learn something from the Japanese. Why ridicule it?

The Japanese have the same gauge of railway line that we have. They have a very much greater population. The Railway Administration there has to transport from the stations with great speed the great number of passengers provided by this dense population, and it has succeeded in running its trains at a higher speed than ours do over reasonable distances. Other countries have not succeeded in doing so, in any case not on that gauge. All of that is of interest to us, because we have to deal with a large Bantu population which we have to transport and take away from the stations speedily. Now, is it wrong of us to go and see what they do there?</p>

<p>In connection with the depopulation of the platteland.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is what I mean. The depopulation of the platteland is taking place in various areas. One of the areas concerned is the southern Free State and another area, amongst others, is the remote part of the Northern Cape. There has also been a certain amount of depopulation possibly in the Fish and Sundays River valleys as the result of the difficulties experienced there. The Orange River scheme will go a long way towards checking the depopulation of these rural areas. It does not behove anybody to despise the Orange River scheme as something which will not nearly meet the requirements of our growing population. If the hon. member says that, as he did, it sounds as though we are thinking of the Orange River scheme as something which is only useful for new settlements for farmers. That, however, is only part of the significance of that project. The industrial consequences of that project, the industrial consequences of the acquisition of a cheap form of electricity and the provision of electricity to many towns and cities, will be of enormous importance to the development of our industries in many different places. It will certainly be of great importance to our growing population. But naturally other projects will also have to follow and naturally industries will have to be developed other than those which specifically flow from this, and they are also going to make their contribution to the full development of this country. At some time or other a second Sasol will certainly have to come into being, with the resultant expansion of the chemical industry&#x2014; when and where we still do not know&#x2014;but in this way many more undertakings over and above the Orange River scheme will be needed to guide the growth of South Africa in the future. It is not necessary to say therefore, because a certain important, highly important, scheme also has its limitations in taking care of the population, that for that reason it must not be undertaken, or dismiss it as something which is of lesser importance than it actually is. I think one must have confidence in the very great future of South Africa, quite apart from this enormous scheme.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has again referred to Article 73 (e) and he wants to know whether we have not been caught unawares. I want to repeat what I said immediately after the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had posed this question, namely that my legal advice, after proper inquiry by legal experts in international law, is that the Transkeian policy and, as I have again subsequently ascertained, the draft constitution of the Recess Committee, do not expose us to the danger which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition fears. My legal advice is in direct conflict therefore with the fear or the suspicion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. More than that I need not say in this regard. My legal advice differs very clearly from what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition believes. But I say again that I am very sorry that he has played into the hands of the enemies of our State by introducing this new issue.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that there were certain other matters of importance that he wished to mention. The first was what South Africa would do if Britain were to join the European Economic Common Market. South Africa is watching that position very carefully. We have already taken steps to be kept fully informed of everything that goes on there. We have no obsession in this connection, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition believes. We have no obsession either with regard to associate membership or with regard to any other action. We are going to act on the facts as we find them. Like many other people I too have no doubt that South Africa will be no worse off than the other members of the Commonwealth; on the contrary, because of the character of South Africa&#x2019;s exports the prospects are that on the whole South Africa will be better off, if Britain joins, than Commonwealth countries like Australia and Canada. In other words, whatever Britain might want to do for her Commonwealth members if, as has been said more than once, she acts in a certain way in her own interests, those States will be in a more dangerous situation than South Africa. South Africa may well be affected in certain respects, and the Government is seeking ways and means of meeting that situation. But I want to say perfectly clearly that we are aware of the problems which may flow from the fact that the United Kingdom joins the Common Market, just as members of the Commonwealth realize what problems that step may bring in its wake for them. We have our people there who are investigating this matter; we are watching every development. When it becomes necessary to do so we shall strengthen our representation there. We are not indifferent. We are not filled with any obsession in respect of that situation. We are reserving the right to ourselves to do what may appear to be in the best interests of South Africa as the position develops and as the outcome of that becomes clearer and clearer. Indeed as yet there is no certainty as to what Britain herself, for example, is going to do. There are certain indications but there is no certainty.</p>

<p>As far as Radio South Africa is concerned, I cannot, of course, share the hon. member&#x2019;s obsession that there is something radically wrong with Radio South Africa. On the contrary, I think Radio South Africa is placing itself on a sound business footing, which has not always been the case in the past. Moreover, I am convinced that it will do what every radio undertaking in any country does, and that is to function as a loyal instrument serving the interests of our fatherland. Radio South Africa, as happens in every country, will make known <span class="col_3821-3822" refersTo="page_0537"/>to the country what is newsworthy, and it will refuse to submit to the attempt which has sometimes been made in the past, both abroad as well as internally, to make it a partial instrument acting against the interests of South Africa. And I do not deprecate its new policy&#x2014;I support it. As far as the future of this Corporation is concerned, I believe that as an independent Corporation, as it is at the present time, with the right that the State has to make appointments and therefore to exercise basic control, which is the position under the existing Act, a great and a safe future lies ahead of it. I think with the changes which it is now introducing throughout the whole country&#x2014;a new network for ultra-shortwave transmissions&#x2014;it will bring to South Africa a service, in that form, which will be quite unique for a country of such vast distances. Furthermore, I believe that Radio South Africa with its Bantu services will also bring a service to the other sections of the population such as no single other power in Africa brings to its people as far as the actual daily service is concerned. I am not talking about their foreign propaganda. I believe that this institution will be of great value to the development of harmonious relations and friendship between the various racial groups in our fatherland. I therefore unambiguously express my confidence in Radio South Africa.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked certain questions in connection with the new ministerial appointments. He asked what our plans were in connection with the Department of Community Development. But, after all, the Minister of Community Development introduced legislation in connection with that Department just recently, only a few weeks ago, and on that occasion he explained the duties of the Department of Community Development in the clearest possible terms. Why does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ask me to-day what the function of this Department is? Was he not present when that legislation was dealt with? Was he not even aware of what the Minister had said before he criticized? To summarize the position briefly, let me put it this way: As far as the Whites are concerned we do not need a Department of Community Development. The Department is not intended for that purpose therefore. We have built up our cities in the course of our history. Our towns and our cities are all closely knit communities. But we have no such thing in the case of the Coloureds and particularly in the case of the Indians. In the case of the Bantu there are separate locations for them where they are developing into communities. Because of the fact that they have been placed together in housing schemes, they are developing into communities with common interests and their own cultural life. But as yet we have nothing of the kind in the case of the Coloured and the Indian. The mere development of residential areas for Coloureds and Indians under other legislation is of great importance, but we do not want to limit ourselves to the building of houses and to the laying out of streets and the provision of electric light and sewage and then say to them, &#x201C;That is the place where you are to live.&#x201D; We want to build up the cultural, religious, closely knit community that we settle in those houses. We want them to grow into a unit where they will provide all the necessary services to one another so that they will have an opportunity for development. Take the Coloureds, for example. The Coloured must be given an opportunity to govern his own local community. In this case we are dealing in the main with communities in the towns and cities. It is not simply a question of creating a Bantu residential area or a Coloured residential area. The Department of Community Development is concerned with the towns and cities which are being established for Coloureds and Indians, but the object is to help them grow and to knit them into true communities, in which they themselves render all the services to their own people. That must include the management of their communities; it must include the development and the utilization of their own culture within those communities, and the building up of self-esteem. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows what the building up of a community means, in the sociological sense as well, then he will understand what we seek to achieve with the establishment of this extremely important Department in the interests of the Coloured and the Indian communities. That is also my reply then to his further question as to why we have not given more information as to what is to become of the Coloureds and the Indians. What more can I say than I have said over and over again already? I gave a full exposition as to what is to happen in the case of the Coloureds; I explained it before the Coloured Council; it has been stated here over and over again on many occasions by the Minister of Coloured Affairs. And in addition to that I said in connection with the Indian community that what happens in the case of the Coloureds will be taken as our model. Step by step&#x2014;it is true that this will come later on because the Indians have not yet developed to the stage where they want to co-operate with us to establish an Advisory Council in the first place, although at the moment the signs are very favourable that we shall also get the co-operation of the Indian communities&#x2014;we are going to follow the same model as in the case of the Coloureds. More than that I need not say, nor do I propose to say any more.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition talked about the Department of Information. He asked whether the taking over of all the information services of the various Departments was proof that the information service was poor. My reply, of course, is &#x201C;No&#x201D;. The original Information Division developed from what the United Party itself established. During the war years the United Party established a Division of Information, of limited scope, in order to achieve certain purposes at that time. That Division developed further during the National Party&#x2019;s regime, and other Departments, such as the Department of Native Affairs, also felt a need for the dissemination <span class="col_3823-3824" refersTo="page_0538"/>of information. I myself established a division there for specific information to and concerning the Bantu. Each of these divisions did good work, but a stage was reached in the development of all those information services where the sensible thing to do was to co-ordinate those services. I personally assume the responsibility, together with my Government, who agreed 100 per cent with it, for the decision that the time had come to bring all the information services together in one Department. We then proceeded to bring together the various services (under central guidance) which had started to overlap and which can actually supplement and enrich one another. When I appointed a new Minister I certainly took advantage of the oppotunity, amongst other things, not only to give this highly essential service the full status of a Department but to obtain the full co-operation and the intensive initiative of a Minister in whom I have the fullest confidence that he will see to it that South Africa&#x2019;s case is put effectively. I want to add, in reply to the question by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition as to whether this will bring about a change in world opinion unless South Africa changes her policy, that we as Government are not going to change our policy so as to make it conform to what is acceptable in other States in the furtherance of their own interests. We are going to implement a policy which we believe to be in the best interests of South Africa, and we are going to do what every country does that believes in its policy, and that is to continue to state its policy so that others will understand it correctly and view it more sympathetically. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asks me whether we have any hope of achieving this aim, my reply is that not only have we hopes of succeeding but that we are already beginning to reap the fruits. It is a lengthy and a difficult process to overcome suspicion once it has been created. But the wheel is turning, not only as the result of the activities of our own Department but as the result of events which are taking place in the world itself. The occurrence in Goa, the exposure of India, the developments in Kenya and Tanganyika, and now in the Federation, and the fact that the Western world is beginning to get some idea of the pressure exerted by Communism, of the use which Communism makes of the non-White races, together with the growing realization throughout the world of the danger which the Western nations themselves are facing more and more, are making people more receptive than ever before to the information that we can furnish with regard to what we are doing. It is for that reason that the time that we chose to establish this Department of Information was the psychological moment. This is the moment when the world is more receptive to the message that we have to give. I am absolutely convinced therefore that the establishment of this Department was an extremely wise step and that South Africa will never regret the expenditure of this money.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I only have ten minutes in which to reply to the Prime Minister, and I intend to spend those ten minutes on his remarks about the reserves, but, before I get on to that, I must say that I was amazed to hear the Prime Minister misconstrue a remark made by my Leader about Australia. The Prime Minister suggested that my Leader was out to belittle this country as much as he could, and that he was ashamed of what was being done in South Africa. The Prime Minister knows very well that what my Leader was doing was to belittle the efforts of this Government and to point out that if we had an ambitious Government, like the Australian Government, or if the United Party had stayed in power in 1948, we would have been doing what they are doing in Australia to-day. Just to give one example, if we had stayed in power in 1948, the Orange River scheme would have been working now. The Prime Minister also turned a remark made by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), and I cannot allow that to go unchallenged. The hon. member for South Coast asked the Prime Minister whether he could accept the assurance that the White man&#x2019;s interest would be protected in the new independent State, and the Prime Minister then suggested&#x2014;and he actually used the word &#x201C;haat&#x201D;&#x2014;that the hon. member for South Coast hated the Bantu, and he asked how he could believe in the sincerity of our policy&#x2026;.</p>

<p>He said: &#x201C;Do you trust them?&#x201D; That was my reason.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister asked how could he believe in our policy of integration and of giving them representation in Parliament and working with them if, in fact, we did not trust the Bantu at all. The point is that, as far as the United Party is concerned, and as far as the hon. member for South Coast is concerned, we have learnt to work with the African people, and we can work together with them, as we are prepared to work with them in this House. But what the hon. member for South Coast fears, and what I fear, is this: that the Prime Minister may be handing over these areas when he does not know who will eventually control them. When the British handed over in Ghana, did they know who was going to take over? The Prime Minister of Ghana was in jail when they held those first elections. They thought that the chieftains were going to take over the Government. Did the Belgians know what was going to happen in the Congo when they handed over? Of course they did not. And what is the position now in Kenya and Rhodesia? They have learnt their lesson, and they are afraid now as to who is going to take over, and that is why they are having so much trouble with the constitutions of those countries. What the hon. member for South Coast means is this: that the Prime Minister, in giving independence to these states, does not know who is going to take them over. The people with whom <span class="col_3825-3826" refersTo="page_0539"/>he is negotiating now may not rule those states very long.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also attacked me for mentioning the Bunga, and he said, because I had made a &#x201C;plei-dooi vir die Bunga&#x201D;, that I knew nothing about the Transkei. Sir, I made no plea for the old Bunga. I pointed out that this system of development towards self-government was started many years before the Verwoerd policy was thought of, and the Bunga system was part of it. But in 14 years I am certain that the Bunga system would have changed if the United Party had been in power, especially as Gen. Smuts had promised that the Bantu in those areas would be given more power. The Prime Minister now wants to pretend that if the United Party had remained in power, the Bunga system would not have altered one bit, and that we would still have had White magistrates as district chairmen.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister then said that there was a radical difference between his policy with regard to the Europeans in the Transkei and that of the British Government in Kenya. I want to ask him what that radical difference is. Sir, I must go by this constitution which I mentioned just now, because when the Prime Minister was taxed on this question a few weeks ago he said: &#x201C;Ek sal volledig vir die Blankes sorg&#x201D;, and I am surprised to hear the hon. the Prime Minister say that he will not necessarily accept this constitution if the Transkeian Territorial Authority accepts these recommendations.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has not given the assurance that he will accept this, and I am surprised because the hon. the Prime Minister himself admits that they asked him for his advice in drawing up this document, and the hon. the Prime Minister will know that the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development was with the committee right up to the end when this document was drafted, and I am positive that both the Minister of Bantu Administration and the Prime Minister knew what was in this document and the progress that had been made. The Prime Minister himself says that he advised them to give more elected members to the new Authority than they intended to give originally. That surprises me too, Sir, because the Prime Minister is the man who introduced the Bantu Authorities Act. That was to be the solution of the Native problem for South Africa, that was to contain the political rights the Natives would enjoy. That was the Act the Transkei refused to accept and he had to give the Transkei a separate proclamation. But the point is this that in terms of that Act, the Prime Minister would give the ordinary Africans no elective rights at all, and now he has changed completely and tells the Territorial Authority that they must give them more elected members as opposed to chiefs and headmen.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to know something more from the hon. the Prime Minister about this Clause 68 which affects the position of the Europeans. Surely the hon. the Prime Minister must have discussed the interests of the Europeans with the Recess Committee. It would be scandalous if the hon. the Prime Minister had not discussed the position of the Europeans in this new state with the Recess Committee. All we see in the recommended constitution is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the event of Europeans with business interests in the Transkei being required to terminate certain business interests, it is recognized that they are entitled to facilities for realizing their assets &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is a nice general statement &#x201C;given facilities to realize their assets&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by selling to Transkeian citizens and that, where justified, adequate compensation should be made.</block>

<p>Who is going to decide whether they are justified to receive compensation? Is the hon. the Prime Minister going to decide, or the new independent government? I want to point out to the hon. the Prime Minister that the majority of the White people in the Transkei are not engaged in industry, they are men of commerce. The hon. the Prime Minister says that he is behaving better than the British Government, because he is looking after the civil servants; they will be taken back into the Union. We are not worried about the position of the civil servants. We know that they will be protected by this Government. They remain republican citizens and officials. We are worried about what is going to happen to the commercial men. The hon. the Prime Minister knows that the farms have been sold around Umtata and that there are very few industrialists. The hon. the Prime Minister said that the White man will continue to make his living there by giving services. But under the policy of this Government, the Bantu Development Corporation is going to be allowed now to finance commercial institutions in the urban areas there, and in terms of the constitution I see that the urban areas are going to be zoned for different racial occupation, and the Africans will be encouraged to start their own commercial businesses in those zoned areas. Now, Sir, the White trader does not mind fair competition and the White trader won&#x2019;t mind one bit if the hon. the Prime Minister does to them what he did in respect of the farmers. If he values their properties on a fair basis, on the same basis as the farmers, taking into account their incomes, and if he pays them out on the same basis, they won&#x2019;t mind at all selling their businesses to Bantu businessmen, and if the Corporation would say &#x201C;We will only finance the taking <span class="col_3827-3828" refersTo="page_0540"/>over of existing trading stations &#x201D;, nobody would mind. But what we fear is this artificial competition. These established European businesses may go under because of the assistance which is going to be given to Bantu traders to start artificial competition. That is what we are complaining about. Sir, the traders are not birds of passage. They did not buy their trading stations and their stands in the villages because they expected the Government would do something which would increase the value of their property, as lots of others did in getting options over land when they knew the Native Trust was going to buy. They did not do anything like that. The traders settled there, encouraged by the Government to do so, and they have been there for generations. The Prime Minister is now throwing them to the wolves, because if the new Independent Parliament is allowed to control licences and give any business the right, and assistance, to start in competition with established businesses on an unfair basis, these established businesses will go under. But it is not only the businesses I am worried about. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has just asked: How did Britain know who would take over in Ghana, and how did Belgium know who would take over in the Congo? And then he further asks: How does the hon. the Prime Minister know who will be at the head of affairs in the Transkei? Now I just want to ask the hon. member this: In terms of the Federation Plan of the United Party, how will he know who will be at the head of the non-White components of their Federation? Whom will he put in this Parliament to represent the Black man in their Federation? Then the hon. member for South Coast asked again where the borders of the Bantu homelands are? We can put the same question to them. The hon. the Prime Minister has clearly indicated that the borders are there. But where are the borders of the Black components of their Bantu homelands?</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the allegation that the Prime Minister is deserting the White people in the Transkei in the same way that the British Government is deserting the Whites in Kenya. Let me say immediately that allegation is devoid of all truth. It is a malicious allegation aimed at creating unnecessary unrest and ill-feeling between the White man and the Black man, in the hope that the Transkei plan will fail. The circumstances under which the Whites settled themselves in Kenya and in the Transkei especially differ very widely. In Kenya settlers from South Africa and from Britain settled and acquired properties, particularly after 1905, well knowing that Kenya had been declared to be a Protectorate of Britain. Secondly, they knew that the British Government had bought the interests of the British Imperial East Africa Company, and thirdly (and this is the most important), they knew that the British Government had in 1902 provided conditions for the expropriation of land for the benefit of the Whites, particularly in the Highlands of Kenya. I have here the &#x201C;Kenya Yearbook&#x201D;, in which we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A few years later, in 1902, the boundaries of the East African Protectorate were altered to include what was previously the Eastern Province of Uganda, and in that year also the conditions under which land could be alienated were laid down.</block>

<p>But thereafter, in 1922, the Devonshire White Paper confirmed the position of the White man in the Highlands, and in 1932 the Carter Committee again reaffirmed it. In this &#x201C;Yearbook&#x201D; we read that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1932 the Carter Committee was set up to consider the needs of the Native population with regard to land and to define the area of the White Highlands within which persons of European descent were to have a privileged position in accordance with the guarantees of the Devonshire White Paper of 1922.</block>

<p>That was further confirmed by the fact that after the 1918 War the British Government established special schemes for the settlement of ex-soldiers. The White man did not go to Kenya on a loose footing. The White man in Kenya accepted it as his fatherland to such an extent that on three occasions he fought for that fatherland, in 1916 against the Germans (under the late General Smuts), in 1940 against the Italians, and we all know about the heroic deeds performed there in the battle against the Mau Mau. It is a fact that the White man went to Kenya under certain conditions, and that the Whites, particularly in the Highlands, started building up and developing the country from the bottom to become a prosperous community, and a large proportion of them were officials in the service of the British Government. There is no doubt at all that the whole course of history was the establishment of a permanent home for the Whites in Kenya by the British Government, and it is only fair that the promotor, viz. Britain, should protect and ensure their possessions and their future. But alas, what is the situation? The Whites are looking for security in vain. On the contrary, the butcher Kenyatta was set free and he will sit in the Government of Kenya. In the third place, the value of their properties was destroyed almost completely, and in certain cases their properties are already being handed over to the Black man, and there is a large-scale exodus of Whites from Kenya, accompanied by tremendous personal losses. And the officials in Kenya are being left to the mercy of a Black Government, of which Kenyatta is a member. Apart from that, it has already been mentioned here that the Lombard Bank is now abandoning Kenya and Africa, and it says that it is doing so to save millions of pounds before the British Government completes its catastrophic policy in Africa. There is not the least doubt that the approximately <span class="col_3829-3830" refersTo="page_0541"/>62,000 Whites in Kenya have been left in the lurch, and furthermore, that the franchise they enjoyed and which was something of value to them is now of no value at all.</p>

<p>In regard to the Transkei, there are 13,922 Whites there, and they went there to settle in an area which was established by legislation as Black man&#x2019;s country. In the second place they went there exclusively to render services which the Bantu was not able to render, and for no other reason. No White farms, with the exception of a few at Umtata, could be acquired or developed, and only 26 small towns, perhaps with the exception of Umtata and Butterworth, which are a little larger, were established for the sole purpose of providing accommodation for the officials, the professional people and the traders in the Transkei. Even the 637 trading stations were granted on Bantu land, and the traders knew that this was not White land. Therefore the number of Whites in the Transkei remained small, and the total income tax paid by Whites in the year 1959-60 was only R540,000, because the White community could not develop to the full. What is the position to-day as compared with Kenya? There is no exodus of Whites from the Transkei. Even the hon. member for Transkeian Territories is quite prepared to stay there and to continue holding stock sales. The assurance was given unequivocally this afternoon, and also on previous occasions, that the interests of the Whites will not be neglected, and this afternoon the hon. the Prime Minister added a further point to it, namely that the Whites who will gradually leave that area to come back to the larger South Africa will have splendid opportunities for settling themselves also as the result of the Orange River scheme and all the other developments taking place there.</p>

<p>But I want to say that I also attach tremendous importance to the statement made by Kaiser Matanzima some time ago, and which is now incorporated in this document which has been signed. I will tell hon. members why I attach so much importance to it. It seems to me that we in South Africa are in the fortunate position, as compared with the rest of Africa, of having a responsible and reliable Bantu population with which to negotiate. That perhaps emanates from the way in which the Bantu has been treated by the White man in past years. Furthermore, to my mind the possibility is not excluded that as the result of the greater development which is imminent the value of properties and trading stations in the Transkei may perhaps rise. The position of the officials has been guaranteed by the Prime Minister. They remain in the service of the Republic and retain all the privileges they enjoy to-day, and they even have the choice of remaining there or not. And, further, the vote held by the White man in the Transkei to-day retains the same value in the Republic. There is a tremendous difference between the position in Kenya and in the Transkei. In regard to the historical background, one cannot even make a comparison, and although the future of the White man in Kenya is comparatively dark, the future of the White man in the Transkei is assured. The accusation of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) in regard to the &#x201C;Kenyasation&#x201D; of the Transkei is not only false but it is a malicious accusation which ignores the facts in regard to the Transkei and in regard to Kenya. Other than in the rest of Africa we are evidently dealing with a responsible and reliable Bantu population in South Africa, and therefore we shall also in future be able to make such arrangements with them that we can live as good neighbours. The hon. member for South Coast evidently does not believe that one can trust a Black man. When the Prime Minister said so this afternoon he laughed in his face. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories may want to deride it, but the fact remains that the hon. member for South Coast showed very clearly this afternoon that when we on this side of the House try to safeguard the position of the White man and at the same time try to gain the confidence of the Black man, and tell him that we trust him, he undermines that confidence.

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>In passing, I just want to refer to something which was said by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) and then, with his approval, I will go on to what was said by the hon. the Prime Minister in the few minutes at my disposal. The hon. member asked where, in terms of the policy of the United Party, the borders of our Bantu homelands are. Those borders of our Bantu homelands are the borders of South Africa, because under us those areas will never be independent, but will remain part of South Africa, an integral part of South Africa.</p>

<p>I should, however, like to refer once more to what was said by the hon. the Prime Minister, and particularly to the effects of his policy. I want to honour him for the fact that since he became Minister he has steadfastly stood by this policy of Bantustans and the splitting up of South Africa. He said from the beginning that was his policy and that he would implement it if possible. Mr. Chairman, you know what clever ruses the National Party has to resort to from time to time to get past that, what equivocal replies had to be given, how at first it was &#x201C;total segregration&#x201D;, how it was &#x201C;separate areas&#x201D;, and then again it was nothing else but the old segregation policy, how the new policy now being followed was not a &#x201C;practical policy,&#x201D;, how it was &#x201C;domination&#x201D;, and how later it was again described as &#x201C;sovereignty&#x201D;, and now it is separate national development for the Bantu groups in their own area. But what worried me about the replies given by the Prime Minister to-day is that he can be so naive, a man of his standing, the Prime Minister of South Africa, to give us such a nonsensical reply when we say that in his negotiations with the Natives he pushed aside the Whites, and that he forgot <span class="col_3831-3832" refersTo="page_0542"/>all about the rights of the Whites in his negotiations with the Bantu. He says: We will make provision, e.g. that the Whites of Umtata can cast their votes here in the White area! Where does he get that from? Surely they are going to be independent areas, areas which will decide themselves what those White people will be able to do or not be able to do. It is not for the Prime Minister or for us, or for this House, to say what they will or will not do. I see that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who is not here at the moment, realizes one thing in regard to the Transkei (I mention it just in passing), and that is that one of the first consequences of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy for the Transkei will be the joining up of the Transkei territory with Basutoland. He sees that coming. And what does he say outside? He says: Do not worry about it, we will surmount it, we will establish a neutral area! How nonsensical&#x2014;to use the words of the hon. the Prime Minister! Does he not know our history? Does he not know that we have already tried to apply such a policy of having neutral areas in South Africa? Does he not know that we cannot keep human beings away from each other?</p>

Inside this &#x201C;inherited&#x201D; area of Zululand lies what we know as Kwa Matewane, and Moordkoppie, part of the history and of the blood of the Whites. What will happen to that? What will the descendants do of the Greylings who lie there, your forefathers? Will you allow it to be given back? Will you tolerate Hlomo Amabutu being given back to the Zulus? Will you patiently allow the inheritance of your fathers, their bones, many of which still lie there bleaching in the sun, be given away in terms of the policy of your Prime Minister?

<p>I want to ask the hon. member not to waste my time. The hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) has warned the hon. the Leader of the Opposition against the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, but I want to warn him against the danger in his own bosom. That hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) is <i>par excellence</i> a kicker-out of leaders. In September of the year in which they got rid of Mr. Strauss as their leader, he moved a motion of full confidence in him, and just a few months later, whilst he was still sitting in the aircraft, they kicked him out, under the leadership of the hon. member for South Coast. In Bloemfontein, when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition voted with the Progressive Party in connection with purchase of land, the hon. member for South Coast saw an opportunity to kick out not only the Progressive Party but also the Leader of the Opposition. But then the Leader of the Opposition was clever enough to vote against it. In that way he retained his position and to-day he is still Leader of the Opposition. I want to warn him about the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast accuses me of holding meetings in my constituency to persuade the farmers to sell their land to the Trust. Now I want to ask him this: Mention one meeting I convened where I advised the farmers to sell their land. Mention just one. The hon. member cannot do so and therefore I can do nothing else but say that he told and untruth here. He says these things which he cannot prove. I challenge him to get on to the same platform with me in Vryheid and to allege there that I held meetings to advise the farmers to sell their land. Why does he tell these untruths here? But, Mr. Chairman, that was their policy. I attended a meeting when the late Dr. Douglas Smith and the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) came to Helpmekaar and tried to persuade the farmers to sell all their land in that area. It was their policy to purchase that whole White area. They left there with their tails between their legs.</p>

<p>But let me sketch the background of this whole campaign. It was during the regime of the United Party&#x2014;and at that time the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) represented Vryheid&#x2014;that they jumped over the natural border, the Mvuyana, to purchase the farms Tradouw, Purim and Strydpoort. It was during their regime that they crossed that natural border, and what is happening now? Now he is running up and down all over that area. At Coronation he stated that the hon. the Minister and I wanted to purchase all that land up to Vryheid.</p>

<p>The unfortunate part is that when the hon. member comes there to sow evil he does not speak from a public platform where people can settle accounts with him, but he stays in the background and causes trouble without having the courage to hold a meeting and to make those allegations. In 1959 a prominent member of the United Party, Commandant Piet Taljaard, who was their candidate in the Provincial election, suggested at Nqutu that the whole area from Scheeper&#x2019;s Nek along the Sandspruit right up to where it joins the White Umfulosi should be sold to the Bantu. And then this hon. member grasped at that suggestion and went round about the people and told them that I intended selling that area to the Government.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Why did he not come to the second meeting held at Calverts? He sowed this evil, but did not have the courage to come there. When I saw what area the United Party supporters wanted to sell, I asked that a representative meeting should be convened because I could not accept that <span class="col_3835-3836" refersTo="page_0544"/>decision. A representative meeting was then convened at Calverts. What happened then? Then the hon. Senator Friend came along and suggested that not one single inch more land should be purchased in Natal, contrary to an Act they passed. I pointed out to them the foolishness of this. Where was the compensating land to come from if we had to clear up the Black spots? How must the Bantu homelands be rounded off? Then the resolution was changed. And now they are again busy fomenting trouble in Natal by telling the people that we want to sell the whole of Vryheid to the Bantu. I say that is scandalous behaviour. I want to warn the hon. member for South Coast. He is playing this game, but he should be careful of the cohorts he is using. He should be careful of his advisers, because they are giving him the wrong advice. He should not think that he will harm me and the Government. They tried it once, and last year they received a beating such as they have never before had in Vryheid, and they will receive an even greater beating as the result of these slanderous stories they are telling there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast does not have the courage to visit those northern parts because the people there will settle accounts with him. I merely say that this is a scandalous policy of the leader of that party in Natal. Natal has many problems, and he realizes that. He should rather put his shoulder to the wheel and think soberly about these matters, and we must all co-operate in order to solve those tremendous problems satisfactorily. But he serves no good purpose by fomenting trouble amongst the White people there. He says that we are following a Kenya policy. I ask him to tell those immigrants from Kenya who want to come here, and who particularly want to come to Natal: Do not come here because a Kenya policy is being followed here! But the hon. member reminds me of a whirlwind. He delights most of all in blowing across a yard full of rubble and dirt, which he sucks up and then like Jan F. Cilliers&#x2019; pig deposits with a sigh of joy in a place which is always swept clean. That does not redound to his honour. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that the hon. member will forgive me if I do not follow him in the spleenventing which we have just had from him. I think that the hon. member will also forgive me if I tell him that with my knowledge of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) I am certain that he would not allow the hon. member to advertise himself by appearing on the same platform with him. If that hon. member wishes to hold meetings, he must convene his own meetings. If he cannot obtain sufficient publicity, he must not try to make use of the hon. member for South Coast to assemble people to listen to the spleen-venting that we have had here from him this afternoon. I do not wish to pursue this point any further; I just want to say that what he described here as being good Afrikaans is usually classed as kitchen Afrikaans.</p>

<p>I want to come back rather to what the hon. the Prime Minister said in connection with compensation to European persons who are in the Transkei to-day, when he said that the farmers in the Transkei would receive fair compensation for their land and that land had already been purchased; that the White people living in the Transkei would have and retain the franchise in the White areas; that the public servants there would be permitted to return to the rest of White South Africa; and where he said later that all the Whites in the Transkei would be taken care of and that they would not be dealt with as Great Britain dealt with the Europeans in Kenya. However, Mr. Chairman, there is something which the hon. the Prime Minister forgets and which hon. members on the other side forget. When White people went to Kenya, it was a foreign territory. The people who are in the Transkei to-day went to live there because it was part of South Africa, their homeland. It was not a foreign territory.</p>

<p>What that hon. member apparently means is that I have the courage of a man and that means more courage than he possesses. I want to revert to what the hon. the Prime Minister said. He spoke about the Transkei and he told us how safe it was there for the White man. When we spoke about what was going to happen in the rest of South Africa, he said that the arguments that there was unrest amongst the people living in the other areas where independent states may also be set up in the future were inflated arguments. That is the difficulty with this Government. They promise things, they create uncertainty, and then they do not wish to face up to the difficulty. I have here a cutting from the <i>Transvaler</i> in which the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government will probably shortly announce important plans for the more rapid development of the Bantu homelands &#x2026; It is learnt from high sources that these <span class="col_3837-3838" refersTo="page_0545"/>steps will cover a threefold direction, namely, the promotion of the Bantu homelands in the political sphere, the strengthening of their economic life and the promotion of sound human and group relationships &#x2026; The establishment of territorial Authorities for the Transkei, the Ciskei and the Tswana has already been effected. Those for the South-Sotho and the North-Sotho have practically reached the stage where their formal establishment can be resorted to. The Territorial Authority for Zululand may still be given the final touches this year. The establishment of Authorities for the Venda/Tsonga is being delayed by negotiations between the two groups on the question &#x2026;</block>

<p>The date is 6 December 1961. That was precisely four months ago. As I said, Mr. Chairman, this Government makes promises. They promise these things and they talk about the creation of Bantu homelands and then they do not wish to face up to the difficulties.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister said to-day that the boundaries of the Transkei were clear. I am not sure whether the hon. the Prime Minister actually knows what is going on there. I find the following in the <i>Burger</i> of 2 February of this year&#x2014;in case my hon. friends say that four months is a long time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the draft (that is for the Transkei) the Transkei is defined as the 26 districts of the present Transkei with the possible addition in the indefinite future of a number of districts such as Glen Grey (at present a part of the Ciskei). Elliott. Indwe. Herschel and Maclear.</block>

<p>They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The day before yesterday, when the Bantu members of the committee met in the afternoon, without European officials being present, a definite resolution was adopted regarding the future expansion of the Transkei, and the district of Kokstad and a small portion of Southern Natal were also mentioned.</block>

<p>This is a quotation from the <i>Burger,</i> the Nationalist Party paper, and the hon. the Prime Minister must not complain because he spoke about inflated arguments. I want to remind him that in October 1959, Mr. de Wet Nel, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, stated at the Free State Nationalist Congress: &#x201C;Give me two years and I will show you a new South Africa.&#x201D; That was three-and-a-half years ago. Now he speaks about the next five years and then he will show us a new South Africa. In the meantime, however, the hon. the Prime Minister speaks about inflated arguments when we tell him that the farmers of South Africa are perturbed about what is going to happen to their land. The hon. the Prime Minister spoke about the franchise which the people will have in the Bantu homelands and I then asked him what these people were going to live on. His reply was: Certainly not off her. That is quite correct, but he did not tell us what they were going to live on. Then he said that the argument that the farmers were worried was an inflated argument. However, I have proof here in regard to resolutions which have been adopted on various occasions in this connection by the South African Agricultural Union. At the Congress of the South African Agricultural Union on 30 April 1961, held in Sea Point, they introduced the following motion <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The motion asks that a fixed programme be worked out for land purchases and requests the Department of Lands to adopt a policy whereby land, evacuated by Bantu, which became the property of the State, would be offered by closed auction to farmers whose land had been purchased by the Bantu Trust for Bantu settlement.</block>

That hon. member for Hillbrow is very concerned about the White man&#x2019;s interests today: we are now turning South Africa into a Kenya; we are applying the Kenya policy to the White man in the Transkei! Does the hon. member not realize where their policy is leading us to? Does he not listen when the Prime Minister talks? Did the hon. the Prime Minister not explain clearly what the difference was between the actions of the British Government towards Kenya and the actions which the Republican Government contemplate here?</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. member and I am surprised at the attitude which he adopts. I simply cannot believe it. I wish to ask you this question Where will we find ourselves if we accept the policy of the United Party, a policy which provides for the retention of the Bantu areas and a policy which provides for the Bantu to be governed together with the White man within the White man's area? [Interjections.] Do you mean to tell me that is not your policy? Do you allege that is not your policy? Is their policy not to share the government jointly under the whole federation plan which they advocate?</p>

<p>However, Mr. Chairman, we are in a difficult position, because we form part of a pattern which has become difficult throughout the world and because, as I said yesterday, we are faced with a whole world which wish to attack us on a number of fronts. And the Opposition plays a role in that whole campaign of attacking us on as many fronts as possible. Fortunately&#x2014;and I say it is very fortunate&#x2014; we are as prepared as we are to meet this crisis in which we find ourselves. I wish to mention five fronts on which we have prepared ourselves. Let me mention the first one and as I said yesterday as far as that one is concerned, I wish to give the credit to our Prime Minister. He deserves the credit for having cut this knot by giving definite shape to our policy of separate development. Hon. members opposite may laugh at the Transkeian policy. You may ridicule it; you may wish to draw a veil over it; you may wish to raise dust; you may try to sow suspicion; you may try to erect fences to confuse the people outside; you may try to present yourselves as the so-called champions of the White man&#x2019;s interests in the Transkei, but that will not avail you at all. You will never, never succeed in putting an end to this revolutionary process which has started with this statement in regard to the Transkei. That knot has been cut. In the future development of this country the Transkei will be our valuable ally. We have also cut a second knot and I am grateful for that. We have two English-speaking members in this Cabinet. Yes, laugh about that! But there is a deep significance to that. <span class="col_3841-3842" refersTo="page_0547"/>After this constitutional knot had been cut through two English-speaking members entered the Cabinet as the symbol of the further progress which had to take place and which has taken place once the Prime Minister had cut this constitutional knot.</p>

<p>When my time expired a moment ago I was engaged in reading from this article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Land still to be purchased includes more than 1,000,000 morgen in the Transvaal, about 950,000 morgen in the Cape and 300,000 morgen in Natal.<br/>According to the Secretary of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, Mr. N. J. Deacon, his Union and the South African Agricultural Union have resolved to ask the Government to purchase, as quickly as possible, the balance of the land. Mr. Deacon said that Natal farmers were anxious to have this question settled.</block>

<p>Here I have another report which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farmers want facts on Bantu areas: The resolution, which delegates said dealt with a problem of national importance, was introduced &#x201C;to dispel uncertainty among farmers in the border areas&#x201D;. <br/>Mr. M. C. van Rooyen said that the average farmer, particularly those living near or on the reserve borders, was living in uncertainty because they did not know what the future held for them. <br/>A lengthy resolution on the economic situation called on the General Council of the Union to discuss with the Government a basis for an overall policy.</block>

<p>In yesterday&#x2019;s newspaper we get the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farmers in the Natal Midlands, concerned at overtures made to the Government to purchase land in the area for African resettlement, hope to hear full details of Government plans within the next two weeks. Farmers have opposed the proposal on principle so far because of lack of information.</block>

<p>Then they continue and say Mr. M. C. van Rooyen was sent to Pretoria to determine the position because farmers found themselves in this impossible situation.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Prime Minister talks about exaggerated arguments when resolution after resolution is passed by the agricultural unions in this regard. He talks about exaggerated arguments when the Secretary of Lands is sending circulars to people in Zululand and Natal, proposing that 200,000 Bantu from seven reserves should be removed to what is now White man&#x2019;s land.</p>

<p>I want to ask them what they think about the position. In what world does the Prime Minister live? What interest can he have in the farmers of South Africa if he says things like that, and when he talks about exaggerated arguments? The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister says it will only be purchased in the released areas, and he says that consolidation will not amount to buying out, but that there will be a consolidation of the existing Bantu areas. He says that, as a result, there will be no more released farms, because no more farms will border on those areas. But where does the Prime Minister get that from? Because the more consolidation there is. the longer the borders and the greater the number of bordering farms. A Standard II child should be able to work that out. The fact of the matter is that, when the Prime Minister says that, and when he says that it is an exaggerated argument that the farmers are worried, then I want to ask him what guarantee the farmers have who are living in those areas to-day, where another 1,000,000 morgen will have to be sold in the Transvaal and 600,000 acres in Natal and 950,000 in the Cape Province&#x2026;.

<p>In 1953, as quoted here by the hon. member for Kensington, the Prime Minister said independence would be granted in 100 or 200 years&#x2019; time and in 1959 he spoke of the distant future and in 1961 he still spoke of the distant future, but only a few months later he announced that independence would be granted soon. Today he says me must wait for it in peace and the farmers must be satisfied and the traders in those areas must be satisfied. And what does he say he will give them? He will give them the vote in the White area. What makes the National Party think that the people, whether White or Black, are interested solely in the vote? Surely there is much more in life than only the vote. Does the Prime Minister think that if he gives them the vote in the Transkei, however poor they may be, that they will be satisfied? The Prime Minister says we of the United Party believe in a mixed state, but the Nationalists believe in a White Government and Black neighbouring states with whom we will be on a friendly footing. Where will that White state be? Is it not a fact that there will still be twice as many Bantu as Whites in that so-called White state? The Prime Minister also tells us how much better he is treating the people in the Transkei, which will be the first independent state, than Britain is treating the Whites in Kenya. But when we ask him exactly what his plans are and to tell us where the borders of the Black independent states will be and to tell us immediately so that the farmers and the traders may know what to do and so that we may know what the future pattern will be, he refuses to reply. And do you know why he refuses to reply? The Nationalist Party is afraid that the people will have realized the extent of the chaos which existed in this country under this Government by the time the next election takes place. They are also afraid that the people will realize and know exactly what is going to happen and how Black this country will become and how many White people will be displaced and how many Black people will be removed from where they are living to-day. The Prime Minister should not get up here and tell us with a holy smile on his face that he intends looking after the White people in the Transkei. The truth of the matter is that &#x201C;the White man in the Transkei is expendable&#x201D;, but he is simply not interested in them. The truth of the matter is that on account of his own policy, the Prime Minister has been forced by the outside world and by circumstances beyond his control to follow a policy which will result in the fragmentation of South Africa, our beloved fatherland; because of him, South Africa is alone in the world to-day. Not only will it result in the fragmentation of our beloved fatherland, but it will also cause suffering to our people, to our farmers and to the people who are today in a state of stagnation and who simply does not know what will happen in the country. If the Prime Minister wants to do South Africa a service, he should demarcate the borders clearly for us to-day and tell us where those territories will be and when he intends declaring them independent and what he intends doing with the White man in those territories.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) was lecturing us and putting up the fight which she did a moment ago I noticed how jealously the Leader of the United Party looked at her; he was jealous to see a woman who could put up such a fight. The hon. member who tried so hard to hold her own gave us an anthology of the resolutions which were passed in connection with the land which has to be purchased. I wish to ask her this definite question Does the United Party still stand by the 1936 Act and the agreement which stipulates how much land must be purchased? That is the first question. I want to know whether the United Party still stands by the Act which was unanimously passed by them in 1936 because that Act lays down how much land must still be purchased in order to carry out the policy of establishing Bantu homelands. I wish to know whether the United Party still subscribes to that Act. The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) made a peculiar admission to-day. He said that South Africa was the boundary of the Bantu homelands. In other words they are departing from the 1936 Act and they will purchase the land which that Act provides for and they will not give political rights to the Bantu in those areas alone; they will turn the whole of South Africa into Bantu homelands.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow, who fled from Vryheid, must tell us whether the United Party still supports the 1936 provision. Why do they try to make the voters and the agricultural unions believe that we will be buying more land? Why do they get up in this House and, with tears in their eyes, talk about our beloved fatherland when we are simply carrying out the 1936 Act? Surely that is not being politically honest. The hon. member for Drakensberg told us that the Secretary for Lands had directed a certain circular to the agricultural union of Natal. Why does she not give the true facts to the House? In 1960 the Minister of Lands addressed the congress of the Zululand Public Bodies and told them that 600,000 morgen still had to be purchased in order to give effect to the 1936 Act. He invited them to put suggestions forward. He told them that there was still so much Crown Land in Natal which could be cut up into settlements, etc., but Natal still had to provide so much land <span class="col_3845-3846" refersTo="page_0549"/>and he told them that he was giving them the opportunity, as responsible people and people who had the interests of that area at heart, to put forward suggestions. The United Party tried to attach a political meaning to this friendly invitation issued by the Minister. The hon. member for South Coast is not present at the moment but I wish to point out that as a result of that invitation a meeting was called in April 1961 which the hon. member for South Coast attended together with Senator Pretorius, and where a committee was appointed&#x2014;the Land Tenure Committee&#x2014;with Mr. Rautenbach as chairman and Mr. Pretorius and Mr. Bertram <i>ex officio</i> because he is chairman of the Zululand Public Bodies. I wish to appeal to the United Party and the hon. member for South Coast in heaven&#x2019;s name to start to act responsibly towards South Africa, responsibly towards the Whites as well as towards the non-Whites. Because, what did these hon. members do at that meeting? What did they recommend to the Land Tenure Committee? The hon. member for South Coast, who consistently wants to invite the non-Whites to come and join us here in Parliament and to join us in governing South Africa under their federation plan, suggested to the Land Tenure Committee that it should sow fear, distrust and enmity between the Whites and the non-Whites if they tried to determine in a friendly spirit which portions should be consolidated. What did he do? He suggested that Mr. Rautenbach should, on behalf of the Land Tenure Committee, submit a plan to the Zululand Public Bodies in which it should be suggested that certain strips and portions of the Bantu area should be cut off so as to create a four-mile wide corridor from Matubatuba as far as Durban and to tell the people that in future that corridor will have to be patrolled with the necessary weapons because there will be enmity and war if this plan is carried out. That was the suggestion which that hon. member made. I find this in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 24 December&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Instead of Natives in Zululand getting some of the 600,000 acres owing to them under the Native Trust Act, they may lose 147,000 acres and their kraals if a recommendation of the Land Tenure Committee of the Zululand Public Bodies is approved by the Government.</block>

<p>The interesting thing is that committee does not know who suggested that nor does the Zululand Public Bodies know, and the information had to be extracted with a corkscrew that it did not emanate from the hon. member for Zululand but from the hon. member for South Coast. Why? Because the hon. member for South Coast tried to get those people to convey a recommendation to the Natal Agricultural Union with the sole object of trying to wreck the whole idea of establishing Bantu homelands. That was not all, however, but the object was also to sow distrust and enmity among the Bantu. They submitted this memorandum to the Natal Agricultural Union on 26 September 1961 and the Land Tenure Committee and the Zululand Public Bodies wanted to know on whose behalf they were submitting it. The hon. member for South Coast was the person who did it. Does he and the United Party think that they are making a contribution towards the creation of the right human relationship if they come into this House and pretend the one day to be opposing the Government as the so-called oppressors of the Bantu and say the next day: We do not trust the Bantu; they are a crowd of dishonest people against whom we have to arm ourselves and establish safeguarding corridors. I have never as yet come across more irresponsible action than that towards South Africa. Do you know what those hon. members remind me of, Sir? You have already watched rugby matches at Newlands with me and when the Springboks kick the ball clearly over the posts a certain section of the crowd jeer at them and when the All Blacks score a try they are cheered. These hon. members of the United Party remind me of the skollies who can see no good in South Africa. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like immediately to come to the point raised by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins), whether the U.P. stands by the promise contained in the 1936 Act. I would like to say quite frankly that in accordance with the resolution passed by the Union Congress of the United Party, the U.P. stands four-square by the promise in regard to the acquisition of land contained in the 1936 Act which was an Act passed by the U.P. despite the objections of the Nationalists at that time. I am very glad they stand by it now, but the U.P. stands four-square for the acquisition of the land in terms of the 1936 Act. This is what our resolution says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Congress of the United Party records that it is mindful of and maintains the pledge given by Gen. Hertzog in 1936 to provide for the Bantu of the Union 7&#x00BD; million morgen of land under conditions which maintain that land as an integral part of the Union.</block>

<p>Nobody will deny that the provisions of the 1936 Act, are dealing with that land&#x2014;it is implicit in the Act and in the Act which was passed at the same time, the Representation of Natives Act, which was repealed by this Government, lay down that South Africa was going to be governed by the representatives of the various race groups but was to be maintained as an integral whole. The second clause of the resolution says this&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) Expresses its entire opposition to the acquisition and alienation of more land for the Government&#x2019;s avowed purpose of giving it to Bantu tribes which under the Bantustan policy of the Government are to form independent, sovereign states, whether such land is to-day Crown land or in private ownership; and</li>

<li>(3) Calls upon the Prime Minister forthwith to define the boundaries of the proposed new independent Bantu states for the information of South Africa.</li>

</ol>

<p>That resolution is perfectly clear in its terms. The objection is to the principle which I am not allowed to discuss now, I understand, but perhaps I can refer to it, i.e. the principle of the creation of these independent states.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Whether I voted for it or not is beside the point. The point is that the resolution was carried and the important fact by which I stand four-square is that the U.P. will maintain the provisions of the 1936 Act, and I hope that we will have no further arguments about that matter.</p>

<p>What we must realize in this country is this, that what we are all seeking is a method of government which will ensure that the various groups, White and Black and the Coloured people, will be able to live in peace in South Africa and that it will be a permanent home for all the people of South Africa. What is in dispute is the method of achieving it. I do not propose to deal in this regard with splinter parties. I want to deal with the position of the Government party and the party to which I have honour to belong. Let me say at once that the first cardinal point of difference between the two parties is that the U.P. stands for the maintenance of the present boundaries of South Africa and for the government of the Republic of South Africa by the people of South Africa; that we are utterly opposed to the creation of independent Bantu states. It is true that it may take some time, but we are utterly opposed to it and believe that it would be tremendously dangerous. I want to deal with that in some detail and to show how it affects the Transvaal in particular before I go on to other points.</p>

<p>We know that at present only one such territory is being proclaimed, the Transkei. It is a consolidated area and there is of course the suggestion of further consolidation. That has been said on several occasions, but the area as it stands is a consolidated area. So far as the Transvaal is concerned, we are not in that happy position and if one looks at the very valuable maps which form part of the report of the Tomlinson Commission, one will see the immense difficulty which this policy of the Government holds in store for the future of the Transvaal if they can ever reach the stage to which they are rapidly advancing. The position is that there are a large number of areas in the Transvaal, something like 84, but of those, certain areas are very big. There is the Olifants-Steelpoort-Blyderivier area, which is 1.4 million morgen <span class="col_3849-3850" refersTo="page_0551"/>and which stretches from the centre of the Transvaal right to the border of the Kruger National Park. It lies right athwart the centre of the eastern half of the Transvaal. [Interjection.] All the maps are the same, but this particular one is Map No. 6. Then you come to the Letaba-Shingwedyi area, which is 1.3 million morgen. The next biggest area is No. 5 on the map, the Bochum-Potgietersrust area, .8 million morgen, and then the next largest is No. 8 on the map, the Rustenburg-Pilanesberg area, which is .7 million morgen. It should be borne in mind that although these are only four of the reserves in the Transvaal &#x2014;and I concede that the others are very much smaller&#x2014;these four reserves together spread right from the eastern boundary, the Kruger Park, to the western border, and in the centre there are two other areas, one of which is the Hammanskraal area and the other the area at Premier Mine. Those areas stretch almost unbroken to the western border of the Transvaal, where they come very close to the Bechuanaland border. The two areas I mentioned first are in the north and they lie one to the north-east and the other to the north-west of Pietersburg, which is being developed as an industrial area. One has only to look at this map to realize the utter impossibility in the event of an attack on the Transvaal of defending it if these areas, either in their present form or in a greater consolidated form, have been turned into independent Bantu states lying right across the heart of the Transvaal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when business was suspended I was dealing with the reserves in the Transvaal and the effect of Government policy on that area. I would like to point out that approximately 20 per cent of the total area of the Transvaal is or will become Native area. In fact, the area may be slightly over that figure. Apart from the territories to which I have referred, it is a fact that in terms of the policy of the last President of the South African Republic, President Kruger, there is a very large number of small areas which in terms of the law do not exceed 3,000 morgen in extent. Those small areas are spread throughout the Transvaal. It is very important that there should be clarity in regard to the future of those areas from every point of view. I should like to submit to the hon. the Prime Minister that a very definite responsibility rests on him to bring clarity to this whole confused picture. I want to tell the Prime Minister that not only are statements which he makes in this House denied on platforms by some of his colleagues in the Cabinet, but my experience has been that hon. members on the other side apparently do not know what the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy is because very often they are simply not prepared to stand by that policy on public platforms. [Interjections.] Sir. all I am pleading for is this. Hon. members will get an opportunity of replying. I hope they will allow me to state my case. The point which I wish to put is this that there is immense confusion. I do believe that as far as we are concerned we want clarity. I repeat we are all in this country. We have to solve this problem and on the successful solution of this problem the future of the White people of this country depends. It is of equal interest to us on this side of the House as it is to hon. members on the other side. We can only do this effectively if there is complete clarity as to what it is for which the different parties stand. [Interjections.] I do appeal to hon. members to give the hon. the Prime Minister an opportunity of hearing what I am saying so that he can reply to it. It will only be an act of courtesy to him if not to me. I want to plead with the Prime Minister to clarify a number of issues. I have pointed out the number of very great difficulties with which the Transvaal is faced if what is my conception of the Nationalist Party is carried out.</p>

<p>All right, the National Party if members prefer that. If the policy of this Government is carried out you will have a band of areas right across the centre of the Transvaal which will become independent. Two of those were not included in the proposed consolidation in terms of Map No. 63 of the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s report. However, we were told by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration that as far as the Hammanskraal areas was concerned, it was not the policy of the Government to act upon the recommendation of the Tomlinson Commission and that would remain a permanent Native area. I presume that also applies to the Premier Mine area, but that is not so important. Whatever the position is, there is a band across the centre of the Transvaal. There are problems in the eastern and the western corners of the Transvaal, and, of course, there are very great problems in the north. What is of the greatest urgency and importance, Sir, is that the people of the Transvaal should know exactly what the policy of the Government is. Which of these areas are to be permanent? Let me say at once that there are many areas where a point cuts right into them and where it will probably be desirable that they should be taken over, but which of those areas are to be taken over? Because in many of these areas we are dealing with land which is comparatively of little value&#x2014;land which can only be used for grazing purposes. However, in other areas we are dealing with land which is either irrigation land already or where the possibilities for irrigation exist. That land is the most valuable land in the whole of this country. I think the hon. the Prime Minister owes it to the country to make his own position clear. He should make it clear that if it is the policy of the Nationalist Party to consolidate, how that consolidation is to be carried out; to what extent it will be carried out. And <span class="col_3851-3852" refersTo="page_0552"/>if it is not to be carried out, then the country is entitled to know that is no longer the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>I defy the hon. the Chief Whip to get up and to tell us what the policy of the Government is in regard to consolidation. He cannot do it. Sir. There is only one man in this country who can tell us that and that is the hon. the Prime Minister. My plea to him is to take the country into his confidence and to deal with this matter this evening.</p>

<p>But it is not only that, Sir; clarity is wanted and it is wanted urgently, in regard to the policy regarding industries on the borders of the reserves in relation to the urban areas. Here I would like to say that I am very glad indeed that there have been declarations by hon. Ministers in recent times in which they have said that the prosperity of the established areas will be maintained. I am appealing to the hon. the Prime Minister to make it perfectly clear this evening that will be done. It is again in the highest interests of the Transvaal that we should know where we stand. There are towns which, without further industrialization, must die. And I submit that it is the duty of the Prime Minister to put the question in relation to those areas beyond any doubt. Then those will be matters which we will not have to debate any further in this House. Then there is the question of the pace of development of these areas. I think an explanation in that regard is owing to this House. I think it is necessary. I would like to say that perhaps we have not as much time as we think in regard to these grave problems which face us. I would say to the hon. the Prime Minister that I believe it is a matter of urgency that he should deal with these matters.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we have the question of the political rights. I wish to point out that the Prime Minister has adopted a completely new policy as far as the Nationalist Party is concerned. I want to quote from Hansard of 1951, col. 6820. The speaker I am quoting is the hon. the late Prime Minister. Dr. Malan. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In regard to the Natives in South Africa we have announced over and over again that we will give them more and more self-governing powers in their own territories, gradually and slowly as they achieved the ability of such power and get the sense of responsibility they need.</block>

<p>There is no dispute from this side of the House in regard to that. There may be disputes as to what should be the type of political rights which they should be given. But there is no doubt whatsoever as to the granting of a measure of self-government. The hon. the Prime Minister went on and he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In their own areas they will always have to stand under the guardianship and the domination of the White man in South Africa. Call it &#x201C;baaskap&#x201D; or call it what you like. We have always used the expression that we are the guardians and we remain the guardians.</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has quite clearly departed from that policy. It will help us, Sir, if he would confirm that; then it will not be necessary for us to argue about it. It will assist us if he confirmed that he no longer stood by that declaration of Dr. Malan&#x2019;s and that there has been a fundamental change in the policy of the Nationalist Party as far as those political rights were concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I make this appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister. I believe that if he would make a clear declaration of policy on these points, if he would make a declaration which leaves no doubt, he would be clarifying the political atmosphere in this country. If it is his policy that these territories can become independent he should in all seriousness consider the dangers of such a policy and consider whether it would not be very much better to adopt the policy of this side of the House in terms of which policy we believe that there must be local self-government to a large extent.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to deal briefly with what the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) said a moment ago. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party stands four-square by the Act of 1936.</block>

<p>The Act of 1936 provides unequivocally and subject to no conditions&#x2014;and I emphasize that no conditions will be attached to it&#x2014;that in addition to the scheduled areas as provided for by the 1913 legislation under which we hold the Native reserves, 7,250,000 morgen of additional land have to be acquired for the Bantu. That is called the &#x201C;quota&#x201D;. Certain areas have been designated where this quota has to be purchased. Those areas are called released areas. The 1936 Act does not lay down any provisions. The underlying idea was that the Bantu should have their homeland there and that they should be given political rights there. The hon. member for Germiston (District) quoted the late Dr. Malan a moment ago. I wish to quote what the late General Smuts said in this connection. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3853-3854" refersTo="page_0553"/>If we are to solve the Native question, it is useless to try to govern Black and White in the same way and to subject them to the same forms of legislation. It is hopeless to try that. They are different, not only in colour, but also in soul. They are different in political structure and their political institutions should be different.</block>

<p>In other words, different in two senses, Mr. Chairman. Not only should there not be one House or legislative institution but there should be another government or another institution.</p>

<p>If it says &#x201C;separate institutions&#x201D; you cannot do otherwise but take it that there should be &#x201C;separate states&#x201D;. I quoted it a moment ago. If the hon. member does not understand it I suggest that he reads it himself. The hon. member for Germiston (District) tells us to-day that they are &#x201C;foursquare&#x201D; behind it. In support of his statement that they are &#x201C;four-square&#x201D; behind that legislation, he quotes the resolution passed by the United Party at the Bloemfontein congress but where they added this little tailpiece&#x2014;&#x201C;as an integral part of South Africa&#x201D;. My submission is that not at any time did General Smuts or General Hertzog or Dr. Malan or any of our previous leaders who were present on that occasion, ask that it should be &#x201C;an integral part of South Africa&#x201D;. As a matter of fact as long ago as 1913, General Hertzog said, when they were arguing in this House about the scheduled areas, that he foresaw that they would have to have self-government and independence in those areas.</p>

<p>Quote it.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It has already been quoted three or four times in this House. I cannot help it if the hon. member does not know that. It was only last year that the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) quoted it. He quoted chapter and verse. Dr. Malan also said it, as appears from the quotation which the hon. member for Germiston (District) read a moment ago. The hon. member tries to suggest to-day that we are advocating a different policy from that of Dr. Malan. Had we developed stage by stage, as Dr. Malan says there, surely there should at least have been a guardian under whom that stage-by-stage development should have taken place. That is all that Dr. Malan is saying there. He says nothing more. I am sure he did not envisage that we should be able to keep them in a subordinate position for all time. That was never his intention. He did say, however, that they should develop step by step and that as long as that development was taking place it had to take place under the guardianship of the White man. I think it is a poor effort on the part of the hon. member for Germiston (District) to try to sit on two stools. The same thing will happen to him which always happens to the United Party. They are continually trying to sit on two stools but they miss both. On the face of it they wish to have the benefits which the 1936 legislation offers; they want to try to follow the suggestions put forward by General Smuts and General Hertzog. But ultimately they come forward with the little tailpiece that it should be an &#x201C;integral part of South Africa&#x201D;. Their objective is the same as that of the Progressive Party, namely that the whole of South Africa must be Black. That is the only reason why it should be &#x201C;an integral part&#x201D; of the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with the provisions regarding the boundaries. The hon. member for Germiston (District) referred to the map in the Tomlinson Commission Report. I think the hon. member was in the Other Place at the time. But he will remember that a White Paper was issued as a result of this report. The Tomlinson Commission advocated a bloc formation in their report. They did not actually advocate it; it was really only a suggestion on their part. A White Paper was issued by the hon. the Prime Minister who was then Minister of Native Affairs in respect of that suggested bloc formation. Paragraph 20 of that White Paper rejects that so-called bloc formation idea contained in the Tomlinson report as being impracticable. What is envisaged to-day? I can do no better than to refer to what the Prime Minister said as recently as two weeks ago in this House in that connection. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, what is in fact necessary in terms of providing additional land is to provide such land as will assist in consolidating these areas into economic units. But in this process of consolidation it is not necessary to buy all the land belonging to Whites which lies in between Black spots. There should also be a process of the exchange of land. Therefore the whole problem of additional land and the exchange of land must stand over until there is a separate government for such an area.</block>

<p>He then continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Therefore it is essential that this process should rather take place through proper co-operation between the Bantu Government and the White Government. That also applies to the question of determining the borders. Of course there must be borders immediately.</block>

<p>He says there must be borders. There are borders to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, every tribal authority in the Bantu area has borders. Those borders have been defined by proclamation. The borders of every regional authority have been defined by notice in the <i>Government</i> <span class="col_3855-3856" refersTo="page_0554"/><i>Gazette.</i> Every territorial authority has had its borders announced in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> In the case of the territorial authority of the Transkei as well, if that hon. member does not know it, the borders have been defined according to a <i>Government Gazette.</i> The territorial authority is receiving greater power to-day. [Interjections.] You asked: &#x201C;Where are they?&#x201D; You did not ask where they will be; you asked where they are and I am replying to that question. These borders exist to-day; they are there as proclaimed in <i>Government Gazettes.</i> Hon. members now ask where they will be. Very well, the Prime Minister has already said that there will be a measure of exchange. In future those borders will be changed; that is true but that will take place by way of exchange, as the Prime Minister has said. Hon. members can read that in col. 87 of the speech he made on 23 January. I do not wish to repeat his speech.</p>

<p>The next point raised was in connection with political rights. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories said that the Prime Minister should at least have discussed the rights of the White people this afternoon. I wish to emphasize immediately that Bantu authorities have never as yet had any jurisdiction over any White person. The rights of the White people, therefore, fall under the jurisdiction of the White Republic; under the Government of the White Republic and under it alone. That is the only authority which has jurisdiction over them. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am absolutely stunned; I did not know that they had lost their fighting spirit to that extent. It seems to me that the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) is so surprised that they won the election that he forgot to jump up.</p>

<p>During the last few hours we have been discussing the problem of our race relations here in South Africa. As far as I am concerned, the tragedy of the whole matter is the contributions which we get from the opposite benches, even the contribution of a dear old member like the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). He asked a question to which I wish to reply. He asked that we should once and for all give a clear reply to the question of whether these Bantu homelands will ever be able to develop into complete independence. My reply is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. I trust he understands that now. Does the hon. member understand that? If he understands it he must promise me that he will not ask that question again during this Session. If the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) is not satisfied he may repeat that question to the hon. the Prime Minister. I wish to assure him, however, that the Prime Minister will give him exactly the same answer as I have just given. But in that case he too must promise me that he will not again ask that question for the following five years.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what I cannot understand and what I find so strange on the part of these people who present themselves as the alternative Government, is the frivolous and censorious attitude which they adopt when we are trying to solve a problem, a problem which, humanly speaking, can really not be solved. Let me put it this way: In my opinion this separate development which we are trying here in South Africa is the greatest experiment in human relationships which has ever been undertaken in the history of the world. Here we are in South Africa to-day; we did not bring about this position; we did not find it like this; it has just developed. We are faced with the greatest problem in human relations which has ever existed in the history of any part of the world. That problem of human relations would in any case have been the most difficult problem even if there were no interference from the world outside, even if we did not have UNO. even if we did not have an undermining English-language Press, even if we did not have a hopeless Opposition. Even if we did not have any of those things the problem of human relations which we have here in South Africa would have been the most difficult problem which any part of the world has had to contend with. We are here, a small nation, faced with the problem of race intermingling, with the problem of human relations in a large degree, a problem which faces other countries only in a small degree. In reality all the racial problems which other countries have are present here in the Republic of South Africa. What is that problem as it has revealed itself? It is a problem which arises where you have different groups, where you have various groups together in one country, where you have Whites, where you have Bantu, where you have Blacks, where you have Asiatics and we have the whole crowd here in the Republic of South Africa. How can we solve that problem? How can you get away from discrimination? That is the problem which faces every country where there are mixed groups together. Wherever you have these groups together on the Continent of Africa or in any part of the world, you find discrimination against a certain group. In Africa, during the colonial period, there was discrimination against the coloured races, against the Asiatic races, against the Indians, against the Coloureds and against the Black nations. The problem to-day is this: How can you abolish discrimination against the non-White races without replacing that with discrimination against the White races? That is our problem here in the Republic of South Africa. That is the problem in the whole of Africa. As I have said we are conducting an experiment here, an experiment which holds out the only solution. In our experiment we are trying to abolish discrimination against the non-Whites without that resulting in discrimination against the Whites. Every other solution which has been tried on the Continent of Africa has failed. Wherever they have abolished discrimination against the Black man it has been substituted by discrimination against the White man. That was the case in Ghana; that was the case in Nigeria; and that is the <span class="col_3857-3858" refersTo="page_0555"/>case in Tanganyika and in Kenya. And that is what is happening in Rhodesia, in Nyasaland, and which is on the point of happening in Southern Rhodesia. How can you abolish discrimination against the Black man without that being substituted by discrimination against the White man? In the rest of Africa the pattern which the British Government wanted to enforce, the pattern which the Belgian Government applies to the Congo, has led to it that discrimination against the Black man has been substituted by discrimination against the White man. I challenge hon. members opposite to name any country on the Continent of Africa where that was not the pattern which developed under the policy of &#x201C;partnership&#x201D;, under the policy which they call White leadership with justice. Throughout the Continent of Africa where they tried to apply any other policy than the policy of separate development that has been the position. Discrimination against the Black man was abolished; good and well, but you found a new conception of discrimination, namely discrimination against the White man in its place. I say, therefore, that we are conducting the biggest experiment in human relationships here in South Africa that has ever been conducted in the history of the world. And we are beginning to succeed, or at least, the possibilities are there that we will succeed. We can do away with discrimination against the Black man without replacing it by discrimination against the White man. Not only discrimination, but as the hon. the Minister of Information says, discrimination which will ultimately lead to the extermination of the White man. That policy is the policy of separate development. That is not the policy of the present Prime Minister; that is the traditional policy of South Africa. That is the policy which developed in this country even during the days of Gen. Louis Botha. He was the person who said: Those areas must be Black and those areas must be White. I do not contend that he or Gen. Smuts or Gen. Hertzog had in mind in those days that there would be totally independent Black states here at the southernmost tip of Africa. It was not possible for them to foresee the developments which we have had in recent years in Africa. A person with the foresight and insight of the present Prime Minister realized that because of the strange influences which were operating in Africa, influences over which we had no control, the only possible way in which discrimination against the Black man could be abolished without that being replaced by discrimination against the White man, was to give the Black man the opportunity of developing total independence here in Southern Africa. That is the experiment which we are conducting to-day. Heaven knows, Mr. Chairman, that experiment will still cause us a great deal of difficulty. It will still give us a great deal of trouble. It will still cause us a great deal of sorrow. It will demand tremendous sacrifices, but that does not frighten me. What does frighten me is the fact that hon. members opposite, amongst whom there are sensible people, are making no positive contribution to solve the problem which confronts us to-day.

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) referred in his speech to the immense confusion which seems to exist in regard to the Government&#x2019;s policy and plans particularly in regard to the boundaries of the proposed independent states. That statement was criticized by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) when he was questioned on that aspect by way of interjection and in his speech. The hon. member for Heilbron referred to the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister delivered in January of this year in this House. That speech of the Prime Minister made it clear that the intention was that there would be no change in the boundaries of the existing Native areas but that any change which had to be made would be made by negotiation, or as a result of negotiation after the independent states had been created. We have had it from a number of speakers opposite this evening, that the boundaries of the existing areas are laid down and defined at the present time. The criticism is that there is confusion. There is no doubt that there is that confusion, not only in the minds of the ordinary people but in the Cabinet circle itself. If one considers, together with the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, the fact that at the present time there is in existence a departmental committee appointed by the hon. the Minister of Lands which amongst other things is considering the abolition of five Native reserves in Zululand and the provision of compensatory land for those reserves, a committee which is also considering the alteration of the boundaries of six other Native reserves in Zululand and the provision of compensatory land for that, and when one bears in mind, together with those facts, the fact that there is inadequate Crown land both to fulfil the requirements of the 1936 legislation and to provide compensatory land for the proposed reserves which are to be abolished, then the inference is clear that the present White-owned land will have to be given up in order that this shuffling of land ownership can be put into effect. On that basis alone, Sir, we are justified in saying that when you have ministerial heads of various Departments at variance on this issue of land-ownership and boundaries in Zululand, confusion not only exists among the people, but also in the highest circles of the Government. I have said on an earlier occasion that I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister had an overall plan or concept in regard to land-ownership in Natal, and I would challenge him at this moment to deny that is the situation. Let him give us clarity once and for all. Let the hon. the Prime Minister stand up and say that there is no plan in existence at the present time governing this situation of land-ownership related to the creation of Bantustans in Natal and Zululand. Then only can we have some clarity on the issue. The matter does not end there, the confusion does not <span class="col_3859-3860" refersTo="page_0556"/>end there, because shortly before the recess I asked certain information from the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration in regard to the removal of Black spots in Natal and Zululand, and the hon. the Minister was good enough to give a comprehensive reply as to what the number of those spots were, what the extent those spots are, and the magisterial district where those spots were situated. It is interesting that when one compares the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply with the information given in the letter sent to various agricultural bodies by the Secretary for Lands, we find that the Secretary for Lands says that certain Bantu reserves, six in number, are to be abolished and that compensatory land is to be made available, and when one identifies those reserves on a convenient map which shows you the Black and the White areas, you find that the reserves that are going to be abolished are Black spots, but they are not referred to by the hon. the Minister of Lands in reply to my questions. There is no reference whatever to the magisterial districts where those Black spots are situated. So we have the Department of Lands indicating that these Black spots are to be removed and we have the hon. Minister of Native Affairs making no mention of these particular Black spots when he is asked which spots are going to be removed in Zululand. I think I am justified in saying on this evidence that confusion exists in Government circles in regard to what is to take place in Natal, and the inference to be drawn from that is that the master mind alone, the hon. the Prime Minister alone, knows what is proposed, but that the details of that are not so well known by his honourable colleagues.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wakkerstroom was unwise enough to mention in his speech certain activities of the Zululand Public Bodies Land Tenure Committee, and he attempted to castigate the hon. member for South Coast by saying that as a result of a request from the Minister of Lands that evidence be given in regard to the future of Crown Land in Zululand, the hon. member for South Coast tried to make political capital out of it. He was unwise enough to rely on newspaper cuttings, because if he knew the facts he would realize that only two bodies have tried to make political capital out of this, namely the Progressive Party and the hon. member for Wakkerstroom. Because, Mr. Chairman, the Nationalist-controlled bodies in Zululand almost to a man have supported the recommendations of the Land Tenure Committee in every regard, and those recommendations were designed to one end only and that was to circumscribe the creation of Bantu states in Zululand. It is quite clear that Nationalist opinion in Zululand, and in any other area which is likely to be affected by these schemes, is as unhappy about the situation as we are.</p>

During the last general election, Sir, four paid organizers were introduced by the Nationalist Party into my constituency and every one of those paid organizers attended at least one of my meetings, and every single one denied it as a pack of lies when I alleged that the hon. the Prime Minister intended to create independent Bantu states in the near future. It was categorically denied on every occasion that was the policy of the Nationalist Party. As the hon. member for Wakkerstroom well knows Nationalist opinion in Zululand and in Natal in general is as afraid of these schemes as anybody else, and had they known the facts at the time of the last general election, many of those results would have been different.

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) wishes to deny that is the policy, but there you have the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) admitting and welcoming it, Sir. I find nothing wrong with that, but I do want some hon. members opposite to deny it. They should acknowledge paternity. On the last occasion when I said it formed part of their policy, there was a chorus of protest, but I have their policy here. This is not what back-benchers have said, but it appears under the beautiful photograph of the Leader of the Opposition and also that of the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;I wish I looked like that; I would have gone off to Hollywood immediately. Why do hon. gentlemen not admit once and for all that this question of land ownership and the question of the boundaries have them cornered? However, hon. gentlemen do not accept it when the Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration and others tell them time and time again that the question of the boundaries can only be solved as the process of consolidation develops and that process of consolidation will be expedited when, for example, other bodies with authority are established, bodies which can assist, as the Transkeian Territory and others will develop later on. In that case the process can easily go on. Why are those hon. gentlemen in such a hurry that the Government should tell them this evening where the boundaries will be, whereas they are not prepared to answer when I ask them whether they will be satisfied if the Government announces to-morrow that all the released areas will be purchased? I think the time has arrived for hon. gentlemen opposite to state their attitude clearly and that they do not claim unto themselves the right to criticize the policy of the Government, because they have no alternative policy, and because they are not clear in their own minds, and because their sole object is to put a spoke in our wheels. They know very well that we are progressing under this policy in spite of their opposition. The policy we are following to-day is a policy which will ultimately&#x2014;and here I wish to associate myself with the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee)&#x2014;lead to it that we will get away from discrimination. The policy of the United Party, however, is aimed at immortalizing discrimination, otherwise they should state that their declared policy is an ideal policy, as perfect as it can be, provided you accept that the White man is only a temporary sojourner in South Africa. The policy of the National Party, however, is based on the fact that the White man will remain here as long as this earth is inhabited. The United Party&#x2019;s policy of concessions is based on the idea that everything is of a temporary nature. The control, proportional representation, the federal system will all be temporary until such time as the majority group has so much power in its hand that it will be able to exterminate everybody else and wipe them off the face of the earth. In that case the policy of the United Party will, of course, be the ideal policy if you accept that at some time in the future there will be a wholesale extermination of the White man at the southern tip of Africa. If that is the policy they wish to follow as against the policy of the National Party, they should not be surprised if the people of South Africa, whenever they have an opportunity of voicing their opinion on this matter, continue to push the United Party further and further into the background. They will do that because the United Party refuses to take a stand, and because they are powerless to take a stand, and because they wish to thwart every effort. Time and again they rely on the pressure which the world outside is bringing to bear on us, international pressure, and that is something which will be recorded in the annals of history for all time to come, to the discredit of the present Opposition.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We have been arguing in this Committee now for hours and hours on the boundaries of Bantustans and the boundaries of the race federation scheme offered by the official Opposition and I must say that I have listened to this debate now with a sense of complete unreality because neither of these two solutions offered anything that is going to suggest a stable future for this country. I must say right away that on this question of the boundaries of Bantustans I have yet to read of a case of a White farmer who has been expropriated in order to fulfil the 1936 Land Act who has had to complain about the price he has received for his land, and I don&#x2019;t share the fears of the official Opposition that the Government is going to encroach to any extent upon land other than that which was set aside under the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936. I do not see this Government as a Government which is likely to make farmers or any other White people suffer in order to try and fulfil its obligations to the Bantu people. I do not share that fear. I think, Sir, that the Opposition&#x2019;s plan is based on the correct premises and <span class="col_3863-3864" refersTo="page_0558"/>that is that South Africa is a multi-racial country. To me that is a premise which has to be accepted by anybody who faces the situation with any reality, but of course the consequences of the acceptance of South Africa as a multiracial country is a different matter, and there I differ profoundly from the official Opposition. But I am going to leave that to one side. I want to come back to a point made by the hon. the Prime Minister in the course of his speech on these independent Bantustans. Sir, the Prime Minister has repeatedly refused to accept the fact that South Africa is a multiracial country. This basic premise is not accepted by the hon. the Prime Minister and his party, and because of that the hon. the Prime Minister has decided that since he realizes that it is not possible to deny for any length of time the legitimate political aspirations of any race, Black, Coloured or Indian, he must look for an alternative solution that does not accept the multi-racial character of South Africa. In other words, he is not prepared to make allowances for people of different colour to exercise their rights in a multiracial South Africa. So he has come up with this <i>quid pro quo.</i> I am not going to deal with the Coloured solution or the Indian solution. Those are two separate solutions altogether. But we have been discussing this issue of the separate Bantustans and the hon. the Prime Minister has come up with this solution, in respect of which he gave us details two years ago in this House, and we will certainly see the beginning of the implementation of the system of an independent Bantustan. A Recess Committee was appointed and a constitution has been drawn up for the Transkei. This now is his <i>quid pro quo</i>: Not recognizing the basic premise of the multi-racial character of South Africa, he is now offering full sovereign political rights in the Transkei to start with, and later in other areas, in exchange for the deprivation of all political rights or all permanent rights in what he calls the White Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>They have never had such rights.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course they have enjoyed rights to a limited extent, but they are increasingly losing those rights. But now I want to challenge the hon. the Prime Minister on one thing that he said in the course of this debate. Talking about the Whites in Umtata and in the Transkei generally, he said that he had no fears about the future of those people, that he was sure that they would be secure living in the independent sovereign area of the Transkei. He said that he had had discussions with the leaders of the African people who formed the Recess Committee during the recent adjournment of Parliament and he was sure from what they told him that they wished to live in peace and harmony with the Whites of the Transkei who have lived there for many years, and he reassured this House, and in particular members of the Opposition who had expressed their doubts about this, that this would be so, that even if the Bantu in those areas were given full independent rights, they would treat the Whites in those areas fairly and they would not in any way encroach on either their rights or on their person. Now I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister: Why is he prepared to put so much trust in the Bantu of the Transkei who will outnumber the Whites in that area by a ratio far exceeding the outweighing of numbers in the so-called White South Africa&#x2014;why does he trust the one and a half million Africans in the Transkei in relation to the Whites there, and he will not extend the same trust to the Africans in the so-called White Republic? Why not? The disparity is certainly not as unfavourable as in the Transkei, and most important of all, the Africans living in the urban areas of South Africa are by far the most advanced Africans in the whole of the Republic. Sir, they are people who are educated, they are the people with initiative and drive, as is usually the case with people who become urbanized, and they are the people who have most adapted themselves to Western civilization and to the attainment of some form of Western culture. This is where the whole argument of the hon. the Prime Minister can be challenged. His fear always has been that if he extends even limited rights&#x2014;I hope hon. members will listen carefully now, because I am discussing this logically and without any political bias&#x2014;if the hon. the Prime Minister is not prepared to concede even limited rights to the Africans who are the most developed and the most advanced of the African people and who are living in the urban areas of the so-called White Republic of South Africa because he fears that this will lead to the complete undermining of the whole of the White civilization and the end of the White man in the White Republic of South Africa, why does he not entertain that fear when he hands complete sovereign independence to the Africans living in an independent Transkeian Territory? Why has he no fear about how they will react, what powers they will take unto themselves and how they will treat the White man who is in a very small minority, living in that area? I think the hon. the Prime Minister must reply to this, because his whole theory is challengeable by virtue of what he said earlier this afternoon, and I hope that the hon. the Prime Minister will give us a reply to this question because I believe it to be of fundamental importance. He knows that I do not agree with his theory of independent Bantustans. I believe that rights must be advanced within the whole of South Africa to people who have reached a certain stage of development, and I am not frightened, Sir, that when people have reached a certain stage of civilization they must necessarily when they get some power, behave like savages. I believe that is not the case. I believe that South Africa could very well go forward and offer sufficiently wide concessions, sensible concessions to the non-Whites in this country to re-establish us as one of the democratic countries in the world, a reputation which we do not enjoy to-day<span class="col_3865-3866" refersTo="page_0559"/>and which is one of the main reasons why we have experienced such great difficulties at UNO over the past few years.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I think one can entirely ignore the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), because I do not think even the United Party will nibble on the bait that she held out here.</p>

<p>I rise really to reply to a few arguments advanced by the hon. Leader of the Opposition and also by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) and some of the other members. It has been said that the policy of the National Party Government is to blame for the hostile attitude adopted by UNO towards South Africa from the beginning. The hon. the Prime Minister has already replied to that, but I want to quote a few passages just to indicate that it was in fact the segregation policy of the United Party which constantly got us into trouble with the United Nations. I want to quote from a document which was tabled in this House in the year 1947 and which contains a report of a debate at the United Nations in November 1946. On that occasion India&#x2019;s delegate, Sir Maharadja Singh, made the charge against South Africa that we were following a policy of segregation or apartheid here, and quite an issue was made out of this. According to the report this delegate said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In connection with the latter point the Indian representative mentioned details of discriminatory practices against the Natives in the Union. The Natives of the Union have no provincial or municipal franchise. Their political education is very limited and they cannot exercise their rights.</block>

<p>It must be remembered that at that time the United Party was still in power&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no equality for them in the church or in the State and although they constitute 80 per cent of the population, only 13 per cent of the country&#x2019;s arable land has been set aside for them. The sphere of skilled labour is practically prohibited terrain for them and as far as their freedom of movement is concerned, they are subject to extremely stringent rules.</block>

<p>That was under the policy of the United Party. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Union practises a policy of segregation and discrimination against all non-Whites. The non-White delegates gathered here at the United Nations would be subject to that policy if they went to South Africa.</block>

<p>That goes to show that it is not only the National Party Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid which brought us into disfavour with the outside world, but also the United Party&#x2019;s segregation policy. I want to add that the late Gen. Smuts replied to this charge and his defence was not that South Africa would start abolishing the policy of segregation; that was not his defence. He did not consider that for a moment. He made a long speech on this matter, and the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Field Marshal Smuts then replied to the other charges made by the Indian representation concerning discrimination between Whites and Natives. He maintained that it ill behoved a representative of a country like India where social discrimination was part and parcel of their social system, to make such an accusation. In the Union of South Africa various population groups were living side by side within a peaceful and orderly community.</block>

<p>It will be seen that the late Gen. Smuts defended this segregation policy, and I want to ask hon. members on the other side whether they think for a single moment that the late Gen. Smuts would have departed from the policy of segregation for South Africa as the result of pressure from UNO.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>This is not the first time that hon. member has talked nonsense. I want to ask what right members on the other side have to say that it is the apartheid policy of the National Party Government which has brought our country into disfavour in the outside world. What I have quoted shows that the hostility on the part of UNO came into being during the very period that the United Party was in power, and that was in November 1946 when UNO had just been established.</p>

<p>But I want to reply really to another very important point that the hon. Leader of the Opposition made in this debate. He said that South Africa would be compelled in terms of article 73 of the Charter to submit reports to UNO in respect of the Transkei and other territories which may become independent later on. In this connection I want to advance and prove three propositions. In the first place I submit that Chapter XI only relates to colonies; secondly I want to make the submission that the Transkei is not a colony as visualized there, and thirdly I want to make the submission that in any event members of UNO could decide themselves whether or not they wished to submit reports in terms of Article 73.</p>

<p>Let me first of all read out the definition of &#x201C;colony&#x201D; for the edification of hon. members on the other side; they will then understand it better, and for this purpose I quote the definition in the latest issue of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica. I should like the hon. member for Germiston-District in particular to listen carefully to what is stated here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3867-3868" refersTo="page_0560"/>&#x201C;Colony&#x201D; A term denoting the settlement of the subjects of a state beyond its territorial limits.</block>

<p>It then goes on to enlarge upon it and to define it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More strictly the term refers to (a) a settlement of the subjects of a state in an area outside its geographical boundaries, but within its administrative sphere.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; (b) a territorial unit outside the limits of the state but closely associated with it by ties of nationality, administration, economic interests or sentiment.</block>

<p>That is the definition of a &#x201C;colony&#x201D;. This matter was gone into very carefully at the discussion in San Francisco, because when that article was framed the countries wanted to make sure that the correct description was given for the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, and I refer particularly to the Fourth Committee of which the late Gen. Smuts was the President and where the late Gen. Smuts, on the 20th June, 1945, set out his idea of the territories which, are included under Article 73. I do not want to read out the whole passage.

<p>Yes, because he believed that South West Africa could be regarded as a colony and not as a mandated territory. That was his desire. But in any event various delegates expressed their opinion with regard to this matter, and in the Minutes of the Fourth Committee (Document 712 of the 31st May, 1945) there is a fine summary of what the delegates actually said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In connection with this phrase the question was raised whether the intention was to include among peoples not yet able to stand by themselves, peoples within metropolitan areas. Some delegates felt that the wording of paragraph (a) (2) made it clear that such was not the intention.

I should like that hon. Minister to get up and tell the House what he is doing about it and how many people he has already influenced. Mr. Chairman, the position is simply this, that whether or not Gen. Smuts supported the policy of segregation, his policies were never as unacceptable to Australia, to Great Britain, Canada or New Zealand as this Government&#x2019;s policies are unacceptable. I am sure that had the United Party with its policies been in power, South Africa would never have been put out of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) said that she had to listen to a very unrealistic debate. To-day, however, it is clear, Mr. Chairman, after yesterday&#x2019;s elections, that to most voters her ideas of what is real and what is unreal, are not theirs. The people outside are interested in the questions which are being raised and discussed here today; they are interested in where the boundaries of the new Bantu States are going to be. She said that she accepted that the Government was not going to buy land beyond the boundaries which were decided upon in 1936. That was what I understood her to say. I notice that she nods with her head meaning that what I am saying is true. But nobody else accepts that.</p>

I have already asked the hon. the Minister for Bantu Administration and Development and I have asked the Prime Minister what land they were going to buy in the Transkei but nobody answered me. I should now like to put that question to the hon. member for Heilbron. He said that the boundaries were fixed. I have here the constitution for the Transkei. I admit that the Prime Minister said that he did not necessarily have to adopt this constitution, but in terms of this constitution, the Transkeian Territorial Authority is going to take over the whole of the Transkei except the district of Mount Currie. Mount Currie was given the assurance by the Prime Minister and by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development that the European areas in those districts would not fall under the Transkei. I want to ask the hon. member for Heilbron, however, what about Port St. Johns? The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development gave the assurance that area would not be taken over. The Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development wrote them a letter telling them that they would not fall witin the Transkei.

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron also said that the Europeans need not have any fears in the Transkei because the new independent government of the Transkei will have no jurisdiction over them. I was, however, not complaining about the jurisdiction, but I was worried about whether and how they were going to be compensated for the material losses which they fear they are going to suffer. We know that they will not fall under the jurisdiction of the new New Transkeian government. The Prime Minister gave them that assurance. So we know that. But it is obvious from the remarks of the hon. member for Heilbron that the Government members have no concept of what is worrying the White and the Coloured people not only in the Transkei but in all those areas where they feel that they might fall under Bantustan states. The last time I spoke, I was dealing with the position of the professional man and other people occupied in commerce but not necessarily owners of businesses. The Prime Minister said that they were different from the people in Kenya because they could come to South Africa and continue to practise their professions here, or get other jobs here. What I, however, want to know is what is going to happen to their properties? What is going to happen to their residences? I have asked this question often before but nobody wants to answer me. Perhaps the hon. the Minister of Information will now give me the information. Are those areas going to be exempted from the operation of the Group Areas Act? The Prime Minister has told us clearly that all the villages, and Umtata, are eventually going to go Black. <span class="col_3871-3872" refersTo="page_0562"/>But now I want to ask this, namely how are they going to go Black when Africans cannot buy properties from Whites? The areas are, admittedly, going to be zoned&#x2014;they are going to zone certain areas for occupation by certain races. But who is going to buy the properties of the Whites if the Africans cannot do so in terms of the Group Areas Act? Once the zoning has taken place, who is going to buy those properties? The Prime Minister must realize that the White people do not fear that they will not be allowed to trade. We appreciate that they will be allowed to trade and that no law will be passed to force us out of the area. All that we accept. We fear, however, that pressure will be brought to bear upon the Whites forcing them out. It is useless telling a doctor that he can come and practise in Cape Town, or telling an attorney that he can go and practise in East London. The question is what is to happen to the properties they occupy in Umtata, Butter-worth, or any other town? [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I am pleased that you are giving me the opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to deal further with the matter with which I was dealing a moment ago. When my time expired I was pointing out that there was a thorough discussion at San Francisco of the territories affected by Chapter XI. Thereafter, the interpretation of this Chapter was raised repeatedly in the General Assembly of the United Nations. One such occasion was the 27th sitting of the General Assembly when the British delegate made it very clear that the territories referred to in Chapter XI only included colonial territories. The Transkei and other Bantu homelands in South Africa are at the present time still part of metropolitan South Africa and as long as they remain part of South Africa they cannot be considered to be independent territories. As long as they are still part of South Africa it is not necessary to report on them because they are not included under what are considered to be &#x201C;colonial territories&#x201D;. When they achieve full independence one day it will of course not be necessary to report on them because then they will be completely independent states. If hon. members note the heading of Chapter XI they will see the following, &#x201C;Declaration Affecting Non-Self-Governing Territories&#x201D;. This heading is placed there for a specific purpose. In its original form it was &#x201C;General Policy&#x201D;. At that time it was felt in San Francisco that countries having colonial territories should not be compelled to submit reports in terms of Article 73. Therefore the heading was framed in such a way that it dealt with a &#x201C;declaration concerning non-selfgoverning territories&#x201D;. In other words, member countries could declare voluntarily whether they wanted to bring their particular colonial territories within the scope of Article 73. There have been many writers on international law who have written about this but I want to refer particularly to one whom I consider to be the greatest authority in this connection, namely, Professor Hans Kelsen, Professor of Political Science at the University of California. On page 555 of his book &#x201C;The Law of the United Nations&#x201D; he discusses this particular matter in full. He says, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most important question to be answered by an interpretation of Chapter XI is: What are the territories to which the provisions of this Chapter should apply?</block>

<p>After having discussed this question in detail, he arrives at the following conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The formula of non-selfgoverning territories is usually interpreted to mean only non-selfgoverning colonies.</block>

<p>That is his eventual conclusion therefore. In pursuance of the heading to Chapter XI, the question also arose as to whether member countries were compelled to submit reports and this matter was fully discussed and dealt with by various writers on international law. Professor Kelsen expresses a very clear opinion in this regard in his book from which I have already quoted. He refers to a resolution which was adopted at the 64th meeting of the General Assembly, discusses it, and arrives at the following conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That means that the Assembly left it to the members to determine which territories fall within the category of non-selfgoverning territories.</block>

<p>In other words, member countries were left to decide voluntarily on the question as to whether they would submit reports in terms of Article 73 of the Charter or not.</p>

<p>This request to Britain takes place under pressure by the Afro-Asian countries. The fact that Britain did not previously submit reports in respect of Southern Rhodesia in fact proves the correctness of Kelsen&#x2019;s standpoint. The position is that Britain as well as other countries agreed voluntarily to submit reports on certain non-selfgoverning territories in terms of <span class="col_3873-3874" refersTo="page_0563"/>Article 73. In this way more than 60 non-self-governing territories were brought within the jurisdiction of Article 73. I have here with me the latest report of the &#x201C;Committee on Information for Non-Self-Governing Territories&#x201D;, from which you will see that Britain, <i>inter alia,</i> voluntarily undertook to submit reports in respect of certain non-self-governing colonies to UNO but not in respect of Southern Rhodesia.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, out of all the welter of confusion which the Government is creating about its Bantustan policy, only one thing emerges clearly&#x2014;they do not know the meaning of the word &#x201C;independence&#x201D;. Right throughout this debate we have had assurances that the Government will protect the interests of the White people in the Transkei. But how can the Government give an assurance that it will protect the interests of the Whites in an independent Transkei? The moment they interfere to protect those interests, they deny the independence of the Transkei. They cannot have it both ways! As an example of the confused thinking one finds among members on the other side, I would refer to a challenging statement which was made by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). He said that one of the major problems to-day in Africa was to end discrimination against Black people without substituting for it discrimination against White people. We are now told that the main purpose of the Transkeian experiment&#x2014;it is not a policy any more, but is now an experiment&#x2014;is to end discrimination against the Black people there. But what steps are being taken to prevent discrimination against the White people of the Transkei? If it is truly independent, the Government will be powerless, unless it is willing to destroy the very definition of independence thereby reducing its entire policy to hollowness. I think we have had a remarkable revelation of how half-baked the Bantustan policy of the hon. the Prime Minister is. I cannot yet call it a policy of the Nationalist Party, because I can confirm from personal experience that the rank and file of the Nationalist Party do not accept it as their policy. I was recently in Aliwal North in connection with a by-election there, and a prominent Nationalist then asked me why I was attacking this policy knowing that the hon. the Prime Minister was not mad? He would never do a thing like it. I told him that I could prove from Hansard that he had stated it. To that he replied by saying that the Prime Minister was a clever man and that he was speaking for foreign ears.</p>

<p>Where people do not believe the policy of their own Party, you can expect any result! We have, however, achieved one thing; there can no longer be denials behind the back of the hon. the Prime Minister that the policy of the Nationalist Party is one of independence for Bantustans. We have at least had this confession, however reluctant, that the Prime Minister will be forced to do to the White community of the Transkei exactly what he is accusing other metropolitan countries of doing to Whites in colonies which are in the process of being emancipated in Africa.</p>

<p>I want to react to another theorem propounded by the hon. the Prime Minister because it interests me very much. I think it was yesterday that the hon. the Prime Minister made the point that as the Transkeian experiment developed, it would have the effect of changing the image of South Africa throughout the world. If that were to happen, none would be so gratified as we on this side of the House would be. I mean it. But I should like to add that the world will not judge this Government, or this country as long as it has this Government, according to the position which will obtain in one of the tribal areas of South Africa. On the contrary, it will also judge South Africa, as we have constantly warned, according to the fate of those millions of Bantu who never will have any direct material or economic contact with the reserves, i.e. the Natives outside those reserves. I wonder whether the hon. the Prime Minister would not consider, while experimenting with the Transkei, also making a simple experiment outside the Transkei, i.e. to reduce the harshness, the implacability, the indefensibility and the injustice of the many discriminatory measures which he has made to apply to the Natives living in the so-called White areas.</p>

<p>I can mention many examples, Sir. My only trouble is that I do not want to criticize legislation which has already been adopted by this House. There is one example, however, of discrimination which although it was enforced by legislation, is entirely a matter of administration. I am referring to the discrimination which is made possible under Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, or the &#x201C;job reservation section&#x201D; as it is generally known. Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act did not reserve one single job for one single person. It, however, permits the Minister of Labour to do that after certain formalities have been completed. I want to criticize and condemn the administration of that section by the various Ministers of Labour since that section existed.</p>

<p>I do not want to speak about the exemptions, Sir. I want to speak about the administration of the Act, and the various ministerial actions in applying the principle of job reservation. I want us to consider the administrative attempts made by the various Ministers to apply this principle of job reservation. The very first determination was over-hasty and abortive. It led to court cases which were lost. Eventually, when the Minister succeeded in escaping his difficulties, he was compelled to grant more exemptions than was originally intended. This shows what an impossible situation the Minister had been landed in. Then there followed determination No. 2 which dealt with the removal of night soil in Durban. He went to great lengths to preserve this work, even in respect of non-European areas, for Whites. I will not make any further comment upon this. A third determination was the preservation of 50 operations in the engineering industry for Whites resulting in the protection of only 90 people in the whole of that mighty industry. The next determination applied to traffic police and fire brigade services in Cape Town, effecting exactly 14 people in the whole of South Africa. Another determination reserved the work of passenger lift attendants in Johannesburg, Bloemfontein and Pretoria for Whites. Determination No. 6 reserved all skilled and many semi-skilled jobs in the building industry in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State for Whites. Determination No. 7 endeavoured to protect 148 people in the refrigeration and stove industry. Then, having apparently learnt from past experience, determination No. 8 was made and this was no longer a simple reservation, but a complex formula aiming at the retention of the <i>status quo</i> in that industry, i.e. a reservation based on percentages. But while it sought to protect Whites and Coloureds in theory, in practice it was an unnecessary piece of red tape because it gave no White man a job, it cost no Coloured man his job, and did not affect any Bantu in the slightest. Determinations Nos. 9 to 11 affected transport drivers in various fields. Finally in the place of what would have been determination No. 12 if the Minister had his way, came a very interesting report from the Industrial Tribunal to the effect that the displacement of Whites by non-Whites in the clothing industry had not been substantiated and that it would, therefore, not be necessary to conduct a further investigation at that stage. By finding this, the Tribunal disproved so many of the arguments which have been advanced in favour of job reservation. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I purposely waited a long time in order to listen to the debate which was started by members of the Opposition on the constitutional development plan for the Transkei, in order to ascertain what sense of responsibility they would display after they had read the report of the Recess Committee which was published in the Press. I think I am right in saying that in this connection the Opposition has displayed the most pitiful sense of irresponsibility that I have ever seen. I say that with reference to their reaction and that of their Press to the publication of the report of the Recess Committee of the Transkeian Territorial Authority. My time is limited so I will only refer to that reaction in brief. In this connection I wish to refer to the speeches of the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) and that of the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman), and that of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) who also referred to the discrimination which will be practised against the Whites once the Transkei becomes an independent state. Mr. Chairman, if there is an answer to these points &#x2014;points which they regard as being the most contentious&#x2014;that answer can be found in the report of the Recess Committee and in statements made by responsible Bantu leaders in the Transkei. They can ask the Government what its attitude is in respect of this or that matter, but the people who they wish to frighten will be living in the Bantu state and the question, therefore, is what attitude will the Bantu government of that state adopt towards the White people who live there, towards the question of the boundaries, towards the consolidation of areas, and towards all the other things with which the Opposition wish to make the South African nation&#x2019;s hair stand on end. Let us scrutinize a few of these things closer. I maintain that the spirit which the Opposition has revealed in respect of these things, is one of frustration. The Opposition and their Press were very frustrated when they read the report of the Recess Committee of the Transkei Territorial Authority. They thought it would provide them with ammunition, but it was actually a great disappointment to them, more so because the Transkeian Recess Committee has <span class="col_3877-3878" refersTo="page_0565"/>come forward with many good constructive suggestions. In doing that they have adopted a very sensible attitude. However, the main reason why the Opposition and their Press feel frustrated is the fact that the Recess Committee has shown that they accept separate development in principle and not the conception of a multi-racial government as advocated by the Opposition and their Press. The silence which the Opposition Press has observed in its leading articles and in its comments on the Transkeian constitution, and the imperfect reports on the report of the Recess Committee all indicate frustration and sorrow, also on the part of the Press. The basic approach of the Opposition&#x2014;and that is where they are making a big mistake&#x2014;is that this Government is treating the Bantu of the Transkei in the same way as the British Government have treated those in Kenya where threats, ultimatums and forced coalition compelled the people of Kenya to take certain steps. Nothing like that has happened here. Earlier this afternoon already the Prime Minister pointed out that the initiative in this matter was taken by the Bantu leaders in the Transkei. They consulted the Government and the Government put its view and advised them. For the very reason that the initiative in this matter was taken by the Bantu in the Transkei it is better to consider the attitude which the Bantu in the Transkei is adopting towards this matter with which the Opposition is trying to frighten the public. Let us look a little deeper into some of these matters. Firstly, it should be noted that the report concerned was unanimously adopted. That is important because it was reported in detail in the Press. I also wish to point out that report was signed by those chiefs and others in respect of whom, before the meeting of the Recess Committee, the Opposition Press recklessly wrote that they would submit different constitutions. The fact that this report was unanimously accepted is not appreciated within the ranks of the Opposition. They have no kind word to say about the sense of responsibility which the Bantu leaders of the Transkei have displayed. On the contrary they come here with insinuations with the object of sowing suspicion within the ranks of the Bantu and to give them ideas how to rebel against the White man. I want to give another example. I referred to the fact a moment ago that it was done voluntarily, and not as a result of an ultimatum issued to them and not as a result of forcing coalition upon them and not as a result of vetos and things like that, as was the case in all the schemes which were applied to the north of us. [Interjections.] I think that hon. member has already spoken on ten occasions. This is the first time that I am taking part in this debate and immediately I sit down he can get up again. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) reproached us and said we were practising the policy which Britain practised in Kenya. It is ironical, of course, that a super Britisher like Mr. Douglas Mitchell should refer to British methods in a deprecatory manner. I wish to tell him, however, that the Prime Minister has already given sufficient proof that we will not follow the policy which was followed in Kenya as far as the property of the White people is concerned, nor will we follow the methods which were followed in Kenya in respect of the drafting of a constitution, such as vetos and ultimatums.</p>

But what is the reply given by the Recess Committee? The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) referred to it here. The entire report was published in the Press. He knows that the reply of the Recess Committee to this bogey of land and boundaries is that they accept the boundaries of the Transkeian territory as they exist to-day and as they have been proclaimed, and if only the hon. member studies that proclamation carefully he will realize what they are. The hon. member will realize that he has already been answered and that an area like Port St. Johns is excluded.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>There is a matter I would like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Prime Minister and I am very grateful to have the opportunity to do so at this stage. Throughout the hours this debate has lasted, there has been extensive talk about the independence of the Transkei, the degree of independence that this new state will have, the number of White people concerned there and how their rights will be protected, and about the boundaries of that future state, but not a word was mentioned about the people whom I represent in that area, because the Transkei forms part of the Outeniqua constituency and there happen to be about 14,000 Coloured people living in that area. The Coloured people in that territory have been concerned about their position over the years, even before this Government came into power in 1948, because there seems to have been the idea always that the Bantu in the Transkei will have some form of local government which will possibly in future be extended and in many respects the Coloured people in the Transkei resorted under the same legislation as the Bantu, which they naturally resented because they have never become integrated with the Bantu population there. On 7 February I raised this matter in a debate and since then we have not heard a word except a short comment by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) who followed me in that debate, in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I just want to tell you that as far as the Coloureds in the Transkei are concerned the hon. member need not worry at all, because both the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and the Department of Coloured Affairs are already attending to the whole matter. These two Departments work together.</block>

<p>What authority there is for this statement I do not know. It is also very vague. Apart from that, there was comment on the speech I made in this House by Mr. Tom Swartz at Umtata, the Government&#x2019;s nominated member on the Union Council for Coloured Affairs and the chairman of that body, to the effect that I was more or less talking nonsense in having raised the matter.</p>

<p>When I have finished, we will see who is correct. This servile, bowing and scraping man, appointed by the Government, has no standing there, I can assure you, Sir. He does not know what is happening there and he is completely wrong. The position there is that in spite of what this gentleman said, the problem of the Coloured people in the Transkei is a very real one. These people have no association as far as the future form of government is concerned with the Bantu people. They have traditionally the same way of life, the same culture, the same language and the same religion as the White people. They are living there in fear and uncertainty which has become quite acute over the last few years, as I will prove. These people live in settlements scattered over the Transkei, such as Rietvlei, Enzikeni, Upper Roza, Lusikisiki and other places, or in the larger towns. Many of them are traders. They form part of the 600 odd traders mentioned here. They are descendants, to a large extent, of the soldiers who fought with the White man to civilize that country. I mentioned here what Chief Matanzima said to a prominent leader of the Coloured people in the Transkei and I did not mention it because I wished to engender racialism between the Bantu and the Coloured people. I used the expression before in regard to the Bantu and the Coloured people that oil and water do not mix. On the other hand, if some of the Bantu chiefs in the Transkei are talking about the Coloureds having to leave the Transkei, I do not blame them for it because naturally they would like to see their population increase and their people from outside the territory brought in there into the places now occupied by the Coloured people. But the fact remains that those people are there and that they have no future there. Over the last year or so we have had a great deal of unrest, particularly in Pondoland. The Coloured people refused to take part in the unrest and the demonstrations and rioting against the White authority. I can assure you, Sir, that I have had representations from responsible people there. I have been in the area since, and I speak with the utmost conviction and sincerity when I say that already the more primitive type of Bantu in the Transkei is threatening those people. They are uncertain and in danger of their lives, and they are being told: We are going to become independent and then we will deal with you because you stand by the White man and refuse to stand by us. Now, I want it clearly understood that I do not say these things for the newspapers or anyone else to distort it and to say that I am engendering racialism between the Coloureds and the Bantu there, but the fact remains that as the White Government of South Africa we are responsible for those people. They are not as fortunate as the White people who are, generally speaking, in a better economic position than they are. They cannot help themselves and it is for the Government of South Africa, which they recognize as their Government, to assist them and it is time now for them to be told where they must go or what will happen to them. The Prime Minister, in dealing with the political rights of the White people who <span class="col_3881-3882" refersTo="page_0567"/>will live in that territory after it gains its independence, gave the House the assurance that they will be able to exercise their political rights as before, in the Republic. The Coloured people&#x2019;s political rights have been limited as they are to-day, but we would like to know whether that applies also to the Coloureds who will be living in that territory after it becomes independent.</p>

But after having gauged the feelings and having visited the area myself towards the end of last year, I can say it would be appreciated by my constituents there if the Prime Minister would make a clear statement as to their position. There are many thousands of people concerned. Many of them are on the land, where they were settled after their forbears were discharged from the Cape Corps in the Kaffir Wars. They will have to be uprooted there and re-settled elsewhere, and it is hard for any person to go to some strange area. There are other people who have business rights there, or who are in business, and they will also have to be uprooted and re-settled somewhere else, and fine a niche in the economy of the country somewhere else. I wish to appeal to the Prime Minister during the course of this debate to make a statement and to give some assurance to those people that the Government will accept responsibility for them, because after all they were not in a position to have any say whatever as to whether that territory will become an independent Bantu territory or not. They were not consulted in any way. I do not wish to make any recriminations, but this is a serious matter and I can assure the Prime Minister that those people will appreciate it if the Prime Minister could be able to tell us what the intentions of the Government are with regard to them, whether they will have to stay there or whether they will have to be re-settled elsewhere. Perhaps the recently announced Orange-Fish River scheme could be used to re-settle them if they are to be moved. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Before my time expired, I was dealing with the statement made by Matanzima even before the report of the Recess Committee appeared in the Press, the statement in which he referred to the so-called unrest which existed amongst the White people in connection with their property in the Transkei. I should like to read this out because I think it is very important, it ought to reassure everybody and because it is so strikingly in agreement with what they recommend in their report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He appealed to the Whites to remain calm and not to worry about their future. We are aware of our great debt to the Whites for all they have done for us in the past and we will not forget it. He said there was no intention of just handing over the properties to the Africans. In the gradual take-over, Africans would be prepared and would have to pay full market value for all White-owned stores and other businesses.</block>

<p>When I read out things like this, the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) chatters to another hon. member and refuses to listen. [Interjections.] When you talk to them, Sir, they do not listen, but afterwards they say exactly what they want to. That does not hurt me in the least. I am only drawing attention to their behaviour. We have many definite statements by the Bantu themselves, statements in which they express their appreciation of the missionary work which the various churches have done in the Transkei and that they always wish to maintain Western civilization in the future. But not a word is said about that by the Opposition. That makes no impression upon them. When you read that report, Sir, you see that they have a very clear realization of the inter-dependence of the Bantu in the Transkeian territory and the Republic. We have that in many respects; there are many respects in which the two areas are dependent upon each other. Without it having been forced upon them, they themselves said in their report that those things which were common to them and the Republic should rest with the Republic such things as foreign affairs, defence, railways, national road, etc. Does the fact that they wish to leave those things, even internal security etc. in the hands of the Republic not reveal real confidence on the part of the Transkeian Bantu in the White man of the Republic? But the Opposition does not say a word about that. They do not even accept those assurances on the part of the Bantu. The fact that the Bantu is prepared to entrust his own future in respect of those matters to the Republic, based on his experience with the White man in the past, is indicative of the boundless confidence which the Bantu has in the White man. But the Opposition does not say a word about that. They will probably deny that those intentions are sincere. The confidence which they have revealed in the Government should be stimulated and what is the Opposition doing to that confidence? They belittle it and trample it in the mud and do exactly the <span class="col_3883-3884" refersTo="page_0568"/>opposite. They instigate and incite them against the White man in all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>Then I will say &#x201C;instigate&#x201D;, Sir. I say that the Bantu of the Transkei has revealed a far greater sense of responsibility and greater confidence in the White man of the Republic than the Opposition has. The Recess Committee of the Bantu has revealed greater confidence in the Republic of the future, apart from the Republic of to-day, than the Opposition has. They have revealed greater confidence in the White state which has brought them where they are to-day than the Bantu in the Northern states revealed in those governments. These are assurances which come from the Bantu in the Transkei. They do not come from our Government, but from the Bantu. Does that not carry weight with the Opposition? Why does it not carry weight with them? Whose words ought to carry a great deal of weight with the White man in these days, both in the Transkei and outside? Naturally the words of the Bantu in the Transkei, because with whose words are the White people in Kenya being frightened to-day. With the words of Kenyatta, and in his own area Kenyatta is to-day the counterpart of Matanzima here, namely the leader of his area, but there is, of course, a big difference between the two. There you have former gaolbirds and people who are prepared to commit the same misdeeds which they committed in the past, whereas we have exactly the opposite here. That is why I resent it when the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) refer to both Matanzima and Kenyatta in the same breath. On account of the work done by the Recess Committee, the Bantu have displayed a very great sense of responsibility and that is why the Government will assist them in the future. However, it seems to me that we will have to prepare ourselves to get nothing from the Opposition, the alternative government, but the most despicable destructive opposition, no co-operation whatsoever. I deprecate it when the Opposition instigates the Whites against the Government, but I think it is unforgiveable and extremely reckless when the Opposition does what it has been doing recently namely to instigate the Bantu of the Transkei against the Government and against the good intentions which it has displayed so far. I think that is extremely reckless. If the Opposition is powerless to come into power on the strength of its own internal policy they should not sink to the low level of instigating the Bantu of the Transkei against the Government.</p>

<p>What interested me most about the speech of the Deputy Minister is that while we are calling this Government to account he tries to hide behind the good intentions of the Bantu in the Transkei. We are not attacking the Bantu in the Transkei. Why should he defend them? We are asking what steps this Government can take and what guarantees they can give for the security of minority groups, Whites and Coloureds, in the Transkei. I would like to help the hon. the Prime Minister and also the Deputy Minister by giving them the example of the 1936 Act for which the United Party Government was responsible. If we had a United Party Government in power there would not have been any difficulty, because under the 1936 Act we undertook to buy certain land from Whites and to hand it over to the Bantu. But we did not want any of those Whites to feel insecure, so in that Act we gave a firm undertaking that they would be paid the basic value of their farms, plus a certain percentage on their capital for every year they owned that farm, plus up to 20 per cent compensation for any inconvenience they suffered. What could be fairer? Instead of having a political diatribe from the hon. the Deputy Minister, why does he not give a similar guarantee to the White people of the Transkei, and the problem would be solved?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister gave a vague undertaking, that he would look after those people, but there was nothing concrete. We get it from everywhere that the Transkei will become independent and that the <span class="col_3885-3886" refersTo="page_0569"/>Government will lose all control over the situation. What we want is a definite, logical and firm undertaking from the Government as to how these people will be protected, giving details. That is the only way in which those people can be given security. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to draw the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attention to the manner in which the Minister of Labour is taking the initiative in effecting Job Reservation. Nothing can happen in regard to job reservation except on the initiative of the Minister, and I want to point out how he is creating harsh injustice and uncertainty in the industrial life of South Africa. I have given many examples to show that what the Minister is doing under this measure is unnecessary and silly, as in the case of the night-soil workers in Durban. It is ineffective, as it was in the clothing industry, where he gave mass exemptions. It is negligible; for although it is cruel to the individual, its impact upon the economic life of South Africa is negligible, as in the case of the unfortunate traffic officers in Cape Town. It is doubly ineffective from the point of view of the Government itself. I can remember sitting in this House and hearing the philosophy of apartheid expounded by Government members, and one of the corner-stones of that philosophy was that never must the White man be the servant of or subservient to a Black man; he should not render services to the Black man. But what is happening in terms of the reservation of the jobs of lift attendants in Johannesburg? In buildings where Black men used to take White women up in the lift rendering a service to them, to-day White girls have to take Black men up in the lifts and render service to them. [Interjections.] From the point of view of the Government, it is utterly ineffective and it is irritating. It creates uncertainty. People want to invest money in South Africa, but can they calculate the risks if they are subject to Government interference to this extent? Worst of all, the Minister&#x2019;s actions can create rigidity in our future labour pattern in this country, which may be most unfortunate. We know that we will have more non-Whites doing semi-skilled and skilled jobs in South Africa in the next five years, even more in the next ten years and more still in the next twenty years. The Viljoen Commission reported on that and gave us figures. They said that if immigration is not increased by the year 2000 &#x2014;and with this Minister in charge it will be much sooner&#x2014;there will be 329,000 artisans in industry of whom only 161,000 will be Whites. More than half the artisans employed in South Africa will be non-Whites, if we are to develop. At present the figures are that there are 147,633 artisans, of whom the Whites are 129,855, the vast majority. But if we are to develop and give a living to our people we will have to employ more non-White artisans by the year 2000 in less than 40 years&#x2019; time. The Viljoen Commission also pointed out that while Whites could provide the workers in 41 per cent of all tertiary services, i.e. the distributive, domestic and professional services, by the year 2000 they expected that the Whites would be able to provide only 25 per cent of these services. In addition to that we have to remember that with the greater rationalization in industry, jobs are being broken up. Skilled jobs are being divided into the unskilled elements for each job, and as the result of that we will find more and more unskilled and semi-skilled people doing jobs which are being done by skilled people to-day. There will be more jobs of the type which we are now beginning to give to Bantu and other non-Whites, and as we develop the proportion of those jobs will increase, yet we want to give to a particular Minister the power to restrain such a necessary and natural development for the continued economic advance of South Africa.</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF HOUSING:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) R8,000 in areas subject to a wage determination in terms of the Wage Act, 1937, or a wage agreement in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, 1937, for the building industry, and R6,000 in other areas. (For the purpose of determining the maximum loan that may be granted the Free State gold fields are regarded as a wage-regulated area.)</li>

<li>(b) Subject to the maximum amounts mentioned in (1), the maximum loan that may be granted to an officer is determined by his gross salary plus allowances and the amount standing to his credit in the Union Pension Fund, as it is a condition of the loan scheme that the monthly instalment in respect of a loan that may be granted should not exceed one-fifth of the officer&#x2019;s salary plus allowances. The maximum amount that may be granted is also affected by the age of the officer, as it is a condition of the scheme that the portion guaranteed by the State must be redeemed during his period of service. Officers above a certain age therefore obtain smaller loans than younger officers, for the same instalment, if they are in receipt of equal salaries and allowances.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) No. The maximum loan that may be granted is limited to protect the State against possible unduly high losses as the State has to guarantee 30 per cent of all loans granted. The circumstances of professional officers in the higher salary grades in no way differ from the circumstances of other officers in the same salary groups; and because it is possible for such officers to contribute out of their high incomes to the cost of erection or purchase of their dwellings, exceptional treatment cannot be justified.</li>

<p>The question whether corporal punishment is obligatory for a contravention of Section 37 (1) of Act No. 62 of 1955 has already been decided by the Cape, Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal Divisions of the Supreme Court. Only the Natal Division decided that corporal punishment is obligatory. The Judge President of that Division has, however, undertaken to submit the matter to a full Bench consisting of more than two Judges should an occasion again arise. There is thus no necessity for dealing with the matter in terms of Section 385 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I think that most members of the House would have heard over Radio South Africa this morning a broadcast purporting to report news coming from New York to the effect that the South African Government has extended an invitation to two members of the Committee of seven to visit South Africa for discussions with the Prime Minister in Pretoria, and I believe a further report to the effect that they had been authorized by the Committee to accept that invitation. In view of the importance of this matter I wonder whether the Prime Minister will take an early opportunity of informing the House of the details of the position and making a statement so that the matter can, if necessary, be debated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I take it that the hon. the Prime Minister will reply in due course to the question of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and all of us will follow his reply to that question with great interest. I want to say immediately that this is one of the first matters which has been raised in this protracted debate which has been worthy of the debate.</p>

<p>What could we expect in a long and important debate such as this one on the Vote of the hon. the Prime Minister? I think that we could reasonably expect three things: In the first place, an analysis of the crux of our country&#x2019;s problems; in the second place, the test as to whether the broad policy of the hon. the Prime Minister satisfactorily tackles and meets the crux of those problems; and in the third place, that the Opposition would put their policy and show us how that policy seeks to tackle the crux of those problems; that the Opposition would try to prove that things would run more smoothly under their policy than under the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>But what did we find? There was no analysis of the actual main problem of South Africa. The first approach of the Opposition to this Vote was through the medium of their hon. Leader and a number of other members who asked a mass of questions, chiefly minor questions upon matters of detail. There was nothing tangible, there was simply a whole series of minor questions, and in that process of questioning the hon. the Leader of the Opposition even went so far as to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether the Prime Minister of Nigeria would be invited to visit South Africa or not. I do not wish to dwell upon this; I merely want to show how senseless such a question is in the light of the fact that after the Commonwealth Conference almost exactly a year ago Mr. Balewa, the Prime Minister of Nigeria, expressed himself as follows, for the benefit of the whole country and the whole world, regarding our country when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is just the beginning. Nigeria is going to fight the South Africans&#x2019; racial policy right to the end.</block>

<p>And according to the <i>Argus</i> reports he went further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister said there were many ways to fight South Africa, e.g. in the United Nations and by means of economic sanctions.</block>

<p>And yet that same Prime Minister whose name is put forward as a potential guest in our country arrived at an airport and raised no objection to the youth organization of his party bearing banners like the following: &#x201C;Give us arms to fight South Africa&#x201D;; &#x201C;Boycott South African goods&#x201D;; Remove South West Africa from the South African mandate&#x201D;, &#x201C;Starve Verwoerd into submission&#x201D;. How childish can we become if in a debate of this nature we ask questions the replies to which are so self-evident? This was the first facet of the line taken by the Opposition, the asking of minor questions.</p>

<p>What was their second facet? It was the establishment of a new propaganda front. In the first place, their purpose was to make the National Party suspect amongst the voters of South Africa in its role as the protector of the interests of the White man, and the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) was the first to enter the arena with the idea that we would Kenya-ize the Europeans in the Transkeian Territories. He concentrated on the proposition that this Government would leave <span class="col_3901-3902" refersTo="page_0577"/>the living White man in the lurch. However, the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) turned from the living to the dead and delivered an impassioned plea in regard to the manner in which we apparently wish to abandon the graves of our forefathers who fought and died in Natal. I want to dwell for a moment on the unpleasant idea of the hon. member regarding these graves. If we had to take the history of South Africa and project it into the future in those terms, then we who are Afrikaans speaking would have to say today that the burial places and the battlefields of Magersfontein and of Majuba must remain in Afrikaner hands because that is where we find the graves and the great tradition of Afrikanerdom. That is how we should view the position. According to the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) our attitude is, however, and must be that the glory of Majuba and Magersfontein belongs as much to our English-speaking fellow-Afrikaners as it does to us, just as we cultivate the idea that the tradition of Dellville Wood belongs as much to us as it does to them. So much for that graves story. Furthermore, hon. members raised the question of the determination of the boundaries of the Bantu homelands. This is a matter which has been resolved 90 per cent by the determination of the boundaries of the released areas. There is only a small additional amount of land to be added. When it comes to the last resting places of our forebears in this country, I can also say a word or two and I want to say that our forefathers, mine as well, did not fight to retain for us the scenes of past battles but to find a homeland for our entire nation and to bring the gospel to the whole of South Africa. We did not fight for the permanent possession of those specific laager sites and those specific battlegrounds. We fought for a homeland for the whole nation and for the Christianizing of the whole area and if the future requires us to forfeit what is right in order to retain that which is necessary and which is hereditary to the European, then we will probably prefer to divide ourselves rather than to be divided by outside forces.</p>

<p>The last facet of the building up of this new propaganda front of the Opposition came from the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). She came to light with tales and newspaper reports about districts which are disturbed about the question as to whether they will be included in the Transkeian Territory or not, and she also came to light with heartrending stories regarding farmers adjacent to the Native areas and who are living in uncertainty. Those matters have been repeatedly cleared up by statements by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in connection with the Transkeian Territories, and statements by the hon. the Prime Minister, and the boundaries were further determined in the Schedule to the 1936 legislation, the released areas. However, the stories of all three hon. members are raised to create a new propaganda front, and they do this in spite of the fact that they also wish to retain their old propaganda front. The namesake of the hon. member for South Coast, the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), wrote in the <i>Cape Times,</i> not about this Government seeking to Kenya-ize and desert the White man, no, his charge remained the old traditional charge from the heart of the United Party and this is what he wrote, according to the <i>Cape Times</i> of this week&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We will move a little closer to the brink of disaster propelled by the wheels of Nationalist &#x201C;baasskap-apartheid&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is the motive which that party has untruthfully ascribed over the years to the Government and still tries to ascribe to it while at the same time they wish to open up this new front.</p>

<p>The last facet of the old liberalist attack was launched yesterday evening by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) who once again, because of the labour relationships in our country, tried to suggest that this Government wished to develop an economic system with a reckless contempt for the problems and the potential of the Bantu.</p>

<p>To put it briefly, what is the real problem in our country? I would say that it is composed of three things. In the first place, that we must be able to resist a racist Pan-African movement against the wheels which infects not only the whole continent but which can also infect and has partially infected our own Bantu. Opposition to this inexorable, irrational, hostile, racist movement is our first task. Our second task is to fulfil our moral duties towards both the Bantu and the White man in South Africa as regards residence in this country and the enjoyment of its amenities. The third facet of our task is to maintain economic leadership in Africa and to provide employment for the increasing population in our own country. What has this debate produced in respect of these matters? I wish to dwell for a moment on the last facet, and it was also this last aspect which was mentioned by the hon. member for Yeoville. When we think of our labour problem and the task of the Bantu where can our aims be better achieved than within the concept of the development of the border areas and the reserves? We all know that the mingling of White and Black labour in our European areas brings about labour disruption. Why cannot we develop those reserves unanimously and without inhibition? The machinery of state capitalism has been made available to make a contribution to assist the Bantu there; the machinery in connection with border industries has been set up there. The labour potential of the Bantu can be used there to increase the riches of the whole of Southern Africa and to create thousands and tens of thousands of opportunities for employment. The hon member for Yeoville quoted from the report of the Viljoen Commission which said that if we expand our economy sufficiently, we will also have to train non-European technicians.

<p>I think I should reply as soon as possible to the question put to me by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, so it seems to me, leakages in New York have led to Press reports and that forces me to give certain information to the House at this stage, but I hope I will be excused if I do not go too deeply into the matter since the Government received no formal reply at all. I am therefore not in a position to disclose fully the content of the letter we sent to the Committee, or of the approach made by that Committee. I think this should be given to the Press, or the public or to Parliament at the same time in both place. There should be a release in New York and here in full of the reactions of both sides at the same time. I am, however, prepared to meet the position which has resulted from this leakage by making a certain statement, which I hope will fully satisfy the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and which I hope will prevent us from continuing these discussions under the existing circumstances, particularly since it might upset what could be a favourable arrangement. My statement is as follows:</p>

<p>Informal approaches were made last week to the South African ambassador at the United Nations by the Chairman of the Special Committee of South West Africa. It was the impression of the South African Government that in these informal discussions a spirit of cooperation animated the Committee&#x2019;s approach in the matter.</p>

<p>The South African Government could, of course, not be a party to any proposal or action which could imply a departure from its consistently held attitude on the juridical position since General Smuts led the South African delegation to the United Nations in 1946.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the South African Government still adheres to its desire to have removed this constant source of friction which has for many years had a disturbing effect on conditions of harmony and stability in the territory, so necessary for the promotion of the interests of all those who live in South West Africa.</p>

<p>The co-operative attitude displayed by the Chairman of the Committee in his informal discussion with South Africa&#x2019;s permanent representatives has led the Government to believe that the Committee desires to establish contact with the Government for the purpose of conducting discussions aimed at finding a way out of the present impasse, without requiring the Republic to compromise its juridical position, or to discuss sub-paragraphs (b) to (h) of paragraph 2 of Resolution 1702. On the assumption that this belief is correct, the South African Government has indicated that it would undertake to co-operate to the extent possible for it to do so, without sacrificing its position in any way and without paragraphs (b) to (h) becoming part of these discussions.</p>

<p>In the circumstances it has been decided to extend to the Chairman of the Committee, and also to the Vice-Chairman, an invitation to visit the Republic as guests of the Government, with the assurance that the Government would then be prepared, without prejudice to its juridical position, to enter informally into a review of the matter at issue between the United Nations and the South African Government.</p>

<p>It would not be possible to invite the whole Committee, as this could be open to an interpretation prejudicial to South Africa&#x2019;s position in the case at present pending before the International Court of Justice.</p>

<p>If, as a result of the discussions at Pretoria, it should appear advisable that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman should also visit South West Africa for the purpose of acquainting themselves with the territory and its peoples, then a visit could then be arranged.</p>

<p>If this proposal is accepted, it will be seen that it is in line with the proposal formerly publicized that the South African Government has nothing to hide and would be prepared to receive three past presidents of UNO. If in the circles interested instead of three past presidents it would be preferred to have these two gentlemen as guests of the South African Government, then we see no difference between receiving either the one group of gentlemen or the other, as long as it remains perfectly clear that South Africa can in no way sacrifice the position it has taken up so far. This has been stated quite clearly and if the news report is correct that these gentlemen are prepared to accept our invitation, that could only be to the advantage of all and perhaps lead us out of the present impasse.</p>

<p>I think I should say no more at the present stage.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal with a point that was dealt with by the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday, and dealing with this question of the boundaries of the future Bantustans and the contention that is continually raised by hon. members on the other side that the lands which are being made the subject of the Bantustans are lands which, so far as I am able to interpret the meaning of what the hon. the Prime Minister said yesterday, are their traditional by inheritance (I think that is as fair a way as I can put it). I want to say this. The hon. the Prime Minister said that we are handing back to the Bantu those lands which are traditionally theirs by inheritance. You see, notwithstanding assertions that are made specifically to the effect that the boundaries of the Bantustans are known, there is no such statement available <span class="col_3905-3906" refersTo="page_0579"/>that has ever been made. The boundaries are not known. I would say for example categorically in regard to the extension northwards of the Transkeian Bantustan, why is the Government continuing to buy land in Natal proper, north of the Umtamvuna River, in terms of the definition of the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday? That is not the traditional land by inheritance of the Pondos. They never owned that land, it was never under their paramount chiefs, it has never been under their chiefs. But the Department of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration continues to buy all around Harding; they are making Harding a small White village and all that portion of Natal is obviously destined ultimately to join one of the Bantustans, and it can only join the Transkei; it cannot join Zululand, because Natal proper rests between that portion of southern Natal and Zululand proper.</p>

<p>But let us come to the definition of the hon. the Prime Minister. If he is to give to the Bantu what is traditionally by inheritance their land, then what happens to the whole of Natal? Let us look at our history. The Voortrekkers, Sir, went to get from Dingaan Natal. That was given them. Let them read the document that was found on Piet Retief&#x2019;s body that gave him what is to-day Natal. Do hon. members opposite insinuate that it was the intention of those Voortrekkers to hand that country back again to the Zulus and to give them self-government under their own independent government in respect of those parts? Do hon. members want to say that it was not the intention of the Voortrekkers to actually keep that land that had been granted to them? That land was granted over and over again by the various Bantu chiefs, the same land. Farewell and his people got a grant. They got a grant of land up to Durban Bay. The hon. the Prime Minister talks about land which is traditionally theirs by inheritance. Let us look at the words which to-day appear on our railway stations and so forth, such as the railway station of Congella. What is Congella? That is not the name of that place. The name of that place is Kangela Izinkeruyana. It was the lookout of a Zulu outpost against the cannibals that were then in the whole of the southern portion which had been raided by the Zulus. That established their boundary. That is where their outpost was located, not down on the flat where the railway station is, but up on the hill overlooking the bay. That is historical. Why did the Voortrekkers. why did the first English settlers at the Bay go and ask Zulu chiefs for a grant of land unless they recognized that it was the Zulus&#x2019; to give? Sir, what is the position in Zululand proper when the hon. the Prime Minister talks about the traditional inheritance? How did the present piece of land on which is situated the sugar mill in the Transvaal, the only sugar mill and sugar estate in the Transvaal, how did that piece of land become acquired by Whites in the valley of the Pongola River? That piece of land was acquired by the late General Botha and his commando from Dinizulu, the successor to Cetsjewayo, as the result of helping Dinizulu against Sebepu in the internal wars of the Zulu. That is why that land was granted to them and they took that land that was granted as a result of their help to Dinizulu at the battle of Tshaneni Hill, where the remnants of the battle are still to be seen to-day in the skeletons of those who were killed there. There are still skulls to this day lying there, and anybody who read the late Deneys Reitz&#x2019;s book will see a photo of all the skulls and bones lying there in the veld that was burnt off on Tshaneni Hill 25, 30 years later. General Botha and his Burgers gave that military support and they were given the land in return, but the land did not stop where the Pongola scheme stops to-day. It went right down the valley of the Pongola and across the Flats, and it included Sordwana Bay because the Transvaal Boers wanted an outlet to the ocean, and they intended to make Sordwana Bay their harbour. All the documents of that time make it perfectly clear, and Britain stepped in to stop the Transvaal from getting a port and annexed Zululand as a direct result of Botha&#x2019;s help to Dinizulu. They annexed the whole of the country up to the Portuguese territory of Louren&#x00E7;o Marques so that there was a common boundary between British territory and Portuguese territory. The result was that Britain took the territory right up to Delagoa Bay itself and had a quarrel with the Portuguese. All that is historical. That led to what was called the MacMahon award, when Britain and Portugal instead of going to arms, went to arbitration, and Marshal MacMahon, the President of France, was the arbitrator and Britain then accepted all that land as annexed territory and shut the Boers off from getting their seaport. Is it suggested by hon. members opposite that General Botha and all his people did that with a view to handing that land back to the Zulus to use for a self-governing Zulu state? What utter nonsense, Sir! And to come along as the hon. the Prime Minister does now and say: We will give all this land back to the Zulus, the land which is traditionally their land by inheritance!</p>

We don&#x2019;t accept this thing in principle. But we do want to know where we stand and the White people want to know where they stand.

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister tried to show that there is a difference between the British Government&#x2019;s policy in Kenya and his Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to the White people in the so-called Bantustans. Where is the difference? The hon. the Prime Minister said that in the case of Kenya those people have to go. Where are they to go? Back to their homeland? Where are the people from the Transkei and Zululand to go? The people in Kenya have not lost their franchise rights in Britain. They can go back there and enjoy their franchise rights and their rights of citizenship, just in the same way as the people in the Transkei can get out and come here. As the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) asked: The point is what happens to their property? Where does the Government protect the property and the rights of the people in those areas? They went to that area as an area which was part of our inheritance, a part of South Africa, and whether the territory was on this side of the river or on the other side of the river, or whether they went to Pondoland, they went to a part of South Africa. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) talks about battles that were fought and about sacred places. With all due respect to him what does he know about sacred places and battles that were fought? Those places are places which are here in South Africa, all those sacred places. We have not heard the last of this, Sir. I gave a warning six weeks ago in this House as to what the Zulus were going to do about their sacred places. The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) gave the same warning yesterday. We have our sacred places and the Zulu have their sacred places, and they are just as sacred to them as ours are to us. But the hon. the Prime Minister comes along and he will not define the boundaries, he talks in general terms and then says that there is a misunderstanding. We want to know specifically and precisely where the line is to be drawn, where the boundaries are. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down is very concerned about the price which we wish to pay for the retention of South Africa for the Whites and their civilization, but while I wish to leave him to the hon. the Prime Minister I would like to tell him briefly that the policy of the United Party of a multi-racial state can in the long run result in only one thing and that is the forfeiture of South Africa as a whole, including her civilization. It is precisely in this regard that I wish to express a few ideas. I think that all of us will agree that the most important task in life of a nation is to build a culture and a civilization where Providence has deemed fit to establish that nation. We attach great value to the civilization which we have built up here over 300 years because we have paid very dearly for it. I do not wish to make a blood-and-tears speech but do not think that I shall be guilty of exaggerating if I say that blood and tears and sweat cling to the civilization which we have built up here over 300 years.</p>

<p>If, however, as world opinion demands of us, we were to terminate all racial discrimination overnight and apply the one man, one vote principle here overnight, darkness would descend over the Republic of South Africa and over that dearly earned civilization of ours overnight. Mr. Chairman, one cannot leave a civilization to the mercy of people who are as yet uncivilized or semi-civilized and expect them to maintain it and guard and preserve it for generations to come. The experience elsewhere in Africa has produced ample proof to the contrary. And yet this is precisely what the world, including the so-called civilized nations of the world, including too our own Opposition to-day, expects of us. They expect us to hand over that civilization which we have built up here to people who are still semicivilized and uncivilized and say: &#x201C;Here is our civilization; take it and do with it what you will.&#x201D; Therefore the present Prime Minister, like his Nationalist predecessors, has rejected that road as a stupid, foolish and disastrous road for the Republic of South Africa. And they have therefore planned our road for us; they have demarcated our road ahead, a road which will give the non-Europeans those things which the world demands for them in the name of civilization, but, and this is very important, without destroying us or our civilization or causing us to forfeit that civilization in the process. We will give them one man, one vote, but in their own area. We will end discrimination by living alongside one another as equals in the areas which history has carved out for us. That is briefly our road. That is the road to which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), who, by the way, comes into the Chamber when he wishes to make a speech, referred as &#x201C;minor apartheid&#x201D;. I wonder on whose behalf that hon. member speaks? The day before yesterday he was a member of the U.P.; yesterday he was National; to-day he is N.U. and to-morrow he will be &#x201C;N-I-K-S &#x201D;, yes nothing once again because to-morrow he will again be a member of the U.P.! [Interjection.] Yes, my hon. friends on that side call Mr. Basson &#x201C;a man of many parts &#x201D;, but we call him &#x201C;a man of many parties&#x201D;!</p>

<p>When the hon. the Prime Minister stood up in this House on 23 January 1962 to announce the Transkei self-government plan, he told us: &#x201C;The time to talk and to think and to ponder on our road is past. The time has come for us to place our feet upon the hard earth of that road, that road of apartheid which we have.&#x201D; Therefore that day will &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am speaking about apartheid, Mr. Chairman. I am <span class="col_3909-3910" refersTo="page_0581"/>not ashamed of apartheid and I shall tell you why later. Therefore that day, 23 January 1962, will always stand as an important turning point, as the new order in the history of South Africa; as a red-letter day, when under the forceful and dynamic leadership of the hon. the Prime Minister theoretical apartheid was converted into a practical apartheid; as the day when friend and foe in South Africa saw the fulfilment of our ideal, our long-cherished ideal of segregation; as the day when the Bantu in South Africa have personal experience of the fact that apartheid was not the great lie which was proclaimed to the world, namely, an oppressive and discriminatory policy, but that on the contrary it would open doors for him which would lead to full freedom and independence for him in his own state; and, lastly, as the day when the world outside and our Opposition here in the country had practical experience of what they never wished to accept verbally, namely, that the National Party was in earnest with apartheid all the time; that all the time we were sincere in this regard and there was never any question of its being a bluff.</p>

<p>And gradually, Mr. Chairman, they will also realize that apartheid is possible in practice. Time will also teach them that this is the only solution to the problem of multi-racialism on the Continent of Africa and elsewhere. It remains the one and only solution which is fair towards both White and non-White and which takes cognizance of the demands of our calling of civilization. The day will come when the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, which in the meantime has become a word of abuse in the world, will be reinstated as an honourable word because it will be seen that this is the only Christian and morally justifiable policy. When we refer to the Transkei we say with pride to-day to the Bantu in our midst and also to the whole world: There is apartheid; there is the Transkei as its first gleaming fruit. More Transkeis will come. This is the start of peaceful co-existence in South Africa; this is the start of a peaceful commonwealth of nations in Southern Africa. Let the little people continue to fuss and complain as they have done over the past few days; let the mongrels bark, the caravan of apartheid moves onward to better White-Black race relationships, to a new order of peaceful co-existence of White and non-White in South Africa.</p>

<p>And now, Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by following somewhat the example of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. No, I do not wish to become a United Party supporter! However, I wish to ask a question, as he did. I do not wish to ask as many questions as he did. I want to put one question to him. The question which I want to put to him is this: When is he going to stand up in this House again and make a speech in which he adopts a definite standpoint and when is he going to cease asking a series of questions which give no indication of the standpoint which he adopts?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Throughout the lengthy discussion on this Vote very little indeed has been said about the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy in regard to our Coloured people. The Coloured citizens constitute an important section of our population and I wish to avail myself of this opportunity of discussing their position in our country. I hope the hon. the Prime Minister will give me his attention in what I have to say in this regard. I do so in the hope that the Prime Minister, who up to now has dealt most casually with his policy in regard to the Coloureds in this country, will be induced to make a further pronouncement which will hold out to these people some hope for their future. I think, Sir, that they are entitled to hear from the hon. the Prime Minister himself what part he envisages for them in their own country.</p>

<p>Sufficient has already been said in this debate on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy to substantiate the grim fact that South Africa stands isolated to-day in the eyes of the world as a result of the racial policy which has relentlessly been pursued by this Government since 1948. There is no gainsaying the fact, Sir, that the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policies&#x2014;when I talk of his policies I am talking of the policies of the Government&#x2014;have been the principal object of enmity on this African Continent and have been primarily responsible for isolating us from the rest of the world. These policies, we are told by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;and I accept what he says&#x2014;have been pursued for the purpose (and I use his own words) &#x201C;of saving the White man of this country and saving White civilization in South Africa&#x201D;. The hon. the Prime Minister claims that his sole object is an earnest desire to save the White man in South Africa. I should like to say immediately, Sir, that I do not think there is a single person in this House who will not associate himself with that stated object of the hon. the Prime Minister, i.e. the earnest desire to save the White man of South Africa. But the differences which exist between the Nationalist Party on the one hand and every section of the Opposition on the other with regard to the saving of the White civilization of our country, are the means whereby this object is to be attained. I think it would be fair to say that we are all united in attaining the end but where we differ fundamentally from the hon. the Prime Minister and from each other in this House, is in respect of the means by which this end is to be achieved. Where I think, with respect, the Prime Minister errs is that he thinks of the White people of South Africa in complete isolation. The hon. the Prime Minister is responsible for having made a policy statement in which he declared to the world&#x2014; and I use his own words&#x2014;that &#x201C;when I talk of the nation of South Africa, I talk of the White nation of South Africa&#x201D;. Since the declaration of that unfortunate policy statement, many members of the Cabinet and many ordinary members of the Nationalist Party have followed the same line of thought, i.e. of talking of the South African nation as though it consisted exclusively of a White nation with a <span class="col_3911-3912" refersTo="page_0582"/>total disregard of the rest of the South African population. I repeat, Sir, that the fundamental mistake made by the hon. the Prime Minister is that he thinks of the White people of South Africa in absolute isolation. He fails to take into account the fact that the 3,000,000 White people living in this country and whom he wants to save, live integrated with the 12,000,000 other people of this country. He fails to take into account the fact that the 3,000, 000 White people of the South African nation are dependent in many respects upon the rest of the South African population in order to survive. Surely the hon. the Prime Minister realizes that throughout the country the presence of all sections of our population is absolutely necessary if the 3,000,000 White people of this country are to survive. For instance, Sir, one cannot imagine the continued existence of the Rand without its vast population of Africans; can one imagine what future development there will be in our industries in this country without the services and the needs of the other 12,000,000 of our South African population; can one imagine for a single moment how the Western Province&#x2014;I am coming nearer home&#x2014;will survive without our Coloured people at practically every level? No, Mr. Chairman, if the non-White residents of South Africa were to be withdrawn from the farming industry in this country, can you imagine what would happen to that industry? The more one examines the position, without introducing any political bias, the more one is convinced that our South African nation cannot be regarded as the White man in isolation. If South Africa is to survive as a country the basic fact has to be acknowledged that the White man and the non-Whites are all inextricably interwoven and dependent upon each other for their survival. When the hon. the Prime Minister talks of the South African nation as consisting of the Whites, he must surely realize the incalculable harm he is doing his laudable object of trying to save the White man of this country. Surely the hon. the Prime Minister realizes that a statement of policy of the nature of the one I have just read must offend not only the 12,000,000 remaining citizens of this country but must have a most devastating effect on South Africa in the eyes of the outside world.</p>

<p>I wish to deal to-day particularly with the impact of that policy statement by the Prime Minister upon our Coloured people. The hon. the Prime Minister already knows what the world&#x2019;s reaction was. I do not wish to take up the time at my disposal to go into that. The Prime Minister already knows what that reaction was to this statement of policy of his. I wish to confine myself to the effect which this has had upon the Coloured community of South Africa. I say, Sir, that the Coloured people were deeply shocked by this policy statement of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s. When I talk of the Coloured people, Sir, I talk of them as a whole, the handful of the Coloured people who support the Government and the vast majority who are non-supporters of the Government. I am not going to quote to-day from the public statements which were made by most of the prominent leaders of the Coloured people with regard to this policy statement. But what strikes me forcibly, Sir, and what I think is worthy of repeating here in the presence of the hon. the Prime Minister, is the manner in which this policy statement was received even by that handful of Coloured people who are supporters of the Government for reasons best known to themselves. I want to quote, for instance, from statements made by Government nominated members of the Union Council of Coloured Affairs. These men owe everything that they possess in the way of status in the Coloured community to this Government. These men have attained their positions as a result of being nominated to this Council by the Government. These men themselves in no uncertain terms condemned the statement of the Prime Minister in regard to his conception of the South African nation. For instance, Mr. S. Dollie, who is a Government nominated executive member of the Union Council of Coloured Affairs, said this with regard to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am greatly upset by Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s remarks. When a man tells me I am not a South African, I feel insulted &#x2026; I do not quite understand what the hon. the Prime Minister means. In my opinion any person who has made South Africa his home is a South African. The Coloured people are a part of the whole South African nation, even though we might have a system of self-development.</block>

<p>He is now trying to justify his support of the Government. Though they might have a system of self-development, the Coloured people form part of the South African nation&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) could not control his urge to &#x201C;march&#x201D; this morning once again and he marched right into the mud. I would like to tell the hon. member that a man should not tackle a task for which he is not equipped. If you do not know your history, you must not confuse the British annexation of Zululand and the incorporation of Zululand into Natal in that way. If a man does not have the heart for it, he must not demand that his province &#x201C;march and if a man cannot speak representatively of South Africa, he must not try to teach the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government a lesson as to how they must deal with the geographical surface of South Africa. What does the hon. member for South Coast represent? He <span class="col_3913-3914" refersTo="page_0583"/>represents a province which until two years ago had not even become a member of the Union, as far as its spirit was concerned; which did not even think that its borders were the Drakensberg but that its borders were at Cato Ridge. Now this is the man who has to teach us a concept of history and the demand which history makes of us in respect of the utilization of the territory of South Africa. Then he has the audacity to ask me what I know about the holy places of South Africa and what right I have to speak about them. If he can find a history teacher, the hon. member can inquire from him about Hans Steyn of Blood River, Congella, through Boomplaats, the first magistrate of Utrecht, and so fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I come now to his pertinent historical reference when he spoke about the situation in Natal and the annexation of the territory of the New Republic of Vryheid. In the first place it was not General Louis Botha who was the leader when that land was obtained. As a young man he accompanied General Lukas Meyer who led the operation and the negotiations. Neither General Botha nor General Lukas Meyer participated in that action to obtain land for South Africa for a fixed purpose. They went along to obtain the land for the use of their people because is was right and necessary for the nation to use that land. Those eastern parts of the new Republic which were first annexed by the British Imperial Government and later taken over by the Union Parliament in 1936, were set aside chiefly as Bantu areas in that arrangement of 1936. Now the hon. member must tell us what his party&#x2019;s policy is. They also wish to implement that 1936 settlement; they also wish to purchase the remaining land for Natal which must be purchased in terms of their policy. What is his criticism in respect of the determination of our boundaries and what is the difference between the parties, and what is their standpoint as a whole? It did not pass unnoticed that the hon. member for Hill-brow (Dr. Steenkamp) said that the borders of their Bantustans are well known&#x2014;they are the borders of South Africa. Precisely! That is the whole difference. Those hon. gentlemen wish to subject the whole of South Africa to the Bantu and we wish to give a portion to the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast should really tell us what the borders of the local autonomous Bantu areas in Natal will be in terms of their own policy, according to the explanation of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). He said: &#x201C;The Native areas should be given local authorities.&#x201D; Where will the borders of their &#x201C;local authorities&#x201D; in Natal be in terms of their policy? The hon. member should rather tell us how many members will be made available to represent the Bantu in this Central Parliament. The urban members were mentioned by their Leader, but the representatives of the Bantu national groups were not mentioned. Is the number going to be eight or is it going to be 16? He can also tell us how many Indian representatives they are going to send to the Central Parliament. He can also stand up and give us the information which his hon. Leader has never given to the country, although they try to sell an alternative Government policy to the country. He should rather stand up and tell us what Natal will do with those Indians entitled to the franchise in their provincial councils and city councils. He need not speak about people who wish to swim with the Indians but he is a member of the party which desires to give an undefined franchise to the Indians in the Central Government, but he has never investigated this aspect, the implications which will arise from it at the provincial and municipal level. [Interjections.] The interjection of that hon. member in connection with the Japanese is just as appropriate as his meddling with and abuse of the past. He can always make misuse of an argument because he does not grasp the point of it.</p>

<p>I asked that the hon. member for South Coast should inform us in regard to the implications of the policy of that party in respect of the Indians in Natal. In conclusion the hon. member can also inform us in regard to what he has in mind in connection with control over the land which has historical associations as far as the Whites are concerned. He stated here that those who went to the Transkei and Pondoland went to a part of South Africa, to White man&#x2019;s territory, just as this is. Does he stand by that? Does the hon. member wish to state that the various territories which were annexed in the Eastern Cape from 1877 to 1884 were annexed as White man&#x2019;s territories? Or were they Bantu-Xhosa territories which were placed under the control of the Imperial Government and the old Cape Government? Surely it is a well-known fact that those territories were never released for White settlement as was the policy to the South in the Ciskeian Territory. And if he gives this interpretation to history, let him stand up and tell us whether the Transkeian Territories and all the Bantu territories in South Africa should now, in terms of the policy of that party, be released for White occupation or not.</p>

<p>When I was interrupted a moment ago by the time limit, I had read to this Committee a statement made by one of the members of the Union Council of Coloured Affairs, Mr. Dollie, with regard to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement as to his conception of the South African nation. This statement came from a supporter of the Government, a man who owes his status amongst the Coloured people, to the office conferred upon him by this Government. We have heard what his reaction was to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement.</p>

<p>I want to quote another Government nominee&#x2019;s views on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement I refer to the statement made by Mr. T. M. <span class="col_3915-3916" refersTo="page_0584"/>Le Fleur, also a nominated member of the Council. He had this to say with regard to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured people are just as much South Africans as any White man. I feel that everyone must be given a stake in this country. If the Europeans are the only South Africans then the Coloured people must be accepted as Europeans. The hon. the Prime Minister must withdraw that statement. That sort of talk does not make for unity in this country.</block>

<p>Another Coloured man, who is a direct employee of the Government, not a nominated member of the Council, but a direct employee of the Government, is Mr. Adam Small. He is a lecturer in philosophy at the Coloured University of the Western Cape. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s remarks were a cold and deliberate statement without any conscience.</block>

<p>It only emphasizes the distance existing between apartheid and the reality of circumstances which for us fill every day with the immoral consequences of the idea that the nation of South Africa is the White people of South Africa.</p>

<p>Dirk Opperman, our celebrated Afrikaans poet, recently referred to the&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; &#x201C;cold spiritual hell&#x201D; which is awaiting Afrikanerdom. It really is a pity that everything best in the Afrikaner nation should have to suffer for this sort of thing&#x2026;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, these then are typical of the condemnations which the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy statement with regard to the South African nation, received from even Government supporters among the Coloured people. You can well imagine, Sir, what the Coloured opponents of the Government had to say in regard to that statement of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s. But I do not at this stage, propose to waste my time by reading those to the Prime Minister. However, this condemnation did not only come from the Coloured people. White supporters of the Government also condemned this unfortunate statement on the part of the hon. the Prime Minister. Even the Government sponsored organ, the <i>Burger,</i> had a great deal to say about this unfortunate declaration. Other European supporters of the Government condemned it. A man like the hon. Thomas Boy-dell who, for reasons best known to himself, lauds the Government on every possible occasion, rushed in to condemn that statement. In his own inimitable style, in dealing with the Coloured people, he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured people are the Whites&#x2019; responsibility and belong to the White orbit in this country. I just cannot understand the Prime Minister&#x2019;s conception.</block>

<p>Surely there was no necessity for the hon. the Prime Minister to give this gratuitous insult to the Coloured people. Surely it is necessary, Sir, even at this late stage&#x2014;and it is a late stage&#x2014;in view of our isolated position, in view of the difficulties with which our country is being confronted, for us to do something to win back the friendship and the goodwill of this important section of our population, a section which has always loyally stood by the White people of this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, has the time not come for the hon. the Prime Minister to clarify his statement of policy with regard to the South African nation? Has the time not arrived for him to declare in no uncertain terms that he includes our Coloured people in his definition of the South African nation? Has the time not arrived for the hon. the Prime Minister to declare to the world at large that he is prepared to take active and tangible steps to incorporate the Coloured people in the South African nation? Does the hon. the Prime Minister not realize that the continued deprivation of citizenship rights of our Coloured people is totally opposed to the outlook of Western civilization and to all Western conceptions? Surely the Government must realize that in this year 1962, the civilized world leans towards extending political rights rather than curtailing such rights. Surely the hon. the Prime Minister realizes that in the last few years&#x2014;and even during the course of this Session&#x2014;the Government has been responsible for moving South Africa further and further away from the ideals and practices of Western civilization.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the point where I started. Whilst, therefore, we all have a common object of endeavouring to save the White man of this country, it is necessary for us to examine, without bias and without introducing any political animosity one way or the other, the best way by which this can be achieved.</p>

<p>I say that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s method of endeavouring to save the White man by isolating him, as his policy indicates, &#x2026;</p>

I say, Sir, that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s method of trying to save the White man by isolating him is doomed to failure. It can only continue in turning the rest of the world from us. If South Africa is to survive as a nation there will have to be some complete re-thinking on the part of the hon. the Prime Minister, because to my mind, Sir, he is the guiding spirit in this matter. There will have to be some rethinking on the part of the Prime Minister as to what the South African nation shall consist of. I say that no time must be lost. I say that no time must be lost in modifying the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy statement so <span class="col_3917-3918" refersTo="page_0585"/>as to include in our South African nation at least our Coloured people. I do not wish to delve into the problems confronting the Government in regard to the Bantu, but at least in regard to the Coloured people who traditionally and historically form part and parcel of the White population it is at least necessary for the Prime Minister to include in our South African nation those Coloured citizens who historically have always been regarded as belonging to the White orbit in South Africa. I hope that the Prime Minister will in the course of this debate make some pronouncement with regard to the Coloured people so as to hold out to them some hope for the future role they have to play in South Africa, their only country.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SOUTH WEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) repeated the accusation which we have heard so often in the past, namely, that South Africa is isolated from the rest of the world and, more especially, that the hatred revealed in the African countries towards South Africa is as a result of the policy of this Government. They base their statement largely upon what happens at UN and from that they make their deduction. I feel that it is my duty to dwell on this point for a while. Let us see what the position was at UN when the United Party was in power and what changes have come about since then.</p>

<p>If we go back we will find that in 1946 the total membership of UN was 55 and in 1947, it was 57, of which about two-thirds could be regarded as being European countries and the remainder countries of the Afro-Asian group. There is no doubt therefore that at that time the West controlled the balance of power and that the West could enforce its will at all costs. But what has happened since? To-day the membership of UN stands at more than 100 and those which have since been included have almost without exception been non-White states; those which are still to be included and will be included will without exception all be non-White states. This changed the pattern at UN completely and not only this, but it also changed the spirit which prevailed there. In 1946 and 1947 we experienced a post-war spirit of cameraderie which arose from people who fought alongside one another, a spirit of goodwill towards South Africa because South Africa fought together with those Black nations of Africa to save their hides. At that time the South African soldiers liberated Abyssinia and Somaliland and helped to fight in the north of Africa. There is no doubt that those things had to make an impression on those people and it would have been extremely ungrateful of them to take action against South Africa at that time. However, one forgets quickly and it is precisely those countries which have forgotten what South Africa did for them, the White man of South Africa, when they needed that assistance. As I say, the whole spirit has changed. Where it was a spirit of friendship, it has changed into a spirit of animosity, and for what reason? Firstly, because of our colour policy. Let us accept this as being so, but there are also other reasons and very serious reasons, reasons which have their origin here in South Africa. In this House, from poltical platforms and in newspapers it has been stated that in South Africa the present Government is oppressing the non-Whites. It is said that this is a police state; that the non-Europeans are thrown into prison in large numbers without trial. Mention is made of the cruel apartheid laws which are applied here and the serious discrimination against people simply because of their colour.</p>

<p>Somebody has again said so. This is reiterated. However, it does not remain here. From here it is taken overseas and these things are used overseas. Blood-curdling stories are told there at UN, bolstered up and supported by cuttings from newspapers here, from speeches which are made in this House and elsewhere. There can be no other result than that when these things are conveyed at UN, they create a feeling of rage on the part of those people. I myself have seen what happens there. When evidence was produced there against South Africa, one of the members in the Fourth Committee stood up with clenched fists and called out with tears in his eyes: &#x201C;For God&#x2019;s sake, just tell me this is not true!&#x201D; What else can we expect if those people are so stirred up at UN by the persons who give evidence there? It must create a feeling of rage on their part. It must create a feeling of hatred and opposition and distaste, and where is the source of that trouble? It is here in South Africa, from the lips of South Africans, from reports in our own newspapers. No wonder that a person who is held in very high esteem by the United Party said this&#x2014;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SOUTH WEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No less a person <span class="col_3919-3920" refersTo="page_0586"/>than the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) on 31 March 1958. Those were his words. He is a partner of the United Party to-day and his documents and speeches are used eagerly by UN.</p>

<p>Then we had a changed method of action at UN. In former times the countries which were represented there acted independently, individually. Each one acted on its own but that no longer happens to-day. We have joint action taking place to-day. No matter is discussed in UN unless a thorough caucus has been held in that regard. It often happened that when a meeting was due to start the chairman announced that the meeting could not start because the African group was still in caucus or the Afro-Asian group was still in caucus. This is the way they operate, in groups, and those caucus resolutions bind each member of that group. It is self-evident that when such joint action is taken it is a far more effective manner of taking action than was previously the case. It is the White nations at UN which do not form a group and have no caucus.</p>

<p>The next difficulty is that Africa has become a very important factor in world politics today. Every country at UN is seeking the favour of the African states because each one of them has a vote which counts just as much as do the votes of America or France or Russia or Britain. They fear that number of votes because it is the number of votes which is used to compel any country there to do what they want. No wonder that America has now started placating. Mr. Adlai Stevenson, the Ambassador of the United States of America at UN, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He raised an important issue this week when he spoke in favour of continued support of UN. Mr. Stevenson spoke cautiously, almost unenthusiastically, because in the United States at the moment there is considerable criticism of UN, as there has been recently in Britain in official quarters, notably in a speech by the Foreign Secretary, Lord Home, and even more strongly in France. In the early years of the UN the West was dominant and consequently and inevitably there was repeated use of the Veto by Russia. [Time limit.]</block>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister painted a picture of what happened at one of the committee meetings at UN and told us that when one of the witnesses against South Africa appeared before that committee, this delegate, presumably from one of the African states, got up and called out: &#x201C;For God&#x2019;s sake, tell me it is not true!&#x201D; Now the question arises: Why did we not tell those people that those false stories were not true? [Interjections.] The Deputy Minister made a comparison between the UN of 1946 and of to-day. I am the first to admit that difference exists and that in 1946 there were only 55 members, whereas now there are over 100, and that of the 55 members in 1946 the majority represented White nations. But again we point out: In 1946, of those 55 White nations we could get the support or the friendly neutrality of up to half or two-thirds, while to-day of those 55 nations, who are all still there, we can get the support of one or two at the most. That is the important point. The hon. the Deputy Minister will forgive me if I do not follow him further, because I want to raise another matter.</p>

<p>My Leader, during his speech yesterday, raised a very important matter when he referred to Radio South Africa and to certain events in that organization which are causing alarm to the general public. The airy dismissal of the subject by the hon. the Prime Minister in a sentence or two is to be deplored. After all, the Prime Minister is one of the people who has been using the radio for purposes which we do not regard as proper. I think of one instance when he made a speech after the last general election criticizing the hon. members for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) and South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and making political remarks of the most deplorable nature.</p>

<p>If ever there was an issue calling for an investigation at the highest level, it is the S.A.B.C. If ever there was a granite wall hiding from our view favouritism, nepotism, frustration, seething discontent, Gestapo methods and political persecution, it is the granite wall surrounding the S.A.B.C. For. mark you, Sir, that organization is getting &#x00A3;1.6 million a year from the public in licence fees, and those licence fees have been increased to an extent equivalent to probably 10 per cent of the taxes paid by the poorer people. Nearly &#x00A3;1,000,000 is taken by Springbok Radio. Millions are granted in loans to the S.A.B.C. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent on a luxury building in Parktown which became a sort of club for the members of the board of directors, and we are not allowed to know the particulars about what happened there. We do not get those particulars, despite the fact that the law of the land, the Broadcasting Act, says that those particulars&#x2014;not general facts&#x2014; must be placed before Parliament. Even today we had the fantastic case of the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs getting up and telling us that he could not get information from the S.A.B.C. as to whether there was any consultation with political leaders during the last general election on political broadcasts. Yet two weeks previously he had specifically told me in reply to a question in this House that there had been such consultations. Where did he get that information? Obviously from the S.A.B.C., and I say that information was false and I say it was probably a lie.</p>

<p>Sir, the country has been alarmed during the past year by the spate of resignations of people in important positions in the S.A.B.C. We had, first of all, the resignation of the Director-General, Mr. Gideon Roos, a brilliant man, whose resignation so shocked the country that even the <i>Burger</i> had to cry out&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">dat dit in hierdie tyd nie kan bekostig word <span class="col_3921-3922" refersTo="page_0587"/>dat seifs een voortreflike seun van ons land op die verkeerde plek is of glad nie gebruik word nie. So &#x2019;n surplus van begaafdheid het ons waarlik nie in ho&#x00EB; kringe nie.</block>

<p>That was only one resignation. There were the resignations of the editor of the <i>Radio Bulletin</i> during the past 12 months, the resignation of the senior administrative assistant to the Director-General, and of an important producer. There were the resignations of another senior producer in March last year, the resignation of a senior announcer in May last year, and of a further senior radio announcer in May last year, a man who had 27 years&#x2019; service. In December last year an important official resigned and then the Deputy Chief of the news service resigned. The Publicity Manager of the S.A.B.C. resigned last year after 28 years&#x2019; service. An important technical adviser, Mr. Robert Gaynor, resigned after 25 years&#x2019; service. A Cambridge graduate who had been with the Corporation for 15 years resigned last year, and a fortnight ago the whole of the English news staff in Durban resigned. What is going on when these continual resignations are taking place?</p>

<p>We know that there are contracts entered into by these gentlemen which preclude them from telling the public what has happened. We are not prepared to accept the excuse, first of all, that this is ordinary wear and tear in an organization. It is not ordinary wear and tear; it is an erosion of talent and men and money in a fearful mess. It is no excuse to say, as the S.A.B.C. has been saying, that the resignations only represent 1.8 per cent of the senior male staff; 12 major resignations in one year is not 1.8 per cent of the senior male staff, and that can be worked out on any bit of paper, because it means that there would have to be 660 members on the senior male staff. Here I believe again that the S.A.B.C. has been giving deliberately false information to the country. There is indeed something rotten behind this granite curtain. In December we discovered that a certain person had been appointed as the Head of the Personnel Department, who would go into the capabilities of all the staff members of the S.A.B.C. One of the results of that was, I believe, that Christmas bonuses were arbitrarily cut or increased.</p>

<p>Now we ask ourselves what we are to do about this. I say the first and most important thing is for the S.A.B.C. to carry out the law as laid down in the Broadcasting Act and let Parliament know the particulars as demanded by that Act, and I am not the first one to say so. The United Party had the courage to appoint a Commission of Inquiry into the S.A.B.C. in 1946. It brought out its report in 1948, but unfortunately, owing to the change of Government, that report could not be carried out, but one of the recommendations in the report was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board&#x2019;s annual reports for the last few years do not comply with the requirements of the Act. They are incomplete and it is impossible to ascertain therefrom how the Corporation&#x2019;s finances are managed. The Corporation&#x2019;s balance sheet and expenditure account should be shown in far greater detail in the Board&#x2019;s annual report.</block>

<p>I do not propose to deal with the private feuds of hon. members in connection with special matters, nor do I propose to reply to the hon. member who has just sat down. If he wants to continue his feud in respect of Radio South Africa, there are other Votes perhaps under which he can do so. There is only one point that he made which affects me personally and in regard to which I should like to say a few words. He alleged that I had misused the radio. He bases that on one broadcast out of the many that I made. He regards that as sufficient to justify generalization. The particular broadcast to which he refers was made in response to a request after the recent general election to give a diagnosis, as I saw the position, of the significance of the results of that election. If hon. members think that one misuses the radio when one gives one&#x2019;s honest opinion, when the election is over and it can no longer have any influence on the outcome, as to what one thinks the election proved, then I do not understand them. After all, there is only one way in which one can react in expressing an opinion after an election and that is to talk politics and I certainly did talk politics. I said what I thought of the chances of the Progressive Party, and that is that in due course the United Party would wipe them out again. That statement is held against me by the Progressives. Apparently even this consolidation did not greatly delight hon. members of the United Party, because as far as the United Party is concerned I stated that it was an outmoded party in terms of the points of view and the matters that it could submit to the public. My opinion therefore was that unless the United Party became rejuvenated and imbued with a new spirit and began to develop new policies and became positive in its planning for the future, the outcome of the election had shown that it was no longer acceptable; that the electorate no longer regarded it as a party which really had any prospect of making a contribution. In other words, in that case it was a dying party. That was the trend of my diagnosis of the outcome of the previous election. When the public has to be informed over the radio as to what the then Prime Minister thinks of the outcome of an election, then I do not propose on such an occasion (which I certainly do not misuse because it can have no affect on the next election which will only be held in another five years) to hide my opinion simply in order to receive eulogies perhaps from the hon. member about my reticence. That is all I wish to say in this regard.</p>

<p>Then just a few words with regard to the questions put to me by the representatives of <span class="col_3923-3924" refersTo="page_0588"/>the Coloureds. The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has made use of this opportunity to make a propagandistic attack. I do not think that attack deserves to be analysed by me in dealing with my Vote, and I do not propose to do so in detail therefore. All I do want to say is that one must distinguish between two aspects of this matter. The one is citizenship of a country and the other is what the components of a homogeneous nation are. There is no doubt that the Coloureds are citizens of this country. There is just as little doubt that they are not part of this homogeneous entity that can be described here as &#x201C;the nation&#x201D;. Just as one finds in certain other states that two groups of the population who in the nature of things are two nations have the same citizenship, so in South Africa too various groups of the population who in the nature of things are different nations possess citizenship. The Bantu are part and parcel of the citizens of South Africa, but who on earth would say that they form one nation together with either the Coloureds or the Indians or the Whites or everybody in this country? We ourselves as Whites are descended from various nations, and for a long time we regarded ourselves as English and Afrikaners, etc. With the establishment of the Republic the unification of those two components into one nation became a possibility, and it is for that possibility that I plead. But, after all, the unification of both White population groups into one nation need not necessarily be accompanied by a further unification, namely a unification into one nation together with the Bantu. What constitutes a nation is something quite different from the citizens of a state. I fully adhere therefore to what I said in that connection. What is of more actual importance to the Coloureds is the question that was put to me by the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) concerning the destinies of the Coloureds in a part of his constituency, namely in the Transkei. Here we are dealing with various groups of Coloureds. They are not all of the same type. In the first place there are the Coloureds in the White areas, in the towns which remain White areas. Their position in respect of the Republic is precisely the same as that of the Whites who remain in those areas. They remain under the control of the Republic of South Africa. Their political rights too will therefore be exercised in the same way in which those rights are being exercised now by Coloureds here, just as in the case of White citizens those White citizens remain parliamentary voters Then there are the Coloureds who will be in the Bantu-controlled area, and here we also find two types. There is the one type who is on a par with the White traders. Just as the White traders as citizens of the Republic will continue to exercise their political rights as they do at the present time, so too those Coloureds will continue to exercise their political rights as they have done in the past. That applies to that section of the Coloureds in that area who retain their identity. That is the first of the two groups within the Bantu-controlled area. But there is another group within the Bantu-controlled area, namely the Coloureds who have become absorbed into the Bantu community, who pay Bantu taxes and inter-marry with the Xhosa and who have therefore become largely assimilated with them. These non-Whites will probably have to be classified as Xhosa citizens. Apart from that group which has actually become assimilated&#x2014;and it is a small portion&#x2014;we find amongst the first group, namely those who have retained their identity, a section occupying certain areas as agriculturists, for example at Rietvlei and Umzimkulu. They present a special problem, a problem which it will probably be possible to solve only by means of re-settlement. Some time ago an inter-departmental committee was appointed to enquire into the destinies of the Coloureds in all the Bantu areas of South Africa, with special reference to the Transkei. With the assistance of the report that will come from this committee we shall have to devise plans as to what we can reasonably do in respect of those Coloureds who have retained their identity and who will probably no longer wish to live in a Bantu State but in another agricultural area that will be under the control of the Department of Coloured Affairs. If that is what they desire, then it will be possible to plan accordingly. In other words, we are very seriously considering the position of those Coloureds More than that I need not say in this regard.</p>

<p>I come back now to the further discussion that has taken place here as far as the United Party is concerned. I must admit the discussion that has taken place since I last spoke has not produced much that is new, apart from the fact that they did advance a few new arguments to buttress the accusations made earlier in the debate&#x2014;for example about the lack of knowledge on the part of the public with regard to the proposed boundaries. Some of the main arguments advanced were the accusations made by the hon. members for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp), namely that I am supposed to have said that all kinds of areas which are now White but in which formerly one or other Native group lived are regarded by me as being theirs by inheritance and that it will be taken out of the hands of the Whites to be given to the Bantu group concerned. But that is not what I said. What I said was quite clear, namely that it concerns what is now Bantu area and what is theirs by inheritance. If I did not say it clearly enough for those hon. members to understand it in that way, then I am putting it this way now to clarify what I said before. Our attitude in regard to the Transkei has already been stated very clearly, viz. that this Bantu controlled area, under any new Constitution which might be given to the Bantu, will be precisely the same area, i.e. bordered as it is now, which is being controlled by the present Bantu Territorial Authority. In that sense I said that the borders were clearly determined, because the <span class="col_3925-3926" refersTo="page_0589"/>borders of every Bantu Territorial Authority are prescribed by law. Therefore the borders of the Transkeian Territorial Authority have also been prescribed. When people allege, as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) did, that there is doubt in the minds of the population of Port St. John&#x2019;s, then there is no justification for it. In fact, I clearly stated that the Bantu Constitution would concern the area as it is now in fact defined, viz. as the area over which the Bantu Territorial Authority now has authority. The latter, however, has no authority over Port St. John&#x2019;s. I said on a previous occasion that in my opinion Port St. John&#x2019;s is not a White spot, as, for example, Cala is, because it is not completely surrounded. The fact that the sea on the one side forms the link with the White state particularly does not make it a White spot. If hon. members opposite do not accept that, or if they do not like one to argue in that way, they can do what they like, but that is the definition this Government gives to it and will maintain. Its policy will be judged in terms of its own definition and not in terms of any interpretation the Opposition may like to attach to it.</p>

<p>May I put a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member may put his question in a few moments. I hope that it is now very clear that when I talk about what is Bantu area, which may come under the control of the new Bantu machinery of control, then it is essentially and basically the presently existing area. Therefore I am now referring only to this as the area which is now Bantu area and which is theirs by inheritance. I am giving no undertaking and making no promises in respect of any other area which in the course of history became White territory. It is now White territory, inherited and by inheritance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Does that apply to the Transvaal also?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It applies everywhere. The area which is White now remains White; the area which is Bantu now remains Bantu. To that, however, I added this: an undertaking was given in terms of the 1936 Act which affects land which is White territory. That is not based on any argument in connection with inheritance or any other argument, but results from the legislation introduced by the United Party in 1936. So, for example, originally an obligation was entered into to add 7,500,000 morgen to what is Bantu territory. A reasonably large proportion of it has been purchased during the course of the years and added to it, but everything has not been added yet; everything has not yet been purchased. That quota of 7,500,000 morgen included the released area, but the released areas were not sufficient. In that Act it was therefore also provided that the portion which did not as released areas comply with the promises but falls within the quota would have to be indicated from time to time. The Government will also have to purchase that and add it because it has undertaken to honour the promises made to the Bantu by the previous Government. No Government can honourably do otherwise than honour such undertakings given by its predecessors. Therefore it is essential to continue to add to what is obviously the already clearly defined Bantu area the amount of land promised in terms of the United Party Act of 1936, in the first place the released area and further quota land outside it.</p>

<p>In addition, one is still landed with a problem, namely that there are certain Black spots. Black spots have also been clearly defined in many discussions in the past, viz. as not also the smaller Bantu reserves, and in regard to this the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) is confused. Black spots have clearly been defined by us as such smaller Bantu residential areas or farms which have from time to time been acquired by them or which have been given to them inside the White rural area. They often form little areas of about 4,000 morgen, or even smaller, which were perhaps granted to them in Paul Kruger&#x2019;s time for certain services rendered. Land was then given to them, e.g., as the result of assistance given by them against Black attackers. Some Black spots are in fact inside the released area and surrounded by Whites, but they are not really reserves as defined in the 1918 Act. The result is that one has to deal with private Black areas completely surrounded by Whites and which are small, as well as with declared reserves. Those which are not reserves are the most obvious areas to exchange and to shift the population. We will continue to shift these people so that they will be nearer to their own folk, because in terms of the Act that is comparatively easy. On the other hand, to exchange a proclaimed reserve, however small it may be, and to shift its inhabitants to the compensating area is difficult, but we also undertook that in some cases. Therefore I said that it is only reasonable that when a definite Black spot or a smaller reserve can easily be consolidated with the basic Native area, it will become White, whilst White land adjoining that Native area will become Black in exchange for it. That is an old practice which we have been applying for a long time already. By doing that the White area becomes more consolidated and the Black area becomes more of a geographic unit. For that reason I said that whilst the borders within which such an authority will receive jurisdiction are clearly defined, as they are under the Territorial Authorities, there will be adaptations of the borders in the course of time, <i>inter alia</i> by means of this specific procedure. It was done in the same way in the past, but in the past the Government sometimes had to try for five years to exchange a small Black spot for a White area adjoining the Bantu area, simply because the Bantu thought that they were being deceived, or because they were strongly attached to their land and had no feeling of attachment for the other area where ethnically they belonged more. In future, when <span class="col_3927-3928" refersTo="page_0590"/>better Bantu controlling machinery is created for the Bantu area, for which every Bantu in the Transkei will have the vote, it will be easier to have the necessary adaptation of outlook. It is absolutely clear that we are not unjustifiably trying to rob the Whites of their land. Any scaremongering by the hon. member for South Coast or the hon. member for Hillbrow to frighten the people of Natal is deplorable, for example, that the Government is creating great confusion and that it wants to deprive the Bantu of large areas of land without applying the procedure which has been adopted over the years. By doing this the Opposition is misleading the people and creating unnecessary anxiety.</p>

<p>I also want to remind hon. members that on the previous occasion I spoke here I said that when I referred to Zululand in connection with any Zulu authority, I was referring only to what is already Bantu Zululand, and that I realize that the concept of Zululand is history, and even to-day in the ordinary language of many Natalians, is a much broader concept which includes large areas which beyond any doubt are occupied by Whites. I then said that I did not want to be misunderstood, and that I did not want to create the impression that everything which is generally known as Zululand is the area to which we refer when we speak about the area which the Zulu nation may govern itself. That was clearly all I referred to when I used the words that all the Zulu nation will control is that which is now its own territory, because it is also its territory by inheritance. Surely one cannot state it more clearly than that. I hope there will be no more misunderstanding about this. I do not want the words &#x201C;by inheritance&#x201D;, which I happened to use, to be used to create any impression that areas which in the past belonged to their forefathers but which in the meantime unequivocally became White will now be handed over on the basis of this argument in regard to inheritance, There is no such idea; there is no such plan.</p>

<p>What about consolidation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I said very clearly that through the process of clearing up Black spots and the process of shifting small reserves, one would to a large extent be able to consolidate everything around the larger areas. If that is done, the large number of smaller Bantu areas will also disappear. If there are hon. members who say that we ever stated that one would be able to consolidate large reserves, e.g. the large areas which are Zulu areas in Southern Natal, and the large Zulu areas in Northern Natal, and to make them one area, then they are wrong or they are deliberately trying to cause confusion. I stated on a previous occasion that in the same way that it was not possible, when the state of Pakistan was established, to join together various large Mahommedan-Indian territories and to make one territory of them, neither is it possible here. There government control is exercised to-day still over two areas which are separated from each other by 1,000 miles of foreign territory. Here scattered areas will also have to be governed. We shall have to accept it as a basic problem that some of these Authorities will have control over various large areas, but their administration of them will be easier, because these areas are not as far apart as in the case of the similarly divided state of Pakistan. I also added at the time when I dealt with this matter that without any doubt it would lead to difficulty, that it is a difficult position, but that this difficult position and the difficulties emanating from it would not be comparable with the danger it would constitute for South Africa and for the White people if we were to have a mixed state here in terms of the United Party policy, with a mixed Cabinet and a mixed Public Service and a mixed Army. Therefore I said that we had to choose between two evils, seeing that history had created this situation for us. One cannot have everything just as one would like it. I said that this side of the House also recognized the fact that it would be dealing, e.g. in the Transvaal, to which the hon. member for Germiston-District (Mr. Tucker) referred, with various areas in the West, in the East and in the northern central part of the Transvaal which organizationally but not physically would be linked with each other if that ethnic group develops to a selfgoverning community. I even emphasised that it would certainly cause us trouble and that these large areas certainly could not be eliminated. Consolidation will therefore have to take the form of linking up all the small and large areas possible, but to have one area will be impracticable in various cases. In that process it may be that the future will show that it will be possible to link up some of these areas with Swaziland, Bechuanaland and Basutoland, because there are certain Bantu areas which ethnically really fit in with them. Had we had control over the High Commission Territories and had we been able therefore to guide the struggle for freedom of those Territories, then in that case, I said, we would not have allowed a mixed Basutoland and a Swaziland under mixed control to come into existence. We would have seen to it that there was a Basutoland under Black control without the bluff of giving the 2,000 Whites (as second class citizens because of limitations) some sort of share in the control. We would not have bluffed them in that way but would have allowed them to vote in the Republic. It would have been possible for Basutoland to develop into a Black state and in the case of Swaziland we would have linked together the areas which were ethnically Swazi in exchange and in compensation for White areas, areas which in turn could be joined on to the Republic. However, those areas are not available to us for better planning. I do not know what the future of those areas will be but we envisage the possibility that the time may arrive when the relationship between the Republic and, say Basutoland, for the sake of argument, and Swaziland and Bechuanaland will be so good that when the idea of a commonwealth takes further<span class="col_3929-3930" refersTo="page_0591"/> shape in South Africa, a good-neighbourly relationship can be established along those lines. In that event not only the Transkei but Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland as well, would be able to share in that. That would be highly desirable but the time for that has not arrived yet. I do not, therefore, want to speculate on it any further. I hope it is perfectly clear now that these hair-raising stories that we are supposed to want to deprive White people of their land illegally and wrongfully, for whatever reasons, and that we are promising to hand over large areas, are without any foundation whatsover. If the hon. member for Hill-brow wishes to ask me a question he may do so now.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. the Prime Minister. The matter which I dealt with yesterday was not so much the borders. There are legacies of the Whites within the hereditary Zulu area. The legacies of the White people lie next to Ema Kosini, the burial ground of Zenzengakona and Zulu. I asked the Prime Minister what he was doing to ensure that those were maintained as the property and treasure of the White people.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Firstly, the question of Ema Kosini was already discussed at the time when I was Minister of Native Affairs and I gave the unequivocal reply at the time that Ema Kosini was regarded by the Zulu as the place where the Zulu nation was born. As I said at the time, it is a comparatively small area there&#x2014;and that was also the attitude of my predecessors in the United Party&#x2014;and one which in all fairness should vest in the Zulu nation. Since then attempts have been made to buy it. I do not know what progress has been made. The Minister of Bantu Administration should be asked what has happened in the meantime. The principle underlying the attitude which was adopted at that time, however, was that small area which contained the graves of the forefathers of the Zulu nation should be incorporated in the Zulu area because it is of great religious significance to them.</p>

<p>The acquisition would have taken place by way of exchange.

<p>Moordkoppie, where you have the White mission station, lies just alongside, true enough, but if that portion were completely encircled by a Native area, it would form a White spot. The Department has been trying for a long time to remove other White spots in Zululand. White people have been living there for a long time, but they themselves are becoming anxious to leave. This process has so often been discussed in this House that it is surely not necessary to argue about it as though it is the outcome of the policy of establishing Bantu homelands. These removals are not the outcome of the policy of establishing Bantu homelands; they flow from the old policy of letting the Bantu live in a Bantu area without any White spots and letting the White people live in a White area without Black spots. That is part of the old process which has been in operation for a long time.</p>

<p>I understood from the hon. the Prime Minister that Port St. John&#x2019;s was in a totally different position from the other towns in the Transkei, because it is not completely surrounded by a Native area. The other towns and villages are to become Black gradually.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will deal with that point because it appears on my list of Opposition questions. Let me first also give the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) an opportunity of putting his question. I do not wish to play the role of school teacher but it seems I have no alternative.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is it the intention at the present time to do away with all the coastal native reserves north of the Tugela, i.e. all those Native reserves banking onto the ocean&#x2014; all those north of the Tugela&#x2014;and if that is the intention, is it not correct that in order to provide compensatory land, some considerable extent of White-owned land will have to be taken over in order to compensate for those.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not my intention to indicate now which reserves will be moved and which will not. I am at present no longer concerned with the administration of Native affairs but what I am able to tell the hon. member is this: In Natal a considerable number of obligations still remained under their own 1936 Act. By reason of the fact that Natal has already been so tremendously fragmented&#x2014;and I have a great deal of sympathy with the concern of the hon. member for South Coast regarding the interests of the Whites in Natal in the light of historical<span class="col_3931-3932" refersTo="page_0592"/> events there and the enormous inheritance (which they bequeathed to us and which was bequeathed to them) of the problem of Black and White in many places living alongside each other; Natal is in a terribly difficult position and I have, and have always had, a lot of sympathy with that province as far as this is concerned&#x2014;we are endeavouring to better that position. In terms of the United Party Act there is still such a tremendous amount of land to be given to the Bantu (in terms of their 1936 Act), that we are trying to make use of the large amount of state land which is still available there. When state land is used either for compensation for the clearing up of Black spots or for clearing up certain smaller reserves, for whatever purpose that might be necessary, as e.g. in complying with the necessity for still giving the non-released land which has to be given under the 1936 Act, it reduces the area of land belonging to White farmers which otherwise would have had to be purchased for that purpose. Nevertheless, when to-day land is bought from White farmers it is used, particularly in recent times, as compensation in the implementation of methods in terms of which Natal&#x2019;s terrible intermingling of White and non-White areas can be relieved. It is surely desirable that the White areas should be consolidated more than they have hitherto been. I would have thought that in this regard we would have had the full support of Natal. That is in fact what we get from many parts of Natal&#x2014;joy because our object is to consolidate the White area more than has hitherto been the case. State land is therefore being used to facilitate the implementation of an obligation which the United Party assumed, in terms of what otherwise would have had to be purchased from White farmers.</p>

<p>Now I come back to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories. I have said over and over, and I am sorry that I so often have to repeat my statements because of the renewed attacks made, that Port St. John&#x2019;s is not surrounded by Bantu area. I mentioned the case of Cala&#x2014;and I could mention many other places which, on the contrary, are completely surrounded and therefore are White spots. We know that Umtata is also completely surrounded, but we have always made the point that they differ from Umtata, which is a large urban area as well as a surrounded area. It will surely in the course of history become part of the Black Transkei, but in that case the transition process must necessarily, because of its magnitude and its significance also to the internal economy of the Black state which will be established there, be much slower. It will be a natural process but a very slow one. People there need not be concerned, particularly in the light of the good spirit revealed by the Bantu leaders there, in which I believe. These smaller places, as I have already said, will obviously be incorporated in the Bantu-controlled area, even though we do not make them Bantu homelands territory. It is mainly the pressure of the increasing Bantu capacity to render services to their own people which in itself will clear up those areas as White spots. How did those places come to be established? A White trader came there because there were Bantu customers but no Bantu traders. A missionary went to live there because there were people he could convert. The need arose for a post and therefore officials went there. Then the need arose for a school for the children of these White inhabitants of the towns, and consequently teachers were attracted to those towns. That created the need for a church for those White people. In the same way the need arose for White clerks to serve in the expanding post office and, if a railway station was built, to work in that station. Gradually the need arose for White clerks to work in the shops, because in the beginning there was nobody else to assist. That is how those towns were established. Now this process, however, is reversed without anything being done on our part. Educated Bantu clerks become available and even the White traders prefer to use Bantu clerks, either because they work for lower salaries or because it attracts customers. The State is busy with the process of employing Bantu to serve their own people, e.g. in the post offices, etc. In other words, the same process which attracted the Whites is now busy removing them, because the need for them is disappearing now that the Bantu can take over their own services. That must necessarily, whether we do something about it or not, lead to a shrinking in the number of Whites who go to look for work in those smaller towns. The question is only: How will the authority allow that process to take place? Requests have come from time to time during the past ten years from the Whites in those towns to sell their houses to the Bantu in spite of the law. Those requests had to be refused because there was the danger that the value of the properties of all the Whites in the vicinity would drop if the Bantu built houses on certain plots in between them. That is what happens all over the world. That also happens in America and England when Black people buy houses next to those of Whites. Therefore the Government adopted this standpoint: here we see the new process increasing of the advent of the Bantu official, the Bantu clerk and the Bantu teacher. Why, at any town like Cala, surrounded by a Bantu area, should a separate location now be developed whilst that White area is becoming empty and the houses there are becoming valueless? Let the process of absorption rattier take place by the planned taking over of such towns themselves, then no quarrels will arise. The Bantu can occupy those towns bit by bit. The result is that what we did then&#x2014;and this is also stale news; I already referred to it before I became Prime Minister and mentioned Cala specifically&#x2014;was to zone a section of the white spot town in which the Bantu could buy property. In this way that natural process can evolve conveniently for the Bantu and the White people who have property there and want to or have to go away to have the opportunity to sell those properties. In fact, they have sold their properties continuously in <span class="col_3933-3934" refersTo="page_0593"/>that way, and it was not in conflict with the Group Areas Act. In terms of the powers which the Minister of Bantu Administration can exercise in the Transkei, we were able to, and did in fact, implement this policy all the time (also since the passing of the Group Areas Act), to zone in that way with the object of allowing zone after zone to be sold to the Bantu. What more must I say about this matter than I have already said?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) has also said in the course of his complaints that I do not know who will rule the Transkei It may not be the well-disposed persons with whom we are now negotiating. Of course it is true that where a selfgoverning area is established which can elect its own Parliament and its own Cabinet, I cannot determine who will be the rulers from time to time, but these people themselves will determine it. That is true. But it is equally true that if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition establishes self-governing areas in terms of his plan, the same process will take place. He will not know either who will be in authority in those areas in the course of time.I know, however, that in terms of our policy the Bantu leaders, whoever they might be, whether they are acceptable to us or not, will only rule themselves! In terms of the policy of the United Party, those who are unacceptable will, however, also sit in this Parliament! Those who may be &#x201C;unacceptable&#x201D; will surely see to it, in terms of the race federation plan of the United Party, that they will be represented in the Federal Parliament. If future Bantu leaders are then going to become such dangerous and unacceptable people, they will not be a hindrance to my kind of state except on its borders and beyond its borders as neighbours, but they will be a hindrance to the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s kind of state as members of the body governing the whole country. Therefore I want to warn the Leader of the Opposition and his followers that this kind of argument can be turned against them with serious results.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member again said that he was surprised that I was not prepared to accept the report of the Recess Committee at this stage already, seeing that I myself had given advice in regard to that report. Is it really necessary again to explain something which should really be clear to every normal person, namely that if a particular body has to make representations to another body, that other body, or its representatives or its leaders, cannot give a decision before the report is received and before it is known whether a preliminary report, in regard to which the other body or its leaders have been consulted, has actually been adopted by the particular body which is the responsible body? Surely that is obvious. Does the hon. member really consider that it would be fair of me to face the Transkeian Territorial Authority with a <i>fait accompli</i> and with the possible implication of a threat that I will accept this present draft and not an amended one? Surely I cannot do that.</p>

<p>The hon. member says he is surprised at it, in view of the fact that in the past I adopted the attitude which I did adopt in regard to the establishment of the Territorial Authority system.

My standpoint has always been this: the Bantu will have to develop along the road of self-government, and when people are assisted to develop one should not begin by foisting an unknown or strange form of government on them. One should not foist a Western system on to a Bantu community, which has no real experience of government without adapting it to their needs. If one does so, one harms them and then confusion arises, as has so often happened in Central Africa. My standpoint was rather to adopt a different method, rather to adopt the following process: begin with a form of government which they know and allow them, as and when they understand it and desire to develop further, gradually to become better acquainted with the Western elements by increasingly adding them. That is precisely the process we have followed hitherto and which I held out in prospect at the time as a further step, which we are now taking. In the first<span class="col_3935-3936" refersTo="page_0594"/>place I introduced the system of Territorial Authorities, by means of which we broke away from the existing co-control of the Whites in the Bunga and proceeded to have a body completely controlled by the Bantu, but on the basis of the natural democracy of the Bantu, as I always described it, namely the representatives or leaders who, according to their customs, represent the tribes. Now that this body has had the opportunity to look after their own interests for a few years, according to this indigenous system, the one which was known to them, and their Bantu Chairman and officials have gained experience in handling their own people on a basis and by methods well known to them, they have now reached the stage where they themselves ask that we should grant them the next stage of governmental development. The next stage of development still does not mean a complete change-over to our Parliamentary system as we know it, but it does mean the introduction of the factor of representation in their system. That is what they have asked for so far in their proposed constitution. In my opinion, however, they wanted to take too small a step in this direction by making provision for a small limited number of elected members, and my advice to them was this: Retain your tribal leaders and thus retain the characteristics of your natural democracy, but make provision, on the other hand, now that you are reaching the parliamentary stage of development, for a reasonable direct representation so that it will be appreciated that a further substantial step has been taken on the road of constitutional development. What I am doing is no more than is advocated in Nigeria, the country to which hon. members opposite refer with so much respect. In Nigeria one of the parliamentary leaders, a Minister I believe, specifically stated that it was a mistake on the part of the West to try to superimpose its parliamentary system on to their state, because more regard should be had to the tribal background. Here we are in fact observing all the principles for which even Nkrumah pleaded at one stage before he continued further on the dictatorial path. In other words, when the hon. member says he is surprised that I wanted to see more elected members there, there is no reason for him to be surprised because I am doing precisely what I always said the process would be. I hope that in future the hon. member will stop making accusations of this kind against us. After all, in the past, they often came along with the story that with the territorial authority system we wanted to lead the Bantu back to the jungle, to the primitive state. Hon. members will recall the accusations that we wanted to lead the Bantu back to something of an inferior nature. Our argument was always that we believed in development from the known to the unknown. Now that we are busy with this development, they come along with the opposite accusation that we are leading the Bantu too soon towards the independence of Western civilization. They no longer talk about &#x201C;leading them back to the jungle&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But apart from that and in the second place I gave certain guarantees on behalf of our state. I divided the interested parties into classes. All that the hon. member now wants me to do in addition to that is to make a whole series of promises about compensation in respect of the houses of professional people who will apparently not even have to move. If they did leave for other reasons of their own, then in any event I ought not to make any promises. He wants me to make clearer promises but at the same time he says that all my promises are worthless. I think it was the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) who said that I would retain no authority in respect of the Whites in an independent Transkei.</p>

<p>But surely that is wrong. Every country has influence and a say over its own citizens in another state. If there are Whites there and they remain citizens of the Republic, they will be under the care of the Republic. The representative of the Republic there will be the person who will have to look after their interests and protect them against unjust action. The independence of such a state does not deprive the Republic of those rights in respect of its own citizens. In other words, we will be able to help our citizens living in neighbouring territories. Apart from that we are entitled to grant any assistance we like in our own territory to such citizens if they have to leave that territory. If that territory gives undertakings and makes promises which are not fulfilled, we can intervene on behalf of our citizens to have those promises carried out. There is no substance in the argument that we are not able to look after our citizens.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. If there is a Transkeian Authority and there is a Transkeian Bantu here who enjoys and exercises his citizenship rights there, and who is here because he is a work-seeker and has undertaken to obey the laws of our country, then as soon as he refuses to subject himself to the laws of our country, they can accommodate him in their country. Or if there is any question of an injustice, they can make representations, in the same way that England can make representations to South Africa in respect of her citizens, even when it is a person like Ganyile. Naturally. But even if it brings difficulties with it, it is much better to have this situation than that we should have dissatisfied Bantu as our partners and that they should have the reins of government in what was our own country and that they should be able to say, because of their majority, &#x201C;Do so and so&#x201D;. It is a question of choosing what is the best course. Let me say to the United Party that this whole campaign of sowing suspicion in which they are engaged at the present time, is one which they also tried during the previous election. The voters do not fall for that type of accusation. The voters do not allow themselves to be frightened in this way, because they know that a difficult choice has to be made between two difficult courses &#x2014; between the course of separation, which is difficult, and the course of integration which is infinitely more difficult and deadly. They have to choose between those two courses. They were aware during the election of all the problems that would flow from this. It was stated very clearly by us what we proposed to do, and the United Party then also tried, even by misrepresenting our intentions, to frighten people as much as possible, but they did not succeed in coaxing away our supporters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) apparently wants to defend Britain&#x2019;s attitude towards the Whites in Kenya, because she says the people who went to Kenya went to a foreign territory. In other words, when they are treated in the way that they are now being treated, that is to say, when they are left in the lurch, then according to the hon. member it is no more than they deserve, because they &#x201C;went to a foreign country&#x201D;! She therefore defends the United Kingdom against the claims of those Whites who developed this territory. But what is the truth? Britain invited these people to go there to assist her in her task of bringing civilization to this territory. She was so anxious to have them there that promises were made to them and the prospect of stability and protection was held out to them. Britain did not bring them under the impression that she was going to lose control over this country, nor did she think that this would happen. Subsequently, when the first moves were made in this direction some years ago, Britain made promises of compensation in order to keep the Whites there because of their economic value to the territory and to the guardian herself who believed that she would retain control. To-day, however, the people of Kenya say that Britain has not carried out those promises.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In conclusion I want to make just a few further observations. The hon. member for Drakensberg has raised the objection that the farmers throughout the country are in a state of uncertainty. She has quoted certain reports to show that they have asked that we should buy the land in which they have an interest as soon as possible. That is not something, of course, which specifically flows from our policy of Bantu homelands. It is an old complaint on the part of farmers who fall in released areas under the United Party Act of 1936; they are anxious that the land owned by them and that was ear-marked at the time under the Act of 1936 to become Bantu areas should be purchased by us as soon as possible. I can well understand that those of them who do not want to hang on to this land are anxious that the undertaking of 1936 should be implemented as soon as possible. But both our Government and previous Governments have been able to do no more than to carry on with a programme of purchases extending over a reasonably long period. The sum of R2 million for the purchase of land this year, to which a certain amount of objection has been raised by United Party members, has been provided for in the Estimates for the very purpose of meeting the demands of the farmers. In the prevailing circumstances, of course, it is impossible to satisfy all the demands within the space of one or two years. There is still an enormous amount of land in released areas to be purchased. I can only say that these purchases are being expedited as much as possible. Any allegation of stagnation in farming that is based on this ground is a charge against the effects of the Act of 1936 since 1936 and not, as she tries to put it, a charge which flows from the Bantu homelands policy. In actual fact most of these farmers have developed their lands and there has been no real stagnation. They have been able and are able to develop their land because they have known that they will be compensated not only for the land but also for improvements on the land. Development has in fact always taken place there. The farmers concerned have known that they are not all going to be bought out immediately and they have carried on with their farming developments. This attack is therefore really a repetition of a charge which has been made over a long period and which is without much substance, although one feels sorry for the farmers who are in released areas and whose land cannot be bought out immediately.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston-District (Mr. Tucker) has pleaded for certain existing industrial areas. I believe he has in mind places<span class="col_3939-3940" refersTo="page_0596"/> like Brakpan. He wants to know whether some assurance cannot be given that there will be opportunities of development for them. My reply is, and this has already been said clearly before, that apart from the border area development, there will of course, be development in the hinterland, but in developing the hinterland, and particularly industrial development, the aim must be to get away from this increase in Bantu labour. What we must try to achieve is mechanization and automation in the industrial sphere and better use of the Bantu labour that is already here, so that there will be no undesirable further influx of labour. That process is continually being encouraged, namely that industrial development in the hinterland must not cease but must be so planned and be of such a nature that it does not cause a constant increase of Bantu labour in these areas. I have no doubt that it is possible in certain industries to maintain quite a different ratio of White labour to non-White labour than we have had in the <i>laissez faire</i> period of the past. There is every indication that will be the case, also with regard to new industries that will come into being.</p>

<p>The allegation has also been made that I have come forward with an entirely new policy, a policy which differs from that followed by Dr. Malan or Adv. Strydom. That is not so. The fact of the matter is that from the inception of the policy of apartheid it was realized what the trend of the development would go. Hon. members will remember that I and others have often spoken about the two opposite roads which we could follow in this country. The one is the road of integration and we have said that must untimately lead to Black domination. We also spoke about the other road, the road which the Government is following, the road of apartheid. Throughout the years everybody has said that road will ultimately lead to the existence of independent states alongside each other, White and non-White.</p>

<p>Very wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, that was always said. But the question which was put to Dr. Malan and subsequently to Adv. Strijdom was this: Is your immediate objective to bring about territorial apartheid and separate states? At the time when I was Minister of Native Affairs the charge was already made, in an attempt to drive in a wedge, that we were giving different replies to that question. However, all of us have always replied and said that it was not practical to follow that policy at the moment. Dr. Malan adopted the attitude that we as the guardians, should grant more and more rights to the Bantu and that the further outcome of that did not constitute a problem which we need worry about at the moment. It was clear to all of us what the United Party had in mind when they made that charge, namely, that when a leader envisages something for the distant future, to project that immediately on to the present and to use that as a charge against the policy which he followed at the moment. That was why my predecessor was very careful in adopting any stand and only referred to what we were doing at the moment. That was to give the Bantu a greater and greater degree of self-government under our guardianship. Since then the position has changed considerably. I as Prime Minister find myself in a different stage of the development. It is a fact that development everywhere has been very condensed. I want to admit frankly, that as far as I am concerned, in spite of the policy which I have always advocated and its ultimate end, I did not envisage that within ten years the position in Africa and in the world and locally would be such that it would be necessary for these steps to be taken to-day already. I often said that I did not know when the separation would be complete, whether it would be in ten years&#x2019; or 20 years&#x2019; or 100 years&#x2019; time, but I said that because I wanted to make it clear that the period would not be determined. There was no undertaking that the process would take 200 years. I realized that it was simply impossible to determine the time it would take and nobody could say whether the process would take a short time, a long time or a very long time. The position which has arisen over the past few years, however, has caused us, for the sake of the security and the prosperity of our country, to let the stages follow one another quicker than we had expected they would. Those factors were the same factors which urged the United Party to advocate more and more that its policy of a multi-racial nation and state should be followed immediately. Which member of the United Party would have said ten years ago that they would have been prepared in 1962 to advocate a federation with all the non-White groups as partners, with everybody represented in Parliament by his own people, within the foreseeable future? Who would have said that? When we accused them at that time of adopting the Hofmeyr attitude they denied that they had supported such liberalism. The application of our policy has certainly been expedited but there has not been a change in principle or in the direction of our policy. I hope, therefore, that it is quite clear that we are not dealing here with a dishonest policy or that there has been a clash in directions, but with a position which has been created by modern developments which have taken place at an unexpectedly fast pace.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a final point. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) made this statement: &#x201C;You say that you have confidence in the assurance which the Bantu leaders have given to the Whites in the Transkei.&#x201D; She asks: &#x201C;In that case why do you not trust them to form a mixed Parliament and Government or to live in a mixed state?&#x201D; Well, that is the whole crux of the difference which is still existing between us. We are convinced that if the Bantu is given the opportunity separately to achieve all his ambitions within his own circle, he can become a good neighbour and that he will then wish to co-operate with us as friends and that he will even need us for economic<span class="col_3941-3942" refersTo="page_0597"/> and other reasons. If the Whites try to take the Bantu with them into one society major clashes will of necessity have to take place in that society, clashes in respect of outlook and clashes in respect of the ambition to achieve supremacy in that common land. The friendship which could have developed between independent neighbours will not develop between partners who are fighting one another to gain that supremacy, as has happened elsewhere in Africa. When it is said that constitutions of such a nature will be drawn up (based on numbers and based on the standard of civilization) that they will constitute guarantees to the Whites and that the Bantu will be kept in the background, you will be creating situations which will cause difficulties. There will be no confidence. The basis of our attitude throughout the years has consistently been that method must lead to conflicts, conflicts which will stand in the way of separate though full opportunities. As I have said before, if you have various members of your step-family living in your home, you will easily clash with them. But if any members of your step-family live next to you, a spirit of mutual helpfulness may develop, because those contacts which cause tension will be absent. The trust and love and co-operation which is so difficult to obtain in one household where the people are foreign to one another, are different when they live next to one another or near to one another. In that event the possibility exists that good relationship will develop.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is also a question which I have often replied to. Before I deal with that I want to finish stating the first point clearly. It does not follow at all that because the White people may have assurances and are confident that there will be co-operation and friendship with the Bantu when they have independent control over their own areas (something which they are glad that the Whites have helped them to obtain), there is justification to expect confidence when the races do not only live together in one area but are also in continual competition with one another in every sphere of life because the White man will always try to maintain himself and the Black man will try to maintain himself there.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked the further question as to what we intended doing with the Bantu who will continue to work here. When the people who are in our midst can exercise their rights in the ethnic areas with which they are connected, in respect of those people who are their own, and if they are able to go there and by virtue of skills which they have acquired here, climb to the highest positions, and when the taxes which they pay are utilized there, in other words if they are here to work and to make a living merely because they wish to be here and should be grateful for the right to be here and to make a living, we can expect them basically to be well-disposed and appreciative. Does the hon. member think that the Italians who go and work in France or Germany, and who perhaps remain there their whole life through, are not grateful for the fact that France or Germany or whichever country it may be, has afforded them that opportunity.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course there is the difference in regard to naturalization, something which we will not allow. But we know that those Italians do not exercise that right often either. That is not a source of trouble, therefore, because their fatherland offers them a way out to fulfil their ambitions and to achieve their desires. The opportunity to live in peace simply does not exist in a common fatherland where there are continual conflicts. I am firmly convinced, therefore, that with the policy which we advocate the country is on the road of friendship and peace whereas with the other policy peace and quiet will never be attained.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It is not my wish to prolong this Vote unnecessarily, but there are a few things the hon. the Prime Minister has said which I do not think one can let pass. Firstly, running right through this debate there has been the tendency from speakers opposite and on the part of the Prime Minister himself, to try to draw parallels between South Africa and what is happening in other parts of Africa as to the inevitability of the submergence of the White race if any political rights at all were to be given to the non-European in the same state as the White. It seems to me that there are two points which are overlooked when those parallels are drawn. The first is the population ratios. I wonder whether those hon. members who have drawn those parallels, realize that the ratio between White and non-White in the Federation is 1 to 26; that the ratio between White and non-White in Kenya is 1 to 94; in the Congo 1 to 124; in Tanganyika 1 to 409 and in Ghana, which the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) is so keen to talk about, it is 1 to 1,000. Here in South Africa it is 1 to 4 and if the Cape Coloured people are reckoned with the Whites, it is 1 to which is a very different proposition indeed. The second point is that in not one of those states to date has an attempt been made to grant representation on the basis of a federation of the races as envisaged by this party. It seems to me, Sir, that this parallel is being drawn, or that attempts are being made to draw it, for the simple purpose of trying to get away from <span class="col_3943-3944" refersTo="page_0598"/>the difficulties with which the hon. the Prime Minister and his party are faced. What has been most interesting to-day has been to see yet again a shifting of the ground in the application of the policy of apartheid. I noticed the hon. the Minister of Lands at times gazing with admiration upon this creation of his imagination in 1948 when he came out with his apartheid policy statement. I wonder whether he ever envisaged what has happened at the present time.</p>

<p>Let us look at some of the changes which have taken place. When the original policy statement came out we heard that there would be ultimate total territorial separation. What has happened to-day, Sir? Now there are going to be more Blacks than Whites in the so-called White areas; now we are going to have Black areas which are not even going to be consolidated. One must congratulate the hon. the Prime Minister on the fact that he is moving faster and faster towards United Party policy. He has appreciated at long last that the difficulties in the way of consolidation are such that he can no longer face up to them. To-day we had it coming for the first time in my memory that these Territorial Authorities who will ultimately get independence, will have control over separate geographical areas, not necessarily contiguous to each other.</p>

The whole idea of consolidation as set out by the Tomlinson Commission, has now been thrown overboard. I wonder what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration thinks about that? He signed the report of the Tomlinson Commission. We were always told how he was going to clear up the Black spots in the White areas; we were always told how by means of exchange he was going to get rid of the little reserves and how the big reserves were going to be consolidated until you had geographical units.</p>

<p>There we have it Sir! What better example could one have of the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister has changed his policy. But let us take it one step further. It was always the policy of the party opposite that for the successful conclusion of their policy it was necessary to have the protectorates. The hon. the Prime Minister indicated that they would be the heartlands and that these reserves would be attached to them. Now what has happened, Sir? Now we are not going to get the protectorates. But it appears that the reserves will be given independence and that they will be free to join up with the protectorates in due course as foreign states outside of South Africa. You know, Sir, the great virtue of having a federal arrangement was that consolidation was unnecessary, entirely unnecessary. The big problem of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s was his difficulty of consolidating. Just by a flick of the hand he has thrown the whole thing overboard and left the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development a couple of weeks behind in the latest development! No wonder that he cannot give us the outline of the boundaries of these reserves. He concedes that he is going outside of the released areas. He concedes that there are going to be exchanges but nobody knows where those exchanges are going to take place and many of them may not take place for many years.</p>

<p>To a very limited extent, and the hon. gentleman knows it. But that will not get the hon. the Prime Minister out of his difficulties. The position he envisages leaves the country in a state of complete uncertainty because he cannot give them any idea at all as to where those boundaries are to be. And now he tries to justify the attitude of his party by indicating that General Smuts was supposed to have stood for this kind of policy. Sir, it has been done so often, but I think I must, before this debate closes, refer to just two statements made by General Smuts. The first is from his Oxford Lecture in 1929 &#x201C;Africa and some World Problems.&#x201D; This was what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think there can be, and this is the opinion of those who have given the matter serious attention, any doubt that in the supreme legislature of a country with a mixed population, all classes and colours should have representation. It is repugnant to our civilized European ideas that the weaker in the community should not be heard, should go without representation either by themselves or through European spokesmen where their interests are concerned. There can be but one sovereign body in a country and that body should represent the weaker no less than the stronger. To that extent there should be agreement.</block>

<p>Let me give just one more quotation from the speech which General Smuts made in the City Hall in Cape Town in 1942&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have tried to get around this fear by adopting a policy of what has been called segregation, by keeping Whites and Africans apart. We are trying to carry out that policy and have indeed placed it on the Statute Book. But I am sure you will agree that the results have been disappointing, for our fervent hope that White and Black people will live happily together in this land of ours has <span class="col_3945-3946" refersTo="page_0599"/>not yet been realized. How could it be otherwise? The whole trend of feeling in this country and on the Continent of Europe is in the opposite direction.

<p>Sir, we have been discussing this Vote for some two or three days but we are still faced with a large number of uncertainties and imponderables. I think those uncertainties to a large extent still remain despite the most courteous efforts on the part of the Prime Minister to try to meet our requests. We have no idea yet, Sir, what the absorption rate of the reserves is going to be. We have no idea whether he still stands by his policy that within 50 years from 1955, when the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s report came out, his objective was fifty-fifty Black-White in the so-called White areas. We still do not know, Sir, whether there are going to be trade unions for Natives in the Bantustans. We do not know whether they are going to be allowed to form trade unions if they are engaged in border industries. We do not know whether Bantu industries in the reserves are going to be able to import White labour or skilled artisans. We do not know whether there is going to be job reservation in the reserves.</p>

Now the hon. gentleman says that these uncertainties are not affecting our economy. Well, Sir, if they are not affecting our economy, then surely currency control is no longer necessary. Then surely, Sir. the experiment can be tried of lifting that currency control. The only reply from the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Prime Minister is &#x201C;the Opposition is so strong that the Opposition will influence people to take their money out of the country&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, I wish the Opposition which is so strong, could just influence this Government a little to take a few more sensible decisions in respect of this policy, to adopt a little more of the United Party policy and then they will have a realistic policy to follow in the future. Where are we, Sir. We have a Government in power which, to use the Afrikaans phrase, &#x2018; is uitgedien&#x2019;. All it has to hold its people together is this policy of separate development. But I am satisfied that the people will prefer a policy of federalism, keeping the units together, to the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the Minister would comment on these estimates we have here. I notice that there is an increase in all administrative charges. There is a general increase in all administrative costs to a considerable extent. Wages and allowances have increased by R37,500 whereas the expenditure on all the settlements has actually decreased. In the case of welfare settlements, there has been a decrease of R6,500. As regards welfare settlements most of this expenditure is recoverable. After all, it is a very fine location for the elderly and infirm people. I am wondering why there is this decrease. Is the Minister reducing the accommodation or the availability of allotments to people of infirm health.</p>

<p>In regard to the items under Irrigation Settlements, I hope the Minister will be able to inform us that the settlers at Buchuberg all have increased holdings. That has been my general complaint, that those people have uneconomic holdings and their conditions have been very strained and difficult. The Minister has promised to make provision for some to sell out to other and to offer those, who have sold out, land somewhere else along the Orange River. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what progress he has made in that regard. Then as regards Loskop, one of our outstanding settlements, we should like to know whether malaria is now under control or, preferably, whether it has disappeared altogether. In respect of Riet River, Sir, we should like to know what steps the Minister has taken in regard to the stabilization of the water supply there. We should like to know how many settlers have sold out or have left the Riet River settlement and what future prospects he offers settlers there as regards an adequate water supply.</p>

<p>With regard to the Vaalhartz Settlement, I should like to know whether the Minister now regards the Vaalhartz Settlement as providing for a stable population. We should like to know how many of those who obtained title have sold their holdings. And at what average price. We should like to know what steps the Minister has taken to overcome the drainage difficulties there. It is rumoured that the yield of crops there has dropped. Whether that is true or not I do not know but we would like to <span class="col_3947-3948" refersTo="page_0600"/>have any information which the Minister can give us. Because, with the Minister, we place great importance on these settlements. We do hope that when the Orange River scheme comes into operation there will be an enormous extension of settlements and that we will bring about a drift from the towns back to the land, which is essential if we are to develop a healthy nationhood in this country. So, Sir, we would like the Minister to give us whatever information he can. I have always asked what the average income of the settlers at Vaalhartz was. I do not like to repeat that question but, in view of the rumours I have heard that the people are not doing so well there and that there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction, I should be pleased if the Minister could give us this information and assure us that these rumours have no foundation. However, these rumours have reached me from very reliable sources and I know it is only the Minister who can contradict any wrong information which may have been conveyed to me. We would, of course, like the Minister to give us some details about the drainage. Perhaps the Minister has paid due regard to the amount of water which flows in the &#x201C;Dry Hartz&#x201D;. When I last visited the Vaalhartz Settlement there was as much water flowing from the drainage system in the Dry Hartz River as there was in the canals coming from the Vaal River, which seems to be something very unhealthy. It meant that over-irrigation was taking place and, that the mineral content and the value of that soil was being drained by over-irrigation. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what steps have been taken in regard to the control of irrigation on those plots. I think this is a most important factor. If we wish to conserve our waters and provide for permanent water supplies on irrigation holdings, we do want to have the assurance that this water is used on a conservation basis and that there is no over-irrigation. Over-irrigation is of no advantage at all, Mr. Chairman, Not only does it wash out the top properties of the soil but it does not guarantee a permanent increased yield. It may do it for the first year or two, but after that the crop decreases. And we would like the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that in general on land settlements, special attention is now being paid to the controlling of our water and that there is no unnecessary wastage and that people realize what the cost is to the State to provide these settlements with an adequate water supply. If that is not done, Sir, I do not see much hope for our future development of our irrigation settlements. Even along the Orange/Fish Rivers, it is no good our measuring what contents proposed dams will contain, the extent of land they will be able to irrigate if, when the irrigation is put on this land. the water is wasted and runs off through the drainage systems. I think that we have had to spend far too much at Vaalhartz on the drainage system. In fact, I think it is a disgrace when one comes to think of what has been spent there and the wastage of water which is taking place. I think if the Minister could reply to those questions, we would appreciate it very much. We are deeply interested in the Minister&#x2019;s portfolio. We appreciate the interest he takes in the various departments, but it is only through him that we can obtain reliable information and receive the encouragement in this development of land settlement which is so essential to this country.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>In the first instance I would like to bring a few matters to the notice of the hon. the Minister in connection with Section 20 and also direct a request to him. In the Annual Report of the Department of Lands for the year ending 31st March, 1960, I find that from 1912 to 1960 the Department had already purchased 4,902,000 morgen of land for farmers under Section 20 and that the total purchase price for that land amounted to &#x00A3;19,976,000. Where this section has assumed such vast proportions and where it was such a popular section up to 1960, I find in the same Annual Report that the Secretary for Lands expresses concern because these purchases show a tremendous drop. He gives the figures and he points out that in the previous financial year there were 604 applications and in the current financial year only 385. In other words, this number was virtually cut by half. He gives certain reasons for this. Unfortunately, this year&#x2019;s report has not yet been Tabled and I would like in passing to refer to this fact. I understand that consideration is being given to whether a report of this nature will ever be Tabled again; that the Department of Lands is considering no longer issuing an Annual Report. If this is so. I want to make an earnest plea that this should not be so and that we should have an Annual Report because it contains very important information and data which I think ought to be made available to this House.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Department of Lands gives his reasons and he mentions the increased Land Bank loans, the consolidation of debt under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act. and then he comes to the third reason and he says: &#x201C;The policy which is at present being followed by the Department to ensure that only economic units are purchased.&#x201D; I wish to dwell on this aspect for a while. Where steps are being taken to ensure that only economic units are purchased, I want to ask that there should be better co-ordinated consultation with the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. When I speak of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services in this connection, however, I do not wish to speak only of the officials of the Department. For example, I do not want the Land Board and the Department to consult only the extension officers in a certain magisterial district and tell them: &#x201C;We have now received an application to buy that farm and we want your report on it.&#x201D; Such extension officer may be a technically trained man; he may be very capable: he may come from a university; however, he is not <i>au fait</i> with all the circumstances there. I think. Mr. Chairman, <span class="col_3949-3950" refersTo="page_0601"/>that if we can make use of the already established Soil Conservation Committees on which an official of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, namely, the extension officer, does have a seat, then we will obtain a far better report in two ways. We will obtain a report from people who have been selected by that area and are regarded as people who are acquainted with agriculturally economic units and who are acquainted with the nature and circumstances of farming which can be applied, and who may also be <i>au fait</i> with the applicant so as to know that the applicant is not merely a man who can plough over the land and try to sow mealies but a man who will also farm with Jersey cows or poultry or bees&#x2014;that he is a man who can farm with other things as well. In other words, the economic unit also deals with the applicant and the method of farming which is applied. If we only make use of that extension officer, who may perhaps not know the applicant at all, while the soil conservation committee may possibly know him far better if he is a person from that area&#x2014;I say that if this is done then we are going to obtain a far more detailed answer and a clear and more detailed picture of the position. I would like to add something further to this. Such extension officer may, after he has made his soil tests, has ascertained the nature of the soil, the quantity of water and so forth, base his report up on those findings. However, he often finds that he has not taken account of the natural circumstances, climatic conditions, the fungus diseases and so forth with which these soil conservation committees are acquainted because they have been there for some time and have to deal with these matters every day. They are accordingly in a position to make a better report. Mr. Chairman, this aspect is very important. You will find that on six or seven occasions, namely, 1935, 1937, 1942, 1944, 1948, 1955 and 1960, the amount which is granted under this section has been increased, namely, from 3,600 to 4,500 to 5,510 to 6,300 to 8,300 and to 10,300 and has now been increased to R13,000. We find therefore that the Department of Lands and the hon. the Minister consider it desirable to increase this amount. However. I think that another reason why we have obtained so few applications during this period, why the popularity of this scheme is perhaps waning, if we consider the number of applications, is the price structure of land in South Africa. I fear that the amount of R13,000 is still too small to buy an economic unit which will enable a young farmer to do the right thing. I want to make this very clear because in the preamble to this Report the Secretary for Lands states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where the Department has expert information regarding the productivity of such land, this is at present to a very large extent being done in consultation with the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and it is engaged in ensuring under this section that a settler is not placed on land which does not afford him a reasonable living.</block>

<p>Therefore I believe that the amount must be larger and we must make use of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, Not only must we make use of the officials but also of the soil conservation committees.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister this question. In this same Report mention is made of the fact that demonstration plots have been laid out. It is stated that a demonstration plot and at the same time an experimental plot has been established under the Sak River Settlement. I would like to ask that the Department of Lands should establish a proper experimental plot under a sugar settlement, preferably at Pongola, so that the Department of Lands will be <i>au fait</i> with the sugar production and with what constitutes an economic unit in regard to the quota allocations which are made. I mention this because I gained the impression that the Department of Lands is not properly acquainted with the circumstances of sugar production. It has at the moment to ask Edgecombe for the necessary details and unfortunately it is not always sympathetically disposed in this regard or it does not always accept the information of Edgecombe because Edgecombe may perhaps base its information on a larger production unit. There is this aspect, that you find yourself in the position where a certain amount of land constitutes a unit if you go a little way beyond it before you arrive at the second amount, you have a gap in the meantime which makes it an uneconomic unit while the smaller one, which does not need the tremendous capital investment, is still an economic unit. I want to make a very earnest plea that the neccesary experimental plot should be laid out so that the Department of Lands can determine for itself what the reclamation methods must be in respect of soil which becomes brak or sour. I want to mention an example. There is one man at Pongola who was a very good student at university and qualified himself properly in agriculture. He wants to reclaim his soil but now he finds that the ley period is such that he does not have sufficient land to enable him to reclaim it properly. All these are things in regard to which the Department of Lands will be better able to express an opinion if it makes the tests there itself.</p>

<speech by="#warren">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>It would appear that my suspicions over the past years must have been well founded because we have the state of affairs now as the result of arrangements being made by the Department of Native Administration that they are now staking a claim to State-owned land that has been in the hands of the German settlers for well over a century. That land is now being sought by the Department of Bantu Administration. That land has been in the hands of those settlers for all that time. The position there is peculiar to those areas alone, as the Minister knows full well. You have that chain of country from Amalinda to the base of the Amatola Mountains which has been occupied by those people for all that time. It is unsurveyed land. Nothing is embodied in their <span class="col_3951-3952" refersTo="page_0602"/>titles. Now the Minister wants that land. Having been used by those people for that length of time, and in view of the fact that the Minister since he took over this portfolio has allowed the subdivision of the other pieces of land falling under the various settlements and has allowed it to be allocated to the owners of land within those areas, I want to ask the Minister to protect those settlements. I am talking now of Potsdam, but that is not the only one. I have got information that the Minister is to take over a series of these bits of land. I want those people to be protected. They could claim that land by prescription, but they do not want to do so. The Minister tells us they want to sell. I dispute that. Some do want to sell but as the Minister knows there are always people who will sell when the right price is offered. But when these people are uprooted from these small settlements they own within those grazing areas, they cannot re-establish themselves anywhere else in view of the present price of land unless they are compensated for the grazing they have to-day. Far from letting that land go for nothing to the Minister of Bantu Administration, I want to ask the Minister to set a price for that land equivalent to the selling price of land so that these people can receive some reward for what they have done over the last hundred years. That will enable them to re-establish themselves elsewhere. On that particular settlement alone there are 43 of those owners who will be uprooted. The Minister knows himself the difference in the types of farming in that area in comparison with where land might be offered to them on other settlements. It is so different that it is quite impossible for these men to be transferred, nor can they re-establish themselves unless they get compensation for that land. I think it is essential that the Minister should put his foot down and ask for compensation on behalf of those people for what is at present State-owned land but which they can claim by prescription, because it has been grazed and farmed by them for the last 100 years.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>It always comes up in a slightly different form because there is no uniformity. I think I should explain to the House what this is all about. About 100 years ago, in 1856, after the Crimean War, a number of German settlers were placed there, starting with one of the regiments which fought in the Crimean War. They were placed in the Eastern Province, where they were given land. Subsequently further German settlers came, I think in 1868. They were all given land there and it is rather interesting to note that the amount of land given was in proportion to the rank they held. A private would get so much and a sergeant so much and a captain so much and a major would get far more than half-a-dozen corporals together, and their children all counted as well. The farms given to them were small, but they were given a large amount of communal land. These communal lands were given to them in different ways. In some cases the ownership of the communal land attached to the property given to the settlers and in those cases there has been very little difficulty. In other cases it was kept in trust for them as Crown land. Then villages started, sometimes on these communal lands or adjoining them, and for the last ten or fifteen years, and particularly the last five years, we have been trying to divide up these communal lands and proportion them to each owner in relation to the size of his farm. But then the municipalities came in and said some of it should be given to them for communal grazing for the towns, and it has been a very difficult subject indeed. However, in most cases we have come to an agreement and, except for a few, most of them have been settled. Now Potsdam is one of those where the land is held by the Crown and not in ownership by the farmers. I told the hon. member some time ago that even if the Crown held this land in trust for those settlers, I, in principle, would consider that the land belonged to the settlers and that I was willing to divide that land up amongst the settlers in the same way that we would have divided it up if the land had been held in communal ownership by the settlers. I feel that morally they have the right to it. In fact, they have practically possessed it for the last 100 years. They have used it and I do not think it would be right in any way to deprive them of this land which they have had for 100 years, and which everybody has accepted, because in many cases the people do not know whether they are the owners of the land, or whether it is held in trust for them. I do not know exactly what the position at Potsdam is.</p>

<p><span class="col_3953-3954" refersTo="page_0603"/>*The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) raised a few important points in connection with Section 20. He expressed his concern that insufficient use is made of Section 20, or the one-tenth contribution system. It is quite correct that over the past few years and particularly during the past financial year for which the report appeared there was a considerable drop in the number of applications. He also mentioned the three reasons which were given in the Report of the Secretary for Lands as to why that decrease took place. The one is that people can obtain Land Bank loans so much more easily now than was the case previously. That is probably the most important reason. They prefer to take a Land Bank loan because then they immediately become the owners of the land. Where there is a very strong feeling on the part of our people to obtain right and title to a piece of land in their own name, they are more inclined to approach the Land Bank for a loan simply for those sentimental reasons, in order to become the owners of the land immediately, rather than to purchase it through us and only to take transfer thereof in five years time or even later. It has been our experience throughout the years that as soon as the Land Bank is prepared to advance more money, we experience a decrease in the number of applications. However, if the Land Bank finds it difficult to advance money, the number of applications to us increases. The consolidation of debts has not had so much to do with it, although it is a contributory factor, but the third thing is that we only allocate economic holdings to these people; in other words, that we are more careful to ensure that when we assist a man under Section 20 to obtain a farm, it must be an economic holding on which he can farm according to the standards which we lay down. As the hon. member knows, we started settlements as a form of charity. It was to assist people who had no other place to go and those people were simply given a small piece of land. I would almost say that in many cases it was the poorest type of man who had the greatest claim to land. However, our policy has changed completely over the years and it has adopted a direction whereby we wish in the first place to give a man a farm on which he can make a decent living, and secondly &#x2014; this flows from the first provision &#x2014; that we give land to a person only if we are sure that man will make a success of it himself. Last year I announced the new system we have applied in the selection of applicants for land under Section 20, particularly on the more thickly populated settlements, and in this regard we are far stricter regarding the selection of candidates than was previously the case. We had a meeting the other day of the superintendents of our settlements and everyone testified, with great joy, to the great improvement which has taken place in the class of person whom they are now obtaining since we introduced this new system. We find far fewer &#x201C;duds&#x201D; there. This is also one of the reasons why fewer concessions are made. However, there was another shortcoming in regard to Section 20 and this was that we had far too many failures. These failures were due to various causes. There are natural causes, of course, but I am not talking about the things which nature can do to a farmer. We had too many failures which were due to bad farming methods and the inefficiency of certain persons, to a lack of capital and particularly due to holdings which would not enable even the best farmer to make a living. I immediately tried to make changes. There is the Land Board. These are people with a sound knowledge of practical farming and land values, but who, from the nature of the case, do not have the technical knowledge. For the first time then I laid down the provision that we should call in the assistance of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. However, the hon. member has now come along here with a suggestion that we should also consult the soil conservation committees. I want to give him the assurance that this is a suggestion which I will follow up. I do not wish to commit myself but it is a good idea which I will investigate further.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether we do not perhaps make too little money available and whether we should not advance more than R13,000. The strange thing, however, is that immediately after we raised this amount to R13.000, we experienced this decrease in the number of applications. Therefore, it does not appear as though there is any connection between the two things because if we raise the amount in the normal course of events the number of applicants would not decrease but would increase. However, their number decreased. Therefore, I think that the reason for the fewer applications cannot be the fact that the amount which we make available is too small. It must therefore be due to the other reasons which I mentioned. However, I can give the hon. member the assurance that the amount which we advance enables many people to farm successfully and he will pardon me if I say that since I have been in this House &#x2014; and that has been for a very long time &#x2014; I have not yet attended a debate on the Department of Lands in which no request was forthcoming for the contribution under Section 20 to be increased, and I think that this will always be the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) is always someone who is very interested in land settlement and who fires a lot of questions at you with extreme rapidity. I tried my best to write down as many of them as I could, but the hon. member speaks faster than I can write, but I think I have most of them and I will try to reply to them as well as I can. In the first place he asked why there was an increase in salaries. I have partly answered that, and the rest is due to the normal increase in commitments with regard to salaries, the normal promotions and annual increments.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member raised the question which he raised last year also, the Boegoeberg-Gariep development on the Orange River. As hon. members know, the old Orange River Scheme was given out in allotments which according to our ideas to-day are far too small. <span class="col_3955-3956" refersTo="page_0604"/>The people who are there are probably the most hard-working farmers we have in the whole of South Africa and they also have less complaints than I get from any other settlement, although their income is lower than that on any other settlement, because of the small allotments. So what we try to do is to increase the size of the plots. We do it in various ways. Where an allotment becomes vacant we split it up between the neighbours, but for the last year or two we have started to develop a new scheme on the northern bank of the Orange River, the Gariep Scheme, and then we said to the people on the south bank that we would move them across to the northern bank where they could get farms about twice the size of their old farms. The new farms are about 12 morgen, which is a very fair-sized farm there. The old ones were six to eight morgen. We were very disappointed in the small number of applicants. We had about 120 farms on the northern side. It seems to me that what happened is that the sons of the farmers on the small plots, seeing that the allotment was too small for the father and the son, the sons have got out and found work somewhere else, and the present holders are mostly older people and they say that at their age they can make a living where they are and they do not want to start a new farm. Nevertheless quite a number did apply and they have been moved across and their farms on the southern side of the river have been split up. So we have managed to do quite a lot.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what the position was in regard to malaria at Loskop. Sir, in the Republic of South Africa, if a man gets malaria to-day it is his own fault. I remember in 1934 the Railways up to Zululand came to a stop as the result of malaria. Now on many of the sugar plantations up there, when a man gets malaria they treat him, but warn him that if he gets it again he will get the sack, because if he gets it, it is his own fault. For anyone taking any reasonable precautions there is no danger of getting malaria on any of the settlements. The position at Pongola was the same. There was a settlement started at Barberton which had to be abandoned as the result of malaria. To-day that area is free of malaria and the whole Republic is to-day practically free of malaria.</p>

<p>Bilharzia is another problem. It is not a problem for Pongola only, but for the whole of Africa, right down from the Nile, and it is coming down the coast. It was never in Natal, but it is there also now, and even in some parts of Pondoland. The wandering Native spreads it. In regard to Rietrivier, the hon. member asked how many have sold out there. I do not know how many have sold out, because the only people who can sell out would be those who have already got ownership. From time to time they sell out, but someone else comes in their place. But I do not think any of the lessess have surrendered their plots, although it might happen as the result of illness or insolvency. But the people there have suffered considerably from drought, because the Rietfontein Dam, which is the second biggest dam in the Republic, was empty. To-day there is about 28 per cent of water in it and that is quite a considerable amount and I foresee that this year the position will be better than last year. As the result of the Orange River Scheme, water will be brought from that river to supplement the water of the Rietriver and when that takes place there ought to be no trouble in regard to water there.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked about Vaalhartz and wanted to know how many people have sold there, and at what price. I cannot say how many people have sold. There are hundreds of people there who have full ownership of their land and sell from time to time, but the prices have been from about R12,000 up to an average of R16,000, and some of them up to R20,000. These people who got very reasonable prices had worked hard and had developed the farms. The bad farms do not sell well but these farms which fetched high prices are farms which have been well-developed and scientifically farmed.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the question of the drainage at Vaalhartz. He knows that Vaalhartz lies in an enormous basin, and when all the water was let into it, the water-table started rising and it could not get out, and the land of many farmers who had extremely good arable land, was suffocated by too much water. The Department of Irrigation immediately had to start to get the water out again, and eventually it has cost the Department just about as much to get the water out as it cost the Department to get the water into Vaalhartz. [Laughter.] Yes, that is quite true. We therefore had to take certain measures to persuade those people there to use less water. Well, you get to a certain level where you cannot use less otherwise you lose income, but with judicious use of your water you can use less than many people actually use. A few years ago therefore we introduced a scale of payment for water. Where the man had paid a flat rate for water beforehand, so much a year, entitling him to so many inches of water, which was his quota, we now start with a low payment for the first quarter&#x2019;s allotment of water to him. and it rises very steeply as it gets to the end. At the very top he does not pay anymore actually for his water than he paid before, but he pays considerably less for water actually used, especially at the high level, and the result has been quite remarkable. On some of our settlements we have saved up to 20 and 30 per cent of water.</p>

<p>The hon. member then said that he went to the Hartz River and that he saw a lot of very fine water running away there. We have started a new settlement on the Hartz. I cannot say how many farms there are but there are quite a number of farms there and they are using this water which results from the <span class="col_3957-3958" refersTo="page_0605"/>drainage of Vaalhartz. It is quite good water, it is not brack, and we have quite a nice scheme coming along there where this water is being used for the second time.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me what the average income was at Vaalhartz. The average gross income is about R4,000 per annum. Then he said that he had heard talk that there was a decrease in the total production of farm produce from Vaalhartz. No, on the contrary there has been an increase. Last year I announced here, when my Vote was under discussion, that the total income was R3,500,000, and this year it is just over R4,000,000. I think that with better methods and with the drainage which is taking place there and with the planning which we now have for agricultural methods in the use of their soil, we will be able to push it up considerably.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>There is one aspect in connection with farming on Land Board land which I would like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister and that is in the case where the Department of Lands builds dams for irrigation schemes and where the farms of certain farmers are partially inundated and where the Department of Lands has then to step in to purchase that land from the farmers, as was the case with the Vaal Dam and will probably also be the case with the Sand River and the Vet River. I know that there is dissatisfaction, particularly amongst people in a certain area, part of whose land has been inundated. There is dissatisfaction particularly amongst persons who do not own large tracts of land there. Take for example the case of a man in the district of Frankfort whom I know of. He had about 130 morgen of land on the Wilgerivier and after the Vaal Dam wall was raised&#x2014;this is not far from the town of Villiers&#x2014;a portion of his land was inundated and the Department of Lands had of course to step in to purchase it. Thirty morgen of his 130 morgen is arable land, the best part of his land, and it is those 30 morgen which have been inundated. You yourself will realize, Mr. Chairman, that if a man only owns 130 morgen, of which 30 morgen is arable land and the other land is somewhat hilly, and the Department comes along and only purchases those 30 morgen, then the remaining 100 morgen means absolutely nothing to that man in that area because you cannot farm with cattle on 100 morgen of land. I would like to bring this to the attention of the hon. the Minister and ask that where such cases materialize where land is inundated and where the Department of Lands has to step in to purchase it, special consideration will be given in such cases; that the Department should also purchase the remainder of the land of that farmer on a small scale at an economic price so that he can buy land somewhere else because he simply cannot make a living on the remaining 100 morgen of land.</p>

<p>There is also a question which is an actual problem in agriculture to-day and that is this question of agricultural surpluses. Now that mention has been made of the tackling of the great Orange River scheme, which I want immediately to say has my blessing, I think that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that the possibility of even greater surpluses of certain agricultural products in the future must not be lost sight of and in this connection I wish to put the following points to the hon. the Minister: I imagine that the Department of Lands will be the instrument to purchase that land under the Orange River scheme and also assist in allocating that land once again to farmers to enable them to farm under the closer settlement conditions. Where the hon. the Minister of Lands and the Department of Lands, as a result of the large thickly populated settlements, as a result of this new tendency in South Africa to bring large irrigation schemes into being along all our large rivers, will play just as important a role in the agricultural sphere in South Africa as the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing are playing, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not think, with a view to the danger of surpluses, that the time has come for them to put their heads together in order to see whether a plan cannot be evolved in regard to land which is controlled by the Department of Lands in order to ensure&#x2014;I do not say through the medium of pressure and coercion and I do not say that people must be compelled; this can be done by means of education and persuasion&#x2014;that agricultural products will be produced on that land which is controlled by the Department of Lands, products of which surpluses are not being produced by the other farmers of South Africa. I think that it is very necessary for the hon. the Minister and the Department of Lands to give their attention to this matter. If it is merely left to the farmers themselves to produce surplus agricultural products on a large scale on the very thickly populated settlements of the future as well, then I do not know whether the Government and the Departments of Agriculture will ever be able to solve this problem of agricultural surpluses because to a large extent already it has become one of the most actual problems in the country. As far as agricultural matters are concerned this can become one of the greatest problems for the Government in South Africa in the future, namely to find a market for these surpluses, and I think that the time has come when all the State Department will have to frame plans in order to overcome this problem. This is only one of the solutions which I suggest to the hon. the Minister of Lands as far as his Department is concerned.</p>

<p>Then there is another case which concerns my own constituency and which I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. In my constituency there is a school, the Roosevelt Park School. We are building a new large school there and the municipality has asked for more land for the school. The <span class="col_3959-3960" refersTo="page_0606"/>application was granted but we have been informed that the registration of the land which has been purchased is subject to the consent of the Department of Lands. I do not have all the details here; that was all I was told. The school board and the school commission of that school want to have the school built as soon as possible; they have the necessary permission and I would just like to request the hon. the Minister to ask his Department to expedite the matter as much as possible when it reaches the Department. I would appreciate that very much.</p>

<p>I would also like to say a few words about the Riet River scheme which was mentioned by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). I am pleased that the hon. the Minister appreciates the seriousness of the position of the Riet River scheme in the Free State. The settlers there have over the past few years experienced a very difficult time and they still do not have sufficient water. There are people there who can no longer make a living. The hon. the Minister said here that once the Orange River scheme is completed, their difficulties will be solved. However, I can assure the hon. the Minister that unless plans are framed in the meanwhile to keep those people on that land, they will all become bankrupt and will have to leave. I just wanted to bring these few matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>In the past various commissions of inquiry investigated the position of the local farmers at Vaalhartz and certain changes were also made. On my own behalf and on behalf of those farmers who received assistance I wish to express gratitude to the Minister for having sent those commissions there and for the changes which were effected. However, in the course of their investigations the commissions also made certain discoveries, namely that the soil at Vaalhartz had either deteriorated in the course of time or that those people who formerly submitted reports on conditions at Vaalhartz had erred, because, after the most recent investigation by the commissions, certain concessions were made to many farmers at Vaalhartz because their holdings appeared to be uneconomic. Consequently they were granted additional land or even grazing land to enable them to make an economic living. Those people are extremely grateful to the Minister. But what is the mistake which has been made over a period of years? I can mention cases of people who requested the Minister to give them other holdings because in their opinion the holdings they were occupying were uneconomic. Yet, the departmental officials who conducted investigations there, and the commissions who went there, declared that those farmers were on economic holdings. Now, after ten years, the most recent commission who went there recommended that those people who had asked for assistance over a period of ten years, should be given assistance. That proves one of two things. It proves that either the previous commissions or the departmental reports were wrong or it proves that those holdings have deteriorated over a period of years and that they had become uneconomic. If the position were that they had deteriorated over a period of years and had become uneconomic, it means that there is only one thing which can be done in future to prevent us from expecting farmers at Vaalhartz &#x2014; and I suppose on other settlements as well &#x2014; to make a living on uneconomic holdings. It means that the Minister will either have to appoint commissions annually to investigate local conditions or appoint a departmental committee annually with instructions to conduct investigations and to ensure that those people are not expected to make a living on uneconomic holdings. One of those two steps will have to be taken. I think the hon. the Minister will readily agree with me that the argument is perfectly logical. It is also true that although many farmers have received assistance, some have not received assistance. It is obvious that those people who have not received assistance are very disappointed because they are convinced that they should have received assistance. I personally am convinced that many did not receive asssistance who should have received assistance. I want to make this further suggestion: The income of farmers should be examined and in cases where farmers ask for additional land, I should, for instance, receive a letter stating that the income of the applicant concerned compares favourably with that of farmers in the neighbourhood. However, we should not only consider his income; we should also consider his costs of production. A farmer&#x2019;s gross income may be R4,000 or R6,000 per year but his costs of production may be so high that he is left with insufficient to make a decent living. His costs of production should be taken into account. There is also another factor. When incomes are considered, the source of those incomes should also be taken into account. Some farmers have a considerable income but that income is not derived from their holdings. A large number of the farmers at Vaalhartz own machinery to-day &#x2014; peanut-picking machines or combines to reap their wheat&#x2014; and when the farmer submits his income he does not show what amount he has earned with his machinery; only the round figures of his income is shown, and it is then taken that income has been earned from his holding That is not the case. The reason why I plead that attention be given to the matter, is that as farmers become more prosperous. more and more of them buy machinery with the result that those who, in the first instance bought machinery for harvesting or picking peanuts, find that their incomes are progressively decreasing as they buy their own machinery, because, in the long run they have to live on what they make out of the soil. We all know that there are small holdings at Vaalhartz. There are holdings of 19 morgen. I think those are the smallest holdings there. If that man does not have another source of income it will become impossible for him to make a decent living. For that reason I wish to plead <span class="col_3961-3962" refersTo="page_0607"/>earnestly with the Minister to see to it that the income returns which are submitted by the farmers at Vaalhartz indicate the source of that income &#x2014; whether it was earned from the soil alone or whether it was additional income derived from machinery, etc. I think it is essential that the Minister should give serious attention to that matter and I should very much like to have a reply from him on the point I have tried to make, namely, that if the soil of those people who have now acquired additional land is gradually deteriorating, which must be the case unless the previous reports have been wrong &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, but I want to tell the hon. the Minister that in most cases, if not all cases, those farmers who retrogressed really acted upon the advice of officials from the regional offices.

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to certain State land in Zululand for a moment, and that is the land lying below the proposed Pongola Dam, and in this regard I should like to refresh his memory for a moment by referring him to what he said at Riverview in a speech on 19 October 1960, in regard to that matter. The hon. the Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I had the Department of Irrigation under me I appointed a committee from the Development of Natural Resources Board to investigate the whole question of the proposed Pongolapoort irrigation scheme, and as a result of their report, which was only produced subsequent to my ceasing to be Minister of Irrigation, this scheme was started. You can imagine being the father at the conception although not the father at the birth of this scheme, this is rather a biological difference. I still take considerable interest in it and its impact on Zululand.</block>

<p>It is gratifying to know&#x2014;and I am quite sure the development would not have taken place without it&#x2014;that a careful investigation was made into the whole question of this irrigation scheme before it was put into effect at all. Indeed one can hardly expect any responsible Minister embarking on an expenditure of R36,000,000 of public moneys without a careful investigation of the use and every detail of the scheme before it is put into effect. Now, Sir, the scheme has been put into effect and I think the House is entitled to have some details from the hon. the Minister as to what is anticipated in that regard. Is the State land&#x2014;50,000-odd morgen&#x2014;to be used for the purpose of the settlement of White farmers or Black farmers as the result of this scheme being put into effect? What crops is it expected will be grown on that land? How big will the plots be? This is the sort of thing which must have been investigated before the scheme was put into effect. Indeed the hon. the Minister went on to say in the same speech to which I have referred&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will mean in all probability that about2,000 flourishing farms will be able to be established in that area. I think you will realize what this will mean to Zululand.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister could not have said that there would be 2,000 flourishing farms unless it was known, at that time at least, nearly two years ago, what size the plots would be and whom it was intended to settle on the land. I ask in all earnestness that this Committee be given some information in this regard at this stage: Who the people are it is intended to settle there, what types of farms &#x2026;</p>

<p>Coming away for a moment from the aspect of the Pongola scheme, I should like to deal with the interdepartmental committee which the Minister has appointed to investigate the future of State land in Natal. That committee was appointed at some time prior to 10 November of last year and I should like the Minister to give this Committee some indication of what progress that committee has made, what investigations it has made, what sort of people it has interviewed, whether it is anywhere near completing its job and when it is expected that committee will report. Furthermore, I should like the Minister to give us an indication as to whether the report of that committee will be made available to this House or to the Press or to any other persons. The committee has been given terms of reference, some of which I referred to at an earlier stage when the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote was under discussion; one of them is that it should investigate the possibility of making available compensatory land in exchange for certain Bantu reserves. I do not ask the hon. the Minister to tell me now <span class="col_3963-3964" refersTo="page_0608"/>what that committee is going to recommend because obviously he cannot do it, but I think I am entitled to put this to the hon. the Minister: What motivated the drawing up of these terms of reference? What was the object of giving this committee terms of reference which necessitated the making available of compensatory land for reserves numbered 1, 2, 13, 15 and 16 in Zululand? Those are the reserves along the coastal strip abutting onto the sea. Is it envisaged that those reserves are to be abolished?</p>

<p>Then a second term of reference of this committee is the possible changing of the boundaries of some six other reserves. What is the intention behind that?

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Swart) referred to surpluses and he asked the hon. the Minister to devote attention to the type of products which can be produced when holdings are allocated. I appreciate the fact that the hon. member always puts his case in such a calm and quiet manner. Just so that we do not misunderstand one another, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that this is not such an easy task and that many difficulties can be caused thereby. In the first place, I want to ask whether we do not often exaggerate these surpluses. Although I do not wish to deny that at this stage there are very large surpluses which create serious problems, I am not so sure that this is something which will remain such a serious problem in the long run. As far as I am concerned I think that in the development process of South Africa, notwithstanding the tremendous development in the country, the farmers have developed even more swiftly and that this process will probably reach a stage where it can be capitalized upon and where it will be far more easy than it is to-day. Therefore, we must be very careful. I think of what the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G.Bekker) said just now in respect of the small farms at Vaalhartz. Those small farms were intended primarily for dairy farming and at this stage those people are experiencing difficulty because there is also such a large surplus production of dairy products and there are urgent representations to the hon. the Minister to permit them to produce other products as well. If you wish to impose restrictions in respect of what may be produced on settlements, you have to be very careful. Otherwise the matter is made even more difficult, particularly for the settlers. I wish to refer to the position under the Riet River scheme. We know how serious the position of those farmers on that settlement is. I on my part wish to express a particular word of thanks to the hon. the Minister and his Department for the assistance which has been given there recently. The Western Co-operative particularly is now closely concerned in these matters, and has a great deal to do with these matters, and the hon. the Minister has gone out of his way to render assistance in difficult circumstances which nobody could foresee. The matter has not yet been resolved but in the meantime I wish to express my thanks for the efforts which are being made to solve that problem.</p>

<p>There is a new development in progress in respect of settlements. We know now that the State lands have been exhausted and that in reality, apart from the close settlements, all the land which becomes available to a certain type of farmer, a farmer who cannot obtain land from his father or as an inheritance. is made available under Section 30. This has been one of the good sections over the years and a large number of middle-class farmers have been assisted to obtain land under its provisions. Tremendous sums of money have been spent on this scheme. We realize that the development which is now in progress is creating considerable difficulty for the hon. the Minister and the Department. Much land is being purchased which is probably uneconomic, and in many cases the hon. the Minister has had to take certain steps to save a farmer from being doomed to failure. I would like to refer to this matter particularly. We realize that a duty rests upon the Department and the hon. the Minister to ensure that the number of failures of this nature is kept to a minimum. The steps which the hon. the Minister is taking are steps which we welcome in many respects. However, at the same time, if we are not very careful as to how these steps are applied, they can create new problems. The officials of the Department and the officials of the Extension Section which falls under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, are utilized to ascertain whether holdings are economic and whether they can enable a man to make a living or not. We cannot do otherwise than welcome that step but we may find that a technical official who is often a young man who comes from university and takes up his employment has to determine <span class="col_3965-3966" refersTo="page_0609"/>the values, and it is sometimes extremely difficult for him to do so. We want to ask the hon. the Minister to ensure that such a person should not have the only say in ascertaining whether a holding is economic or not. We want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to make a little more use in this regard of the soil conservation committees. Can they not be of assistance to the technical officer? I am thinking particularly of the young officials and I feel that it is sometimes not desirable that they should have the final say. I can mention a practical example of proclaimed diggings, a farm which will be partially deproclaimed in terms of the recommendation of the Mining Commissioner. If this happens, we will have 400 morgen of land, practically in the heart of our arable areas, which will be deproclaimed, and this land will then be allocated for settlement purposes. According to the Mining Commissioner, the Department contends that this 400 morgen of arable land will not be an economic holding. I do not take it amiss of the hon. the Minister and I realize that it is a difficult problem to solve but what I would like to see is that no single official should have the final say as to whether that holding is economic or not. That is the one problem.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think that in the future we must be far more strict in ensuring not only the holding should be appraised but that the persons who are placed on the holdings should particularly be appraised. All who are farmers know from experience how often a farmer makes a failure of a small farm, or even of a large farm and is eventually left with only a small piece of land, having sold one piece after the other; eventually he only has the small piece left and this he sells to a person just starting out to farm. That new farmer builds up that land and makes a great success of his farm. In other words, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to ensure that these two factors carry a great deal of weight and also that the method of the determination of values should be reconsidered and that it should not be left to one person only to decide whether a holding is economic or not. Firstly, therefore, we have the personal element of the farmer. The farmer himself has to be appraised to see whether he will be worthy of the land, whether he has affection for the land and the ability to appreciate the land, to build it up and to make a success of it.

<p>I was particularly pleased to learn from the hon. the Minister of Lands this afternoon that the lot of the farmers on the southern bank of the Orange River has now been improved and that those holdings have now been enlarged. I think that I have spoken in this regard on various occasions in this House but where the hon. the Minister has been sympathetically disposed in this connection in the past he has not been able to give us the good news which he gave us this afternoon. He stated quite correctly that those people are amongst the most hard-working in the country. It was particularly interesting for me to hear from the hon. the Minister that they are the people who complain least, because if there are people who have reason to complain, it is those people. It says a great deal for their tenacity and also for their courage that they approach the hon. the Minister so seldom.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) and the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) raised the question of what an economic holding is and how one should determine an economic holding. This is also something which gives many settlers much cause for alarm because if they contend in certain cases that their hildings are not economic, the Department so often contends the opposite. That is the form, the method in which it is determined and in regard to which I would like to say something in passing. I think that the hon. the Minister should ask his Department not to supply him with gross income figures in the future but net income figures because the income fluctuates to such an extent &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, and I hope that the hon. the Minister of Lands also does so. The hon. the Minister will not put me off in that way. With present day expenses it means hardly anything to come along and tell someone who has any knowledge of farming that the income of a settler is R2,000 or R4,000 per annum. How is the hon. the Minister going to know how those people can make a living when he only knows what their gross income is? Whether it is difficult or not so difficult to ascertain this, I still feel that the net income must be considered and unless this House knows the net income and unless we can be told that a certain amount is the average net income of a farmer on a specific settlement, we will not be able to take a decision on the matter.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I wish to discuss and it deals with Land Boards and the functions of members of the Land Board as such where they are appointed as valuators for the valuation of land. We find that the Land Board values land where expropriation has to take place in connection with the establishment of large irrigation schemes. They are the persons who determine the value of that land and the farmer is paid out on their valuation of the land which will be inundated. I want to know from the hon. the Minister what co-ordination exists in this regard. We <span class="col_3967-3968" refersTo="page_0610"/>have four land boards in South Africa, apart from South West Africa.</p>

My experience is that a large number of divergent valuations are made. I find, for example, that in the Cape Province, in Umtata, valuations have been made of farms which have been sold to the Native Trust and these valuations have been reasonable and good ones. Then I find that in other provinces, and the hon. the Minister knows this better than I do because in some provinces he has to make <i>ex-gratia</i> payments, the farmers have many complaints regarding the valuations which are made there. I think at the moment of the one which is closest to me. It is the dam in Northern Natal which has now been completed, the Ingagane Dam. I find that in all the cases which have been brought to my attention where farmers have complaints regarding these valuations such valuations appear to be low, because they tell me that there is no fixed scale of calculation in respect of unimproved land. There is no scale for the valuation of prairie land. Now you find a farmer who has a large piece of land&#x2014;the holdings in that area are fairly large&#x2014;he has a large piece of land and the dam is built and the water rises. It rises over the low-lying parts of the farm of that farmer and he is left with hilly land on both sides. He is paid out for grazing rights in respect of that portion which is situated on the low-lying ground because it is regarded as unimproved land. He used it for grazing purposes. However, in that portion lies his most valuable land, the low-lying portions of his farm. They have the real carrying-capacity. It is those parts which are best in time of drought. However, that land is now valued as ordinary grazing land and that farmer is paid out on the basis of ordinary grazing land. The best part of his farm is lost to him and he is left with ridges on both sides which have not been inundated. In the case of one well-known farmer, a leading Nationalist, he was cut off from his water supply on that farm. Where a dam is built the dam is fenced off and the catchment area is also fenced off. This must be done to keep the water clean and pure. That farmer of whom I am now speaking finds himself with two sections of his farm to-day, one on each side, whereas the low-lying area, the central section, has been expropriated for that dam. He was paid out, or rather, he will receive compensation on that basis. He has not yet received compensation because he is a wealthy man and he is going to take his case to the Water Court. However, that is my difficulty, namely, that where Land Boards make valuations they do not consider all the factors and circumstances. A farmer who has his best land inundated in this way ought to be compensated accordingly and that land ought not to be regarded as just ordinary grazing land.</p>

<p>This brings me to my second point and that is that under the present water legislation the right to arbitration has been suspended. If a farmer experiences difficulty now, he has to go to the Water Court. I spoke just now of a farmer whose best land had been inundated and who is going to take the case to the Water Court. The case has still to come up. However, in that same area we have the neighbour of that farmer whom I have just mentioned. This neighbour of his is a widow with 230 morgen, a small piece of land for that part of the world, and she too was given a valuation which to my mind was far too low. However, the poor woman does not have the money to go to the Water Court, nor does she have the knowledge. She is lost. There is nobody to tell her what she can do. She has been given a valuation for her land and there is nothing that she can do in that regard. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I would like to return to the report of the Secretary, paragraph 4, the grants in terms of section 20 of the Land Settlement Act. He says here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the past financial year there was a considerable decrease in the number of applications received for the purchase of land in terms of this section of the Act. In the previous financial year, 604 applications were received while there were only 385 in the past financial year.</block>

<p>Then he gives three main reasons for this. The hon. the Minister has mentioned some of them already but for the purpose of my speech I would like to mention them as they appear in the Report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) Increased loans by the Land Bank; (2) consolidation of debts in terms of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Scheme; (3) the policy which is presently being followed by the Department to ensure that only economic units are purchased.</block>

<p>I would like to add a fourth reason to these and I think that I would give this reason as the most important one. According to my practical experience the main reason why this important section has become practically immobile and why the number of applications has decreased, is that the amount of the advance to-day is inadequate for the purchase of an economic holding.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I want to make this point and then come back to it. <span class="col_3969-3970" refersTo="page_0611"/>The hon. the Minister gave us a reply but I want to put it to him that this section, in the times in which we live, has become the most important section by means of which young, deserving farmers, whose parents are not able to leave them a farm, have managed to scrape together sufficient from their own earnings to enable them to make a large contribution towards the purchase price of a holding and to become land owners, are given the opportunity so to become land owners. In the past large areas of State land were available and as the State made those parts which had no water suitable for farming by drilling for water, prospective farmers were assisted to acquire land. By so doing there was always the opportunity for our younger farmers to obtain land. That State land has now been exhausted to a very large extent. Then another source of supply came to light in the form of large pieces of company land where companies purchased land for mineral purposes in the old days and later sold the land to the State for settlement purposes. That type of land is also no longer available. Therefore, this section which has always been regarded by all Governments as being the best under the Land Settlement Act, has now become the most important section. We now know that land is still allocated under irrigation schemes, but we know that this is almost the same as taking a lottery ticket: Thousands take tickets but only one can win the prize. The result is to-day that there is no hope for the young farmer to be assisted on an irrigation scheme. It is only the few fortunate ones who are successful. I contend that we have to face up to this position. We have to deal with rising land prices and as land becomes scarcer we must consider how we can assist this type of young farmer to obtain land. You know, Mr. Chairman, that the man who can leave a farm to his son to-day is fortunate and the son is fortunate. But I want to make the point that in South Africa it has never been the farmer whom you could rely upon most who inherited that farm. The man who built up that farm out of his own earnings and through his tireless hard work to the stage where he could make something out of it, was the man on whom you could rely. We speak a great deal about economic holdings&#x2014;I will almost say that we juggle with it. Mr. Chairman, give the right man a small piece of land to start with and he will eventually buy out his neighbours. That is our experience and is a reality.</p>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>Give him a chance and he will make the money. I do not want the hon. the Minister to follow the policy of giving land of any size but I am stating a particular fact. I want to make a strong recommendation to the hon. the Minister that we must not move along five years behind the development. Let us go forward with development and let us enable this type of farmer to obtain his own land. It is very difficult today to be a farmer even if you have your own farm but it it almost impossible if you have to cultivate a share, in many cases a halfshare. Will it not pay us to assist a man who fights in this way to make a living to obtain his own land? I know of farmers who in some years have to pay about R4,000 to the owner of the farm in the form of shares. Why should they not rather use that money to pay off their own land? This is a very urgent requirement. I can give you the assurance that members of Parliament on both sides of the House are greatly impressed by the fact that you cannot buy an economic holding with that advance of R13,000 to-day in the dry areas where there is no irrigation. Take for example 350 morgen in the Western Transvaal. You will perhaps say that this is a very small holding, almost uneconomic. However, I know that it is large enough if you have the proper man to run it. However, you will not obtain that land for R80 a morgen. That land would then cost you R28,000 even at that rate, and we only give an advance of R13,000. Therefore, a transaction in that part of the country cannot go through. Take a district like Mafeking in my constituency where one can practise crop and mixed farming reasonably well. There they ask R40 a morgen but the Land Board will not approve of land which is smaller in extent that 600 morgen because then they regard it as being uneconomic. However, that land will then cost you &#x00A3;12,000 or R24,000; I can mention the district of Vryburg where land in some areas costs R24 a morgen to-day. There one can still resort to crop farming to some extent but cattle farming is the best. You need not less than 1,000 morgen there for an economic holding and this will cost you &#x00A3;12,000 or R24,000.</p>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>It depends upon how much fodder a farmer can produce. It may be the usual five morgen per ox but it depends upon the type of farming one practises. If a farmer produces fodder for his animals he can keep far more animals. The size of the land and whether it is an economic unit also depends upon the type of farming which that farmer practises. If he practises cattle farming on the veld in the usual way he needs a far larger amount of land than when he sells cream of delivers milk to a cheese factory. However, then he needs land on which he can produce his fodder. I want to plead most urgently with the hon. the Minister not to allow this Section 20, the old section 11, to fall into disuse. This is the best section. A man who contributes one-tenth is not going to allow that land to leave his possession easily. If a man has invested a few thousand rand which he has really worked for in a land transaction, he is going to struggle and fight to the utmost to make a success of <span class="col_3971-3972" refersTo="page_0612"/>his farming operations, and this has also been proved to us in the past. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a few matters which I would like to bring to your attention. The first is in connection with the policy concerning temporary settlers. From time to time the Department purchases land or land is purchased on behalf of the State and that land then falls under the Department of Lands. Temporary settlers or overseers are then appointed on that land. My question is Is it still the policy of the hon. the Minister that when such an overseer has to be appointed the post is advertised so that there is some measure of competition and not simply to appoint the first man to make application? It so happens that under the Vaal Dam the temporary settlers also eventually became full settlers. So that man who is on the land does indeed have an advantage over other applicants. I should like to know, therefore, whether there will still be that measure of free competition, in other words, that the appointment will only be made after the post has been advertised.</p>

<p>This brings me to my second point. It is a rule under the Land Settlement Act that a settler who has obtained land cannot ask for transfer of that land until he has occupied and farmed that land for five years. It does sometimes happen that before the five-year period has elapsed a settler is unable to continue with his farming operations.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We can treat ten years and five years in the same way for the purpose of the point that I want to make. Such a settler is unable to carry on. It sometimes happens that a very old man obtains the land. He becomes ill and cannot continue farming, or there is another reason why he wishes to give the land back or transfer it to someone else. I would like to know whether it is still the policy that in such a case the land will be taken back by the Department and again be released for free competition so that applications can be submitted and so that the land will not be transferred directly from one settler to another. If that is done, then the clause which forbids this will indeed amount to nothing because then the transfer of such land would result in speculation.</p>

<p>I come now to the third question that I want to ask. A number of small holdings have already been allocated under the Sand-Vet scheme. I would like to know when further small holdings will again be allocated, what the size of those small holdings will be and whether the people living in the Free State will receive preference in the allocation of those small-holdings. A further question is this now that the Orange River scheme has been announced: You will remember that there are a large number of settlers on the Riet River who have not had sufficient water. This has been the case for a very long time. A number of the smallholdings under the Riet River scheme could not be farmed successfully. I would like to know whether under the Orange River scheme sufficient water will be made available in the Riet River to supply all the settlers under that scheme with sufficient water?</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In any case I have already asked the question. It is too late now. A further question which I wish to ask is in connection with the annual report of the Department. I understand that the annual report will no longer be appearing. I am sorry that such a decision has been taken. The annual report is of particular value to us because it makes us <i>au fait</i> with what is going on in the Department, how the Department is developing, and it is of great importance to us to see the amount of success achieved by the various settlement schemes. In this connection I would like to ask a question regarding the new land inspectors. You will remember that last year a new system was introduced. The old system was abolished and we now have inspectors who are appointed, all of whom fall under the Public Service. I would like to ask whether that scheme is really a success because I have information that the man who now has to operate in the Free State, and in my constituency as well, only arrives there once every six months, if ever. One never sees him. That man simply cannot cope with the work any longer. I would like to know whether more posts are going to be created under the Public Service to make an adequate number of inspectors available.</p>

<p>I come now to the last point which I wish to raise and this affects the land board valuators: it is a matter which was also raised by the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). I want to agree with her. It is a wonder that I agree with her because I usually differ from her. I am compelled today, however, to agree with her because I have had experience in this regard. The land boards which we appoint, so it appears to me, do the valuations for the Department of Lands, <i>inter alia</i> for purchases under Section 20. When this is done there is apparently one type of valuation because then the person involved has to contribute one-tenth. The valuation is then at its very lowest and, usually the man cannot obtain sufficient money to purchase the land because the price asked by the man wishing to sell is higher than the valuation. In other words, there the valuation is always as conservative as possible. However, as a member of the Bantu Affairs Commission I also come into contact with that aspect of <span class="col_3973-3974" refersTo="page_0613"/>the matter. What surprises me is that this same land board, when a farmer wishing to purchase the land is affected, acts so conservatively that it does not value the land properly. But when Bantu Affairs has to pay for that land, then the price shoots sky-high. I want to say that it is to the advantage to the farmers to sell because then they receive a good price.[ want to admit that honestly. But I simply do not want so many yardsticks to be used. Here we have two yardsticks which are used and there is a further one. I have had personal experience of this. I had land in connection with which the Department of Water Affairs had to compensate me for a servitude. In this case the land board also made the valuation and once again their valuation was an extremely conservative one. In this respect I feel very concerned about the fact that the land boards, apparently have various yardsticks for the valuation of land. On the other hand I wish to laud the valuators of the Land Bank in this connection. They have a fixed yardstick, a yardstick which is more or less the same in all the provinces and which is reasonably uniform in each province. I have already found that the Land Bank valuations have also differed in the same province. I want to ask that the Land Bank yardstick should be used; that is to say that the grazing value, the reasonable animal husbandry value and the agricultural value, and also the improvements, should be properly valued according to the system which the Land Bank valuators have. I may just say that the Land Bank valuators are appointed but they also receive reasonable instructions in regard to their method of valuation and the Land Bank also ensures that those instructions are carried out to the letter. This cannot always be said of the land boards. I am sorry that I have to criticize them in this respect but I think that it is necessary as a protection. In this I also find one of the reasons why fewer and fewer purchases are taking place under this Section 20. It is because the valuations are not correct; they are unrealistic and highly imaginary. It is the same people who make the valuation who have to recommend whether that land should be purchased or not. I feel that the hon. the Minister should have an investigation instituted in connection with these matters.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I have nothing to say in regard to what was said by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) because those were questions which he put to the hon. the Minister. However, I wish to associate myself with the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) and his plea that the amount which is made available for purchases under Section 20. with the one-tenth contribution, should be increased. I do this in pursuance of a report which is known to all of us generally as the report of the Commission of Inquiry on European Occupation of the Rural Areas. In paragraph 380 on page 43 the Commission states very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The present maximum amount of &#x00A3;5,150 &#x2026;</block>

<p>When it was still that figure; it is higher now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; under the one-tenth system (Section 20) is inadequate in the cattle regions and ought to be increased to, say, &#x00A3;10,000.</block>

<p>In other words, R20,000&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In such a case the buyer should then contribute two-tenths and for a farm of &#x00A3;15,000 he should contribute three-tenths.</block>

<p>That shows that this Commission gave its thorough attention to this problem and felt that something more should be done to attract those people back to the land. The hon. member for Vryburg is quite right when he says that it is this type of man who is going to become the most important farmer of the future. We are not so much interested in the man who has to be assisted completely right from the start. But we are interested in the man who has already achieved something and who wishes to go further and who can be assisted under this Section 20 through the medium of his one-tenth contribution, if the amount can be increased in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would also like to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) where he made a plea in connection with the position at Vaalhartz. I think Vaalhartz is more or less similar to all the irrigation schemes throughout South Africa. The hon. member made out a good case in respect of the extremely high production costs. In his reply to the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) the hon. the Minister merely spoke about the supply of water, drainage and so forth, and he said that the farmers were no longer using so much water there. Let me tell the hon. the Minister what one of the reasons for the increased production costs is. There has been an increase in the amount which they have to pay for water to-day and this is one of the most important reasons why productions costs have risen to such an extent. I do not think that the hon. the Minister created the impression that there had been no increase in their water tariffs, but if that where the case, I would just like to say that it was completely incorrect. I would like to show the hon. the Minister how the water tariffs of those people have risen and how this has assisted in causing their production costs to rise over the past few years. Up to 31 March 1957, they paid R2 per morgen per year. This amounted to R60 per year for 30 morgen. In April 1958, this amount was raised when the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs came to light with the increased tariff. In April 1959 it was raised again. To-day it is the equivalent of R4.25 per morgen per year if the full quota of 64 cusec-hours per year is utilized. A tremendous increase in the production costs of these people has therefore taken<span class="col_3975-3976" refersTo="page_0614"/>place over the past few years. My question to the hon. the Minister, and this is also the question of many of the irrigation farmers, is this: They say that they are not protected by the Department of Lands when it comes to the question of an increase in the tariffs. They say that the water tariffs are left to the Department of Water Affairs and they and their problems are not adequately considered.</p>

<p>I know it falls under Irrigation but I mention it in pursuance of the increase in the production costs of those people. This is one of the most important items and their argument is that the Department of Lands, when it comes to negotiations with the Department of Water Affairs regarding the raising of water tariffs, must give thorough attention to the position of those farmers. These tariffs were increased on 1 April 1957; they were increased again on 1 April 1958, and they were increased once more on 1 April 1959. There were three or four increases over a matter of a few years. We must understand therefore that the production costs of these people have increased very considerably.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>At the moment it is R4.25 per morgen per annum. Up to 1 April 1957, it was R2 per morgen per year. I have previously told the hon. the Minister about this and I want to repeat it to-day. There are people who have obtained uneconomic holdings under Vaalhartz. They are not so much uneconomic from the point of view that these people did not obtain sufficient land. They did receive sufficient land. Just to mention an example, instead of 30 morgen the man received 38 morgen. Thirty morgen is regarded as being uneconomic and therefore he received a bigger piece of land, namely 38 morgen. However, 8 morgen may perhaps lie on a slope and this land is difficult to irrigate. On the other hand there may be one type of small-holding where there is a very large quantity of water and the drainage is poor, and it is in a case of that kind that the owner of that small-holding may have received those extra morgen. I want to ask the hon. the Minister: Why cannot those people who have such small-holdings be adequately assisted? They will have to pay for the extra service which is given to them by the Department. The Department has machinery at its disposal so why cannot it assist those people to level out those 8 morgen which lie on a slope so that land can be put into production?</p>

That is why I am asking whether there is no method or means which can be used by the Government so that land which is not in production at the moment but which falls within the holding of such a person can be brought into production properly. I have experience of this. The farmer may perhaps be able to utilize sprinkler irrigation on that land. He has water for 30 morgen and by way of sprinkler irrigation he may also perhaps be able to farm the remaining 8 morgen. But, Mr. Chairman, these people must also be permitted to have extra water.</p>

<p>I know that is the difficulty of the hon. the Minister. It is the main difficulty. However, in view particularly of the experience which we have had in the past in the laying out of these settlements, we must see to it, especially when we establish these very large schemes in the future, that <span class="col_3977-3978" refersTo="page_0615"/>we do not again make the same mistake of placing these people in the position of having to farm on uneconomic holdings. I say that a small-holding, just like a farm, must have reserves that one can draw upon. If we are going to permit people to take the maximum from that land in order by so doing to make an economic living, without leaving any reserves to draw upon on that farm or smallholding, it will not be to the benefit of the country. It is not in the interests of the farmer either.</p>

<p>I would like to bring a further matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister. When these new irrigation schemes are laid out and settlements are established we must not simply think in terms of settlers being placed on that land. We must also set aside large portions of that land to enable the stock farmer, for example, to be in a position to obtain a piece of land there so that he can cultivate fodder for his own use. For example, to make all the land which will be available under the Orange River scheme, the 350,000 morgen &#x2026;</p>

We must also think of the thousands and thousands of stock farmers who find themselves in difficulty from time to time because they do not have their own fodder bank and their own lands. Where those parts will be in the central Karoo, in the north-west and the Eastern Province, we must make those facilities available for people to obtain that type of land. Because, Mr. Chairman, it has also been proved that some of the large-scale farmers who have, for example, purchased land under Vaalhartz, are not going to exhaust that land. No, they have invested many thousands of rand in that land and assisted in the development of that area. They have applied the best farming methods and by so doing have also supplied themselves with a reasonable quantity of fodder. We must encourage this and assist it. Mr. Chairman, we have made so many mistakes in the past with our settlement schemes, with those 7 and 8 morgen which the hon. the Minister mentioned, that we are all grateful that the number of morgen will now be increased.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I readily agree with the hon. the Minister where he said that the decline in the number of applications under section 20 was due to the fact that many farmers or applicants were applying to the Land Bank for loans. I personally. think, however, that the reason for the decline in the number of applications and grants is due to the fact that the maximum grant of R13,000 which the Board can grant an applicant cannot be reconciled with the requirements of the Land Board as to what constitutes an economic unit. In particular, it cannot be reconciled with the higher requirements which the extension and technical officers lay down to-day under their high valuation formulae. There is a conflicting element: On the one hand you have the small amount which the Government is willing to contribute and on the other hand you have the high demands as to what constitutes an economic unit, a unit which will be approved when application is made. Let me prove that by way of a small calculation. Irrigation land is generally valued at R400 per morgen. With R13,000 you can therefore buy 32.5 morgen. It sounds well and good on paper but in reality no irrigable land which can be cultivated intensively can be bought under any good irrigation scheme for less than R1,000 or R2,000 per morgen. In other words, only 13 morgen will normally be available for that amount. Therefore it can hardly be expected that applicants will come forward because the land is not available. Secondly, dry land for sowing purposes is reasonably available in the maize triangle and elsewhere at R100 per morgen. That gives an applicant 130 morgen within the limits of the grant, but in reality land is not available in the best parts of the maize triangle at R100 a morgen either. The position of the applicant is therefore aggravated and those parts are closed to him. The The only farms which are available to an applicant are those farms where extensive farming is practiced. He may try to purchase farms at perhaps R20 per morgen in those areas. That will provide him with 650 morgen for extensive cattle farming. But in that case the 650 morgen farm on which extensive cattle farming is carried on is no longer a unit, and he applies in vain for it. Experience in general shows that the typical farm for which the young man and the farmer, who have a craving for land, applies, is the farm on which he can conduct mixed farming operations; five to six morgen under irrigation, fifty to a hundred morgen on which he grows crops, and the balance grazing land. Those farms are four, five, six, up to seven hundred morgen in extent. However, my experience in Marico has been that it is no good an applicant applying for these farms to-day, because they have been written off as being uneconomic.</p>

<p>That leads me to conclude that a suggestion which I have already made to the Minister in a speech on a previous occasion in this House, should once again be considered, namely that the maximum grant should at least be increased to R20,000. I am not in favour of a particularly high maximum because that may have an inflationary effect on land prices, especially land at settlements and other irrigation land. But the present maximum gets us nowhere and I am convinced that applications under Section 20 will continue to decline and that type of young farmer to whom the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) has referred, will come less and less into consideration.</p>

<p>I want to hurry and bring a few other small matters to the attention of the hon. the <span class="col_3979-3980" refersTo="page_0616"/>Minister. I suggest that when an application is refused, the Department should not notify the seller as well. Because that often embarrasses the applicant who has obtained an option from the seller because in that case the seller may withdraw the option. In that event the buyer who could perhaps have made some other plan, loses his opportunity of approaching the Board once again or of even trying to raise a loan with the Land Bank because his option has been cancelled.</p>

<p>The following matter which is of importance, is that in all cases preference should be given to applicants who apply for small units of farms which have been cut up with the object of consolidation. That will encourage farmers to consolidate small uneconomic units.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to address a word of thanks to the officials who are present in this House. I wish to thank them for the expeditious manner in which they have dealt with the agreements of sale in respect of those farms which the farmers in the north western corner of the Marico District have offered to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. It is the duty of the Department of Lands, to value that land and to negotiate with the sellers who offer farms to the Department of Bantu Administration as compensatory land for the removal of black spots. Where sellers have objected the land has been satisfactorily revalued and we are deeply grateful to them for that. In conclusion, applicants complain bitterly about the delay in dealing with applications and I wonder whether it is not possible to oil the machinery a little so that applications can be dealt with more expeditiously.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the Sand-Vet River Scheme near the Free State Goldfields. Actually, I want to direct a request to the Minister, and at the same time I want to congratulate him on a scheme which promises to be a great success and a great asset, not only to the Free State but to the whole country. I would like to know from the Minister whether it is not possible that when applicants are selected applicants from the immediate vicinity will receive particularly sympathetic attention. I should like to mention two groups. I have in mind the people who were born and grew up there, whose parents went there as pioneers and made the country habitable. One feels that their descendants surely have the right to feel that they can share in the developments taking place there now. But apart from that, I think it is obvious that a person who has lived there for years and who knows the local conditions should make a good settler. As far as I am concerned, that is a principle which should apply to all schemes and I should like the Minister to consider it.</p>

<p>The other group are the miners there. There is a saying that once a miner, always a miner, and that is quite true in some cases, but it is equally true that there are many miners who should really have been farmers and who work in the mines simply because they cannot help themselves. Therefore I want to say that it is quite possible that this scheme would not have been in operation already and would perhaps never have been established if it were not for the fact that gold mines were developed in that area. I can understand it if the miner feels that to some extent he had a share in the establishment of the scheme, and when he goes home from work he gets the smell of ploughed lands. Therefore I urgently want to ask the Minister whether it is not possible, perhaps by way of a gentleman&#x2019;s agreement that when applications are received the local applicant should receive a little extra consideration over the others, although I will not say that he must always get preference.</p>

<speech by="#niemand">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEMAND</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister a matter which I have already raised with his Department. It is the question of making available land belonging to the Department of Lands to drought-stricken farmers. These people are sympathetic in regard to the matter, and one does not like to see available grazing not being used while people are in trouble. But there are certain problems connected to the matter. In the first place the Department of Lands normally does not like to give consent for such land to be rented to these people, but the practical problem is that the farmers want to hire the land of the probationer tenants, who do not like to lease it because the grazing is limited, and also because the rentals have to be paid to the State. I should like the Minister to consider giving the probationer tenants of this land the right to sublet and to receive compensation for it, because unless they receive the compensation they are not inclined to lease those lands to the people who need the grazing. I shall be glad if the Minister will give attention to that. There are certain lands which are leased by the Department on a temporary basis, and farmers have made inquiries from me and have said that the probationer tenants are prepared to lease the land to them but that they are reluctant in view of the fact that they must first apply to the Department and that the proceeds of the rental have to be paid directly to the Department. I hope that a concession can be made so that whilst there is an emergency there will not be grazing which is not utilized.</p>

<speech by="#heystek">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to bring two matters pertinently to the notice of the Minister. The first is of a local nature, and as long as I and the Minister are here and Sterkrivier exists we will never stop talking about it. We have the settlement at Sterkrivier in my constituency, where the farmers enjoy some measure of stability as the result of the fact that they farm there intensively under irrigation. It is true that they also suffer from the vagaries of nature over which we have no control, but we have always maintained that <span class="col_3981-3982" refersTo="page_0617"/>granting them 20 morgen of land under irrigation there is not enough in view of the fact that the soil is very poor. There is sand, clay and stony land. I am at liberty to say so in view of the fact that I clearly remember that last year, when referring to Sterkrivier, the Minister said that it was one of our weakest settlements, not because we have weak farmers there but because of the quality of the soil there, and that is true. We have received requests to consolidate the land and to remove some of the tenants from the poorer plots (and here I am thinking of 101 to 105, where changes have already been made), and to give them more land, something which is very difficult to do on the Sterkrivier Settlement unless one turns two plots into one, which will surely be very uneconomic to the State.</p>

<p>The matter I wish to raise is the purchase of those plots. After the lapse of seven years the time has now arrived when the first tenants are receiving letters saying that they can exercise the option to purchase, and I must bring it to the notice of the Minister that several of the dams there are leaking, and for two or three years experiments have been made to discover the difficulty and how to remedy it. There are two possible ways of getting out of this difficulty, namely to fix a lower purchase price and then to grant those tenants a loan to enable them to repair the dams themselves, or otherwise to repair the dams soon and then to fix the purchase price so that the tenants can exercise their option to purchase. I hope and trust that when the prices are finally determined it will be borne in mind that these are small plots of only 20 scheduled morgen and that the soil is very poor. We are all of opinion that the sum of R6,000, which is now hanging in the air somewhat in regard to the prices there, is possibly on the high side. It is essential to have experimental plots there on the poorest holdings in order to give further guidance to the farmers.</p>

<p>I just want to point out further that in regard to land purchased under Section 20. I want to make a more general statement, that as the result of circumstances over which the farmers have no control it has happened during the last few years that an increasing number of tenants on those plots are in arrear for one or two or three or four years, and when they are in arrears for four years the Minister has no option but to cancel the lease. Then it is sometimes done in such a way that the man is kept in suspense and we tell him: Pay half of one instalment now so that you fall just within the four-year period, and you will not quite strangle to death because your feet will just be touching the ground, and when that period is over you must pay another instalment so that you are only 3&#x00BD; years in arrear, but just be careful of the four-year period because then the Minister has no choice and must cancel. But things have now gone so far that I should like to know what percentage of those tenants are in arrear for the third and fourth years, something which causes me and the Minister and the Department headaches. We must continually assist those people. I think we have perhaps come to the stage where I should make a very drastic suggestion to the Minister, namely whether we should not still during this Session go so far as to pass a law to consolidate their debts, as I think was done in 1925 and 1931, in order to give these people a chance to begin again with a clean slate in regard to the payment of interest and capital, so that they will have a clear four-year period before them and will not continually feel demoralized as the result of knowing that they are staying on those plots only out of charity and that to-morrow or the next day they will have to get out.</p>

<p>I wanted to bring these few matters to the notice of the Minister and again to express my thanks for the fact that after having had so much trouble in regard to Sterkrivier, as the result of the fact that these plots are uneconomic units, the Minister told me in the lobby that he would visit Sterkrivier after the Session, and I wrote to the Superintendent and the leading inhabitants there and they were gratified to hear that the Minister will visit the settlement and that we will be able to discuss these problems with each other. I wish to thank the Minister heartily for that.</p>

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister mentioned here that in recent years there were fewer applications for land under Section 20. I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister that there is one matter which causes much difficulty. Formerly an applicant had to obtain a three months&#x2019; option from the owner of the land, and that was increased to four months. I know that the reason why it was increased to four months is to give the extension officer the opportunity thoroughly to ascertain whether that plot is an economic one, and I agree that this is very necessary. But I want to appeal that the rule should be applied more stringently and that the extension officer should use a slightly stricter yardstick before saying that it is an economic unit. But it now happens that the owner gives a four months&#x2019; option, and the four months expire without the applicant knowing whether his application has been granted, and that causes the owners much concern. I have a case here where the four months' option expired on 15 March, and when I went home recently, neither the applicant nor the owner of the land knew yet whether the purchase had been approved or not, with the result that owners of land are becoming hesitant because the matter takes so long. Now I realize that the Minister is in a difficulty. I know that there are not always enough extension officers, but that is one of the reasons why landowners are not keen on granting options.</p>

<p>Then I want to plead with the Minister not to give heed to the plea of the hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) that the people in the vicinity of the Sand-Vet scheme should<span class="col_3983-3984" refersTo="page_0618"/>receive preference, because what do they know about irrigation? They know as little about irrigation as do the Bethlehem farmers who apply. Therefore I hope the Minister will adhere to his policy that an irrigation scheme is intended for all the applicants throughout the Republic. I also want to ask the Minister not to give heed to the plea of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) that he should adopt the Land Bank basis. We know the Land Bank is very conservative, and I want to point out to the Minister that the Land Bank generally assists farmers to acquire the larger properties, and that the one-tenth Land Board farms for which the applicants apply are usually the smaller properties which are obviously generally more expensive than the large farms. I just wanted to bring these two matters to the notice of the Minister and I hope he will give heed to my request.</p>

<p>I wish to exchange a few ideas with the hon. the Minister in connection with the acquisition of land and the screening of applicants under Sections 20 and 23. So far the experience has been that a considerable number of applications are refused under Section 20 because the officials of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services decide that the land is uneconomic. Hence we are grateful to the Minister for having indicated to the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) that the assistance of the local soil conservation committees should also be called in on account of their more extensive knowledge of that type of land and of local conditions.</p>

<p>I said I would consider it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and we are grateful to you for that. As far as the screening of applicants on the settlements is concerned, you get the impression, Sir, that according to the yardstick used by the Department to-day, particular emphasis is laid on the possessions which the applicant has at the moment. The attitude is that the applicant should have capital to tide him over any difficult period which he may experience. We wish to point out that if that is the position it will be impossible for a far greater number of deserving applicants to qualify because the position to-day is that the very poor man cannot go anywhere else than to the Department of Lands to get land. That is why I wish to plead with the Minister to arrange his Department in such a way that those people will qualify, even though they have no cash or have very few possessions, because we cannot get away from the fact that if we over-emphasize the question of possessions or assets, it will mean that the idea of rehabilitating those people, which has always been the objective of the Department, something of which we are very proud and which is also so essential, will disappear. That is why we will greatly appreciate it if less emphasis were placed on that aspect when it comes to the screening of applicants.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the problems which the welfare section experiences at the Loskop settlement. To sketch the background briefly, you have a number of farmers each with six morgen of land. It is true that those people are not physically 100 per cent able and hence the fact that special provision has to be made for them. But it is equally true that numbers of six-morgen plots are uneconomic or sub-economic as a result of conditions beyond the control of the Department and some of those holdings have been lying vacant for years. We wish to plead with the Minister that where there are vacant plots which can be used partly, they should be made available to other tenants who are there at the moment and who normally cannot make a living, to sow one or two crops, or to tenants who do not reap sufficient crops on their six-morgen holdings.</p>

<p>We also wish to suggest something else, and that is that those holdings with infertile soil, should be enlarged by adding the fertile portions of those which are sub-economic or 50 per cent economic, thus making a holding of perhaps nine morgen available to the more deserving cases. However, we also wish to put forward a more revolutionary suggestion and it is this, that in the more deserving cases those farmers who cannot re-enter the agricultural industry in any other way, the hope should be held out to them that they can one day ultimately own that land. Otherwise those people have no hope for the future on account of their physical inability to qualify for holdings on the closer settlements which are established from time to time. In that case the possibility will at least exist for those people to cultivate their smaller holdings beneficially and to own them at a later stage.</p>

<p>As I have already indicated we are dealing with people who suffer from physical defects and in many cases from mental defects hence the fact that the settlement was originally placed under the Department of Social Welfare. We wish to ask the Minister whether it is not possible to add to the list of services rendered by the Department, a social service to be rendered to those people. Our experience has been that some of those people can be rehabilitated and absorbed into society as useful citizens. Just as provision is made in its list of services for a nurse or for a medical service, we wish to plead that a social welfare worker should also be appointed. At the moment the Pretoria office of the Department of Social Welfare renders that service but the discussions which I have had with that Department lead me to believe that they cannot perform that service properly on account of the scope of the work and the distance.</p>

<p>As far as the medical services which the Department makes available to-day are concerned. I wish to point out&#x2014;and this is a fact&#x2014;that the district surgeon renders the necessary medical service but if prescriptions <span class="col_3985-3986" refersTo="page_0619"/>are given and medicine has to be obtained from a chemist, those people are unable to obtain those. Many of them have no credit with the trades people and they cannot obtain the medicine in any other way. We wish to know whether arrangements cannot be made administratively with a local chemist to provide those settlers with medicine because we feel that this is an important aspect which deserves the attention of the Minister.</p>

<p>Furthermore we have the position that settlers are provided with agricultural requirements. Agricultural requirements such as seed, fertilizer, etc., are provided. At present the Department provides those things from elsewhere and it often happens that the grain bags, spades, seed, screws and nails which those people get, are more expensive than the product which is locally available. I am not blaming anybody for that but it is a fact that those people sometimes have to pay more for those articles than they would have paid for them locally. We should like to ask that administrative arrangements be made whereby those articles can be provided departmentally or else be obtained locally. That is why we ask the hon. the Minister to give those few points his attention.</p>

<p>Finally I wish to refer to one aspect as far as the broad policy of the Department is concerned. We have the position to-day that on the closer settlements and in specific circumstances loans of approximately R400 are available to assist farmers in cases where holdings of approximately 30 morgen are available. But you have the Section 20 farmers who farm from 200 to 300 morgen and no other loan other than this loan of R400 is available to them, and as you know, Sir, those people do not qualify for loans under State Advances, nor can they get assistance from any other Department. They are solely dependent on the Department of Lands and because there is such a great difference between the farming operations of the settler and the Section 20 tenant, we wish to know whether it is not possible to increase the loan of the Land Board tenant to R600 per tenant, in order to bring the position into line with the assistance which other farmers receive from State Advances. That will enable the farmer with the greater responsibilities and the bigger area to cultivate to conduct his farming operations on a proper basis.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>I must thank hon. members most heartily for the helpful way in which they have discussed this Vote. I want to give them the assurance that many of these matters which are of a local nature will receive our full attention. I do not think hon. members expect me to deal with each of these matters, particularly not the last one. Some matters have been raised, however, which are of more general interest and to which I want to reply. I do not propose to reply to each of the members individually, because important matters have been raised by many members, and it would take too long if I were to refer to the speech of every individual member. There is, for example, the important point which has been raised that we should also place mine-workers on our settlements because they made a contribution to the settlements. Well, if we start doing that, then the important question also arises whether we should not also allocate land to teachers because after all they did train the children in order to equip them to be placed on these settlements. And then the question also arises whether we should not allow ministers of religion because after all they prepare the settlers so that they can get an even better plot in the life hereafter. I just want to say therefore that once one starts with this thing, the possibilities are endless, and we would have some rare settlements if we wanted to please everybody.</p>

<p>Another question that has been raised is in connection with the purchase of land in areas where we construct dams, and that is that we should not cut up a man&#x2019;s land in such a way that he is no longer able to make a living out of it. I just want to say again to the hon. member who raised this matter that is the rule that we follow; where we expropriate land from a person to construct a dam and the rest of his farm is not big enough to enable him to make a decent living on it&#x2014;if it partially dismembers his farm&#x2014;our fixed policy is to buy out the whole of the farm, and then we take the remaining pieces of land surrounding the dam and cut them up into small-holdings for allotment.</p>

<p>Another important matter which has been raised by quite a few members who are farmers is the question of surpluses. A certain amount of fear has been expressed that if we have large settlement schemes, such as those contemplated in the Free State, for example, but particularly along the Orange River, we shall be saddled with the problem of surpluses. Surpluses, like the poor, have always been with us. We are constantly expanding our farming, and it seems to me that our farming is expanding on the basis of surpluses; our farming does not retrogress because of surpluses. I think we must accept the fact that we shall always have surpluses but that we often cultivate new markets with these surpluses. Take the question of oranges for example. I can remember the days when we were exporting 750,000 boxes &#x201C;What is going to happen when we export 1,000,000 boxes of oranges; who is going to eat them?&#x201D; Three or four years ago the manager of one of the co-operative societies said to me, &#x201C;Do you know that we are exporting 7,500,000 boxes and we expect to export 10,000,000 boxes within a few years; who is going to eat them?&#x201D; I then told him about the 750,000 and the 1,000,000 boxes. One of these days we shall be exporting 17,000,000 and the time will come when it will be 20,000,000, and then people will still be asking who is going to eat those oranges. But the consumption in the world is increasing. I do not want to suggest that we should be stupid <span class="col_3987-3988" refersTo="page_0620"/>and go and plant things on settlements for which there is no market. That is a matter that is always engaging our attention. We have just had an investigation at our new settlements, and at a few of our large settlements, into the farming methods to be applied there. One of the important things that was investigated there is the necessity in the first place to produce something there which is suited to the area and, secondly, to produce something which is not going to cause an artificial overproduction. This is a difficult problem and we will still hear a great deal about it in this House.</p>

<p>At the beginning we made many mistakes on our settlements, and I blame nobody for those mistakes. I blame nobody because when we started with land settlements here in South Africa, we had to start from the beginning without any knowledge and we had to learn as we went along. We have now learned what size the small-holdings should be; we have learned that provision must be made for drainage when the small-holdings are laid out; we have realized the necessity of constructing roads; we have learned that when a settlement is established roads have to be constructed immediately to avoid the mess that we had on some settlements where there was large-scale production and the districts under whom the settlements fell were unable to construct those roads. Another thing that we have learned that is very important is that as far as possible all the small-holdings on the settlement must be of the same size, because even if the man is perfectly happy to get a small plot initially, within a few years he will be sitting on your doorstep complaining that he has been treated badly because the other man was given a bigger plot than that given to him. The fact that the other man had to pay more for his plot is overlooked by him. I say that many mistakes have been made in the past. I do not think that we can point to a single settlement in South Africa where no mistakes have been made. As time goes on we make fewer and fewer mistakes, and I hope that on the settlement that we are now establishing in the Free State fewer mistakes will be made than at all the settlements that we have established up to the present moment, because we have sent some of our best officials there. We have gone into the question of sloping small-holdings and drainage and all that type of thing. We have said to the officials concerned, who have had experience of all our large settlements and who are aware of all the mistakes that were made on our big settlements, &#x201C;Go along and plan this settlement from the very beginning and let us see how many of the mistakes made in the past we can avoid&#x201D;. But here I do want to say one thing. I think that the Department of Lands is being very good to its settlers. I think we are treating our settlers very well indeed. Within the limits of the laws under which we are operating we have never refused to assist a person who has come along to us with a good case.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have also assisted people with weak cases. But having said that, I do want to make an appeal to our Members of Parliament to try to develop a little backbone and not to encourage our settlers in South Africa constantly to come and sit on the Government&#x2019;s doorstep when the slightest thing goes wrong. Sir, we have excellent people on our settlements and we also have weak people on our settlements. Let us try to build up the morale of the weak man to the level of that of the good man; do not let us bring down the morale of the good man to the level of that of the weak man. Sometimes I am ashamed of people who come to us with requests for assistance, and on the other hand I have the greatest admiration for others who have a much greater struggle but who put their shoulders to the wheel and who persevere. The hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) or the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) talked about the capable people whom we should fine to place on our settlements, but we do not want good people to be spoilt there by people who constantly approach the Government with requests which are not justified. We are treating our people well and we shall continue to treat them well, but one thing that is necessary is that we should tell our people that they should sometimes try to battle through their own difficulties and not to come and sit on the Government&#x2019;s doorstep the whole day when it is not necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Hon. members have referred to the income of settlers and to their net income. They have pointed out that we must take into consideration the expenditure incurred by these people. Well, that is quite true, but the only figure on which we can go and in regard to which we have certainty is the income of our tenants; we know what their income is because it goes through our books. We do not know what their expenditure is. The expenditure of a good farmer is usually a smaller percentage of his income than in the case of the poor farmer. But what we try to do in the case of settlements is that we institute investigations and find out more or less what the percentage of expenditure ought to be in relation to income. We can then strike a balance more or less. In certain places it is estimated that the man&#x2019;s expenditure is about 45 per cent of his income; in other places it is 30 per cent and in certain areas it goes up to 60 per cent. One can then determine more or less what the man&#x2019;s income ought to be. Reference has been made here to some of our settlements where the income is low. Reference has been made, for example, to Vaalhartz; it has been said that we simply take into account the man&#x2019;s income but that his expenditure is so high that he is unable to make a living there. Mr. Chairman, if people are struggling to make a living at Vaalhartz. why do they receive such good prices for their farms when they acquire title and sell those <span class="col_3989-3990" refersTo="page_0621"/>farms? Why do they get R16,000 to R40,000 in some cases? Many of them get between R15,000 and R25,000. That is the price for quite an average farm. Why are there so many who get those prices if these people are struggling so much? It seems to me that it does not make sense because our farmers are not so stupid as to go and pay a high price for a farm which is not a payable proposition. But I do admit that there are difficulties. On a large settlement where 500 to 1,400 farms are allotted, you are bound to have a number of farms which have been badly planned, and further planning must take place there to rectify the position, but we are limited in certain respects. One of the hon. members has asked why we do not level a piece of ground above the man&#x2019;s small-holding. In other words, what he wants is an additional piece of land to be given to the man. Once he has been given an additional piece of land but a piece which is not scheduled for water, the next request will be that we should give him water for that additional piece of land. And if he is given water, there will not be sufficient water for everybody and then you will be in even greater trouble. Take the Sundays River, for example. A few years ago when the dam was full of water&#x2014;not the last time but on the previous occasion&#x2014;they came along with the request to the Department that we should schedule more land because the dam was full; the wall had been raised and they said that the dam would never become empty. Two years later those people were in the greatest trouble. If we had given extensions, all of them would have been in distress and they would have been in even greater distress. One is faced with the problem of water therefore. The next problem with regard to extensions on our large settlements is that there is often no land for extension. That is the greatest difficulty. We are told that a certain man has an uneconomic small-holding, but where must we put him? We have to find a different small-holding on which to place him but there is not unlimited land there; in many cases the available land has all been used. These are all difficulties which we have. But within the limitations imposed upon us I think that we are meeting these people as far as we can, and I do want to add also that where we do come to the assistance of people they are grateful to the Department for what it does for them.</p>

<p>As far as Pongola is concerned, a question has been asked here with regard to the important inter-departmental committee that was appointed to institute investigations in Zululand into the availability of State land there. A preliminary investigation has been instituted. The committee has met certain people there. They asked all the bodies concerned to make representations to them. Many of these bodies have already submitted representations to them; many others still have to make representations. The committee will meet again next week to go into this matter further. There are various problems. There are pieces of State land situated all over Zululand. In many cases that land is being occupied by Natives. Well, if this land is eventually going to become Native-owned land, then there is no objection really to their occupying the land, but if this land is going to be needed for irrigation or something of that kind, they cannot be allowed to occupy the land. Then under the proposed Pongola Dam there are certain small Native areas, one of which lies in the middle of the irrigation area. The Pongola Irrigation Dam, when it is completed, is intended for Whites and for Natives&#x2014;one part for Natives and one part for Whites. This one small reserve lies in the middle of the White areas. It is much better to add that Native reserve on to the non-White irrigation scheme. That is one of the cases, and there are quite a few other cases where the problem is more or less the same. As far as the coast is concerned, to which the hon. member for Zululand referred, there is the possible development of Sordwana Bay. At the moment the border runs between Native Trust land and State land, right through the middle of the bay. Hon. members who have been there will know that the camping site is on State land and the road down to the bay goes through Trust land. If a harbour is going to be developed there eventually, then we can have the line running through the middle of the town; some arrangement or other will have to be made there. That is another thing that will be investigated. But what we are now doing is to say in advance where land will be available so that we can act accordingly in the future. That was the object of the appointment of that committee, which is an inter-departmental committee. It is not normally the procedure to publish the reports of inter-departmental committees, but that will be decided when we get the committee&#x2019;s report.</p>

<p>A good deal has been said with regard to the Land Boards and their method of valuation. There is a certain amount of misunderstanding in this connection. It is alleged that the Land Boards value in a certain way in one place and in a different way in another place, and that when it values land for the Native Trust it pays the owners high prices but that when it values land for purchases under Section 20, it pays the farmers low prices. I do not know whether they are paying too much in the case of purchases for the Native Trust, but where land is purchased for a person under Section 20 I think it is a good thing that the Land Board should be conservative in its valuation, that it should not make the man pay more for the land than it is worth. There I think it is a good thing. Apparently there is also a certain amount of difference of opinion because some people have said that we should call in the valuators of the Land Bank and others feel that we should rather carry on in our own way. It seems to me therefore that this is a matter which has not yet been settled. But reference has been made here to one <span class="col_3991-3992" refersTo="page_0622"/>point which is based on a misunderstanding, and that is the question as to what co-ordination there is between the five Land Boards that we have. Apparently the hon. member who asked this question does not realize that the final valuations are done by the Central Land Board. The Central Land Board consists of the chairman of the Central Land Board, who is a full-time official, and the chairman of all the other boards. They meet once a month. There is a certain amount of liasion therefore between all the Land Boards. All the chairmen get together in connection with all these valuations.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>It may not be the best form of co-ordination but in this way we do get a certain amount of co-ordination, and it is very difficult to obtain greater co-ordination. We cannot go and second the Transvaal Land Board to the Cape for a month or three months. What would it know about the value of land in the Karoo; what would it know about the value of land in the Gamtoos Valley; what would it know about the value of land in the coastal region? Just as little as the man from the coastal region would know about the value of land in the Highveld or in the Lowveld. It is a difficult matter therefore.</p>

<p>Another matter to which many members referred is the question of Section 20. Every year we have an interesting debate here on Section 20. The plea has now been put forward that we should increase the assistance that we give under Section 20. The amount was increased about 15 months ago, and it was increased by a bigger margin than ever before in the history of South Africa. I do not know whether or not it is going to have the desired effect. However, hon. members have quoted figures from the last report of the Department of Lands. I have just received the latest figures which indicate that the loans applied for will probably exceed the amount which is available this year. In other words, things have taken a new turn again; there has been an improvement in the position, but there is one thing which hon. members must understand very clearly. If we pushed up these Section 20 loans too high we would defeat the object of Section 20. The man in the higher brackets, who wants to farm on a bigger scale, is the man who goes to the Land Bank. There are really three classes of persons whom we help. There is actually a fourth class also, the indigent. We have our closer settlements where we can settle the man who owns nothing; we can put him on a closer settlement where we keep him going and where we can make a farmer out of him. Then we have the man who is assisted under Section 23 and who already has a good deal of capital, and in between we have the Section 20 scheme, which I always describe as the scheme for the younger son of the farmer, the son who cannot inherit the farm but who accumulates a little money through his own hard work and whom we then assist. But the class above that is the Land Bank&#x2019;s responsibility. I readily concede that generally speaking, the amount that we make available for stock-farming, is inadequate. One needs much more capital for stock-farming than for agriculture. The agriculturist needs perhaps a quarter or half the amount that the stock-farmer needs. I have not asked him but if I were to ask the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) whether this is a good scheme in Brits he would probably reply &#x2026;</p>

<p>On the other hand the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) comes along and says that it is not a good scheme in Vryburg. They are both correct. But this scheme was never intended for the man in Vryburg; the Land Bank was intended to assist him. Where we have made use of this scheme, we have constantly increased the amount so as to assist the Vryburg man, but we have never given him adequate assistance. On the other hand we often give too much to the other people. Every time that we push up the amount it means that there are so many fewer people whom we can assist.</p>

<p>Where would we draw the line? You get the man who is an agriculturist and who also has a number of sheep, and the more sheep he has the less agricultural land he has left.

<p>It becomes impossible later on to draw the dividing line. This is one of the best schemes that we have in South Africa. There are numbers of Cape members in the House at the moment and I hope that they will take heed of what I say and that when they go back to their constituencies they will try to get the people in the Cape to make use also of Section 20. I do not know whether the people in the Cape Province are too independent, but a very, very small percentage of the Section 20 applications <span class="col_3993-3994" refersTo="page_0623"/>comes from the Cape Province. It seems to me that the Cape farmers battle through on their own.</p>

<p>The hon. member behind me says that the Cape farmers come and make a success of farming in the north.</p>

<p>A question has also been asked here with regard to farms that we hire temporarily. There our policy is just the same as when we allocate land. We also have to invite applications in the normal way. Those farms are then given to people under temporary lease, and when they are allocated later on we invite applications. But when those lands are allocated, as in the case of some farms in Zululand at the present time, then if a person has been on that land 10 or 15 years as a temporary lessee and has made a success of his farming, he has a very strong claim when the allocation takes place. In that connection the question has been asked what we do if anything happens to a man who can get transfer under Section 20 after five years or after ten years under Section 23. He may, as happens very often, become too ill to farm. If he has only been there a short while we take the farm back and pay him out for improvements. But if he is approaching the end of the period then we are inclined to give him transfer if we receive a certificate to the effect that he is unable to farm, or if he dies we give it to his wife or to a child of his. In some cases we have even gone so far as to give it to a grandchild, where there is a member of the family close on hand who is willing to work the farm for him. Otherwise we take it back and then it is allocated afresh in the usual way.</p>

<p>At Sand-Vet the farms will be an average of 26 morgen in extent, and they are not meant for local people only. It is not the local people who pay for that settlement; we all pay for it and why should our sons not have just as much right as the local people to be given land on those settlements? If the local young man has a good knowledge of the type of farming which is going to be practised there, then it always counts in his favour. When the Kalahari farms were allocated, we had applications from people who, if they had been given those farms, would simply have abandoned them within a few months. We could only give those farms to people from the north-west. They are the only people who have the hardiness and the necessary experience. But the difficulty with a settlement is that usually it is entirely a new form of irrigation which is going to be practised there, and very often one puts a settler in a place where the land is good but where there is no water and where there is nobody who has any experience of irrigation, and then it is often wise to get people from districts where they have grown up with irrigation, because irrigation is not simply a matter of diverting water on to a piece of land. And in saying that I want to add that the success of our large irrigation works in South Africa today was ensured by people who came from Oudtshoorn and Calitzdorp and Ladismith. Here sits an hon. member who came from that area and he can testify what those people with their knowledge of irrigation meant to Brits when the scheme was first established there. You can go to these settlements and you will see that in the early stages the leading people are always those people who come from districts where irrigation is a natural form of farming, in other words, people who grew up with irrigation. The other people then learn from them.</p>

<p>Our inspectors sometimes have to travel long distances, and they do so; some of the older inspectors had to travel long distances but they did not do so, and I think I can say that our system of land inspectors on the permanent staff of the Department of Lands is a very great success.</p>

<p>Another point of interest that has been raised is that an opportunity should be given under the new Orange River scheme to the stock-farmer to acquire a piece of land there so that he can build up a fodder bank for himself. That is one of the many interesting suggestions made here to-day, and I want to give hon. members the assurance that all these suggestions will be taken into consideration. We shall have to do a great deal of thinking if we want to make a success of this enormous scheme, and the suggestions which have been made here will certainly receive our serious attention.</p>

<p>It has been suggested here by some members that we should assist people who have been afflicted by droughts. I want to say to those hon. members that is our rule. We go out of our way to assist people who have been afflicted by droughts. We give them whatever assistance we can.</p>

<p>I think I have dealt with all the important points now. I can give hon. members the assurance that the other points that I have not dealt with will receive our serious attention.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this side of the House welcomes the amendment which the Minister has proposed because it does away with any doubt which formerly existed that the proposed Clause 15 would be in conflict with the existing provincial legislation which gives special powers to the Municipalities to collect rates. But it raises the question of the necessity for Clause 15 (2). One wonders why Clause 15 (2) has been put into this Bill at all. in view of the fact that there is presently existing provincial legislation which seems to provide adequate machinery for the collection of rates in a special process by a municipality or local authority. We would be grateful if the Minister could give an indication why it was felt necessary to include the present Clause 15 (2) in the Bill.</p>

<p>Secondly, a perusal of the Provincial legislation<span class="col_3997-3998" refersTo="page_0625"/> discloses that when a property in respect of which rates have not been paid has been sold, priority is given to the payment of rates over the payments of any other matters, such as an amount in respect of a mortgage bond on that property. But if one looks at Clause 15 (8) one finds that priority does not appear. In other words, sub-clause (8) seems to make it clear that the property is sold subject to any encumbrances which may be on it at the time of the sale. We would be grateful if the Minister could give us the reason why it has been thought necessary to make this change and to do away with the priority which was given to the collection of rates from the proceeds of the sale of the property under the Provincial legislation, and why that does not appear in the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I should also like to refer to sub-section (8) and to put some points to the Minister. I apologize to the Minister that I did not until this morning discover this reference to mortgage bonds. This clause introduces an entirely new principle into our law in regard to sales in execution. The position at the moment is that when there is a sale in pursuance of a judgment of a magistrate&#x2019;s court or of the Supreme Court, the property is sold and there is firstly the preference for the municipal rates enjoyed under various provincial statutes, and secondly there is the preference enjoyed by anybody having a registered charge on the property in the form of a mortgage bond, and if the creditor is not a person holding a mortgage bond any surplus of the proceeds of the sale available go to satisfying his claim. It seems that the parties concerned, the local authority and mortgagees in their order of preference, have preference over a concurrent creditor on sale, and I would draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention that the payment of rates in terms of this clause may be in respect of rates which are not preferent in respect of the various ordinances of the different Provincial Councils which give a measure of preference. The provision here, that the property is sold subject to every condition, servitude, bond or other encumbrance is quite a reasonable provision in so far as it makes the sale subject to the conditions of title, the registered servitudes over the property and the other encumbrances of various sorts laid down in the conditions of title, but I am at a loss to understand why reference is made here to a bond. The effect of this would be that the property registered in the name of A is sold in terms of an order of court granted under this clause and instead of the mortgage bond being paid off on the sale in execution, the bond is transferred over and liability for whatever is owing on that bond presumably rests on the purchaser. Now, this is an entirely new departure and I would be glad if the Minister could give us an explanation as to why this provision has been inserted. It seems to me that it would be far better if the word &#x201C;bond&#x201D; were deleted, because the provision then will be that the mortgagee would have his ordinary preference in terms of his registered mortgage bond. It is most unusual; I know of no parallel for a provision of this sort.</p>

<p>Then there is a second difficulty I have, and that is that the clause is subject to the terms of any order made under this section. That means that different courts are perfectly free to impose different conditions. I presume that the court could under this order direct that the mortgage bond is not to be dealt with in terms of this clause, but that the mortgagee would have his ordinary preference. I must say that from my experience it would be far better if that procedure were followed, rather than to introduce what I think is an uncertainty in respect of the law. I think the Minister would agree that the law should be certain. I can see no good reason for this. I think it would be far better if the ordinary rule in relation to sales in execution applies. The order in this case can only be given by the Court and in those circumstances it appears to me it would be far better if the ordinary rules of court and the ordinary law in relation to preferences should apply and we do not introduce this most unusual provision into our law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>With regard to the first matter raised, at present the position is that a person who is unable to procure registration of immovable property in the usual manner, as the result, e.g., of the decease or absence of the previous registered owners of that property, is at liberty to apply for an order of court in terms of the law in force in the various Provinces, or to apply to a commission constituted in terms of Section 33. It has been found, however, that the latter procedure is very cumbersome and not cheaper than applying to court. Accordingly this new section is substituted which provides for a uniform procedure to be applied in all four Provinces. Another reason is because the ordinances in the Cape only provide for cases not exceeding R400. The Provincial priority, however, still stands under the ordinance.</p>

<p>The second is this. I think the hon. member will realize that it is rather unfair to push this complicated matter on to me without giving me any notice, but the hon. member has been very helpful in regard to this matter. If he feels very strongly in regard to the word &#x201C;bond&#x201D;, and wishes to move an amendment that it be omitted, I would be willing to accept it. But I think the rest should stand, because the rest is the considered opinion of the Commission which sat on this matter, and on which the hon. member&#x2019;s profession was very adequately represented by people of very high standing.</p>

<speech by="#van_wyk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot agree with the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). This is not a case of a sale in execution. but only a case where a person acquires property which is transferred into his name and the position is made easier for him, consequently he has to take over all the burdens which attach to that property. It is not a case of a sale in execution. I think the hon. member misunderstands the position. Had it<span class="col_3999-4000" refersTo="page_0626"/>been a sale in execution the bond would in any case have fallen away. If there are two or three bonds and the property is sold at a certain price, they have to accept it at the price paid and the bonds fall away automatically. We are dealing here with property which is being transferred, where the person may have inherited it, and in that case the position is made easier, and all the burdens which attach to the property are transferred with it. I think all we need do is to delete the words &#x201C;mortgage bond&#x201D;. If we delete the words &#x201C;mortgage bond&#x201D; the property will be transferred and the bond registered against it will not protect the rights of the mortgagee. I think the hon. member understands very well what this clause means.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder whether this clause could not stand over until the other clauses have been dealt with, in order to give me a short period in which to look at it. I would draw the attention of the hon. member for Edenvale (Mr. G. H. van Wyk) to sub-section (2). What he has said is perhaps quite right in relation to sub-section (1), but if a person acquires property I can well understand that in that case he may wish to take it over subject to the mortgage bond because he may not be in the position to pay the bond. But if the sale is in terms of sub-section (2) for the payment of rates, then quite clearly this becomes a sale in execution. I am sure the hon. member for Edenvale will, on reflection, support what I have had to say in regard to the provisions of sub-section (8) in relation to sub-section (2). But I propose that this clause stand over until the others have been dealt with, and I will have a good look at it in the meantime. I again apologize to the Minister, as I did earlier. I only discovered this point this morning. I did not notice the word &#x201C;bond&#x201D; here before, otherwise I would certainly have consulted with the Minister. I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not propose to move an amendment at this stage. I think the exact form of the amendment is something which should be considered and I would rather have an opportunity of putting it on the Order Paper for the Report Stage. The position is that the Minister has been good enough to give me a note from the legal advisers that it is purely a technical question. I will not move an amendment now, but I will consider the matter and communicate with the Department. Offhand I may say that my view is that possibly the best way of dealing with the matter is to make a provision in terms of which the holder of any registered mortgage bond must be served with a notice of the application to court. The court has power to alter the conditions, and he would then be able to protect himself adequately. Perhaps I shall move an amendment in the Report Stage which, I take it, will not be taken to-morrow, because it is not a matter which one would like to rush.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during his second reading speech the hon. the Minister outlined the reasons which have given rise to this Bill. He gave those reasons and pointed out how essential it had become for him to introduce this Bill. He referred in the first place to the fact that since 1957 to 1961 unemployment had risen from 12,000 to 31,000. Secondly, the Minister argued that increased benefits had been paid. Some of the benefits have been increased by 30 per cent to 40 per cent. He referred to another reason, namely that the number of persons who could claim under the Fund had increased because the limit placed on income had been increased from R1,500 to R2,000. According to the Minister those were the three main reasons for this Bill. Naturally you could give various other reasons why we have this Bill before us, but you cannot prove them. Since 1957 we have had our first experience of what unemployment really means and how the Fund operates, and the first lesson we have learnt from this experience has been that when Parliament effected the most recent amendments it was too lavish in the benefits it granted. Experience has also taught us that we have gone too far in the benefits we have granted and the way in which we have used the Fund and that legal provision was made for certain things when we effected the last amendment which ought not to fall under unemployment insurance.</p>

<p>The first point I wish to make is that in their main points of criticism against the Bill the Opposition did not take any of the reasons advanced by the Minister into account. The Opposition, by way of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), has not dealt with any one of the reasons which have given rise to the introduction of this Bill. Nor did he indicate a single way in which we could have avoided the necessity of introducing this Bill by adopting other measures. The hon. member for Yeoville confined himself to a number of arguments&#x2014;I do not know whether you can call them arguments, Sir; I think they are simply statements&#x2014;and he said amongst other things that the Bill was penalizing innocent people as well as guilty people. I do not know to which guilty people he was referring. Nowhere do I find any reference in the Minister&#x2019;s second reading speech to guilty people. He confined himself solely to the reasons why he thought it necessary to come to Parliament with these amendments. I am sorry that the perceptive powers of the hon. member for Yeoville are always away on holiday or on strike when he has to deal with matters affecting the workers. Just listen to this argument, Sir&#x2014;and I repeat that it is not really an argument but merely a statement. He says he still has to be convinced&#x2014;&#x201C;We have to be persuaded that the majority of the workers are attempting to abuse the Unemployment Insurance Fund&#x201D;. I do not know where he gets that from; nowhere in his speech did the hon. the Minister refer to people, less so to the majority of the workers, in South Africa who have abused the Fund. I do not know why the hon. gentleman made that allegation because the Minister never alleged that. Let me say this: Who is being hit by the measures contemplated here? It is certainly not, as the hon. member for Yeoville would have us believe, the majority of workers who can draw benefits under the Bill. He apparently does not realize that so far 3 per cent of the workers at the most have drawn unemployment benefits. If 3 per cent could draw unemployment benefits, surely it cannot be said that the majority of the workers, as the hon. member for Yeoville alleges, have abused this Fund and submitted claims dishonestly. Why do the Opposition talk about the majority of the workers of South Africa while they know and ought to know that the majority of the workers of South Africa will never receive benefits under this Fund? On the contrary, I contend&#x2014;this, too, is merely a contention, but every reasonable person will agree with me&#x2014;that the vast majority of workers who are contributors will never draw one penny from the Fund. But that does not prevent them from making their contributions voluntarily and insuring themselves to some extent should the fatal day perhaps arrive when they too will be unemployed. A small number have up to date received those increased benefits to which the hon. the Minister has referred. Parliament approved of those improved benefits out of <span class="col_4003-4004" refersTo="page_0628"/>the goodness of its heart. I simply cannot understand how the Opposition can come here and maintain, as they do in their amendment, that we are curtailing rights. How are the rights of the workers who can draw benefits from the Fund, determined? Their rights are and can only be determined according to the benefits which are provided from time to time. Obviously, when somebody receives benefits under the Fund and the majority of the workers think they cannot be expected to contribute for that specific purpose, they will rebel against it. The hon. member for Yeoville lacks the contact with the workers of South Africa which would have enabled him to realize that the majority of the workers sometimes strenuously object to the existence of the Fund, not because they oppose unemployment insurance in principle, but because they are under the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the Fund is sometimes abused.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with the trade unions in a moment. If I forget I hope the hon. member will remind me again. Let me confine myself to the point I wish to make. The point I wish to make is that the Opposition allege that the majority of the workers do not abuse the Fund and my reply to that is that it has never as yet been alleged that the majority of the workers have or will abuse the Fund. Let us confine ourselves to the reasons for increasing the benefits, a fact which will eventually lead to it that the Fund will no longer be sound. These steps are being taken to ensure that the Fund will remain healthy and sound in future. The hon. member should not come to this House and talk about the majority of the workers while we know that only a very small percentage of them will ever receive benefits under the Fund. Let me emphasize again that the great majority of workers will never receive benefits and that in spite of that they are nevertheless willing to make their contributions. One day when they come to the end of their careers they will be grateful for the fact that it was never necessary for them to draw benefits under the Fund.</p>

<p>While we support the hon. the Minister, however, in the steps which he is taking, I wish to emphasize one point. The Opposition made great play of one point namely that the rights of expectant mothers under this Fund were being curtailed.</p>

<p>Is that not true?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>It is being done but not to the extent that it is worth making such a big hullabaloo about it. If the Fund justifies it provisions can be made for expectant mothers, but that is not the point. The point I wish to emphasize is this that the Unemployment Insurance Fund ought never to be used for that purpose. Naturally we all agree that in the absence of another fund under which benefits can be paid to expectant mothers, they should draw those benefits, but it is wrong in principle that the Unemployment Insurance Fund should carry that burden. What is the sense in placing the responsibility of maternity cases on the shoulders of the contributors to the Unemployment Insurance Fund? I do not think we should insist upon it any longer that the Fund should be used for that purpose. That is the reason why I make bold to say to the Minister that, as far as the Fund permits it, the necessary provision should be made, but that he should have the position investigated at the first opportunity which presents itself. I think he will get the unanimous support not only of the country but also of the trade unions concerned if he provided that maternity cases should not fall under the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Another fund should be established to render that service to the female workers of South Africa; they deserve it. This matter is too important and of too great a magnitude to be treated as a side-issue, as an issue of lesser importance and to be included as an incidental matter under the unemployment benefits. I do not think any hon. member opposite&#x2014;most certainly not any hon. member on this side, if he realizes fully what I am pleading for. will oppose my plea. Hon. members will also readily agree with me that there is an incessant call on the Fund for maternity benefits. Assuming the position were to arise to-morrow where there was no unemployment; you will still find, Sir, that incessant demands are made on the Fund as a result of that position; it will mean that there will be a continual drain on the Fund, because everybody will agree with me that as the nation prospers, the birth rate increases. The more the nation prospers the higher will the birth rate rise and the greater will be the demands made upon the Fund. That has. therefore, nothing to do with the matter. You will not allow me, Sir, to advocate this any further. I simply wish to point out that the time has arrived that the Unemployment Insurance Fund should no longer be used for purposes for which it was never intended. We should realize that.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member has asked that question because that shows that he is taking a keen interest in the welfare of the workers.

<p>When the woman who works in a factory becomes unemployed she should draw unemployment <span class="col_4005-4006" refersTo="page_0629"/>benefits from the Fund just like any other worker, but the Fund should not be used to pay maternity grants. I trust the reply satisfies the hon. member. He should not again go to the country and make the people believe that those people who have made contributions cannot receive any benefits. I wish to state clearly, as clearly as words will allow me to do, that people who have contributed to the Fund should draw benefits when they become unemployed but the question of unemployment should no longer be associated with maternity grants. We have been doing that long enough. If maternity grants are paid, the impression will always be created, even during most prosperous times, that there is a certain measure of unemployment when that is not the position at all, because when benefits are paid it is not always specified for what purposes those benefits have been paid. I plead most earnestly for that, Mr. Speaker. We are asked to treat people who are ill with the utmost sympathy. Your own common sense ought to tell you that sick people should be assisted but then they should be sick people, not expectant mothers. The mineworkers, for example, that their sick fund under which sick benefits are paid; when a mineworker becomes ill he draws benefits under that fund, but that is not associated with the Unemployment Insurance Fund at all. As far as maternity grants are concerned, the time has arrived that the position in that respect is cleared up as well and that the fund be placed on a sound basis.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with this important point, and I am not advancing this as an excuse but as a real reason why we have for some time in the past paid benefits freely, lavishly and very liberally. A cry was raised throughout the country and you must remember, Sir, that up to the present the Unemployment Insurance Fund has consistently remained a thorn in the flesh of the United Party; it has always worried them. You will recall how they told expectant mothers and sick persons during elections that there were millions and millions of pounds in the Unemployment Insurance Fund and that the Government refused to pay benefits to them. That was the cry which they raised at the time.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>That has nothing to do with the matter. A cry was raised against the Fund; it has always been a thorn in the flesh of the Opposition. They told the people at public meetings: &#x201C;Look at that strong Fund, yet you have to perish in misery.&#x201D; Time and again they wanted to use the Fund for pension purposes; the following day they suggested that the Fund should be used for another purpose but they always refused to accept that the Fund should be reserved for unemployment benefits and unemployment benefits alone. They continually raised one cry after another and made propaganda that the Fund should be used for one or other purpose. Hon. members opposite cannot get away from that; they are responsible for that. As a result of the cries that were raised and as a result of that propaganda and hon. members&#x2019; misunderstanding as to the reason why the Fund existed, it was quite natural for Parliament to say, as it did when the last amendments were effected: Very well, in that case we will be a little more liberal. And the trade unions concerned approved of that generosity. When there was a cry that increased benefits should be paid, Parliament in its wisdom increased those benefits by 40 per cent.</p>

<p>We have, however, learnt through bitter experience that, while we were able to pay increased benefits temporarily, in the first instance, in response to the unwise propaganda which was made, we could not do so permanently. Those people who are mostly concerned with this Fund, namely the majority of the workers to whom hon. gentlemen are always so quick to refer, are concerned about the soundness of the Fund. They do not wish the Fund to be used for every bagatelle. They would like to see the Fund maintained for the purposes for which it was originally established. In those circumstances we decided to grant those increased benefits. However, the majority of those workers who are directly concerned are to-day beginning to realize that the day may arrive when a greater number of workers will claim under the Fund in which case it may be found that the Fund is running out and cannot serve the purposes for which it was originally established, with the result that the workers will suffer. Far be it that the objection comes from the majority of workers, the conservative people, the people on whom you can depend that they will be at work every day, those are the very people who are keeping a watchful eye on the Fund. They are the very people who say: &#x201C;Oh, no, the time has arrived for you not to be so liberal, and to maintain the Fund for the primary objects for which it was established; we do not want you to ruin the Fund at this stage: we wish the Fund to be strong and sound in the event of there being large-scale unemployment in future.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know whether the trade unions had approved of this Bill. So far the female workers have been the only people who have objected. Had you been in their shoes, Mr. Speaker, you would also have approached the Government and asked it not to touch the maternity grants. That is obvious, and everybody in this House sympathizes with them. However, as I said a moment ago, in the absence of another fund to which those people can turn, they have to rely on this Fund because they cannot claim under any other&#x2019; fund. The responsibility rests on our shoulders to say: Look, another day is dawning; we will indeed provide for the future, but the time has arrived that we no longer allow our generosity to run away with us but that we come to our senses and see to it that that <span class="col_4007-4008" refersTo="page_0630"/>Fund is placed and maintained on a sound basis. Another fund should be established to provide for other contingencies. Does anybody opposite disagree with that? No, they cannot disagree with that. When we are dealing with the interests of the workers, we should cease to regard that as something which we can kick around in this House like a football in order to make political capital out of it. Some hon. members think that the workers will approve of the pleas which they are making here, as the hon. member for Yeoville obviously thinks. His voice was like a bell made of lead, there was no vibration and it found no echo with the workers. His voice was as dead as a bell made out of lead, and I do not think that even &#x00BD; per cent of the workers of South Africa have taken any notice of the objection of the hon. member for Yeoville against this Bill. No, Sir, we should consider these matters more seriously. I realize that political capital can be made out of measures such as these by somebody who merely gets on to a soap box but who does not really know what is in the interests of the workers, somebody who is merely trying to see what poison he can get out of it in order to incite people. Hon. gentlemen should confine themselves to the reasons for this Bill; they should realize that it is necessary for us to apply this measure in a very conservative manner and very carefully. If they do that they cannot come to any other conclusion than the conclusion that the suggestions which I have made this afternoon are sound. Hon. members must not think that they can play about with the interests of the workers and make political capital out of them.</p>

<p>I wish to say a few words about the diminution of rights to which the amendment refers. Rights are determined and limited in conformity with the findings of the actuaries. The actuary tells you that you can take so much out of the dam and if you take more out of it that dam will eventually dry up. You should only take out so much so that the Fund will remain sound. It is a totally wrong interpretation of the provisions of this measure to talk about a diminution of rights. Those rights are determined by the position of the Fund, by the amount available for payment in the form of benefits. After all. anybody who gets water from a city council for his domestic use is limited in the amount of water he may use by the amount which is available from time to time: he does not get an unlimited supply. Similarly the benefits which can be paid under the Fund are not unlimited either and in paying benefits we should ensure that the Fund remains strong and sound.</p>

<p>I have been asked whether the trade unions support this measure. I have said that the only members of a trade union who have objected, as far as I knew, have been the female workers in the clothing industry, and that was the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>Of course, the workers in the clothing industry dictate to the T.U.C. as to what they should object to and they are only objecting as a mere formality. [Laughter.] Hon. members do not know what they are talking about; they do not know why those things happen. The T.U.C. is represented on the National Board of the Insurance Fund and the members of the T.U.C. will be the first people to say:&#x201C;No. look here, you are infringing on our rights.&#x201D; However, when people representing employees on that Board support this measure unanimously, you are indirectly hearing the most reliable voice which you can hear from organized labour. Organized labour no longer voices its opinion by way of mass meetings; they have grown up and you sometimes find somebody giving the lead. In this respect there are people who can give the lead and the trade unions&#x2014;in other words, organized labour&#x2014;have voiced their opinion and given their views at the Board of the Fund, the Board on which there is equal representation. What have hon. gentlemen against that? Or do they think that when anybody simply gets up at a conference and lodges an objection without giving reasons, we should accept that as a yardstick; that we should consider that when we deal with this Fund? No, surely those are the most responsible people that you can find as far as this matter is concerned&#x2014;the people who were there and who have to account to their respective trade unions. Those people are not irresponsible people. You can rest assured, Sir, that they are called to account just as you and I are called to account when we plead for something in this House which is not in the interests of our constituents. Those people are likewise called to account; they are properly consulted and advised, and before they agree to such a step they will first of all consult the trade unions concerned.</p>

<p>That is the aspect of this Bill which we should consider instead of trying to look for sympathy, as the Opposition is trying to do, for people who are supposedly being treated unjustly.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words to the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher). The other evening the hon. member tried to show sympathy in his speech, but I want to tell him once again that everybody in this House has sympathy for his fellow-beings. He is not the only champion of the workers. When you stand on the beach or on the banks of a river and somebody is drowning, you must not do what the hon. gentleman did the other evening, and that is to give a lecture and to say to the people who are standing around: Do you know, if that man remains in the water long enough water will enter his lungs; that will eventually cause his heart to stop. No, you should not do that. Sir. You should jump in and save that person. The hon. member told us how very difficult it was for the <span class="col_4009-4010" refersTo="page_0631"/>poverty-stricken household to make ends meet, the household where the people were unemployed. That is something which every Member of Parliament worth his salt knows and if he does not know it he has no right to be here. We should not try to pull wool over the eyes of the workers. Because in the near future South Africa will have to measure her strength against highly industrialized countries, we must in future consider the benefits to which workers are entitled in countries similar to ours. We will not always be in the position where we have a Fund which is a fairly strong Fund in comparison with countries similar to South Africa. We will shortly have to consider giving similar benefits to our own unemployed and not being as lavish and liberal as we have been in the immediate past, so that when hard times hit us we will be able to pay the maximum benefits to those people who, during all the prosperous years, have been the biggest contributors to the Fund. We should not strip this Fund by way of all these incidental matters which have nothing to do with unemployment whatsoever. I want us to discuss these matters in that spirit. Then and then only can we again make further proper use of this measure. We who are virtually the trustees of that Fund cannot allow our sympathies to run away with us.</p>

<p>Confession is good for the soul, and this afternoon we have heard confessions from the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg), not only on his own behalf, not on behalf of his own soul, but on behalf of the soul of the Nationalist Party. He tells us now that this expenditure from the fund was unforeseen because now we have more unemployment than we could have expected before. Instead of 12,600, as the Minister said, five years ago. it is now 31,160, because this Nationalist Government has failed miserably. That is the reason why there is this increase in the number of people who are drawing benefits. What is the remedy of the hon. member for Krugersdorp? He tells us to-day that the fund&#x2019;s expansion was misconceived, the idea was wrong, that the additions that the Nationalist Party made were wrong, that this was originally an Unemployment Insurance Fund, and that they used it as a fund for social welfare. If that is the contention of the hon. member, I think he should approach his Government and ask them to make provision for a welfare fund. But to say that what the Nationalist Party have done was wrong! Well, that is the most serious confession of all. I am now referring to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report, Part III, page 530. There are five headings under which relief is given under this fund. The first deals with the ordinary payments for which the fund was established by the United Party. The second is called &#x201C;illness allowances&#x201D;. When was that introduced? According to this report, in 1953, by the present Government. Then there is the heading &#x201C;maternity benefits&#x201D;. There you find a considerable amount of expenditure. When was that introduced? In 1954. &#x201C;Payments to dependants of deceased contributors.&#x201D; When was that introduced? In 1957. In other words, this Nationalist Party has been using this fund and has amended the fund. Now a front-bencher of the Nationalist Party, speaking on behalf of the Government, comes along and says that it was all a mistake, that should never have been done, and, in order to get out of his difficulties, he follows the old trick of the debater: he abuses his opponents. He abuses the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). &#x201C;Who spoke of abuses?&#x201D; the hon. member for Krugersdorp says. &#x201C;Did the Minister speak of abuses?&#x201D; &#x201C;No, those were the words of the hon. member for Yeoville.&#x201D; Now let me read from the peroration of the hon. the Minister when he introduced the Bill during the second reading debate. This is what the hon. Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hon. members probably know from their own knowledge that there have been abuses of the fund. I believe that there are many cases where there have been abuses.</block>

<p>This is the Minister. Why then attack the hon. member for Yeoville? The hon. member for Yeoville was repeating the words of the hon. the Minister. To attribute to the hon. member for Yeoville the statement that there had been abuses, and that the hon. the Minister had not mentioned them, is hardly fair debate. But we go a little further. Does the hon. member for Krugersdorp seriously contend that there should be no maternity benefits? Does he think that? Does he think there should be no benefits for illness? We know the history of this fund. This fund was established by the United Party and it was established on such a firm foundation that it went on from year to year increasing dramatically and rapidly under the prosperous economic conditions that this United Party had given the country. When a conservative Minister of Labour, now our hon. Minister of Transport, took command of the fund, he did the obvious thing&#x2014;he acted conservatively in the early stages, which is sound finance. It is always sound in the beginning to build up your reserves, and he did so. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) devoted most of his speech to attacking the hon. member for Yeoville personally. I am not going to refer to that. I have found from experience, as you have, Mr. Speaker, that the personal attack never has any lasting effect. It is a sign of weakness. It is a sign that the person who makes these personal attacks cannot advance any arguments. I think the hon. member for Yeoville put up a very good case, and attacking him personally does not help a bit. But the attack on the United Party for its 1953 proposal to extend this fund into a social welfare organization, that the hon. member does not like, is something that I must reply to. Before the 1953 election, the United Party, on statistical advice, and in the light of actuarial <span class="col_4011-4012" refersTo="page_0632"/>experience of other funds, put forward a scheme for these workmen. South Africa at that time did not have a national income large enough to provide a pension scheme for the whole country. So our plan was to give a pension scheme to the members of this fund and to regard it as a contributory pension scheme. By a slight increase in the contributions we could expand it into a pension fund. I think that was well conceived. But the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) attacked the United Party on account of it. I don&#x2019;t think that attack was justified. I think it was grossly unfair and embarrassing for the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister quite recently made an appeal to us to grasp each other&#x2019;s hand and look in each other&#x2019;s eye as English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. What the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) did was to grasp the Minister&#x2019;s hand and look in his eye and say: &#x201C;What a political charlatan you were in 1953!&#x201D; The hon. the Minister in 1953 was one of those people who advocated the United Party plan in two constituencies where this fund makes a great appeal, Brakpan and Bezuidenhout, where you get the class of man who contributes to this fund. To attack the United Party because it tries to make this fund strong, able to withstand the present unemployment, is not the purpose of this discussion and this Bill. I want to examine this fund and see what it is all about. You will remember that the Minister told us that they had two lines of approach in mind. I will quote his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposals of the board fall into two categories; firstly, they propose increased contributions by employers, by contributors and by the State. These recommendations are being considered, but it is not practicable to introduce legislation on the subject during this Session.</block>

<block name="quote">The second is a proposal to amend the provisions relating to the payment of benefits, so as to bring the use of the fund more into line with its primary object, namely to tide a contributor over during a period of temporary unemployment.</block>

<p>Those were the amendments proposed, but why was only one proposal adopted and not the other? Why does the Minister deal only with the benefits and not with the contributions?</p>

<p>There is only one manner in which we can approach this matter and that is to examine the fund as we know it. The Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report contains an analysis of this fund. I take first the question of the expenditure of the fund. I am quoting round figures, and I am only taking three significant figures in regard to the benefits paid out under the fund. The total expenditure on benefits in the year for which I have the data in this latest report, that is to say the year ending 31 December 1960, was R14,250,000. The shortfall&#x2014;one can&#x2019;t call it a loss&#x2014;but, because of the amount of unemployment, expenditure exceeded revenue, exceeded contributions, by an amount of roughly R3,400,000. I call it a shortfall. Now let us take the income of this fund. How is the income derived? Now here is the income as given in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report:</p>

<p>The contribution of the Government, I call it the Minister&#x2019;s contribution, was R1,190,000; the contributions of employees and employers together amounted to R4,760,000; the interest earned by the Fund (quite a strong fund of R130,000,000) for the year was R4,893,000. In other words, for every R9 contributed to this Fund, R4 came from interest, R4 came from contributions by employers and employees, and the contribution of the Government was only one-ninth of the Fund&#x2019;s income.</p>

<p>Let us take this question of interest. I mentioned that the interest amounted to R4,893,000. If we take the amount in the Fund at the beginning of the year, we find it was R134,000,000. It is very easy to make a calculation of rate of interest, because repeatedly we have asked the hon. the Minister of Labour how much this fund is earning. The amount it is earning comes to about 3&#x00BE; per cent per annum. Now the hon. the Minister of Finance has just raised two loans, one a short-term loan, for about five years&#x2014;the kind of loan that the money of this fund would be invested in&#x2014;and he is paying 5&#x00BC; per cent, that is to say 1&#x00BD; per cent more than he is giving to this workers&#x2019; fund. He has a long-term loan that he has floated this week as well, at 5&#x215E; per cent. And you will remember his revolving credits, Mr. Speaker, revolving credits with the American banks, which one could call in crude South African language &#x201C;over-drafts&#x201D;. For his overdrafts with the American banks he is paying very much more than that: he is paying raising fees as well. But to our people, our own workers, he is paying this paltry 3&#x00BE; per cent. It is grossly unfair. It is worse than that. There was a question asked by a member of the Select Committee, and the reply to that question was rather terrifying, I think. It seems that the money is not only invested at a low rate of interest, but is not intelligently invested. Mr. Emdin, the hon. member for Parktown, a member of the Select Committee, asked this question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I notice from paragraph (1) &#x201C;investments with public debt commissioners&#x201D; that the total amount invested with the public debt commissioners at 31 December 1960 was R126,345,978,92, and that the market value of the investments in stock and debentures as at 31 December 1960, according to information furnished by the public debt commissioners, was R115,697,172,59. Is it likely that any of these investments will have to be realized to meet the commitments of the Fund?</block>

<p>The reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is possible that we shall have to ask the public debt commissioners to realize certain of these investments this year, because there <span class="col_4013-4014" refersTo="page_0633"/>happens to be an interval during which no stock falls due.</block>

<p>Selling Government investments at a loss! That is the suggestion. The suggestion is that it may be necessary for this fund to sell some of its investments at a loss in order to keep the Fund going. That is the story. Now I want to make a proposal to the hon. the Minister: We have, approximately, in the Fund R130,000,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I have already given the <i>pro rata</i> contribution of the Government, namely that for every R9 contributed to the Fund, R1 comes from the Government, R4 from the contributors and employers, and R4 the Fund earns itself through interest. That is the position.</p>

<p>We must do something. I think this Bill is unnecessary. That is the case I am trying to make. If we examine the Fund, it is unnecessary to have this Bill. If we must have a Bill like this, it must be a Bill not only in respect of benefits, but we should then deal with the other part as well. If the hon. the Minister cannot introduce the other part, it is most unfortunate, but then we should not have the second part cither.</p>

<p>Now if the Fund were to get 1&#x00BD; per cent more, which is fair, it would mean 1&#x00BD; per cent on R130,000.000, or R2,000,000 as any schoolboy could tell us: R2,000,000 extra per annum. That would be a fair return in interest, which it is not earning at present. That would leave altogether R1,400,000 short, which is not a serious situation. What is serious, Mr. Speaker, is the amount of unemployment. This is not a serious financial situation for the Fund. I think the Fund could stand this very easily. After all, what have we built it up for? The hon. the Minister of Labour of the old days, who is now Minister of Transport, always said to us: We must put a little bit away for a rainy day, for the sun won&#x2019;t always shine. And now we have come to the rainy day; the sun is not shining; and we have to be prepared to see the Fund falling slightly. And if only R1,400,000 is required, then I think the obvious suggestion is that the Government should make that contribution for unemployment relief to the Fund. Let the Government give the money. Let the Government pay what it should pay and then we will have the Fund in a healthy condition, even in time of unemployment. But if we suggest, as the hon. member for Krugersdorp does, that we should now allow the Fund to be re-created purely as it was at the beginning, and I assume together with it a social welfare scheme, then I think we require something much bigger than an ordinary Bill of this kind. The obvious step for our Government to-day is to say: We are going to tide the Fund over this period by making a contribution of say R2,000,000 this year to see the Fund through a difficult period, and in the meantime the situation should be reviewed.</p>

<p>I want to say that at one period we were told that in respect of this Fund it was not necessary to have contributors who were in permanent employment. Hon. members on the other side said so. But the Government is now looking round for any contribution it can get, and is actually asking the Municipality of Johannesburg to contribute on behalf of its employees who are permanently employed in Johannesburg. These men are never going to draw on the Fund. These men are permanently employed in Johannesburg, but they are now asked to contribute to the Fund for at least two years. Why should they? But the Government are going further than that. They say that the temporary employees of the Johannesburg Municipality should contribute as well, right throughout their period of service with the Johannesburg Municipality. Now what is a temporary employee who is in the service of the Johannesburg Municipality? He is a man who is given a post in the hope that he will qualify to hold the post. But if he does not qualify to hold the post, he is still retained in employment. If he cannot qualify he is still retained in employment until he goes on pension. He contributes to a pension fund.</p>

<p>They are exempted at present. But the Fund is so anxious to get a few contributions that they are asking contributions from the Municipality of Johannesburg. I should like to know on what grounds there is any justification for us proceeding with this Bill. I think the amendment of the United Party meets the situation. If the Government is anxious to explore the position further, I am<span class="col_4015-4016" refersTo="page_0634"/>sure they can get help from the Select Committee on Public Accounts. But to say we are going to deal with certain abuses and not with the contributions is quite wrong. Therefore I can support this amendment of the United Party in the hope that the Government will see reason.</p>

<speech by="#van_wyk">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) spoke a great deal but said very little about the Bill. However, there is something in what he says when he says that the money invested with the Public Debt Commissioner should yield a higher return to the Fund. That is a point which he can make but he has yet to convince me that it is advisable for the Government to borrow its own money at a higher rate of interest. He has not clarified that matter as yet.</p>

<p>However, what does worry me is that the Opposition is trying to make petty political capital out of this Bill, a Bill which is in the interests of the workers of South Africa and which provides social security to the workers of this country. I want to appeal to them and ask them, when we are dealing with unemployment and with poverty, to keep those matters above party politics. For that reason I wish to place this matter beyond party politics and deal with it at that level. We are dealing with measures which ensure the social security of the workers of South Africa. That is all we envisage. To start with, I want to be magnanimous and say that the United Party showed great insight when they instituted the Unemployment Insurance Act in 1946. It is a pity that they did not continue to show that foresight. Had they done that, they would perhaps once again have come into power in 1948. In those years of prosperity the United Party looked so far ahead that they established a fund that would look after the workers during the years of adversity. We have to admit that families were saved a great deal of sorrow and distress in the past because of the benefits they received from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. I well remember the cry which was raised in the country, even by the Opposition, in 1956, 1957 when the Fund had grown: &#x201C;What do you want to do with such a strong fund, why should the fund continually be strengthened?&#x201D; That is because public opinion had been influenced to such an extent that increased benefits were asked for from time to time, and then the additional benefits were paid to which the hon. member for Kensington referred. Sick benefits, maternity grants, etc., were added at the time&#x2014; social benefits as the hon. member for Krugersdorp called them. I am not asking that those benefits should be withdrawn, but we are dealing with the factual position to-day and we have to take that into account. The factual position is that where increased benefits have been granted over the years, we have now reached the stage where the Fund is breaking down. The Opposition cannot argue that away. A position has developed where the Public Accounts Select Committee has issued a warning and has said, &#x201C;Look, if the Fund is breaking down under normal working conditions, something must be done to meet the position when there is abnormal employment in the country.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite possible that it will happen. You do not know what may happen in the future, Sir, and you have to make provision. That hon. member will be well advised if he made timeous provision in Port Elizabeth, otherwise the United Party will lose another seat there. A fund should be built up for the unknown future. The fund can be strengthened in various ways. Firstly, by asking for increased contributions. If the Minister were to suggest that the workers, the employers and the State should pay increased contributions, then the Opposition would have objected and said that we were placing additional burdens on the poor employees in these difficult times by asking increased contributions from them. Secondly, the suggestion of the hon. member for Kensington could be implemented, namely to increase the rate of interest and to ask for a contribution by the Government. But the hon. member was not very clear on that point at all. In the third place we can do what this Bill proposes to do, and that is to curtail the lavish way, as the hon. member for Krugersdorp has called it, or the liberal way as I have called it, in which benefits have been granted in the past. To put it bluntly, &#x201C;to pull in your belt&#x201D;. That is what this Bill envisages. That is all. Not one of the rights of the contributors is being taken away. Nothing is being taken away from the workers which belonged to them previously. I also wish to refer to what the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has said. He said that unemployment insurance was a kind of insurance policy for workers and that any insurance company which paid benefits on such a lavish scale would not get any business. However, the hon. member had hold of the wrong end of the stick. We must distinguish between life insurance and accident insurance. If the hon. member insures his motor-car it is not with the intention of getting involved in an accident to-morrow or the day after in order to get the benefits. An unemployment insurance scheme is a national scheme and the contributions made by those who do not become unemployed have to be used to pay unemployment benefits to those who do become unemployed. They should pay their contributions in a spirit of gratitude because they are not unemployed. I want to put it this way, that when there is unemployment. and when there is a national scheme, the whole nation pays to alleviate the lot of the unfortunate section of the population. It is in this spirit that the Unemployment Insurance Fund has to be approached. It has to be done in a spirit of sacrifice on the part of those who are able to contribute. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said that even permanent workers were to-day being <span class="col_4017-4018" refersTo="page_0635"/>asked to contribute to the fund. I have no fault to find with that. The contributions of those who find themselves in a fortunate position have to be used to ease the burden of the others. We may not play politics with the bread and butter of the poor and the unemployed and of the unfortunate man who is poverty-stricken. That is why I maintain that what is contemplated in this Bill is only the first step toward ensuring that justice is done to the workers of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow the line he has taken on this subject. I should like to confine myself in this debate to one subject only and that is the position of the Coloured man. We are the only people who look after their interests; they would be lost if they were to depend on that side of the House. It is our duty to look after their interests and we will continue to do so.</p>

<p>I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister the position of the employees in the food and canning industry. I should like to point out that there is great disappointment indeed because the industry in which they are employed has been affected by the fact that there has been an extension of areas from time to time in which this industry has been excluded from the operation of this Act. This has placed a very heavy burden on the shoulders of those people who are employed in this industry and I hope the plea that I am about to make to the hon. the Minister will have some beneficial results.</p>

<p>I want to deal first of all with some of the points raised by the hon. the Minister when he introduced this Bill. I wish to point out to the Deputy Minister who is now in charge of this Bill that the Minister in introducing this Bill actually indicated that those people who found themselves in the position of the food and canning industry employees should be assisted. I want to read a few extracts from that speech. In col. 3030 of Hansard No. 9 the Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These recommendations are being considered but it is not practicable to introduce legislation on this subject during this Session. The second is a proposal to amend the conditions relating to the payment of benefits so as to bring the use of the Fund more into line with its primary object &#x2026; and this is the point I wish to make&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; namely, to tide a contributor over during a period of temporary unemployment.</block>

<p>I hope to show a little later that the people who are excluded are those who fall under this category of &#x201C;temporary unemployment&#x201D;. Of course, the Minister did indicate in his speech that there has been an increase in the amount of earnings with the result that the number of contributors has increased. It seems to me that the rich will benefit but that the poor are excluded to some extent. In col. 3031 the Minister also said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those who would be affected would be contributors who are continually losing their employment, and also married women who periodically return to the labour market.</block>

<p>I want to repeat what the Minister said there, namely that those who will be affected will be contributors who are continually losing their employment. He went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now the proposed additional paragraph (1) to Section 41 of the Act will have the effect that a contributor employed on short time will not be regarded as unemployed.</block>

<p>Those were very significant statements by the hon. the Minister when he introduced the Bill. I want to use these statements by the Minister to bring the position of those people to the notice of the hon. the Deputy Minister. As I have explained to the hon. the Deputy Minister, I am not standing here to-day in order to condemn the Government. On the contrary I am here to make a public appeal to the Government to reconsider its action in excluding this industry from the operation of the Act in certain parts of the country, whereas it is not excluded in other parts. For instance, Mr. Speaker, you will find that in Cape Town the industry is not excluded from the operation of this Act. For the information of the hon. the Deputy Minister I want to mention the places where the industry is not excluded. Those places are: Berg River Mouth, Cape Town, Doornbaai, Hout Bay, Hondeklip Bay, Johannesburg, Lamberts Bay, Somerset Strand, Malmesbury, Port Elizabeth, Port Nolloth, Saldanha Bay and St. Helena Bay. My information is that the people employed in the industry in these places which I have mentioned can contribute. But in Ashton, Ceres, Durban, East London, Grabouw, Groot Drakenstein, Kleinmond, Luderitz Bay, Montagu, Mossel Bay, Paarl, Robertson, Wellington, Wolseley and Worcester those people cannot contribute. It seems to be quite wrong that in certain parts of the Republic these people can contribute and enjoy the benefits of this fund but in other areas they are excluded from the operations of the Government&#x2019;s Act.</p>

<p>I wish to deal with the question raised by the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) by way of interjection about seasonal workers. Unfortunately in those areas which are excluded from the operation of this Act, the people who are in permanent employment in that industry are also not allowed to contribute. I want to make it clear that I am not referring to the type of employee who is permanently employed by the Johannesburg Municipality for instance. What I am trying to convey is this, that there are people who are not seasonal workers who are excluded from the operation of this Act and cannot <span class="col_4019-4020" refersTo="page_0636"/>contribute merely because the whole industry is excluded. I think that is most unfair. It does not sound fair, anyway, that people who are in the same position as any other person in South Africa, who want to contribute and who may through no fault of their own fall out of employment temporarily, should not also benefit under this Act. I think people have a misconception about seasonal workers. My information is that these so-called seasonal workers work from December to the end of March continuously. During that time they are actually busy with the canning of fruit, particularly in the Western Province. From April to June they are employed once again on the canning of vegetables. There is a short break between these two periods. I understand that there is then another break from June till September. When the hon. the Minister talks about people having to be in employment for 13 weeks, all these people who are regarded by the Government as seasonal workers have in fact been in employment for 13 weeks and they therefore comply with the requirement laid down by the Minister. They have all worked for 13 weeks during the year. They do not expect to be paid unemployment benefits for all the time that they are out of work. They would, however, like to receive unemployment benefits for such period as will be covered by the amount of their contributions. They do not expect the Government to keep them. If they have contributed for 13 or 15 or 16 weeks and they are entitled to two or three weeks&#x2019; unemployment benefits, that is all they ask for. They are not asking the Government to keep them the whole year round from this Fund. They are not unreasonable at all. I think therefore that it is a misnomer to say that these people are seasonal workers. There are seasonal workers in Cape Town and in those other places which I have mentioned where the Act does not prevent them from receiving benefits. Why should they receive those benefits in some areas and not in other areas? They feel very very upset about it and they have asked me to make this strong appeal to the Government.</p>

<p>I wish to give the House some of the history of this Act. When the Act was introduced in 1946 all these people for whom I am now pleading were contributors. Gradually these people, for reasons best known to the Government, were excluded. One area which is excluded is Paarl. The unfortunate part is this&#x2014;and I hope the Minister will give his attention to this&#x2014;that while the Act permitted them to contribute they found themselves in this position that when their area was excluded from the operation of the Act they also lost all their contributions.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>They lost their contributions. What happened to their contributions; did they get them back? I want the hon. member for Krugersdorp to understand one thing and that is that I am not criticizing the Government in this regard; I am making an appeal. I hope my appeal will not fall on deaf ears. I appeal to the Government to help these people who are employed in a very important industry in South Africa. Why it should be seasonal in this area only I do not understand. I should like to point out that the food and canning industry in South Africa is one of the most important industries in this country. It has got to be kept going and the supply of labour must be there at all times. I understand that in a place like Paarl district some 5,000 people are employed in this industry. Can you imagine, Sir, what will happen to the industry if these 5,000 people do not keep themselves available for the industry during the period when the fruit is not available, during the period between the canning of fruit and the canning of vegetables? If they all went into factories outside Paarl or other employment, can you imagine the dearth of unemployment in the industry? But these people are being penalized for keeping an industry going. Why should they be penalized? I would like the hon. the Minister to give very serious consideration to this matter. These people have now been appealing for years. I have their file here, but I do not want to weary the House by reading the amount of correspondence and the appeals made. I will conclude by emphasizing this fact: There are people in the industry who benefit from this Unemployment Insurance Act but only in certain areas. In other areas they do not benefit. I want the Government to realize&#x2014;and I hope the Minister will take note of this&#x2014;that if these people do not keep themselves available to the industry, the industry will be seriously handicapped. But they are prejudiced because the Government says they are seasonal workers; they cannot get those benefits. They are employed for 13 weeks every year. We should remember what the hon. Minister said when he introduced the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The purpose of the amendment in Clause 2 (c) is to apply to illness, allowance payments, and the restriction requiring a contributor to be employed for 13 weeks immediately preceding the date of unemployment.</block>

<p>I am told that all these people will comply with that requirement, and yet they cannot receive benefits.</p>

<p>I am glad of that interjection, Sir. They realize that.

They are not unreasonable. They are not demanding more than what they are really entitled to. I hope this appeal which I have made publicly will help the Minister to give me a favourable reply namely, that he will consider the application <span class="col_4021-4022" refersTo="page_0637"/>of this Fund to these people. I hope my appeal has not fallen on deaf ears.</p>

<p>For a change the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) was a bit constructive to-day, and, superficially viewed, he made a few suggestions which the hon. the Minister will certainly consider. Without the necessary knowledge of those specific matters, it would seem that he made a few good points.</p>

<p>Before I come to the attitude stated by hon. members on the other side, I should like to address a plea to the hon. the Minister. The fact that they have to look to the central office in Johannesburg for the benefits that they receive under the Unemployment Insurance Act is a great source of inconvenience and of dissatisfaction to the workers on the West Rand, on the East Rand and particularly in the Vereeniging-Vanderbijlpark complex. Representations were often made to the previous Minister, to the present Minister and to the hon. the Deputy Minister, asking whether an office for the Unemployment Insurance Fund cannot be established at Vereeniging for the Vereeniging-Sasolburg-Meyerton complex. When those people become unemployed, it entails an enormous amount of travelling to and fro and all the expenses connected with it if they have to go to Johannesburg to go and discuss their position and the question of benefits. They are put to very great expense and inconvenience. They are quite satisfied with the Fund and the way in which it works, but they feel that if they can get those facilities at Vereeniging for the Sasolburg-Vereeniging-Vanderbijlpark complex, it will be an enormous concession to them and that it will save them a great deal of inconvenience and expense.</p>

<p>This Bill which is being attacked by the United Party is nothing but an attempt to place the Unemployment Insurance Fund on a sound basis; it is intended to obviate the further breaking down of the Fund. Without bringing about any drastic changes, this Bill is an attempt to place the Fund on a sound footing and to put a stop to its further decline. The United Party have made use of this occasion to pose as the great friends of the workers and the great champions of the workers. Fortunately I was not here when the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) spoke. That was something that I was spared. But I understand that he was so close to tears about the lot of the workers that it was really pathetic, and that he almost moved the other members to tears also. He is the last person who should talk about the workers. The workers of Vereeniging have had more than enough of him. Then I come to the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher). He made such a great song here about, and expressed so much pity for, the poor people that anybody listening to him would have sworn that he was a very great friend of the workers. When are those members on the other side going to stop talking about the interests of the workers? They are the greatest enemies of the White workers of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member can say that I am talking nonsense, but I shall prove that to him. The greatest protection that the White workers have is the colour bar, but that hon. member wants to abolish the colour bar, except in the mines where it does not suit him and his bosses to do so. He wants to abolish the colour bar and throw the White worker on to the open market in competition with Black workers. That is what he wants to do, and what would become of this Fund then? What would become of this Fund if he and his party associates and his friends in the Witwatersrand-Vereeniging complex engaged Black workers in ever-increasing numbers and threw the Whites on to the streets? He and his party are against the colour bar; they are against job reservation; they have no sympathy for the White worker. They have never shown any sympathy for the White worker. And that in fact is why the White workers rejected them. But now they come along here with this miserable attempt in connection with the Bill, which was introduced partly at their request. It was introduced at the unanimous request of the members of the Select Committee on Public Accounts, on which there are also members of that party, who said that the Fund was being stripped. They requested the Government to take certain steps to stabilize the Fund and to put a stop to this process of stripping it. Instead of welcoming the steps which are being taken in this Bill, and which represent steps of lesser importance, they try to exploit this situation by posing as the great friends of the workers.</p>

<p>They placed this measure on the Statute Book, but having placed it on the Statute Book, they do not care one scrap what becomes of this Fund, now that they are in the Opposition. They are prepared to plead for all sorts of benefits, they are prepared to plead for smaller contributions; they have already suggested that the Fund should be converted into a pension fund. They are prepared to do anything in connection with this Fund as long as they think it will give them a few votes. They do not care if at the end of this process there is no longer a Fund. They are not only the enemies of the White workers but also the enemies of this Fund. Mention one constructive suggestion which has come from them to make this Fund stable and to put a stop to this process of stripping the Fund. That is why they have come forward with one suggestion only and that is that the Government should contribute more money. And then the hon. member for Kensington, with whom I shall deal in a moment, comes along and says that not only should the Government give more money but that the Government should pay a higher rate of interest on its own money. That is the <span class="col_4023-4024" refersTo="page_0638"/>only constructive argument that they have put forward. It is very easy for them to make such a suggestion because they are not responsible. They do not mind if this Fund is stripped. That is why they suggest that greater benefits should be paid and that the contributions should be reduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is the object of the Fund? This Fund has one object only, and that is to tide the unemployed worker, who temporarily becomes unemployed for some reason or other, over that temporary period. This is not a Fund to help the chronic sick. This is not a Fund to assist the work-shy man. And there is a tremendous amount of exploitation of the Fund by work-shy people. I do not say, as hon. members on the other side want to suggest, that the workers are exploiting this Fund on a large scale. But anyone who has anything to do with this Fund will know that there is a tremendous amount of exploitation of this Fund by the considerable numbers of work-shy people whom we find in South Africa, just as we find them in other countries. I have to deal with these people daily in Vereeniging. Not only in Vereeniging but everywhere one finds that there are people who want to use this Fund to live on the &#x201C;dole&#x201D;. They have no intention of working, and the little work that they do is only done in order to enable them to draw benefits again. The actual purpose of this Fund is to tide the genuine worker, who becomes unemployed for some reason or other, over his temporary period of unemployment. The hon. member for Rosettenville made a terrible song about people who are possibly without employment for a year or two or three years. But, Mr. Speaker, this Fund is not intended for people of that kind. It was not called into being for the chronic sick, because the chronic sick can look elsewhere for assistance. They should go to Social Welfare where they can get a sickness allowance. This Fund provides that the man must work 13 weeks in the year, and I say that any person who cannot work 13 weeks in the year is a chronic sick. However unfortunate the circumstances may be of the man who cannot work 13 weeks in the year&#x2014;and I do not blame him for that because he may be sick&#x2014;I say that this Fund was not called into being for that type of person. Provision is made for him through Social Welfare. He should approach Social Welfare for a sickness allowance. This Fund was not called into being for that purpose.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for Kensington. The hon. member read out a few extracts from the report of the Select Committee on Public Accounts. He says the Committee stated last year that the deficit in this Fund was R3,000,000. But that was the previous year. If he reads the evidence carefully, not only in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, but the evidence of the Select Committee, he will see there that this year the deficit was not R3,000,000 but R5,800,000. It was because there was that deficit that the Select Committee on Public Accounts, including the United Party members on the Committee, unanimously asked that steps should be taken to put a stop to the stripping of this Fund. Well, there are quite a few ways in which we can put a stop to it. We could increase the contributions of the workers and of the employers, but do hon. members want that?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Since when? The hon. member is the first person to put forward that plea. They have never put forward that plea before. The only proposal which has so far should make a greater contribution. What I hold against the hon. member for Kensington is that he quotes at length from the Report of the Select Committee on Public Accounts but he does not tell us that it was the unanimous request of that Committee that certain steps should be taken to make this Fund stable again and to put a stop to this process of stripping it. And the steps which are now being taken are actually steps of minor importance. They do not in any way affect the principle of the Fund in connection with people who are temporarily unemployed; they simply eliminate certain things which lend themselves to abuse. We do not say that the genuine worker misuses the Fund, but one finds large numbers of &#x201C;sharpies&#x201D; amongst the workers, just as we do amongst politicians and doctors, etc. One finds them everywhere.</p>

<p>Now I come to the point made by the hon. member for Kensington. Superficially viewed it would seem that he has a good point there. He says that the money of this Fund is invested by the Public Debt Commissioners at approximately 3&#x00BE; per cent, and then he says that the Fund&#x2019;s income is derived from contributions, from interest and from the Government in the ratio of 4:4:1. In other words, the Government only contributes one-ninth to the Fund. But there are two things that he does not tell us. In the first place the Government contributes to the Fund in two ways. Initially it gave 50 per cent of the contributions and in terms of the Act to-day it is 25 per cent. But apart from that the Government still makes its contributions to its temporary workers, just as other employers do. The four-ninths derived from interest is interest on the Government&#x2019;s money as well as interest on the other money. The hon. member says that this only earns 3&#x00BE; per cent, and he wants to know why the Public Debt Commissioners do not pay a higher rate of interest on those moneys. But let us see what the actual rate of interest is that the Government pays on that money. At the moment the Government is contributing 25 per cent to the Fund and to-day the Fund is earning 3.75 per cent interest, but the Government&#x2019;s contribution is taken away&#x2014;and actually the percentage contributed by the Government over the years has been more than 25 per cent because to begin with it was 50 per cent&#x2014;if the Government&#x2019;s money is taken away so that it does not have to lend that money to itself, <span class="col_4025-4026" refersTo="page_0639"/>then the rate of interest would be 5 per cent, and in the old days it was considerably higher in fact. But what the hon. member for Kensington now asks is that the Government should give a few million rand to the Fund, then take back the same money and pay a higher rate of interest on it. That is unreasonable, because the Government makes its contributions to its temporary workers in the usual way, just as other employers do. The hon. member then advocates that the money should be invested somewhere else. Is it to be invested in more speculative fields and not with the Public Debt Commissioners? I think that would be the height of irresponsibility. The Fund could naturally invest its money in shares to earn a higher rate of interest, but that would be very unsafe, and one cannot speculate with the contributions which have been made by the workers over the years. One must have the backing of the State behind such a Fund.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has asked why there should be any lack of confidence in this Fund and in the economic future of South Africa; according to him we should continue to give the existing benefits and let the Fund continue to be stripped for a while because one of these days there will no longer be unemployment at all because, he says, if we spend all this money on the Orange River scheme and on Defence, we shall have a period of full employment in the near future; why then should we be so pessimistic as to protect the Fund by putting a stop to these benefits? I agree with the hon. member. I have very little doubt. Actually there is not much unemployment in South Africa; the figure is only something like 2&#x00BD; per cent, the lowest in the world, and in most countries an unemployment figure of 2&#x00BD; per cent is regarded as full employment. But I am convinced that even that percentage will disappear with the introduction of the Orange River scheme, with the greater confidence in South Africa and with the money that is going to be spent on armaments. But all that will happen then is that the Fund will recover and become bigger and bigger. In the past we were under the impression that R120,000,000 would be sufficient, but we are now gradually coming to the conclusion that it will do no harm if this Fund can be built up to R200,000,000 and, as far as I am concerned, even higher to make provision in this uncertain world for any possible disruption in the future.</p>

<p>No, the Government has no choice in this matter. It has a responsibility towards the workers and towards the Fund and I feel therefore that we should congratulate the Minister of Labour on having taken these steps to put a stop to the stripping of this Fund and to place it on a sound financial basis.</p>

<p>I have had representations made to me, and I know that the Minister has had representations made to him by the official trade union movement that rather than introduce this Bill he should increase the contribution rate. But they make this important point, that it is no use increasing contributions after this Bill has been passed, and I quite agree with him. The present position of this Fund does not warrant this type of legislation introduced before the question of increased contributions by the State and by the employers and employees has been considered. I am absolutely amazed at the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) in regard to this Bill. He should know that it is almost a fundamental principle of any Government worth its salt to consult with the trade union movement on the funds that belong to the workers before introducing legislation of this type. The hon. member for Krugersdorp says the Unemployment Insurance Board agrees unanimously with all these proposals. But, Sir, did the hon. member tell this House that the representatives on that Board of the trade union movement are bound to secrecy? They have not discussed one of these items in this Bill with the respective unions. The trade union movement as such did not see this Bill; they did not know a thing about it, so how can the hon. member say that the workers are in favour of this Bill because their representatives on the Unemployment Insurance Board support it unanimously? I think that we should ask the Minister why did he not refer this Bill to the trade union movement before he brought it before us? It has been done in the past, and why could it not be done this time? Also, why has the Minister only taken a portion of the recommendations put forward by the Select Committee on Public Accounts in respect of this Fund and dealt with this aspect before he dealt with the other? Because by putting the cart before the horse he is going to run into considerable difficulties, when he comes next year with the suggestion that contributions by the State, employers and employees should be increased, and with this Bill then being in force, increased contributions for reduced benefits is going to be a very difficult proposition to sell to the workers. Therefore I say <span class="col_4027-4028" refersTo="page_0640"/>that if this Bill goes through, and I sincerely hope that even at this late hour, when the Minister or the Deputy Minister gets up to reply to the debate, he will tell us that he will rather withdraw the Bill than continue with it before he has had time to consider the second portion, i.e. the question of increasing the contributions by the State, the employers and the employees.</p>

I think it is unforgiveable for a Government, which claims to speak on behalf of the workers, that we should have workers&#x2019; representatives like the hon. members for Krugersdorp and Vereeniging who suggest that we should support this Bill because they are supporting it, when we know that the trade union movement as such has not been consulted.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>It is not my fault that the hon. member cannot understand what I am saying. I can only feel sorry for him. But I want to say this, that all the speakers on the Government side have referred to temporary workers. This Unemployment Insurance Fund was established to assist workers who are temporarily out of employment, but not one of them has attempted to define what &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; is. I ask the hon. member for Vereeniging: &#x201C;If a man is out of employment for two years in his whole working life of 50 years, does he consider that to be a temporary period of unemployment?&#x201D; Now there is no reply. According to the provisions of this Bill, if a man is out of employment for two years he loses considerable benefits, and it may be two years out of a lifetime&#x2019;s work. Why should that man be penalized? He has considerable credits, but because of the provisions of this Bill he will get his first 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits, but he will not get a second 26 weeks, even though he may have considerable credits. I think it is most unreasonable and I want to ask the Minister to what extent has the second period of benefits in respect of a contributor been abused? How many contributors have enjoyed this second period of benefits? I want to put the position to the House quite clearly. If a contributor has considerable credits&#x2014;let us say he has accumulated two years&#x2019; credits&#x2014;and if he becomes unemployed and qualifies for unemployment benefits, and he enjoys the benefits for six months and remains unemployed during that whole period, and he remains unemployed during the next six months, then in terms of the Act as it is now his initial period of employment will qualify him for a second period of six months&#x2019; unemployment benefits. Why, under those conditions, should this amending Bill deprive him of that second period of benefits? I ask the Minister whether this particular aspect has been abused and, if so, to what extent? The Minister, when he introduced the Bill, spoke about abuses, but I think we are entitled to know whether this particular provision has led to abuse, because to me it is extremely harsh. I have had representations made to me in respect of this&#x2014;and I am thinking now of one particular person who was employed by the Railways. He became employed by them after the age of 45 and therefore did not qualify for a pension. He was compelled in terms of the law to contribute towards this Fund, and when he was eventually retired, without a pension, he applied for benefits in terms of the Act as it now is, and received six months&#x2019; unemployment benefits. The Department of Labour was unable to find any suitable work for him, mainly because he had spent a lifetime working and was now well over 60 and could not easily be absorbed in the labour market. But in terms of the Act as it is now, after his six months&#x2019; benefits were paid out, he had a period in which he was in receipt of no benefits and he qualified for the second period of six months and he still has over two years&#x2019; credit to his account. In terms of this Bill, in any case like that in the future, the second six months&#x2019; benefits will not be paid, even though he has the credits. Sir, how can this be held up as a Bill to the benefit of the workers? I say that it is most unfortunate that there has not been a greater degree of discrimination shown by the Minister in introducing this type of amendment, because it will hit the innocent as well as the guilty. But how are we as an Opposition to judge what the position is if the Minister is not prepared to give us information in respect of the guilty, those who are abusing this Fund? Read through his speech and there is not one example of where an actual abuse is mentioned. The hon. member for Krugersdorp assumed that the Minister did not say that there were no abuses, but that is not so. The Minister did say there were abuses. He said that many members on both sides would know about these abuses from their own experience, but he did not specify anyone that would justify this type of Bill being introduced. Surely we as an Opposition are entitled to know that these abuses have cost, whether they are appreciable abuses, to make it necessary for the Minister to introduce this Bill, abuses which could not be dealt with in some other administrative way. The hon. member for Vereeniging asked why we made no constructive suggestions in regard to the difficulty in which the fund is. but how <span class="col_4029-4030" refersTo="page_0641"/>can we make constructive suggestions when we do not have the information the Minister has in respect of the abuses? That is the criticism I level at the Minister, that we should be given a White Paper detailing the abuses which make it imperative for this type of legislation to be introduced. I think the Minister should consider this matter very carefully, and that he should not proceed with this Bill. I think the Minister should refer this whole matter, if not to a Select Committee, then to the trade union movement, and ask them for their comments as to what should be done in respect of their funds, because it is their Fund. The hon. member for Kensington has made it quite clear that the Government is paying one-ninth towards this Fund.</p>

That is absolute nonsense. The point is this, that in respect of other workers&#x2019; funds the pension funds like the Railways&#x2019; Pension Fund, the law lays down that there should be a fixed rate, a fixed percentage rate of contribution 4&#x00BD; per cent in respect of the superannuation fund.

<p>The Government gets the benefit of the money at this low rate of interest. I think that argument is not sound and my plea to the Government is to refer this whole matter back to the trade union movement, because I can see considerable difficulty if this Bill goes through and then the Minister comes forward next year with another Bill to increase contributions. It will be far better for the whole matter to be considered as one issue, as it should be, because it is one issue, the question of what should be the future position of contributors and the part that the Government should play in the fund.</p>

<p>I have dealt with the question of the Select Committee Report and in his opening remarks the Minister dealt with it also, and it is true that the Select Committee said that there were two ways in which this matter could be set right. I do not think the Minister in his wisdom has dealt with this as one problem. I think that is his cardinal mistake. But I want to move on to a further question, the maternity benefits.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) dealt with this matter at length, and I think he is in a privileged position to do so, representing a constituency of workers and being a medical man as well. The point I want to make is in respect of the amendments proposed here. Why does the Government consider that it is necessary for every female worker who may have considerable credits as far as this fund is concerned to be compelled to work for at least six weeks during her state of pregnancy, to qualify for maternity benefits? I have not heard a reasonable case put up by any hon. member opposite as to why this should be so, why a married woman, or an unmarried one, for that matter, should have to work six weeks during her pregnancy before she can qualify. [Interjections.] The Act lays down the provisions for maternity benefits. If the Government feels that should be abolished, let them say so and face the workers.</p>

<p>I have listened, but I do not know what the hon. member means. It is clear to me that the present Act provides for maternity benefits, and as long as we are in the Opposition we will do our best to see that those provisions remain because the workers want them to remain. But I leave it at that and I ask the Minister why he considers it necessary for this six weeks&#x2019; work to be done while a woman is pregnant before she can qualify for the benefits. Perhaps he will reply to it.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg). I am sorry he is not here now, but during his <span class="col_4031-4032" refersTo="page_0642"/>speech he had a lot to say about what I had said in a former debate. I want to quote what I said so that the House will be under no illusion about the way the U.P. feels in regard to the workers. We were dealing with the amendments to the Act in 1959, and this is what I said in Col. 8015 of Vol. 102 of Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to state quite clearly that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s scheme of rather having people in employment under a subsidy scheme has a lot of merit in it. Those who have been on short time and those that have been faced with unemployment know the great difference there is in their earnings between full employment, short time and unemployment, and the question of the aged and the relative efficiency of older people from an employers&#x2019; point of view are things which we all recognize, and all of those schemes that the Minister has, all those thoughts the hon. the Minister has for that category of worker, also have the sympathy and support of this side of the House.</block>

<p>Now this is what the hon. member did not quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But what the hon. the Minister has not made clear, Mr. Speaker, is why he thinks that the &#x00A3;68,000,000 in the Unemployment Insurance Fund should be used for the purpose of bringing these schemes which he has mentioned to fruition.</block>

<p>Now, what was the issue here? We were dealing with schemes to combat unemployment, and the difference between this and that side of the House was who should finance these schemes. The Government wish to finance these schemes out of the funds of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and we said they should be financed from the Consolidated Revenue Account. That was the difference&#x2014; not on the merits of the schemes to be introduced to combat unemployment, but on the question of where the money should come from. And for my speech to be construed as one which indicates that I and the United Party were without sympathy with the wish and the desire to assist unemployed workers is a gross misrepresentation. I say that from what I have read it is quite clear that the issue was not whether the schemes should be introduced to combat unemployment, but whether or not they should be financed from this fund or from the Consolidated Revenue Account. I think the Minister can tell us, but I have no knowledge of any scheme being introduced in terms of that Amending Bill in 1959. Have there been any schemes introduced to combat unemployment? No, this fund has been called upon to finance the cost. I do not know of one, and that is my further reply to my hon. member for Bloemfontein (East). What was done by way of amendment in 1959, that particular portion of the scheme to combat unemployment, has not reduced unemployment by one little bit. As far as I know, not one scheme was introduced, and when we opposed that particular section of the Act we were protecting this Unemployment Insurance Fund, the fund of the workers. I say that we were completely justified in so doing in the light of what is happening to-day. Finally, I would ask the Government, in spite of the fact that year after year we have drawn his attention to the worsening position as far as the workers of South Africa and unemployment are concerned, what positive steps the Government has taken to reduce unemployment. It is quite clear from the reports which have been placed before this House, that the main reason why this Fund is in difficulty is the increase in unemployment. That is the main reason for it. Had there been no increase in unemployment we would not have had this Bill before us to-day. The fact that the unemployment figure has increased from 12,000 to 31,000, at the end of December of last year, is the main reason for the introduction of this Bill.</p>

<p>What about the fact that the benefits were increased?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, actuaries are brought in to consider these matters before Bills are introduced into this House, and I assume that actuaries were brought in before it was decided upon to increase the benefits. But the point I want to make is that if the worsening of the financial position of this Fund is because of the increase in unemployment, then I think we are entitled to say to the Minister, &#x201C;What are you doing about it?&#x201D; Some hon. members have said that position is due to the Opposition. Sir, what nonsense? What has it to do with the Opposition that there is more unemployment? If we had defeated many candidates on the Government side, then I should say that is the reason why there is unemployment on a small scale in Government circles. But it is the responsibility of the Government to do what they can to prevent unemployment. And when we speak about an unemployment figure of 31,000 as at the end of December of last year, we must not be misled when that figure is reduced to a percentage, as is done by the Government side. They say that it only represents 2.8 per cent and that is the lowest unemployment figure in the world. Talk to an unemployed person and tell him that he has nothing to worry about; that he should be proud of the fact that he is one of those who make up an unemployment figure which is the lowest in the world and see what sort of answer you will get from him. Moreover, we must not forget that figure of 31,000 does not include Bantu workers in South Africa. They are not workers in the eyes of this Government. It is true that the vast majority of them have no way of contributing to this Fund, but they do destroy the argument <span class="col_4033-4034" refersTo="page_0643"/>that the unemployment figure in South Africa is only 2.8 per cent. If we were to add the 50,000 to 60,000 unemployed Bantu workers, then we would discover that our unemployment figure is not the lowest in the world. I am mentioning this because percentages can be very misleading and to emphasize the point, a figure of 31,000 unemployed in South Africa is a very high figure for us. If that problem were tackled there would be no need for this type of Bill to be introduced. May I finally appeal to the Minister to withdraw this Bill. I understand that it may not be promulgated for a while. I say to him: Withdraw it; refer the matter to the Trade Unions; get an expression of opinion from them as to what should be done to rectify this position before proceeding with the Bill. I think this an appeal that we should make, because if the Minister is not prepared to do that we will have no option but to vote against this Bill and to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn).</p>

<p>I agree with a great deal of what the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) has said, and I want to take the argument a little further in some respects. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) referred to the objection of the trade union movement to this Bill as a mere formality.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not only the clothing workers who are involved here. I do not know whether the hon. member for Krugersdorp has seen a telegram which was sent by the Trade Union Council of South Africa to the hon. the Minister on the subject of this Bill. In case he has not I would like to read it to him and to the House. This telegram was sent from the Trade Union Council of South Africa during their congress at East London recently, and it read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This eighth Annual Conference of the Trade Union Council of South Africa notes with the utmost concern that the Unemployment Amendment Bill provides, with one small exception, for cuts all round in the various types of benefit payable from the Fund. Conference also expresses concern on this important issue that no advance information was given to the trade union movement and Conference deprecates the action of the Minister in failing to consult with the organized trade union movement. Conference therefore calls upon the Minister of Labour to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, thus enabling interested parties to give evidence, or alternatively that the Minister receive a deputation from the Trade Union Council prior to the conclusion of the second reading debate on the Bill.</block>

<p>I understand that the hon. the Minister did in fact receive a deputation from the Trade Union Council. I believe it was at the beginning of last week, and if I am correct in this, I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell the House something about the representations that he had from the Trade Union Council, and what he intends to do about the representations that they made to him. Now, Sir, I want to point out to the hon. member for Krugersdorp and to the Government generally that the Trade Union Council consists of 50 unions and that it has 166,333 members, so I do not think the hon. member for Krugersdorp can dismiss them by saying (a) the objection was a formality and (b) that it was simply in agreement with the views expressed by the Garment Workers&#x2019; Union. Sir, the hon. the Minister has not consulted with the organized trade union movement on this Bill, and they object strongly to its provisions. Not only are their objections not a mere formality, but they have taken the trouble to prepare a very lengthy memorandum on the Bill which was submitted to the hon. the Minister of Labour, and with one small exception it objects to every single clause which is being introduced by this amending Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) and the hon. member for Krugersdorp and other hon. members have pointed out that the purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Fund is not to provide for the chronic sick and for old-age pensions, and generally speaking that the fund should be preserved from abuse. I think everybody will agree that where abuses are found they must certainly be eliminated. But as has been pointed out, both in this memorandum and by other speakers, the Government has produced very little evidence as to these abuses which it says represent one of the main causes for the depletion of this fund. Very little evidence has been produced, and I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister when he replies to this debate is going to give the House some statistics about these abuses which he says has reached such proportions that it is necessary to introduce such wide amending legislation.</p>

<p>That is one point that I want to make. The other point which was also mentioned by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana is this question of the unanimity of the Board. The hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill stated emphatically that the Board was unanimous in accepting the recommendations which are now being implemented in this Bill. Sir, that is not so at all. The members representing the Trade Union Council on that Board were bound, as has been pointed out, by a secrecy clause. They were unable to discuss this Bill with their own trade union members, and in fact they themselves objected strongly at the Conference to the Minister&#x2019;s assertion that the Board was unanimous on this point. I want to make one further statement, and that is that the only woman representative on that Board, who does not happen to have a vote&#x2014;she is there really as an observer<span class="col_4035-4036" refersTo="page_0644"/>&#x2014;in fact objected strongly at the meeting of the Board to the changes which are being introduced as far as maternity benefits are concerned. It is quite misleading therefore and it is incorrect to tell the House that the amending Bill has received the unanimous approval of the Board. This in fact is not true.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to know why this Bill is being introduced. One has only to look at the figures of the rising unemployment on the one side and at the figures of the depletion of the Unemployment Insurance Fund on the other side to realize why this Bill is being introduced. At the end of 1956 there were something like 12,631 registered unemployed people in South Africa. At the end of January this year the figures of registered unemployed people had risen to well over 30,000, a very considerable increase in the number of unemployed. We know that according to Government figures the percentage is less than 3 per cent of employable persons, but as has been pointed out, percentages are misleading and indeed the total overall figure of unemployment in South Africa at the present stage is a great deal higher than the registered figure of something like 32,000, because as we all know African unemployment is not registered. It is estimated by a reliable authority that the figure for unemployment amongst Africans at the present stage has reached something like 100,000. Of course, this does not affect contributions from the fund, but nevertheless one must realize the close inter-relation between growing White unemployment and growing non-White unemployment, and it is absurd for us to think that we can simply push the African unemployed to one side, treat them as a separate part of our economy and expect no repercussions on the employed number of Whites in South Africa. The two are closely correlated, because the consumer demand engendered by employed Africans has its effect on the whole internal market in South Africa, and as the demand for products in the internal market goes down with the increasing number of African unemployed in South Africa, so does the demand for goods and services produced by White workers also go down and therefore there is increasing unemployment amongst Whites. It is stupid for us to blind ourselves to the inter-relation of these two forces. The hon. member for Vereeniging has not yet grasped the point that it is not the colour bar that protects the White worker in this country; there is only one thing that protects the White worker in this country, apart, I should hope, from his own efficiency and his own productivity and that is the expanding economy of South Africa. That is the only thing that can protect the White worker of South Africa. In the long run neither colour bars nor artificial protection will be any good at all to the White workers of South Africa because the economy is integrated and bad conditions for one large section, a section consisting of four-fifths of the population of this country, must inevitably have its repercussions on the remaining one-fifth, and the sooner the hon. member for Vereeniging realizes this elementary fact, the sooner will it be possible for us to increase benefits in South Africa, to assist workers and to go in for all the social welfare work and social welfare benefits that the hon. member for Krugersdorp is advocating instead of these benefits coming from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. It is no good saying that the money must come from somewhere else. &#x201C;From social welfare, I suppose,&#x201D; said the hon. the Minister, when he was asked where these benefits should come from when the chronic sick or the old people were under consideration. We will not be able to extend benefits to any of these people, and the unemployed amongst Whites must increase as the numbers of unemployed amongst the Blacks increase. A close inter-relationship between the employment of a large section of our population and the employment of Whites is surely an elementary fact which this House should have appreciated by now, but apparently that is not the case, and in every single debate one still has to argue this very ordinary and elementary point.</p>

<p>I mentioned that it was obvious to anybody who studied the figures both of rising unemployment in this country on the one hand and the depletion of the fund on the other, why it has been necessary for the Government to introduce this Bill. When I say &#x201C;necessary&#x201D; I do not mean to imply that I agree with the Government&#x2019;s introduction of this Bill, but in its own light and by its own logic, or I should say illogic, of its reasoning, one can understand why the Government has to look for this way out instead of the more intelligent way out of expanding our economy and reducing the number of unemployed. We find in examining the figures of the Unemployment Fund that as the result of steadily increasing demands on the fund, the position has now been reached where the nominal size of the fund has dwindled by R7,500,000 since 1959. Of course, we will find that figure by which the fund has decreased is still higher when the 1961 figures become available. If one looks a little bit further back into the history of this, one will find that the decline of the fund actually started a good deal earlier. It started from about 1957 onwards, and if one examines the reports of the Public Debt Commissioner, together with the reports of the Auditor-General, one finds that from 1957, when the contributions less benefits paid and after investment income had been credited back to the fund, that whereas at that stage in 1957 there was to the credit of the fund the sum of R2,734,000, this sum dropped in 1958 to a mere R23,129, and in 1959 showed an actual debit of R2,999,374, and in 1960 a debit of R3,319,784. We see therefore that there has been a steady decline. Whereas in 1957 the position was still relatively buoyant and there was a net credit to the fund, after contributions had been received and when benefits had been paid, by the time the investment income was added back, the <span class="col_4037-4038" refersTo="page_0645"/>fund stood at quite a good figure, but since that time because of the demands made on the fund, the fund has now reached a debit figure of minus R3,000,000. One therefore appreciates the difficulty that the Government faces in this regard; and of course as the result of this the whole question of the investment of the fund itself has also been high-lighted, and as has been pointed out in this House the yield of the fund with the Public Debt Commissioners averages about 3.9 per cent. I think the hon. the Minister will grant that is the average yield. Sir, suggestions have been made that the fund should be invested at higher rates of interest, and I would say that this should be cautiously treated unless one is absolutely certain of the security of the investment and also, of course, unless one is able to invest in short-dated stocks. I do not see any point in a fund, whose main object should be to remain liquid so that it can meet the demands that are made on it, at short notice, being invested for the higher rate of interest in long-dated stocks. It is obviously irresponsible to suggest that. It is clearly necessary for a fund of this sort to remain invested in short-dated stocks, although I do not say that the existing investment is necessarily the best. But we cannot get any information from the Government on this matter. I asked the hon. the Minister of Finance to give us some details as to how the money is invested, and all I could get was an omnibus reply from him &#x201C;In Government stock at ruling rates&#x201D;. Well, that does not help very much. One would like to know exactly what Government stocks and one would like to know whether it would pay in fact in certain circumstances maybe even to take a capital loss, where it may be necessary, in order to re-invest in other stocks. But I do agree that it is necessary to have security before investing this very important fund and that one must remember that the most important demand in the case of a fund like this is to retain its liquidity. I think perhaps the Minister might look into the question of staggering the investments so that the stocks will fall due for maturity at different periods, which would help the fund too. I am wondering also whether it would not be a good idea, as was suggested in fact in an article in the <i>Financial Mail,</i> to have this matter submitted for independent and expert advice. I think the hon. the Minister might give that matter some consideration, that is, that the investment policy of the Public Debt Commissioners, as far as the Unemployment Insurance Fund is concerned, could well be reviewed from time to time by an independent panel of investment specialists. I put that to the hon. the Minister as a constructive suggestion.</p>

<p>Sir, what has been the Government&#x2019;s reaction to this position of increasing unemployment on the one hand and the greater demands on the fund, which has led to a decline in the nominal amount held by the fund? As has been pointed out&#x2014;and I do not intend to go into any detail on this because the position has already been explained by other members on this side&#x2014;all the so-called sacrifices have been expected on the workers&#x2019; side. There was an item in a newspaper to the effect that the Government intended increasing contributions all round next year and that the hon. the Minister was considering the question of increasing the State&#x2019;s contribution, which at present is 25 per cent of the joint contribution of employers and employees, and of course at the same time he would obviously increase the contributions both from employers and employees. Well, that is fine as far as it goes; it may be necessary to do that in a temporary difficulty. But the present Bill simply makes greater demands on the workers. It reduced benefits under the pretext of curing abuse. My point is that no statistical evidence has been produced by the hon. the Minister as to the extent of the abuse which he claims is the main reason for the introduction of this Bill. I think that the workers, particularly in view of their objection, are entitled to know what the Minister has in mind. Surely the workers who themselves have been contributing to this fund over so many years, would be just as interested in protecting expenditure from this fund and protecting it from abuses as the Government is, and I cannot imagine that if there have been large-scale abuses, the workers themselves would not have been the very first to accede with pleasure to the Minister&#x2019;s suggestion; so in the absence of such proof one can only assume that these abuses are being played up out of all proportion to their true extent.</p>

<p>In four or five main directions the workers are being asked to make these sacrifices. Firstly there is the increase in the ratio from one to four to one to six weeks of work before the workers can claim benefits; then there are the changes as far as the groups are concerned. Last year there was a Bill before the House increasing the discretionary right of the claims officer as far as offers of &#x201C;suitable work&#x201D; are concerned. At that stage only groups 1, 2 and 3, were included. This amending Bill now extends it to groups 4 and 5. This is an objectionable feature of the Bill as well.</p>

<p>A lot has been said on maternity benefits and I can only reiterate the objections. It seems to me that it is absurd to insist on women working this additional time and to behave as if all women who are pregnant and who go back to work are doing it in order to swindle the fund out of benefits which should accrue to other workers. Sir, this is nonsense. I want to point out that very many women go back to work in order to earn sufficient money so that they can meet the additional expenses of their confinement, and it is a very hard burden indeed that the maternity benefits should now be reduced. The question of the additional burden falling on people who are due for retirement is also one which I think the Minister should reconsider very carefully indeed. Sir, these are<span class="col_4039-4040" refersTo="page_0646"/>people who have been paying into this fund for a very long time, and it is manifestly unfair that they should now be asked to give up some of the benefits which they have legitimately been expecting to acquire when they retire from full-time employment, and simply go in for part-time employment.</p>

<p>Short-time work has now been excluded altogether from benefits unless the employment is actually terminated. I think this is a very foolish measure because this is going to increase unemployment, and it is penalizing workers and employers in fact who have adopted this simply in order that they may retain skilled workers, so that they can recall them at a time when there might be a seasonal improvement in the trade. I think it is absurd to demand that their employment be terminated and that these skilled workers be dissipated over the entire labour field. Here too I think the hon. the Minister should reconsider this matter very carefully before he goes ahead with this Bill.</p>

<p>Generally speaking I think I can sum up my whole objection to this Bill in one sentence, and that is that the hon. the Minister is doing what the Government always does, that is, he is attacking the symptoms and not the disease itself. The disease is unemployment and the unemployment is caused, as has been said many a time, by the increasing insecurity in South Africa, due largely to the racial policy of this Government. The fact that investment funds are not forthcoming from overseas, the fact that the local investor is frightened to expand, these are the reasons why our economy, which should be booming and which should be working at full employment figures, is to-day suffering a decline, why unemployment is rising and why the fund is being hard pressed to meet the demands which are now being made upon it. The hon. the Minister would do well to withdraw this Bill before it passes its second reading and to submit it to a Select Committee where views can be heard on the whole question of the Unemployment Act, because I am not saying that this Act could not do with amendments in certain directions, but this sort of piecemeal attack on the Act is no solution. The whole matter needs review and the hon. the Minister should submit it to a Select Committee before the principle is accepted in this House so that the workers can give evidence, so that the employers can give evidence and so that generally speaking persons who are interested in the whole question of employment in South Africa and the labour field generally, can give the Government the benefit of their advice. But most of all, the Government should be tackling the actual disease and the way in which to do that, as I have stated originally, is to view the labour market in South Africa as a whole; to find out why there is increased unemployment, why the internal market is in fact decreasing and why our national income, which should be expanding at a very much higher rate than it is, has been virtually static over the last few years.Sir, one could expect this in a country with no resources; one could almost expect it in a fully developed country, but one certainly cannot and should not expect it in a country like South Africa which has magnificent economic resources and whose whole trouble lies in one factor, that there are artificial restrictions on the utilization of those resources, both material and human, and if those restrictions were removed then there would be no spectre of growing unemployment in South Africa and the hon. the Minister would not simply be tackling the symptoms of a very grave disease, instead of the disease itself.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>In my reply I shall deal with certain points of criticism which were voiced to-day, and the hon. the Minister of Labour will in his reply deal with the preceding part of the discussion and the discussion which may still ensue.</p>

<p>A problem which the Government is experiencing in replying to the criticism of hon. members opposite is that the criticism concerned the interests of the workers but was not a plea for their interests. What I mean by that is that hon. members opposite still cannot realize that they have no contact at all with the workers and that the workers have no confidence in them, and that the pleas made here, these lachrymose pleas, do not have the approval of the workers or their support. We had to deal here with theorizing. with incitement and the kicking up of dust which did not touch the kernel of the problem in any way. A few speakers asked here this afternoon, <i>inter alia</i> the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) and the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), by way of interjection, and the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) last week whether we had consulted the trade union movement in regard to the matter. They asked why we did not consult them. The fact that they asked such a question just proves their total ignorance in regard to the procedure followed and the steps taken before legislation of this nature is introduced. I want to reply to it specifically and to point out how the trade union movement was consulted and to what extent that movement co-operated, so that this false argument can be negatived once and for all, that we did not consult the trade union movement in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the report of the Auditor-General was submitted, in which he pointed out the increasing deficits in the fund, it was referred to the Unemployment Insurance Board. Now it is unnecessary for me to tell the House that the Unemployment Insurance Board consists of equal numbers of employers and employees. That Board then appointed a sub-committee to investigate the whole matter of the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act in the light of the criticism voiced. That sub-committee consisted of Mr. Norval, the commissioner who was appointed as Chairman, Mr. R. G. du<span class="col_4041-4042" refersTo="page_0647"/>Plessis, Mr. Worrol, Mr. L. J. van den Berg and Mr. H. F. Tyler, who is not unknown to hon. members opposite because he represents the Trade Union Council, and Mr. Rosenberg as Deputy Secretary. This sub-committee, on which the T.U.C. was represented, did not hold one meeting only but held 11 meetings to discuss this legislation before us to-day.It is nonsense to say that it was secret and that they could not get into touch with their trade union organizations. It is utter tripe to say something like that. They held 11 meetings and after each meeting they could communicate with their various trade union organizations if they wanted to do so, and they could consult with them. At those 11 meetings they considered how to deal with these abuses, and I now want to quote a few points from the report drafted by the sub-committee which it submitted to the Unemployment Insurance Board, which in turn submitted it to the Minister, in order to show what suggestions they made, and then this House and the country can judge to what extent we consulted the trade union movement.</p>

<p>In regard to maternity benefits, the matter in regard to which the Opposition joyfully shed so many crocodile tears, I want to say the following. Of course, the workers know the Opposition and they know exactly what those crocodile tears mean, because otherwise the Opposition would definitely have won in the workers&#x2019; constituencies in which garment workers live, such as Alberton, Germiston, Edenvale and Boksburg. Then the Opposition would not have done what it did last time, when it did not even have the courage to put up candidates there. Because the workers know them, they attach no value to this behaviour of the Opposition. As I said, on the subcommittee there are representatives of the workers, not political agents. What did they decide? They considered the question of maternity benefits and devoted attention to the abuses in that regard, and I want to give what they said in their own words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board considered very fully a suggestion that married women be excluded from the fund, but that a married woman might be admitted if she assumed the main responsibility for the support of herself and her family.</block>

<p>They considered this matter very thoroughly, and in a later portion of the report they say that they also carefully considered whether this benefit the Government granted to married women should be withdrawn. They say, however, that they felt that perhaps it would not be fair to recommend the withdrawal of a privilege which has already been granted. And then the Unemployment Insurance Board, on which the workers are represented, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The abuse could be dealt with effectively by the other safeguards suggested by the Board.</block>

<p>What are those &#x201C;other safeguards&#x201D; to which they refer? This Committee on which the workers were so thoroughly represented, fully investigated the matter and made a suggestion, and their suggestion is precisely what is embodied in the Bill. If hon. members have the Bill before them they can refer to Clause 2 (e) and they will see to what extent it agrees with the recommendation of this Committee of the Insurance Board. Their recommendation read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is recommended therefore that this paragraph be amended to read: <br/>A contributor shall not be entitled to maternity benefits unless she has been in employment as a contributor for at least 18 weeks during the 52 weeks immediately preceding the expected date of confinement.</block>

<p>This part of the Bill is therefore derived from the recommendation of this Unemployment Insurance Committee.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I shall have something to say in a moment about the unanimity, and also in regard to the vacillation of the T.U.C. in this connection, but before I come to that I want to refer to the question of short time and say that this provision in the Bill in regard to short time is not something either which the Minister or I involved; it comes from this committee to which I have referred. They investigated the question of short time and say in their report that at the time they differed from the previous Minister of Labour in regard to this matter, viz. in regard to the benefits in respect of short time. They were never in favour of it, but they say that they have now seen it in operation, and they now feel that the time has arrived to recommend that the short-time concession should be withdrawn. That is precisely what this Bill does, except that we say that in times of need the Minister may in fact grant short-time benefits. The Committee therefore recommended precisely what is contained in Clause 3 (b).</p>

<p>Then I want to say something about the question of the thirteen weeks and the older people who are over 65 and who are now no longer fully entitled to the benefits. In this regard the Committee says that in most other countries people have to be continuous contributors to the fund for much longer than in South Africa in order to derive benefits. They mention the example of Canada, where they must have been contributors for 13 weeks during the past two years in order to qualify for benefits; in the case of Western Germany, 26 weeks in the last two years; Italy, 52 weeks in the last two years; Holland, 78 days in the last twelve months. In addition, they say that they regard it as quite reasonable that <span class="col_4043-4044" refersTo="page_0648"/>there should be a qualifying period of at least 13 weeks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether a continuous period or not during the 52 weeks immediately preceding the date.</block>

<p>So even that recommendation emanates from this Committee which investigated the matter.</p>

<p>But to what extent were these recommendations unanimous? In the report submitted to the Minister it is clearly stated that the recommendations were unanimous. After the fact became known that it was unanimous, the T.U.C. objected and said it was not unanimous. They also had an interview with the Minister, to which I am sure the Minister will refer in his reply. But in regard to the unanimity I just want to say this: We have already become accustomed to it that the representatives of the T.U.C., when they appear before committees in regard to legislation, or before statutory bodies, they agree with certain things and that thereafter, if it suits them, they issue Press statements to repudiate it. I can mention two examples of that. When I myself was entrusted with the previous amending measure to increase the penalty period from six to 13 weeks (a year or so ago), we had precisely the same experience. At that time the representatives of the T.U.C. agreed in the Insurance Board, but thereafter they denied it publicly again. In this case we have precisely the same thing again. I have here the draft minutes of the Unemployment Insurance Board meetings, which indicate how unanimous or not the representatives of the T.U.C. were there. At the meeting of 17th January this year the representative of the T.U.C. expressed doubts as to the amendment, but his doubts were not in regard to the merits of the amendments which the Committee had drafted after eleven weeks. His doubt was that he wanted it to be taken as a whole together with other amendments. He was really opposed to the limiting of the number of amendments, and not to the content of the amendments. He expressed his doubts and asked that they be conveyed to the Minister. At the same meeting the other representatives then discussed the matter and eventually it was proposed that the remarks of Mr. Theiler and one other gentleman should be deleted and not submitted to the Minister. It was then resolved that this would not be transmitted, and then the draft minues further read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Drummond (one of the members of the Board), seconded by Mr. Besaans, moved that the amended Bill be accepted as proposed and that the remarks made by the various speakers be deleted. Messrs. Tyler and Du Plessis withdrew their remarks, and Mr. Drummond&#x2019;s proposal was agreed to unanimously.</block>

<p>That was on 17th January, according to the draft minutes. The official minutes read that it was proposed and seconded &#x201C;that the Bill, as proposed, be accepted&#x201D;. That was agreed to, and the T.U.C. representative was present at the meeting.</p>

<p>But that is not the last of these minutes yet. On 21 February another meeting of the Unemployment Insurance Board was held, at which Mr. Tyler was also present, and then the minutes of the previous board meeting were submitted, in which the Bill was unanimously approved as it is before the House now, and that reads as follows: &#x201C;Minutes approved and signed by the Chairman&#x201D;, with no reference to any difference of opinion. But then the T.U.C. representative again came and said that they differed about this and that, and they issued press statements which the hon. member for Houghton is only too eager to quote, because they get all their ideas which they express in this House from the T.U.C., and the impression is now created that this Government and the Minister did not play open cards with the trade union movement. I think that is a wrong and unfair representation of the facts.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question? It is not quite clear to me, but one of the members of the Board referred to a motion he introduced against the draft Bill, but that he was asked to withdraw it, and that he was informed that his objections would be reconsidered at a later stage. Can the hon. the Minister confirm the accuracy of that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I have no knowledge of any such report or communication. It may be so. I can only refer you to what I have quoted from the official minutes, which were approved by him and which we regard as being authoritative. But the whole point is that the Government and the Department and the Ministers concerned, i.e. the present Minister and his predecessor, clearly consulted the trade union movement in the matter, as they have always done in the past. But now I should like to direct this friendly request and warning to the trade union people: If they want the Government at all times to attach value to their standpoint, they should not jump about like a cat on a hot tin roof; then they should adopt a standpoint after argument and be able thereafter to defend that standpoint in spite of criticism. They should not jump about every time, because then one does not know what value to attach to such standpoints.</p>

<p>The other matter which was also raised here this afternoon, in regard to the interest, which was mentioned by the hon. member for Kensington, I will leave to be dealt with by the hon. the Minister, but I should like to deal with one other aspect, and that is the aspect which runs like a rusty wire through the tearful speeches of hon. members opposite, namely that this measure is too harsh, that it is inhumane and that this Government is acting inhumanely in regard to the restrictions being introduced here. Mr. Speaker,<span class="col_4045-4046" refersTo="page_0649"/>that also smacks of ignorance or of malice, because if we think of the steps this Government has taken to meet workers by means of the extension of this Unemployment Fund, it is evidence only of the greatest measure of goodwill. In fact, if one considers that the sick benefits introduced by this Government resulted in more than R15,000,000 being paid out to people in the form of sick benefits which they would otherwise never have received, it passes my comprehension how this Government can be accused of being heartless towards people. When I remember that about R15,000,000 was also spent on maternity benefits, which was also a concession made by this side of the House, and that the death benefits amounted to about R2,000,000, I think it can only be said that there was the greatest measure of goodwill. But if one also looks at the actual benefits received by the workers, one realizes how conciliatory our attitude was. Take a worker in the highest class, Class 12. He draws six months&#x2019; benefits amounting to R364, and those benefits which he draws in six months are equivalent to his contributions over a period of 58 years. If we bear that in mind it will be appreciated how conciliatory we have been in this regard.</p>

<p>One final point in regard to this attitude of ours: It has always been the standpoint of the Government that we are the trustee of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and that we have to protect the interests of that fund. The Government cannot lend itself to petty politicking such as we have had from the United Party to-day. We have a responsibility towards the fund. Whereas the hon. member for Kensington with his mathematical calculations comes to the conclusion that the State contributes only one-ninth, the hard fact is that since 1946 the State has contributed more than R40,000,000 to this fund. But what I want to state is this, that we as the trustee have the duty to protect this fund for the workers, but we also have to protect it in such a way that we will always retain the support of the public in favour of this fund. Now I may say that from time to time there are municipalities which we would like to bring into the fund, but which object seriously, and then it is my duty and that of the Minister to weigh the objections raised by hon. members who sit here, the objections of Members of Parliament representing rural towns which we want to include in the fund. Then the objection is that neither the workers nor the employers want it. One sometimes gets that from the smaller rural towns. They ask why they should contribute, because they have no unemployment there. They also say that the fund will be abused, but in spite of the arguments we get week after week, we must decide to include those municipalities. Apart from that, hardly a fortnight passes or some pension fund which was exempted and where people who contributed to the pension fund and did not contribute to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, comes to our notice and the exemption has to be withdrawn. Then we have the same objections. They ask why they must contribute to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, because their people will not become unemployed. Then we must adopt the unpopular standpoint that this is a fund administered in the interest of the workers to provide for times of unemployment. Then we must tell them: At the moment perhaps you have no unemployment, but then those who still have employment to-day must contribute to the fund in order to assist those who are out of employment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member can discover that when the occasion offers. In view of that, the Government should take particular care to ensure that this fund is not regarded as a hobo fund. We have an extra responsibility towards the contributors to ensure that abuses are eliminated, thereby also retaining the public support for the fund. If it should appear that we do not mind how the fund is abused and how injudiciously money is spent, it will not strengthen our hands, and that will prevent the fund being built up to such an extent that it will be a safeguard for the workers. Therefore we must take steps not only to ensure that the request of the Unemployment Insurance Board is complied with, coming as it does from the responsible trade union movement, but we must also ensure that the status of the fund is maintained and raised.</p>

<p>In passing, just one final point. The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) referred to the canning industry and the seasonal workers there and said that they do not receive fair treatment. That does not fall under this Bill, but I can give the hon. member the assurance that the matter is being considered at the moment by the Unemployment Insurance Board, and we hope in time to obtain a considered opinion as to whether we can in fact include under this fund that permanent type of worker in the canning industry.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>May I just put a question to the hon. the Deputy Minister? Will he be so kind as to mention the specific abuses to which he refers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>At every meeting of the Unemployment Insurance Board it has to consider a number of applications from people who ask for extra benefits, or for the granting of benefits, and on the basis of their experience throughout the years they have told us that there are abuses. I am reminded of one now. Take the question of short time, which is now being withdrawn. One of the experiences of the Unemployment Insurance Board is that in a <span class="col_4047-4048" refersTo="page_0650"/>leather factory in the Eastern Cape, because their work diminished, they arranged their staff in such a way that one week one group of workers was allowed to work and the next week a different group of workers, so that those who did not work could receive the short-time benefits. As the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Board quite rightly stated, that is an abuse of that concession, because in that way the fund subsidizes certain manufacturers either for under-employment or for unproductive methods of production. The State and the employers and the employees in that way subsidize an uneconomic undertaking. There are many such examples, and on that basis they recommended that attention should be devoted to that aspect. In regard to other abuses, if the hon. member is really interested, I will ask the Unemployment Insurance Board to supply him with a number of such examples.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is a great pity that we could not have had the workers of South Africa here to-day to listen to the speeches of the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg), and to a speech like the one made a few days ago by the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk). Then they would indeed have thrown up their hands in despair and said, &#x201C;We have been left in the lurch by this Government&#x201D;. What is significant in the reply of the hon. the Deputy Minister is the following, viz. that when we want to know more about the abuses which took place or are taking place in regard to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, he is prepared to go to the Unemployment Insurance Board to get examples. It surprises me that the hon. the Minister can say that. Why did he not get those facts and make sure of these abuses before coming to Parliament? The speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister was significant because he did not reply to important matters asked for by the workers. We made the statement that in fact there was no appreciable consultation with the trade union movement in South Africa. There was in fact consultation by the Unemployment Insurance Board on which certain workers&#x2019; associations are represented, but in such an important matter as this it is surely the duty of the Government not only to consult that Board but to consult the trade union movement as a whole to find out what the workers really think about the matter. There are thousands of workers affected by this Bill and their voice should have been heard.</p>

<p>We were disappointed to note from the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister that no concrete steps were being proposed to combat the unemployment which is at the root of all this trouble. Here they come along with a little piece of legislative patchwork, for which the Minister himself cannot find justification enough, while unemployment is increasing, and the difficulty is becoming increasingly greater. The Minister remains quiet when he is asked for a comprehensive plan to save this fund. He did not say a word and did not give any reply in regard to the concrete suggestions made by this side of the House for strengthening that fund. It was suggested that it should be considered that the State, e.g., should increase its contributions, but we had no reply from the Minister. Why not? We hope we will still get a reply. There was not a word of criticism of the fantastic proposals of the hon. member for Krugersdorp, who said that expectant mothers should be excluded and that people who are sick in hospital should be excluded from the benefits of this fund, a suggestion that cries to high heaven, a scandalous suggestion!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>You know that they are not excluded.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>We know it was suggested that there should be something else in its place, but no concrete suggestion was made. It was emphasized that the expectant mother in South Africa and the sick people in the hospitals should be excluded from the benefits of the fund. We should like to know what the workers of South Africa will have to say about that.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that this plea of the United Party does not enjoy the support of the workers, that we are out of contact with the workers and do not know what they think. Let me give the hon. the Minister the assurance that the United Party, the official Opposition in this House, is in fact in contact not only with the ordinary worker but also with responsible workers&#x2019; organizations, and that we consult them, whereas the hon. the Minister has neglected to do so. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that he in fact took steps in regard to consulting the trade union movement. Our point is that he did not directly consult the responsible trade union organizations in the country. He obtained information secondhand, by means of the Unemployment Insurance Board. He read out the minutes of that Board and we were told what that Board had decided. I wonder where the hon. the Deputy Minister gets the right to give all those details? Because the information we get is that there was a special request to the members of that Board to keep quiet and to keep as a secret everything concerning the proposed amendments&#x2014;a request by the hon. the Deputy Minister, by the hon. the Minister and by the Government. They were asked to keep quiet and to say nothing about it. But here the Deputy Minister comes along and blurts out everything which was said at that meeting.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should perhaps mention this also. The Deputy Minister said that we in the United Party are now shedding crocodile tears about the curtailment of maternity benefits by means of this Bill, and then he said: Why does the United Party not put up candidates in the workers&#x2019; constituencies? Then we can see how much support they have from the <span class="col_4049-4050" refersTo="page_0651"/>workers. A short time ago there was a by-election in the important workers&#x2019; constituency Durban (Umbilo), and where did the National Party come in that constituency? There was a by-election in another constituency consisting mainly of workers, in Green Point, and where were the National Party and the Deputy Minister with their policy in that by-election? Quite recently there was a by-election in the part of East London where the workers live, where the new hon. member achieved such a great victory. Where was the National Party in that by-election?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>And what about Salt River?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Salt River. Where was the National Party in that important workers&#x2019; constituency? When it really comes to the workers of South Africa, they are afraid to put up candidates there. That constituency in East London is largely a workers&#x2019; area.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister did, however, admit that at the meeting of the Unemployment Insurance Board on 17 January the representatives of the T.U.C. expressed doubts in regard to certain portions of the legislation. They said that if there had to be amendments to the principal Act, it must come as part of one big comprehensive plan. Now, that is precisely what we on this side say, and when the hon. the Deputy Minister makes that admission he dare not, at the same time, say that there were no doubts or objections from the trade unions, and that no doubts were even expressed at the meetings of that board. It now appears that the position is still worse, that it is still more disquieting, namely that the workers&#x2019; representatives on that Unemployment Insurance Board withdrew their objections on condition that something would be done in regard to this matter which I have just mentioned. In other words, they did not withdraw their objections because they were satisfied with the Bill. The Deputy Minister says we are wrong when we say that this Bill is harsh and heartless. Mr. Speaker, the word &#x201C;Boer-hater&#x201D; is parliamentary, and I wonder whether the word &#x201C;worker-hater&#x201D; will also be parliamentary. In that case I accuse hon. members opposite of being worker-haters.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister says this measure is not too harsh. Ask the sick people in the hospitals. Ask the expectant mother. Ask those thousands and tens of thousands who will suffer under this Bill. They will tell the hon. the Minister whether the Bill is harsh or not. Ask the men who had to pay in so much in the past and who now see their benefits curtailed&#x2014;they are the people who can give the reply. The hon. member boasts of how much was given in the past, but now it is being taken away. There is an old Dutch adage which says &#x201C;eerst gegeven en weder genomen is erger als een dief gestolen&#x201D;, or &#x201C;first to give and then to take is worse than theft&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says we are wrong when we say that at the moment the State contributes only one-ninth to the revenue of the fund. That statement was made by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), and the Deputy Minister says it is quite wrong. It is very easy for him to go through the accounts of the fund, and he will then find the following: Let me give him the figures for 1960. In that year the total revenue of the Unemployment Insurance Fund was R8.10 million. In the same year the contributions by the State were R1.2 million&#x2014;one-ninth, as we said. Why then does the Deputy Minister criticize the hon. member for Kensington; where are his figures which can be compared with the figures of the Auditor-General? We should like to know where his figures come from.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the worker would have been deeply concerned if he had had to listen to the speech of the hon. member for Krugersdorp, who suggested that in future sick people should no longer receive benefits under this Act, and that they should now apply to the Department of Social Welfare; or that the women, who, in the past, received maternity benefits, should now apply to the Department of Social Welfare.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>They come along with vague suggestions before making concrete suggestions to give the worker alternative benefits.</p>

<p>The main object of this Bill is to save the Unemployment Insurance Fund from insolvency, and nobody will deny that it is necessary to do so. Such a fund becomes exhausted only when two things take place. The first is when actual abuses are committed in the administration of such a fund and in regard to the benefits they have. The second is where too much is paid out as compared with the income&#x2014;when more is paid out than is received; when more is paid out as the result of some serious emergency, when there is unemployment on such a scale that the fund loses millions of rand year after year. I do not believe, Sir, that enough proof was given, at least this afternoon, of abuses in the administration or in regard to the benefits paid by the fund. During recent years the unemployment increased by thousands, people who received benefits from this fund. Only a slight percentage of them abused this fund. The rest were genuine cases of unemployment, and I challenge the Deputy Minister to deny that. Mr. Speaker, there is only one reason why this fund is in trouble to-day, and there is only one reason for tampering with this legislation to do patchwork when patchwork can no longer remedy the matter. That reason is that unemployment is getting out of hand in South Africa.</p>

<p>There we have the <span class="col_4051-4052" refersTo="page_0652"/>mocking words of the Chief Whip opposite. Let us look at the facts. In 1955 4,200 White workers were registered as being unemployed in the unemployment offices. In 1962 it was 16,000&#x2014;it had quadrupled in seven years.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the percentage, and I should like to say something about it. There was an increase of 400 per cent within seven years. In regard to the total group, Coloureds, Whites and Asians, the increase between 1956 and 1962 was from 11,800 to 32,000. Does that not prove that unemployment in South Africa is getting out of hand?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely those are normal figures; you know that we cannot have 100 per cent employment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Nobody asks for 100 per cent employment. What we do ask is that unemployment should not increase by 400 per cent in seven years. What is particularly disquieting is that this increase is progressing fast; the curve rises year after year. Between 1960 and 1962 alone&#x2014;during the past two years&#x2014; there was an increase from 26,000 to 32,000, an increase of practically 25 per cent in two years. Is that not disquieting?</p>

<p>Sir, there are many factors influencing this unemployment. Those factors have to be dealt with, as other hon. members have correctly stated. There is, e.g., a slump in the building industry. The year before last the number of building plans decreased from R124,000,000 to R80,000,000. The summonses for debt, affecting the workers, reached the highest level in our history, viz. 600,000 per annum. Workers are summonsed for debt, and then they are still deprived of certain of their benefits by means of this Bill. Insolvencies have never been as many as they are to-day. And what do we find? We get a speech like that of the hon. member for Boksburg about which I want to say a few words.</p>

<p>Let us first accept that the number of unemployed increased by thousands during the past few years. Let us further accept that if there were abuses, they were responsible for only a small proportion of the increased payments. Then I ask the hon. member for Boksburg what right he has to talk in this House about people who receive benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund as being loafers, drunks, hoboes and parasites. Those are the words, Sir, which are recorded in Hansard as having been used by the hon. member for Boksburg. How dare he say that? This quadrupling of the number of unemployed which has caused a decrease in the fund is due to loafers, hoboes and parasites? Never before in the history of South Africa has such language been used in regard to the workers.</p>

<p>Sir, there is however one sentence in the speech of the hon. member with which I agree.He said: If unemployment is the result of economic and political factors over which the Government has no control, then this draining of the fund is justified. I will not say that these are factors over which the Government has no control, but I admit that he is correct in saying that there are economic and political factors in this country responsible for the increasing unemployment. On this side of the House we asked that the money of the fund should be invested in such a way that the rate of interest would be higher than is the case now. If the interest rate on the investments of the fund were higher, this legislation would not be necessary to-day.</p>

<p>We asked for it, and the hon. member for Boksburg asked for it, but the person who said &#x201C;no&#x201D; was the Deputy Minister, and it is he who is the responsible person in this case.</p>

<p>We so often hear the story that in fact there is full employment in South Africa and that the unemployment figure is only 2.8 per cent. That is the figure mentioned. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) and the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) are actually becoming excited over that figure. If one looks at the actual payments made by the fund, one sees that the total payments are much higher than the actual number registered in the unemployment office. We must remember that in this country there are only eight unemployment offices where workers can register, and all unemployed workers simply do not go there to be registered. For example, the woman who was formerly employed and who gives up her work does not always go to the office to be registered. She simply knows that there is no longer any work for her. In her despair she stops trying to obtain work. She is unemployed, but unfortunately she does not figure in the number of unemployed given by the Government. Two years ago the Government said that all unemployed above 60 in the case of women and above 65 in the case of men should no longer be included in the unemployed figure. The Government is busy&#x2014;I do not know whether &#x201C;cooking&#x201D; is parliamentary&#x2014;changing the figures so as to give the country a picture which is quite false.</p>

<p><span class="col_4053-4054" refersTo="page_0653"/>Let us rather see what was said by the Stellenbosch Economic Institute. This institute consists of prominent economists, and let us see what they found. They found, as has already been mentioned by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), that the figure of 2.8 per cent is quite unrealistic and that the real unemployment figure in our country is much higher. They mentioned the very points which we mentioned here. I should like the Minister, the Deputy Minister and the Government to study the report issued by Hupke and van den Berg, which was issued by the Economic Institute of Stellenbosch, and then the hon. members for Vryheid and Brits will be convinced that this 2.8 per cent they referred to gives a totally false picture of the actual unemployment in South Africa.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the hon. the Minister came here with a Bill and intimated that there had been a thorough investigation of all the circumstances.I even gained the impression that there had been a thorough actuarial investigation of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Of course, Sir, one does not come to this House with such legislation unless one has firm ground under one&#x2019;s feet and unless one has made a thorough study of such a fund. But now I just want to quote from the Third Report of the Select Committee on Public Accounts, the evidence the Committee had before it. It was issued in May 1961. In it the Secretary for Labour was asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Hannah, during 1952 the Select Committee of Public Accounts was supplied with an actuarial report in regard to the position of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. When last were you supplied with such a report?</block>

<p>The Secretary for Labour replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I just want to point out that there is no provision in the Act for an actuarial investigation of the fund. However, during January 1957 we consulted the actuaries in regard to certain proposals concerning an increase in the benefits &#x2026; On this occasion the actuaries informed my Department as follows:</block>

<block name="quote">It is not possible at this stage to give an exact estimate as to what the position will be as the result of the proposed scheme for benefits and contributions. It is difficult to make any definite suggestions as to what the gap between revenue and expenditure ought to be which at the moment ought to be aimed at.</block>

<p>And then the Secretary for Labour added this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The actuaries gave us practically no advice in regard to the actuarial basis of the fund.</block>

<p>That is still the position to-day. There is no factual actuarial knowledge in regard to the actuarial basis of the fund. It seems to me that the Government simply, when it felt like doing so, played politics with this fund, and announced some increases before elections, and now it is again taking away the benefits after the election which were granted in the past.</p>

<p>We have shown how this fund to-day does not even have its book value. Its book value this year is R10,000,000 higher than its actual value. If that fund were to be liquidated today, the workers of South Africa would receive R10,000,000 less than they actually paid in and what came in as interest in the past. That is the valuation of the fund given by the Auditor-General, and surely the hon. the Minister will not quarrel with that. The book value is R126.3 million, but the market value is R115.7 million. Why? One reason for it, is of course because the rate of interest paid to the workers on their money is so much lower than what is paid in many other cases. The rate of interest is between 3 per cent and 4 per cent&#x2014;I think on an average it is about <i>3&#x00BD;</i> per cent, whereas on a fund like the Superannuation Fund of the S.A. Railways 4&#x00BD; per cent is paid. But the workers of South Africa, apart from the Railways, are paid a mere 3&#x00BD; per cent on their funds.</p>

<p>I regard this Bill as a poor measure. In the first place it is patchwork. The hon. the Minister himself does not know how great is the defect he has to remedy; he does not realize how big the hole is that he has to close. Now he comes along with patchwork. He hits the innocent worker harder than the guilty one. This Bill breaks faith with the contributors of the past. They contributed on the basis of one week&#x2019;s benefits for four weeks&#x2019; hard work. Now they must work hard for six weeks before they can receive one week&#x2019;s benefits. Hon. members talk about emergencies; have we not heard enough about emergencies during the past few years? Must we still be told about an emergency today? Do we exist on emergencies in this country of ours? The answer is to create work, to follow a sound policy. Therefore, Sir, I hope that all this big talk we hear in regard to the Orange River plan will be turned into deeds. I say that in the years ahead employment will be needed for tens of thousands of people. The sooner the Government turns its words into deeds, the better it will be for the country. Those who are chronically ill are hard hit. Short time is being excluded to a large extent. That, as we have shown, can lead to greater unemployment. In times when there is supposed to be full employment, as we had for a few years in the past, these benefits are paid out, but when there is unemployment on a large scale the benefits are curtailed. The Government is prepared to give the worker of South Africa an umbrella when the sun shines. but when it <span class="col_4055-4056" refersTo="page_0654"/>rains he is deprived of that umbrella. It is clear that patchwork is being done. I feel it is necessary that an investigation should be made by an independent committee of financial experts in regard to the fund and its operation. The Unemployment Insurance Board is doing good work; they deal with appeals and cases arising from the administration of the Act, but when it comes to recommending the practical steps which are necessary in this regard, then financial experts of the highest standing are required. That is why we accuse the Government of having failed to consult the workers and having failed to take the steps which are necesary on a broad basis to see to it that the future of the workers of South Africa is assured.</p>

There was a time when it was customary for aristocratic people not to weep at funerals themselves; they used to hire mourners. These two hon. members give me the impression that they are two hired mourners for people who, according to them, want to weep but are ashamed to do so. Listening to the arguments which have been advanced here by the hon. member for Orange Grove, one can only throw up one&#x2019;s hands in despair and ask where he got hold of all those things.

<p>I want to say this to the hon. member for Orange Grove that if it had depended on the United Party there would have been no unemployment insurance fund in South Africa. [Interjections.] Yes, Mr. Speaker, they did establish it in 1946 and they made a mess of it. You will recall, Sir, that the Act was passed here in 1946 and Dr. Colin Steyn then had to suspend the operation of the Act. Pressure was brought to bear on him by the workers and he caused an investigation to be instituted. The result of that investigation was that in 1949 the present Minister of Transport had to amend the working of the whole Act and put through a new measure to make unemployment insurance practicable.</p>

<p>Of all people the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) comes here this afternoon and tells us what a strong Fund the United Party had built up. I wonder if the hon. member knows that this Fund only stood at about &#x00A3;15,000,000 in 1948 and in 1949. When the Minister introduced these amendments it stood at &#x00A3;21,000,000, in other words, R42,000,000 as against something like R120,000,000 to-day. Where does he get hold of this story that the United Party left a very strong Fund for the National Party to carry on with? Here I have the speech of the then Minister of Labour. He stated clearly that it was impossible to administer the Act which they had passed in 1946. He had to revise the whole Act and to make it capable of implementation. That was done by the Minister in 1949. In 1952, when this Fund had become fairly strong already, the United Party came along and said: &#x201C;Look, we do not need an unemployment insurance fund in South Africa. We want to convert it into a pension fund. We want to give financial assistance out of this fund to people who have never contributed to it.&#x201D; As far as I recall they introduced a motion to that effect in this House. And then they are the people who come and tell us today that we should do this and that we should do that and that we should give additional benefits to the workers under this Fund. If it had depended on them and if they had governed the country there would no longer have been an unemployment insurance fund in South Africa.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I had pointed out that if the United Party had been in power there would no longer have been an unemployment insurance fund because they wanted to use the Fund for other purposes. I had pointed out that in 1949 the Fund stood at &#x00A3;21,000,000 and that by 1951 it had been built up to &#x00A3;43,000,000 under this Government. The United Party makes a great song about the fact that we are now trying to place this fund on a solvent basis, but I want to prove that if they had been in power there would no longer have been a fund. And let me say that the hon. member for Orange Grove, who<span class="col_4057-4058" refersTo="page_0655"/> spoke just before me, is one of the people who issued pamphlets describing how their labour charter would work, which would have swallowed the whole of this Fund, and as far as I know these pamphlets were distributed in every constituency during the 1953 election. The late Mr. Tighy dealt with this whole matter in this House in 1952 under the Labour Vote. He asked for the half-hour, and amongst other things he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I now want to turn to what we will do when we are in power again, what our charter is for the workers if we are returned to power. The United Party will change the Unemployment Insurance Fund into an unemployment fund as well as a pension fund&#x2026;. We will change it so that thousands of workers who contribute to it and never receive benefits from it will be able to receive benefits commensurate with their contributions, so that when they retire they will receive a decent pension apart from any means test&#x2026;. May I point out that last year the Fund had already reached an amount of &#x00A3;43,000,00&#x2026;. There are many other cases. We give the assurance to the workers that we have a way and a plan which will see to it that they will not only be insured against unemployment but also against old age and that they will not have to make do with the small old age pension, but will be able to live on a decent pension for which they themselves worked&#x2026;.</block>

<p>All this sounds very fine, but they wanted to use the Fund to do what Mr. Tighy described here; and they made use of this throughout the country during the 1953 election. In my constituency they went so far as to go to the railwaymen, the permanent staff, who all had pensionable service, and to say to them, &#x201C;When you go on pension, you will each receive a minimum of &#x00A3;16 per month under our labour charter, apart from your Railway pension&#x201D;. That was extremely irresponsible on the part of the United Party, and to this day they have not yet renounced that policy.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says, &#x201C;What is wrong with that?&#x201D; There is everything wrong with it to want to use this money that was paid in by a specific group of people, for the benefit of people who have made no contribution to the fund. But that is what they want to do. The hon. member must not come and shed crocodile tears about a fund which they themselves wanted to wipe out. It is perfectly clear from their speeches in the course of this debate that they would still prefer to wipe out this fund as long as they can derive some political benefit from it. As far as I recall it was in the course of that debate in 1952 that Minister Schoeman said that he would feel safer if this fund, which Mr. Tighy said was already so big, stood at &#x00A3;100,000,000, instead of &#x00A3;43,000,000 which was the figure at that time, and I am inclined to agree with him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove has also done another thing here. He says that the United Party proposed that the State should increase its contribution to this fund. I want to ask him when they put forward that proposal? Was it in this debate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<p>But they said it for the first time in this debate. The Minister has not yet replied but already they are saying that he refuses to do so. [Interjections.] The Minister said that he would reply to this point. The hon. member for Orange Grove says that the United Party consults the workers. He says, &#x201C;Go and ask the sick and the expectant mothers what they think of this terrible step that the Government is taking&#x201D;. I want to ask him whether any <i>bona fide</i> worker who becomes ill loses his benefits under this fund. Let him tell us whether persons who are actually sick and who are <i>bona fide</i> workers will lose their benefits under this Bill. Not a single one. And what expectant mother who was in employment when she became pregnant is going to lose her benefits? Not a single one. And then they talk about abuses. Sir, there are many members who are afraid to say what is going on to-day; I am not afraid to do so. I have had cases in my constituency where people have asked me to find employment for their wives, and I have done so, and later on when you ask the husband how his wife is getting on in that job, he tells you that she is in the maternity home. It becomes perfectly clear then that woman was expecting a baby before she came to seek employment. There is not a single member in this House who can deny that is what is happening and that there are misuses taking place every day.</p>

<p>Why does the Minister not know about it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister is fully aware of it. I want to ask the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) whether he would assist a woman to obtain employment so that she can draw benefits if he knows that she is pregnant. Judging by the way he talks he would gladly do so, because they want to destroy this fund just as they are trying to destroy everything in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove went on to say that there had been a big increase in unemployment from 12,000 to 31,000 and he mentioned the building industry in particular. I want to remind him that it was in fact one of his party associates, a prominent economist and financier, the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) who said that there was excessive building in South Africa, that there was excessive<span class="col_4059-4060" refersTo="page_0656"/> building activity, and that those funds should rather be invested in other avenues&#x2014; and there is a good deal to be said for that. But let me say this to the hon. member that he cannot mention the name of one big city where there has not been excessive building as far as middle-class and higher-class residences and offices are concerned. We cannot allow people to build if those buildings are going to stand empty. That has always been the position in the building industry. I am closely associated with this type of business. For a certain period there is an excessive amount of building and then people discover that they have been erecting too many buildings; then there is a slack period until there is evidence again of a shortage of accommodation; they then start building again and soon there is excessive building once again. That is a natural cycle that we find in the building industry.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove has also said that the interest on the Fund&#x2019;s money should be increased. Again I want to ask the hon. member when they suggested that. They suggested it in the course of this debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>And they suggested it after the hon. member for Boksburg had mentioned here that the rate of interest should be increased and that would add a considerable amount to the income of the fund. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has said to-day that if that happens there will be a deficit of R1.4 million in the fund, but as usual the hon. member does not know what he is talking about. He says that this year the fund shows a deficit of R3,000,000. The deficit over the past year was R5.8 million; the hon. member can look at the report of the Select Committee on his table.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Here I have the report of the Auditor-General.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the previous year&#x2019;s report. After the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, the report of the Select Committee came out, in which there is a record of the evidence of the Secretary for Labour. The Select Committee&#x2019;s report covers the period up to 31 December 1961, whereas the report that he used goes as far as 31 December 1960. As far as this fund is concerned I want to say that it was only last year that the Government reviewed the question of investing at current rates of interest State pension funds which had always been invested at a fixed rate of interest, and of doing the same thing in the case of the other funds. We all feel in this House that this matter should receive serious consideration, but this is not a matter out of which one should try to score a political debating point. The United Party never gave this matter a thought until they heard that the Government had already done this in the case of the Public Service pension funds, but now they want us to believe that this is a new idea of theirs.</p>

<p>With regard to unemployment, I just want to point out to hon. members that of the 31,000 unemployed&#x2014;the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) mentioned the figures the other day&#x2014;there are only 8,700 women, and of them, 70 per cent are not <i>bona fide</i> work-seekers. There is only a small percentage of the female workers, 30 per cent or 2,400, who are <i>bona fide</i> unemployed. The hon. member for Orange Grove talked about an actuarial assessment and he made a great song about the fact that one had not been made recently.I wonder why the hon. member does not read the documents which are at his disposal and which he ought to read as a member of the Select Committee on Public Accounts, because then he would know what the position is. [Interjections.] The fact of the matter is that no actuary can actuarily assess a short-term fund and say precisely what the contributions ought to be. He can make an approximate estimate and say that if there is 2 per cent unemployment, the contribution should be so much, and if there is 4 per cent unemployment it should be so much. Such a calculation was made in 1951-2 and percentages were given there. Working on those percentages I think we are safe under all circumstances. If the unemployment figure is 10 per cent, such and such a percentage of the fund will be used every year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Then the fund will be insolvent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>If there is 10 per cent unemployment then of course it will be insolvent but we only have 2.39 per cent unemployment, and in all industrial countries that is regarded as full employment&#x2014;and South Africa is an industrial country, whether hon. members want to admit it or not. South Africa is the biggest industrial country on this Continent. Our unemployment figure of 2.39 per cent is even lower than the figure that is regarded as full employment, namely 2.5 per cent. I want to submit therefore that with an unemployment position which is normal, taken on the basis of full employment, this fund is not in a position to meet its ordinary current expenditure, and it was for that reason that the Select Committee said that this matter must be reviewed. In America they have an unemployment Act which provides that unemployment up to 6 per cent will be regarded as a normal phenomenon, and if it exceeds 6 per cent it will be regarded as abnormal, as serious unemployment; they then proclaim those parts of the country where the unemployment figure exceeds 6 per cent as areas in which there is serious unemployment and certain provisions of the Act then come into force. America is divided into 150 unemployment regions, and last year 76, or more than half of them, were proclaimed as regions in which there was serious unemployment exceeding 6 per cent. I mention this to show how healthy our position <span class="col_4061-4062" refersTo="page_0657"/>is by comparison. We use our funds so liberally to help people and the contributions to the fund are so small that even with this small amount of unemployment the fund cannot carry the burden. When one looks at the income of the fund to-day, it is perfectly clear that it cannot carry more than 1&#x00BD; per cent unemployment without a capital loss.</p>

It was in these circumstances that the Select Committee passed its resolution last year. I shall come to it in a moment. I just want to examine the position of the fund for a moment.</p>

<p>In 1961 the fund paid out to sick persons R3.3 million, to mothers R2.575 million and to dependants under the 1957 Act R637,000.</p>

<p>What does that prove?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>This is expenditure on benefits other than purely unemployment benefits, and the total amount is a little more than R6,000,000. In 1957 the income of the fund dropped. The contributions to the fund were decreased by 25 per cent and, simultaneously, the benefits paid by the fund were considerably increased and new benefits were added. I think that is where the fault lies. The total income of the fund in 1961 was R11,199,000. Of that amount R4,875,000 was interest. In other words, the contributions to the fund only amounted to R6,324,000. As against this, there was an expenditure of more than R16,000,000. That is the position that we had to meet, and the hon. member for Orange Grove agreed that the position should be met, and that is why he voted for the resolution that we passed in the Select Committee. The hon. member agreed that the position of the fund must be rectified. He voted for that resolution. Here I just want to quote the evidence that was given on 19 March of this year before the Select Committee by the Secretary for Labour, in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In accordance with the Resolution of the Select Committee on Public Accounts, 1961, the Unemployment Insurance Board examined the position of the fund, and, after consultation with the State actuaries, the Board submitted certain proposals to the Government with the object of wiping out the losses of the fund. These proposals fall into two categories, namely (a) increased contributions by the workers, employers and the State and (b) amendments of the law which would tighten the conditions in regard to the drawing of benefits in order to give effect to the original intention of the Act, namely to assist contributors during any period of temporary unemployment.</block>

<p>He goes on to mention that the deficit in the fund for the year concerned was R5,810,000. Here we have what was recommended by the Unemployment Insurance Board to give effect to the resolution of the Select Committee that was accepted by the Government. But the United Party, which is the father of this Act and of the Unemployment Insurance Board, refuses to accept their recommendations because they want to exploit this matter for political purposes. The hon. member for Orange Grove is supposed to know much better than the Insurance Board what has to be done to rectify the position. He is supposed to be the expert, and he wants this problem to be solved in such a way that he can use it for political propaganda. But I say that what they are moving here is a motion of no confidence in the Insurance Board.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was rather glad when the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) got up to take part in the debate, because I thought that he, with his wide and long experience, would make a contribution towards solving the problem of unemployment, but the hon. member failed to do so. I take it that he did not do so for good reasons and, therefore, I cannot blame him, but where I do blame him is that he certainly did not treat the case put by the United Party on its merits. I think the United Party&#x2019;s case is clear. We say this Bill interferes with the rights and privileges of the workers, and the United Party does not stand alone in this attitude. The Minister knows that two deputations that I know of have seen him about this matter, workers&#x2019; deputations. The hon. member for Pretoria (Central), who said that we were playing at politics, surely does not suggest that we are playing at politics in this House, and that the people who went to see the Minister also played at politics. The Deputy Minister said, however, that the United Party&#x2019;s case was a case which only they advocated. Surely he does not suggest that the workers who went to see the Minister were not also on our side. They feel exactly the way the United Party feels about the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member says they are United Party supporters. The hon. member may be perfectly correct, but I have<span class="col_4063-4064" refersTo="page_0658"/> always had a great deal of respect for the intelligence of the workers. Hon. members tried to deal with the Bill from one angle only. They say everything is attributable to abuse, and all that the Minister wants to accomplish with the Bill is to put an end to those abuses. But surely hon. members know that the main object of this Bill is to stabilize this fund again. Do they allege that the stripping of the fund is only attributable to abuses? If it cannot be attributed to abuses alone, surely it seems as though the Bill is interfering with the benefits of workers, and that is exactly the point we are making. The Minister said clearly in his speech that there were very definite reasons why the fund had become weak, and he said clearly that one of those reasons was the fact that abuses had taken place. He said clearly, however, that the main reason was the increased unemployment, and that, to my mind, remains the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>When you consider this matter, Sir, hon. members have to admit two things. Firstly, they have to admit that unemployment is the root of the trouble and secondly, they have to admit that this Bill interferes with the benefits of the workers. In that case they should go further and tell us that they want to interfere with those benefits or that they do not want to do so. And if they do not want to do so, they ought to support the amendment of the United Party.</p>

<p>Another charge has been levelled against us and that is that we are really the enemies of the workers. Hon. members opposite level that charge against us while at the same time eulogizing the original Unemployment Insurance Act. Who introduced that Act? Surely hon. members know that it was the United Party and why should they have introduced that Act had they not thought that it would be in the interests of the workers? Hon. members may say that they have improved the Act. We do not dispute that. I admit that the Nationalist Party have improved the Act and I give them credit for that, but something which you cannot argue away, Sir, is the fact that the idea which underlies that Act is a sound one, the idea to promote the interests of the workers and the United Party gave shape to that idea.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that the six clauses of this Bill have one main objective only. The Minister has said that and that is to place the fund in a sound financial position. There is no doubt about it that the fund should be kept sound. We do not differ there but where we do differ from hon. members opposite is in respect of the method to be employed to keep the Fund sound. I think the easiest way to strengthen the Fund once again is to increase the contributions to the Fund and the Minister himself has said that the Insurance Board had recommended, in the first place, that the contributions should be increased but the Minister said that he did not think that was practicable. Apart from saying that, he did not enlighten us any further. He did not tell us why he did not think it was practicable and I do not think it is unreasonable on my part to ask him this question: Why can that not be done at this stage, why must we wait? As things are at the moment, Sir, you can only come to one conclusion and that is that the Minister does not wish to place the burden of an increased contribution on the shoulders of the Government. If that is the reason the Minister ought to say it candidly to the House.</p>

<p>Various steps can be taken to strengthen the Fund, but what I find strange is that the first step which the Minister is taking is not taken at the expense of the Government or of the employers, but at the expense of the worker. He is the person who is called upon to make the first sacrifice, the person who is hardest hit when there is unemployment. We on this side of the House have stated very clearly that we were quite prepared to assist the Government to put an end to abuses in a proper manner, but that we thought it was unreasonable that the worker should be the first victim, the first one to suffer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>But you say no abuses are taking place, do you not?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We do not say that abuses do not take place but we do say that hon. members go out of their way to accentuate those abuses because they do not want to admit that this legislation is interfering with the rights of the worker. Which method is the Minister employing first? Firstly, the worker is told that he will have to contribute to the Fund for six weeks so as to enjoy benefits for one week. Apart from the fact that it will take the worker much longer in future to build up credit, I submit, with respect, that there is another side to the picture as well. I may be wrong, but I think that the greater the degree of unemployment, the greater are the chances of becoming unemployed and the more difficult it is to find employment and the quicker the worker should be able to build up his credit. Apparently the Minister does not believe that because he is reverting to the former basis of building up credit at the very time when it is difficult to find employment and at a time when the chances of becoming unemployed are very great. The Minister should have left the position as it was. In that event the worker would have been able to afford it.</p>

<p>I want to touch upon a second matter, because certain people have brought it specifically to our notice and that is the question of the maternity grants which women may lose. A great deal has been said about that in this House and various members have said that the Fund was not intended for that type of thing; they say that there ought to be other funds to provide maternity grants. Superficially that sounds logical, but the first point to remember is that these people are already enjoying those benefits, and even if they agreed that there should be another fund for that, I want to know from hon. members opposite why they<span class="col_4065-4066" refersTo="page_0659"/>do not first establish such a fund before they deprive the women of those rights. I think that is the real point. Nobody will find fault with it if hon. members opposite said that they were going to take away the maternity grants but that they would establish another fund simultaneously under which the women could draw similar benefits. If they do that nobody will argue with them. They talk about funds which may be established, but while doing so they are really in the process of harming the female workers of South Africa. I think that the interference with the rights of workers is one of the most unreasonable aspects of this Bill, and hon. members opposite ought to admit that. Mr. Speaker, unemployment is a disease, a disease which to my mind hits the worker very hard, not only economically but also spiritually when the unemployment is on a sufficiently large scale. When this matter is discussed it is so easy to say that there is 2&#x00BD; per cent or 3 per cent or 2 per cent unemployment but the crux of the matter is this: Is the worker, that worker who walks in the street without a job, assured that his interests are being taken care of? I represent a constituency where the unemployed person comes to me every day and I know that in spite of the fact that he draws benefits under the Fund he goes hungry. Reference has been made to the increased benefits which are being paid under this Fund. True those benefits have been increased, Sir, but do you think that increase has kept pace with the increase in the cost of living? Do you think that anybody can live decently, even temporarily on the benefits which he receives under the Fund? I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that if you approached the workers to-day and asked them whether they wanted their contributions to the Fund to be increased or whether their benefits should be curtailed, they would say that they would rather pay increased contributions and that they did not want their meagre benefits diminished. I think that is the basis on which the matter should be approached. It is not a matter of playing at politics. It seems to me as though hon. members opposite think they have a monopoly as far as sympathy for the workers is concerned. I think we are making a big mistake when we say that a particular party is the worker&#x2019;s friend. It should not be necessary for the worker to have to depend on friendship. He is a full-fledged citizen of South Africa and as such it is the duty of this House to look after his interests just as the interests of any citizen of this country are being looked after. That is why I say Mr. Speaker, that it ought not to be necessary for any party to say that it is the worker&#x2019;s friend. The worker is an important citizen of South Africa and we are making a big mistake in singling him out as a specific type of person who has to depend on friendship for certain benefits.</p>

<p>It is significant, Sir, that for the third or fourth time in this debate there has not been one Government member able or willing to stand up to defend his Government against the charges which have been made by this side of the House. One simple charge which has been made by this side of the House is that the Bill before the House is a Bill which will deprive the workers of South Africa of the benefits due to them in terms of the contributions they have made to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Of the speakers who have spoken opposite not a single one has denied that fundamental issue. Not a single one has denied that this measure which we are discussing at the moment is a measure which will deprive the workers of South Africa of benefits to which they were previously entitled. The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) has juggled with figures, but while he was on his feet as their so-called financial expert, why did he not answer the charge of this side of the House that the Government should do something about the interest which it pays on the Unemployment Insurance Fund money. This Government is using that money, the money of the workers of South Africa. We said that if this Fund required money why did the Government not raise the rate of interest to a realistic level. Why did the chairman of the Select Committee on Public Accounts not deal with that issue?</p>

<p>That is an interesting fact. The hon. member sitting behind him must have heard him whispering to himself because I listened very carefully to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech and he said nothing at all about the interest rate which the Government was paying on the money of South Africa&#x2019;s workers. They are using that money; why cannot they pay a decent rate of interest on it? We have not had one single argument from a single member allegedly representing workers&#x2019; constituencies in this country, as to why it is necessary to take away these specific benefits. All we have had, in fact, Mr. Speaker, was the hon. the Deputy Minister calling the unemployed workers of South Africa hoboes. He said that it was his job to prevent this fund from becoming a &#x201C;hobo&#x201D; fund. He said, &#x201C;Ons moet sorg dat dit nie &#x2019;n hobo-fonds word nie&#x201D;. He said that this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, the implication of that statement is that the unemployed drawing benefits from that fund are hoboes. [Interjections.] It is not nonsense, Sir. If you say that this measure is to prevent the fund from becoming a hobo fund, you are saying that it is in the process of becoming a hobo fund. Let them squeal, Sir. They squeal now because of the irresponsible words which slipped out, words which really reflect what they think. When they are trying to defend their Minister when he is in an indefensible position and when the hon. the Deputy Minister himself implies that the unemployed of South Africa are hoboes, that is all very well. I promise the hon. member that when I go back to report to the unemployed in my constituency I will tell them that this<span class="col_4067-4068" refersTo="page_0660"/>Deputy Minister has called them hoboes. [Interjections.] Yes, the unemployment office happens to be in my constituency in Durban, and unlike those hon. members I sometimes go and visit it. I see the queues and I talk to those people who are unemployed. I talk to those people who stand in the queue for hour after hour to draw their pittance, the pittance which those members want to take away from them. Hon. members opposite have not done what I have done; they have not talked to the unemployed to whom they refer as hoboes. I wish to place on record here in this House that those men are not hoboes. They are decent South African citizens, as decent as any member on that side of the House. Most of them, through no fault of their own, are not sitting in this House, but are unemployed. They claim their rights, the rights which they have earned with their own contributions which they have paid week after week, year in and year out, into the fund. They regard that fund as their insurance against misfortune. Here this Government comes and tampers with those rights and benefits, benefits which they have earned by their contributions. Yet, not a single hon. member opposite has got up to defend the workers and the unemployed in his own constituency. Instead they call them hoboes.</p>

<p>I will tell the hon. member why I was elected. I was elected because I have an interest in the welfare of the workers in my constituency, which is more than he has. We have asked this Government to deny that rights are being taken from the unemployed. I want to make this charge, and I make it in all seriousness, that the Minister is creating in this country a new class of people, a class of people whom he is deliberately and consciously throwing to the mercy of charity in South Africa. He is creating a new class of people who are too young for old-age pension, who are too fit for disability grants, but who are perhaps too old in the eyes of potential employers. He is creating a class of people, Sir, for whom there is no recourse to any Government aid whatsoever. Through the foresight of the United Party, we have developed over the years security for the workers and their dependants in South Africa; we have disability grants, we have old-age pensions, we have workmen&#x2019;s compensation and we have unemployment insurance. It is a field which covers the workers of South Africa against misfortune. Now the hon. the Minister is creating a gap, a gulf, between those benefits into which he is prepared to throw all those who cannot, either because of their age or because of sickness, qualify for State assistance. He is debarring the man of 55 or 58 or 59, who may not be as fit as he was, in terms of this amendment, from unemployment insurance benefits unless he has worked for a fixed period in any particular year. He is driving that man into the arms of charity. He is saying to him: &#x201C;We, the Government, are not interested in your welfare. You are too young for old-age pension; you are too fit for disability grants. You cannot get a job for 13 weeks in one year and therefore you cannot draw unemployment insurance.&#x201D; [Interjections.] The only unemployed things my hon. friend from the Bush-veld over there has, are goats and sheep. He is trying to poke his nose into a debate which affects the workers of the cities of South Africa. This legislation does not apply to his part of the world. I say, and the Minister cannot deny it, that he is creating a vacuum into which thousands of South African workers are going to fall. He is going to place a load upon the charities of South Africa to help those people in their difficulties. People will be thrown on to the streets because they cannot pay their rents. Yet they will not be able to go to the very fund to which they have contributed in order to claim the benefits which they have bought for up to 16 years by their recontributions. What sympathy do we get for the mothers of South Africa who are forced to work? [Interjections.] Yes, laugh! That is their concern, Mr. Speaker, for the working mothers of South Africa, the mothers who this Government has forced to go to work, because it could not raise the economic standards of our people sufficiently for the husband to earn enough to keep his family. This Government has forced those mothers to work. No mother wants to work. No mother of her own free will will desert her children to go to work. She goes to work, Sir, because she is forced to do so in order to supplement the family income, because she has got to do so in order to feed her children and clothe them. And what do we get? An hon. member over there interjected at the beginning of this debate and said. &#x201C;Not cost of living; cost of high living&#x201D;. The laughter which we get now is the concern which they have for the mother who is forced to work. The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) also only has goats in his constituency. He is disinterested in the people he has forced into unemployment. He should go to an urban constituency; he should listen to the tales&#x2014;the genuine tales&#x2014;of trouble which families have to face. Mothers are forced, because of desertion by their husbands or because of the illness of their husbands, to go out to work<span class="col_4069-4070" refersTo="page_0661"/>and to earn a living and to feed their children. And what sympathy do they get? Laughter and jeers and contempt from a Government in whose hands their welfare rests. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that these cuts in the benefits were necessary in order to eliminate abuse.</p>

<p>I will ask the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) in a moment whether that is true or not. Last year on 7 February that same Deputy Minister introduced an amendment to this same Act, an amending Bill to close the loopholes of abuse. He said&#x2014;</p>

<p>I now want to ask the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark whether the hon. the Deputy Minister was talking tripe last year as usual? In other words was that one big bluff? Was that amendment which he introduced, in fact, not an amendment to prevent abuse?</p>

<p>What is the point?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>My point is this: If there are still abuses, then that Bill which we attacked last year was not intended, and failed, to prevent abuse, in which case the Deputy Minister must admit failure. He must admit that he introduced an amending Bill to close the loon-holes and that he must come to us a year later and admit that he has failed to close the loopholes. What are the loopholes? The same loopholes which this Bill before us at the moment claims to be closing. Either the measure of last year failed or it was a bluff: it was not intended to close loopholes. It was intended to penalize contributors to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. It was one or the other. It must be one or the other. It was either meant to close the loopholes and it failed or it was not meant to close the loopholes and therefore we have this measure today before us.</p>

<p>Hon. members on that side of the House, speaking on the same debate last year&#x2014;the hon. the Deputy Minister himself&#x2014;dealt with the abuses and listed them for three and a half columns&#x2014;the abuses which were taking place and which he wanted to prevent. Tonight he was challenged by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) and others to mention the abuses and he could think of only one little abuse; one abuse with which he dealt last year and which he claimed last year would be prevented by his amending Bill. Then he said he would have to ask the Unemployment Insurance Board. They will tell us what the abuses are. The Minister is in charge of the Bill and he does not even know the abuses he claims he is preventing. He has to refer to his own board!</p>

The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) came off his perch to tell us that maternity grants should never have been granted under this Fund, because it was against the principle of unemployment insurance. I want to ask him and the Minister: Is a woman who is unemployed because of pregnancy, less unemployed than one who loses her job for another reason?</p>

<p>Let the hon. the Minister tell us then what provision the State is making for the person who is so important as the hon. member has just indicated.

That hon. member laughed with his colleagues. They called it the &#x201C;konynbeleid&#x201D;; they called it the &#x201C;breeding policy&#x201D;. I ask him now to join with us in pleading with the Government to establish those benefits. The hon. member has pleaded for benefits. I now ask the Government, before this Bill is passed, to announce the steps which they intend taking to help the working mothers who are having babies. I ask that, Mr. Speaker, because their own members demand it. Not only us, but their own members demand it. If they do not announce those steps we are entitled to say to the working mothers of South Africa that this Government is disinterested in their welfare and is disinterested as to what is going to happen to their contributions to that fund. The hon. member for Krugersdorp also excluded sickness as one of the benefits which should be paid from the unemployment insurance fund. He said that did not belong there. Again, Mr. Speaker, does he regard a person who, through illness, is unable to work as less<span class="col_4071-4072" refersTo="page_0662"/>entitled to the protection of the State than the man who loses his job for another reason?</p>

It removes security from the workers of South Africa. Unilaterally it takes protection away from them, from mothers, from people who are ill and from people who cannot get employment for 13 weeks out of 52. Therefore this Government is prepared to say to those people: &#x201C;We are not interested in insuring you.&#x201D; If the Government were interested it would place something in place of these benefits before it took them away.

And the Minister says they are not sworn to secrecy. The Deputy Minister quoted the minutes of one meeting. He himself admitted that there were 11 meetings of that committee. Why did he only quote from the minutes of one meeting? When he was challenged from this side of the House to go further he said &#x201C;That is all I have in front of me&#x201D;. When he was asked to quote certain other things which had taken place he said &#x201C;I have only this particular page of the minutes with me&#x201D;. He could not elaborate. He could not give the other details. What about the other ten meetings? I now want to go further and want to ask the hon. the Minister what promise was made to the trade union delegates at the meeting whose minutes were quoted here, in order to get them to withdraw their recorded opposition to this Bill? They recorded opposition to the Bill. It was placed on record, and <span class="col_4073-4074" refersTo="page_0663"/>on a proposal duly seconded, they withdrew those objections. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us what happened at that meeting immediately prior to the withdrawal of their objections. What promise was made to them? [Interjections.] I am not the Minister. I have not got the minutes. I want to know from the hon. the Minister what bait was dangled in front of those delegates. I ask him to deny further that they were told: &#x201C;Here is a fund which must be strengthened. You have to accept some measure of strengthening the fund financially.&#x201D; They were not given the option of asking the Government to increase its contribution to the fund. They were not given the option of increasing the Government&#x2019;s interest rates on the use of that money. They were not given any other option. They were told that out of the workers&#x2019; contributions and the benefits paid the fund has to be balanced. In other words, they were given Hobson&#x2019;s choice. They were told &#x201C;either you have to increase the contributions by members or you have to reduce the benefits.&#x201D; There was no other alternative. If there were why has the Deputy Minister or the Minister or any Government member not given to this House the other alternatives put forward. They said the fund had to be strengthened and that was the best way to do it. But in point of fact they knew that the Unemployment Insurance Board had a simple choice between increasing contributions or reducing benefits. There was no other choice before the Board. I want to know what bait was dangled in front of them, what promises were made, in order to get them to withdraw their objection to this Bill.</p>

<p>Finally I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has given any undertaking that these recommendations to him, these objections to the Bill, would be considered by the Unemployment Insurance Board before this Bill became law and whether in fact, we are now having a sham debate. The Minister himself has given an undertaking that this matter will be reconsidered by the Unemployment Insurance Board. If it should come to him with an alternative proposal, he would have bound this House in principle in accepting the second reading knowing at the same time that he has promised reconsideration to the Trade Union Council. Is that how this House is treated Sir? Are we to continue with the debate when the Minister himself has referred the subject of this debate back to the Unemployment Insurance Board? It is a serious situation, Mr. Speaker. It is a serious situation when this House is treated with contempt. Hon. members laugh; we know they are not interested. I am asking the hon. the Minister now to tell us whether he is treating the Trade Union Council with contempt or is he treating this House with contempt? Because either he was serious when he said that these recommendations would be reconsidered, in which case he is treating the House with contempt, or he was not serious, in which case he in bluffing the Trade Union Council, he is bluffing the workers and he intends to go ahead irrespective of any reconsideration which may take place. But he must tell this House whom he is misleading in regard to reconsideration. He must tell us whether this debate is in fact the final decision on principle or whether there is still an opening for reconsideration. The hon. the Minister himself said there was no secrecy in this matter. Therefore I have every right to quote him what has happened and to ask him to tell this House about it. I ask him finally to tell this House by what right is he justified in depriving working mothers of rights, in forcing people to obtain employment or forfeiting their benefits no matter how long they have contributed and no matter what period is to their credit and in infringing those rights for which people have already contributed. Until the hon. the Minister can satisfy this House and the workers of South Africa, we on this side of the House are entitled to say that the Government is neglecting the interests of the workers and we will oppose this Bill when it comes to a decision.</p>

<p>I think I should deal at once with the remarks of the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) in regard to a deputation that came to see me. It is true that a deputation of the T.U.C. came to see me and another deputation from the garment workers also saw me about this Bill. They alleged that they had not been properly consulted. I pointed out to them that they had a representative on the Unemployment Insurance Board and that any decision taken by the Board had been taken with the approval of their representative. The representative himself was present at this interview with me, and it is true that he pointed out to me that any discussions which had taken place on the Board he had regarded as confidential. But I immediately put the point to him that if he was the representative of the trade union, then whatever was discussed in the Board, it was his duty to tell the body which had nominated him on that Board, and it appeared to me also that they may have been fully alive to the provisions contained in the Bill after the discussion I had with them.</p>

<p>They made two requests to me. The first was that I should withdraw this Bill to give them a further opportunity of going into the implications of the Bill, the second was, that if I could not withdraw the Bill I should send it to a Select Committee. I refused both requests. In the first instance I said that it was quite impossible for any responsible Minister to withdraw a Bill which was already halfway through its second reading and which represented government policy. Secondly I stated that I was not prepared to send it to a Select Committee, either before or after the second reading, because I was quite certain that a Select Committee could not give me any information additional to what I had already received. I was guided naturally by the investigation by the Unemployment Insurance Board. They had been considering this matter for a long period of time; they had consultations with the people <span class="col_4075-4076" refersTo="page_0664"/>who were concerned and interested in it; they had representatives, as I said just now, of the trade unions which were interested, and they had these long drawn-out investigations. As a result of those investigations the recommendation was made that an amending Bill should be introduced in terms which they propose. So that it seems to me that as far as the trade unions are concerned, they had ample opportunity of making their voice heard. But I did give this undertaking to them: I said that apparently there were two main points about which they were mainly concerned; the one was the question of maternity benefits and the other was the question of short time. Those were really the two features of the Bill which they were most concerned about. I said this to them: After listening to your representations, I am perfectly willing to refer those representations to the Unemployment Insurance Board to see what their reaction is, and in order to enable that to be done, I would in due course ask for a period of time between the second reading and the Committee Stage so that I would have an opportunity of hearing from the Unemployment Insurance Board as to what their reaction was to this difficulty. I pointed out at the same time that once the second reading had been taken, certain principles in the Bill could not be altered, but that in the Committee Stage questions of administration might be considered; there might be the question of giving the Minister a discretion in certain matters, and I said that I would be prepared to consider such proposals, but obviously in Committee of the Whole House the principles could not be altered. They understood that and accepted it. That is how the matter stands as far as the representations of these trade unions are concerned, and I ask hon. members whether that is fair or not.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t know. I was not present at the discussions in the Board.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I deal with certain points raised by hon. members, let me just say that I owe the House an apology for not being present this afternoon when certain speeches were made. I was unavoidably detained in the Other Place and I could not come here to listen to those speeches, but the Deputy Minister was here and he made a note of what was said.</p>

<p>At the outset I must express my disappointment at the irresponsible nature of the attack on this Bill by the Opposition. Of course I admit that an Opposition is entitled to be irresponsible, but I don&#x2019;t think they should be recklessly irresponsible. I made it quite clear in my opening remarks when I introduced the second reading of this Bill that it was a serious attempt to comply with a recommendation of the Public Accounts Select Committee, and that it was a serious endeavour to try to put a stop to certain abuses which were partly responsible (only partly) for the unfavourable turn in the financial position of the Fund. Now certain hon. members have asked: What were these abuses? Well, if I have time I will give hon. members the details of a long list I have here. The list consists of almost ten foolscap pages. but let me get on to the more serious aspects of this Bill first. As I say, it was an endeavour to put a stop to certain abuses which had taken place and which were responsible partly for the unfavourable downward trend of the Insurance Fund and that these proposals have had the unanimous support of the Unemployment Insurance Board, on which the principal employers&#x2019; organizations and the trade unions were represented. I want to emphasize that.</p>

<p>What was the response of the Opposition? I say that they made a reprehensible attempt to make political capital out of the interests of the workers, sometimes carried to ridiculous extremes. We had the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) in what I would call his most mischievous mood. He was in his best melodramatic form. He appealed to his back-benchers for applause, but apparently they themselves had very little stomach for this type of attack on a Bill primarily designed to protect the interests of genuine workers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I deal with the individual members of the Opposition (I am going to deal with some of them), I should like to refer to some of the mistaken ideas which critics of the Bill hold. First of all let me deal with <span class="col_4077-4078" refersTo="page_0665"/>the argument that was advanced by the hon. member for Yeoville particularly, that the Unemployment Insurance Act is in effect an insurance contract. I reject this proposition at once. There is no analogy between an Act of Parliament and a private contract.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Every Act &#x00F8;f Parliament affects the daily life of one or other group of our citizens, and government would become impossible if the principle were to be accepted that an Act of Parliament which creates rights and privileges could never be amended. Mr. Speaker, it is fundamental to the principle of Parliamentary government that Parliament has an absolute right to amend the laws of the country as and when they consider it in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>Let me deal with another misconception raised by hon. members in the Opposition, and that is that the Unemployment Insurance Fund only belongs to the workers and that they, and they only, have an absolute right to dispose of it. Even if this argument were correct, I have the approval of the workers&#x2019; representatives for the contents of the Bill through their representation on the Board. But leaving that argument aside, this has been a matter I find that has been raised before, and it was disposed of by my predecessor, the present Minister of the Interior, in a debate in this House on 27 June 1959. Senator de Klerk said this (Hansard, Col. 9351)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;I want to discuss the idea which has arisen and which has been mentioned here to the effect that the Unemployment Insurance Fund is a fund for the workers alone. That is of course completely wrong and is not in accordance with the facts. May I, just to prove my point, quote a few figures relating to contributions made to the Fund. Since the Fund was established in 1946, the employees have contributed a total amount of &#x00A3;23,000,000, and the employers have contributed &#x00A3;25,000,000. while contributions by the state have totalled &#x00A3;20,000,000. If we add to this total &#x00A3;18,000,000 in interest on the investment this gives us a final total of &#x00A3;86,000,000. The idea therefore that this is a fund which belongs to the workers alone is not correct.</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but it is not their fund. I am simply making the point that this is not a fund which belongs to the workers alone. It is a fund to which the employers and the state contribute very substantially. The position to-day is exactly the same, except that the figures quoted by Senator de Klerk have increased. Of course I readily admit that the workers have a very vital interest in the Fund, but I think I should put this matter in its true perspective. It is quite true that the sole object of the Fund is to help the workers.I admit that. But the Fund does not belong exclusively to the workers. The other contributors, that is the state and the employer, who together contribute the bulk of the Fund, also surely has a say and should have a very real say in the administration of the Fund.</p>

<p>I think I should also like to say a word about the relationship between contributions and benefits. One has heard a lot of loose talk about workers being entitled to withdraw their money out of the Fund. Let me assure the House that the amount a worker could withdraw if this request were acceded to, would be very small indeed. Take for instance Group 8, which is the wage group of R1,170 to R1,326 per annum. The worker&#x2019;s rate of contribution is 8 cents per week or R4.16 per year. So if the worker contributes for ten years and is the allowed to take his contributions out, he will draw only R41.60.</p>

<p>Plus interest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Actually when he is unemployed he draws this amount in just over four weeks at the rate of R9.80 per week, and if he is unemployed for any length of time, he draws many times his own contributions. Mr. Speaker, this Unemployment Fund is not a savings or an investment fund. It would be wrong for the worker to look for a financial return from his contributions to the Fund, and indeed I am certain that genuine workers appreciate that the man or woman who has never need to call on the Fund is extremely fortunate. These workers, we all know, are the backbone of our industrial development in this country; they gladly contribute to the Fund to assist those who are less fortunate than they are. The claim that &#x201C;this is our fund, let me draw my money&#x201D; does not come from the workers. It comes from a sense of political frustration on the part of Opposition politicians who cannot or will not realize that the workers of South Africa would prefer to be left alone to themselves to work out their own salvation.</p>

<p>A great deal was also made by Opposition members of the alleged effect of the Bill on those who are either too old or too sick to work. Mr. Speaker, however great one&#x2019;s sympathy might be for those people who are ill and who are getting old, it is neither fair nor practical to expect the Unemployment Insurance Fund to carry that burden. It is not meant to do that. This Government has in my submission given ample proof of its desire to alleviate hardship, as witnessed by the increase in the old age pensions which were recently announced by my colleague, the Minister of Finance. I think I would be failing in my duty and the Unemployment Insurance Board would also be failing in its duty, a duty which they owe to the workers <span class="col_4079-4080" refersTo="page_0666"/>of South Africa, if we did not reject the conception of the Unemployment Insurance Fund as an old age relief fund or a sickness insurance fund or a charitable fund. It is none of these things. It is nothing more or less than a fund designed to help the workers over periods of temporary unemployment. Old age pensioners who have cased to work, married women who have left employment to become housewives and the chronic sick who can no longer work, in fact all those who have ceased to be workers, must be looked after by other organizations and not this Unemployment Insurance Fund. These people cannot be carried by the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and that was the basic principle behind the original Act of 1946, and the amendments now proposed are simply designed to correct some of the anomalies which if not corrected now, must lead to a serious depletion of the Fund at the expense of its ability to fulfil its primary purpose.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question I dealt with already, the deputations which interviewed me, and I want to repeat that I could not agree with the contention that the representatives of those unions, one or more, who sit on the Unemployment Insurance Board, should treat any matter which he hears there as confidential. I told the deputation that, because, as I have already said, the representative is there as the representative of that particular body and it is his duty to report back to that body what proposals are afoot. I want to say this that if the Unemployment Insurance Board is prepared to amend or alter any of their recommendations which are not against the principles of this Bill, and as long as they do not involve any departure of government policy, I do not feel that I should substitute for the Board&#x2019;s proposals suggestions made by other bodies which have no statutory responsibility in this matter. But if the Board wishes to modify any of their recommendations, and it may well be that there are good reasons to do so, then I shall consider those proposals in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to come back to the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant), and the hon. member for Orange Gove. These hon. members made great play with their talk of punishing the workers (these were the words they used) and they say: Why punish the innocent with the guilty? For myself and this side of the House, I repudiate any suggestion that there is any thought of punishment in this Bill. Neither the Government, nor the Nationalist Party initiated this measure. It came from the Unemployment Insurance Board. It was drawn up by the body which is responsible as a result of the inquiry by the Select Committee on Public Accounts.</p>

<p>It was drawn up by the body responsible for advising me on all matters connected with the administration of the Fund, and I don&#x2019;t think it would be out of place for me to congratulate the Board on their sensible approach to a serious problem and on their firmness of purpose in dealing with this problem. It is a difficult problem. Unlike hon. members opposite, the Unemployment Insurance Board is a representative and responsible body, and of course it represents all the people who are concerned in the matter; it represents the employers, the workers and the State.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of the points raised by hon. members can be dealt with in Committee Stage as matters of detail.</p>

<p>I would like, however, to say a word or two about the reference to the difficulty experience by workers in their fifties who become unemployed. I think the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) raised that question as did also the hon. member for Durban-Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). My department is only too well aware of the fact that men without specific qualifications, particularly our clerical workers, who lose their employment at any age after 55, find it most difficult to obtain employment. We know that. On the other hand, the Unemployment Insurance Fund cannot be used as a permanent means for subsistence for persons who are no longer in the labour market.</p>

<p>That is not the object of the Fund. The object of the Fund is to tide them over temporary unemployment. The provisions of the new paragraph (m) which are introduced by Clause 3 (b) are designed to prevent this happening. The effect of the paragraph is that a contributor who becomes and remains genuinely unemployed will draw benefits without question for a period of six months. Thereafter the Board can in terms of Section 39 (3) of the Act authorize the payment of further benefits for an unlimited period. So hon. members will see at once that the genuine work-seeker has nothing to fear from this new provision which does not interfere in any way with the Board&#x2019;s powers to extend the initial period of six months during which benefits are payable. That period can be extended. Incidentally any contributor who draws unemployment benefits for 12 months gets far more out of the Fund than they ever paid into it, as hon. members appreciate. Take the contributor in Group 8 again who has contributed continuously since 1947 when the Unemployment Benefit Act came into operation. He contributes at the present rate 8 cents per week. In 20 years he contributes a total of R83.20. If unemployed for 12 months, he draws R519.60, more than six times what he has paid in. That is how it should be.</p>

<p>I am trying to make the point what they draw out of the Fund if they were allowed to withdraw their contributions; it is nowhere in proportion to what they draw in unemployment insurance over a period of 12 months.</p>

<p>Several hon. members have raised the question of the investment of this Unemployment Insurance Fund. I believe this afternoon, when I was not here, the matter was raised by the hon. member for Kensington and the hon. member for Houghton, and they pleaded that this Unemployment Insurance Fund should be invested to better effect. I would like to give hon. members a statement showing how this fund is invested. This is a question, I understand, that has been raised for years, and I would like to have it on record now of what this investment really means. As hon. members know there is a provision in the Act which stipulates that surplus moneys shall be deposited with the public debt commissioners for investment, and some hon. members asked how they invest the money. The effect of this requirement is that such funds are normally used to purchase Government stock. The Fund at present holds stock to the value of R121,000,000. This amount has of course been accumulated over a period of some years. Interest rates were very unfavourable when the first Unemployment Benefit Fund was set up in 1937. Consequently the Fund at present holds an appreciable amount of stock at low rates of interest, and the following are examples of some of the Government stock at present held by the Fund, which may be of some interest to hon. members. I give the redemption dates first, then the nominal value and then the interest rate, and I give round figures:</p>

<p>1957-62: Stock of just over R2,000,000 at 2&#x215D;per cent.</p>

<p>1963-8: over R5,000,000 at 2 per cent; 1960-70: more than R6,000,000 at 3 per cent; 1959-69: more than R5.000,000 at 3 per cent; 1965-7: more than R8,000,000 at 3&#x00BC; per cent; 1963-6: more than R7,000,000 at 3&#x00BC; per cent; 1964-7: more than R7,000,000 at 4 per cent; 1957: more than R7,000,000 at 4&#x00BE; percent; and 1978: more than R6,000,000 at 5&#x00BC; per cent. Hon. members will, therefore, see that the average rate of interest is 3.813 per cent. This average rises every year as old sock at low rates of interest is redeemed and new stock purchased at the ruling higher rates of interest. It will be observed that the rate of interest on the stock which was last purchased is, accordingly, 5&#x00BC; per cent. It should also be pointed out that the Fund holds very little money on call. Most of the money was used years ago to purchase Government stock. This stock can be realized at par when it falls due for redemption, and is then re-invested in stock bearing higher rates of interest. Generally speaking, it would not be advantageous for the Fund to sell low-interest stock at a loss if a buyer could be found, in order to reinvest. This, however, is a matter on which the public debt commissioners are best able to advise. I, however, want to give an example of what they did recently. They recently sold 3&#x00BD; per cent, stock for just over R3,000,000 which resulted in a book loss of R112,000. With the proceeds, however, they bought stock for more than R3,000,000 bearing interest at 51 per cent. Taking all factors into consideration, the public debt commissioners calculate that the end result will be a net gain to the Fund of a sum of R96,000 by 1 February 1965&#x2014;apart from the advantage of having obtained a large holding of 51 per cent stock. It is, therefore, felt that on balance the present system of investing funds through the public debt commissioners, should not be disturbed and in saying this I bear in mind the point made by the hon. member for Houghton, namely that we have to be careful as to how we invest the moneys in this Fund. This should be done in gilt-edge. It is a very important Fund and we should therefore be very careful. The tendency seems to be that investment is made on short-term rather than on long-term stock because one never knows when there will be a call on the Fund.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they sold stock which was invested at 3&#x00BD; per cent in order to re-invest it in stocks bearing an interest rate of 5&#x215E; per cent. As I pointed out, the Fund in the end will make a profit of R96,000.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister whether if a capital loss is made, it is written off as a loss, and what the position is if stock is bought well below par? Is the defference in due course accounted for as profit?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I will give that information to hon. members when the House is in Committee on the Bill. That is a pertinent question and I will, therefore, obtain the information. The information I have given above, ought to satisfy hon. members that every care is being taken to invest moneys in this Fund to the best advantage.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant). He is not present tonight, but he informed me before hand that <span class="col_4083-4084" refersTo="page_0668"/>he would not be present. I think, however, that I should make some reference to some of the remarks he made when he participated in this debate. He is the man who claims to have fathered more than 22,000 babies during the past 12 months! He admitted, however, that he had some assistance from his colleagues! Not only did he say this, but he went on to say that they had maintained a consistent record in this regard over the past four years. Mr. Speaker, if any proof was needed for my allegation that the opposition to this Bill was rather artificial, the matter is clinched by the suggestion of the hon. member for Turffontein that South Africa did not need an immigration policy but that we only needed to increase the maternity benefits. That was his argument. But the hon. member conveniently overlooked the fact that maternity benefits are payable to all races either under the Unemployment Insurance Act or under the Factories, Machinery and Building Work Act. Well, quite a number of the babies for whom he claims political fatherhood, were non-Europeans! The whole tone of the references of that non. member to maternity allowances, was, I think, misplaced. Does he seriously suggest that working women have babies solely in order to be able to draw some money from the Unemployment Insurance Fund? I hope not, because such a suggestion would reveal an attitude of mind towards working mothers which, I am sure, will be repudiated by every member in this House. I can only reiterate that the whole object of this provision is to help working mothers who are temporarily unemployed during and after their pregnancy. Hon. members talk about not wanting our women to work. Are they prepared to go a step further and to prohibit married women from working? Why should they not be logical and suggest this? Hon. members know, as well as I do, that the working woman is making a valuable contribution to our economy and what is more, this can be said right throughout the civilized world. My attitude in this regard is a realistic one. We know that married women will go on working and we will ensure that the Fund, which is designed to help them, will not be used for other purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, the hon. member for Turffontein accused me of being inaccurate in regard to the year from which the Fund first showed a deficit. I told the House that the Fund had shown a deficit from 1959 onwards. The hon. member quoted the report of the Controller and Auditor-General as authority for a statement that a deficit had been reflected in this Fund since 1957. I wish to point out that when that hon. member purports to set himself up as a financial authority, he should at least make sure that he has studied his documents properly. I find that the relevant passage of the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report does not deal with the Fund&#x2019;s income and expenditure account, but with the difference between the total contributions and the expenditure on benefits. That is something quite different from a deficit on the overall operation of the Fund.</p>

<p>There is a further point which is of interest and with which I wish to deal, namely the point raised by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) in regard to the question of having an actuarial assessment of the Fund. The hon. member referred to the report of the Select Committee on Public Accounts in which the Secretary for Labour is reported as having been asked certain questions and to which that official replied to the effect that there was no provision in the Act for any actuarial investigation of the Fund and that in 1957 the actuaries gave the Department no actuarial advice regarding the Fund. That is quite correct. The hon. member for Orange Grove, however, showed that he did not fully appreciate the position when he suggested that an actuarial investigation of the Fund should be made. That, I think, is quite impossible. The Government actuaries have assured the Department time and again that it was not possible to base an actuarial report on unemployment insurance because future unemployment could not be actuarily calculated. That is, apparently, something quite outside any actuarial science. The only advice we have ever had from the actuaries was that they strongly recommended that we should build up a strong fund. This is what we have done.</p>

<p>This Bill has been very fully debated and I do not, therefore, think it is necessary for me to deal with any further points. Arguments from that side of the House were met by arguments from this side of the House and there is really nothing more for me to add. I, therefore, now move that the Bill be read a second time.</p>

<p>Eighth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Post Office Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>

<p>This amending Bill contains two clauses, both of which have the same objective. Society observes this principle that when a person causes another person to suffer damage, the person who has caused the damage has to accept the responsibility for it. That is a basic principle. If I change the course of a stream of water on my property thereby causing damage to my neighbour, I am responsible for the damage which he suffers. If I dig a hole on my property which will cause the house of my neighbour to collapse I am responsible for the damage. That is a basic principle of our legal system which is recognized as such in Section 83 of the Post Office Act. It often happens that a city council lays out streets and roads and erven and the post office lays telephone wires and cables. If the same city council changes its roads, streets and erven with the result that the post office cables have to be relaid, it is only right that the urban authority should bear the costs. Strangely enough there is an exception to this rule in the case of provincial and divisional councils. If a provincial or divisional council changes a road, they may build it right across the telephone wires and cables of the post office and in that case the post office has to relay those wires at its own expense. That is the exception to the general rule, namely that the body responsible for the damage does not bear the costs but that the costs are borne by the body suffering the damage. That is in conflict with the general legal principle which forms the basis of our entire legal system. Some time ago it happened that the Government had to build a dam in a ravine and in that way obstructed the provincial council road which ran through that ravine. The provincial council concerned was obliged to build another road at a very high cost and it was obliged to bear that cost itself. This principle is not right; in other words it is not right that the body which causes the damage should not be responsible for it. The opposite is more reasonable, namely that the body which has caused the damage, should also be responsible for it. In the case of the dam to which I have referred, the provincial administration concerned was not only obliged to build another road, but it has to construct a high bridge as well. Consequently the provincial administration sustained severe losses. It was on that occasion that the provincial council came to a full realization of the injustice of this rule and approached the Government with the request that the Government should see to it that the ordinary legal principle should also be observed in those cases, namely that the body who has caused the damage should also bear the costs. The Government then decided that where it constructed a dam with the result that the course of a provincial road has to be altered, the Government should bear the costs of the new road. Furthermore it was decided that if the principle applied in respect of actions by the Government, it should also apply in respect of actions by the provincial councils and divisional councils; In other words, if a provincial council deviates a road with the result that the post office has to change its cables, the provincial council or the divisional council concerned, as the case may be, should carry the costs. That is after all the general principle which is basic to our legal system, namely that a person or body who causes the damage, should also accept responsibility for the costs of restoring that damage. So far Sections 83 and 108 of the Post Office Act have provided for an exception to this sensible principle, but the object of this amending Bill is to do away with this exception and to make the ordinary legal principle applicable. That is the only matter which this amending Bill deals with.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Basically this Bill contains much more than what the hon. the Minister told us it contained. Basically, it tries to do away with an entrenched custom and a well established privilege of provincial councils and in view of this, we, on this side of the House, cannot let it pass without subjecting it to the closest scrutiny. What is, in fact, happening here, Mr. Speaker? At present <span class="col_4087-4088" refersTo="page_0670"/>the position is that when a provincial or divisional council builds a road, or a school, or a hospital, it, more often than not, becomes necessary for some telephone lines to be removed in the process. They have to be removed to facilitate the provision of a worthy cause, such as roads, a sorely needed hospital or a much needed school. The position up to now has been that the provincial council or divisional council was not called upon to pay for such displacement of telephone wires or poles. On the contrary, the cost therefore was borne by the post office. It is not so that the post office did not obtain a <i>quid pro quo,</i> or no compensation for the cost it bore for the removal of the wiring in question. The position, after all, is that the new roads will be used by post office vans without it having to pay any contribution towards their upkeep. What is more, these roads provide an essential access to telegraph and telephone lines, an access which is needed when these lines have to be reached for repairs. Furthermore, the post office is often entitled to make use of servitudes attached to land used by provincial councils or the divisional council, in order to lay telephone lines of erect poles. Even when the building of a new school or hospital involves the rerouting of cables, the post office is often handsomely rewarded for that work by virtue of the new business which results therefrom.</p>

<p>I regard this Bill as being an unwarranted infringement upon the rights of the provinces. Parliament is jealous of its own rights and liberties; it should be equally jealous of the rights and liberties of lesser bodies, such as divisional and provincial councils especially in view of the fact that these bodies have no voice in this House. It is, therefore, our duty to act as guardian of their rights and privileges. We have to be their protectors. We shall not leave provincial and divisional councils naked and voiceless in the face of this attack. We particularly deplore the extensive powers which are being granted to the hon. the Minister in this amending Bill. The Minister is being given the supreme power to decide whether a provincial road or building makes the removal of a line or cable necessary. I realize that the original Post Office Act provided that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If, in the opinion of the Postmaster-General, it is necessary at any time subsequent to the construction of any telegraph line or any pipe, tunnel or tube, to alter or remove the same owing to the work of any local authority or person, that local authority or person will have to pay.</block>

<p>Now, however, the powers of the Minister are being extended in that he will in future have the same power over provincial and divisional councils. This prompts me to put my first important question, namely to what extent were the divisional and provincial councils actually consulted in regard to this Bill? If consultation has, in fact, taken place, we should like to know with whom, when, where and how such consultation took place. Our information is that whatever consultation there has been, was of a very sketchy nature, and that provincial and divisional councils had, in fact, been presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> It was not a question of telling them that they could take it or leave it, but of saying to them that they could take it, or else! Surely, Sir, in a matter such as this consultation is of the very essence, and it was essential that provincial and divisional councils should have been consulted at the very highest level.</p>

<p>Did the hon. member consult the provincial and divisional councils in order to oppose this Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am very happy to reply to that hon. member that we have people with whom we can consult, people with a knowledge of provincial matters. [Interjections]. Amongst them there are responsible provincial councillors, also members serving on the Divisional Council Congress of the Cape, people who in the past had served on executive committees of provincial councils. There are people, very responsible people in the provincial and divisional councils who are concerned about what is happening, and who are concerned about not having been properly consulted in this issue. If the Department of Bantu Administration and Development were to build a road through the Transkei to connect, say, Basutoland with the coast, involving the relaying of telephone lines and cables, the post office would, no doubt, pay the Transkeian Territorial Authority any cost involved in this relaying, but if the provincial council of the Cape, of the Transvaal, or Natal built a road, the provincial council concerned would have to pay.</p>
