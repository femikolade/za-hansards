<p>asked the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether the information required to be furnished by the South African Broadcasting Corporation in its annual report in terms of Section 24 of the Broadcasting Act, particularly under paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of sub-section (1), is still made available to Members of Parliament in the detailed form in which it was furnished in the report for 1959; if not, why not; if so,</li>

<li>(2) whether he will lay upon the Table schedules of these particulars in respect of 1960; and</li>

<ol>

<li>(1). (2) and (3) Since the inception of the S.A.B.C. in 1936 the annual report of its Board of Governors has been printed to a more or less fixed pattern, but in 1959 more detailed information than usual was incorporated. Legal advice is at present being obtained to ascertain whether the particulars in the customary annual report meet all the requirements of Section 24 of the Broadcasting Act and, if necessary, the Corporation will take steps to rectify the matter.</li>

<heading>Negotiations under General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs</heading>

<question by="#cronje" to="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<num>*III.</num>

<from>Dr. CRONJE</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to reports in the Press and on the radio that South Africa is party to an agreement with the United States of America and members of the European Economic Community involving a reduction in duty on motor cars and other manufactured goods; and</li>

<li>(2)

<ol>

<li>(a) what commodities are involved so far as South Africa is concerned in respect of imports and exports, respectively, and</li>

<li>(b) what are the tariff reductions agreed to in respect of these commodities.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#cronje">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li><p>(1) Yes. The Press and radio reports were, however, not quite accurate. South Africa is not a direct party to an agreement between the U.S.A. and members of the European Economic Community.</p>

<p>In terms of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, provision was made for tariff negotiations, which commenced during 1960&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) to afford members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the opportunity of amending previously concluded tariff concessions in terms of Article XXVIII of the General Agreement;</li>

<li>(b) to allow members of the European Economic Community to re-negotiate in terms of Article XXIV (6) of the General Agreement their respective individual tariff concessions to other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on the basis of the combined external tariff of the Community;</li>

<li>(c) to allow the members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to conduct mutual negotiations in respect of the decrease of customs tariffs, i.e. new tariff concessions. This phase of the negotiations is known as the Dillon round; and</li>

<li><p>(d) to afford applicants the opportunity of conducting tariff negotiations with a view to entering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

<p>South Africa directly participated in the discussions mentioned under fa) and (b). firstly, with a view to securing releases from tariff concessions to which it is committed under the General Agreement in order that new or increased tariff protection may be granted or promised to existing and prospective domestic manufacturers and, secondly, in an endeavour to retain, as far as possible, in the combined external tariff of the European Economic Community the tariff concessions which the individual member states of the Community had initially negotiated with South Africa under the Agreement;</p></li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2)

<ol>

<li>(a) particulars of the commodities which were involved at the above-mentioned negotiations between the other contracting parties to the General Agreement are not yet available, and (b) in regard to the tariff concessions which were granted during the negotiations between the other contracting parties to the General Agreement, including the United States of America and the European Economic Community, it must be pointed out that any such concessions will, in accordance with the most favoured-nation principles of the General Agreement, automatically be applicable to South African goods exported to the relative countries.</li>

<question by="#bronkhorst" to="#minister_of_defence">

<num>*VI.</num>

<from>Brig. BRONKHORST (for Mr. Ross)</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<p>Whether the Royal Durban Light Infantry, Royal Natal Carbineers, Imperial Light Horse and Rand Light Infantry regiments were informed that the appointments of their Honorary Colonels-in-Chief had lapsed; if so, on what date; and, if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#bronkhorst">

<from>The MINISTER OF LABOUR:</from>

<p>No. The Government accepted it as obvious that the Royal Colonelcies-in-Chief had automatically lapsed with effect from 31 May 1961, when South Africa became a Republic outside the Commonwealth, in the same way as other regimental associations with the British Crown and it was not considered necessary to notify the units concerned in writing.</p>

<p>This matter was raised with the appropriate authorities during my visit to the United Kingdom last year and they shared our view that the Colonelcies-in-Chief had lapsed.</p>

<heading>Commandos with the Same Names as Cemeteries</heading>

<question by="#bronkhorst" to="#minister_of_defence">

<num>*VII.</num>

<from>Brig. BRONKHORST (for Mr. Ross)</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports of the names given to the English-speaking Commandos to be established on the Witwatersrand and that two of the names, West Park and Primrose, are also the names of the new cemetery in Johannesburg and the cemetery in Germiston, respectively; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will consider having the names of these two Commandos changed; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#bronkhorst">

<from>The MINISTER OF LABOUR:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li><p>(2) No. The principle in the allocation of designations to Commandos is that the name should be an indication of the suburb, town, city or area from which the Commando draws its members. In the case of the West Park Commando, &#x201C;Johannesburg West&#x201D; would have been the only other designation. There is, however, already an Afrikaans-medium Commando so named. With regard to the Primrose Commando, it has the same recruiting area as the existing Germiston Commando, namely, the Magisterial districts of Germiston and Alberton. It is expected that Germiston will supply the majority of members for the English-medium Commando and as Primrose is one of the biggest suburbs of Germiston and is, moreover, an English nomen, it was decided on this designation.</p>

<p>In explanation it may be mentioned that there are also Afrikaans-medium Commandos named after a town or city where the cemetery bears the same name, e.g. Bloemfontein Commando (which is one of our most active Commandos) and Bloemfontein Cemetery.</p></li>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports of a demonstration held outside his Pretoria offices on 7 March 1962; and</li>

<li>(2) whether, as reported, officials of his Department attempted to prevent newspaper reporters from reporting the demonstration; if so, on whose authority.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_indian_affairs" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) No. In fact, reports of the demonstration and photographs of the eight female and two male demonstrators who came over from Johannesburg under the leadership of the Chairman of the Transvaal Indian Congress, were published in several newspapers. Despite the fact that they neither asked for, nor obtained, permission to demonstrate in the passages of a public office, they were not immediately asked to leave. When, however, their behaviour became offensive and they started using abusive language and causing obstruction in the the passages after I, and the Indian leaders whom I met in Pretoria had arrived, they were, on the authority of the Secretary for Indian Affairs, requested to leave the building.</li>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) No.</li>

<li><p>(3) I quoted from a photostatic copy of a document submitted to the Committee of Inquiry into Separate Beach Amenities by a firm of attorneys at Knysna on instruction of their clients.</p>

<p>From the document I quoted, the paragraph under the heading &#x201C;The Suggested Solution&#x201D; reads as follows:</p>

<p>&#x201C;What then is the solution? It is obvious that the Coloured people resident in this area are entitled by natural right to access to the sea at a suitable beach or beaches. We are not, therefore, instructed to request that Noetzi be retained as a beach for the exclusive use of the White population. For a great many years, in fact as long as living memory can recall, there has been an unwritten mutual agreement between the Whites and the Coloureds in terms whereof the eastern end of the Noetzi beach, beyond the mouth of the Noetzi river, has been used by Coloured people and the western side by White people. We can see no logical reason why this state of affairs should not be preserved and given the force of law by proclamation. In support of this suggestion, we would ask you to consider the following points:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Noetzi beach is some 700 yards across from the east to west, and, therefore, is quite wide enough to render subdivision an easy matter.</li>

<li>(b) The selection of the river mouth as the boundary between the two sections would create a natural dividing line.&#x201D;</li></ol>

<p>The committee conducted a hearing in public and the relevant document could, therefore, be freely obtained by the Press. It is not for me to decide on the publication thereof.</p></li>

<li><p>(4) I wish to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to a statement which I made and which appeared in two local newspapers towards the end of last week.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I wish to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to the fact that, according to Mrs. Todd&#x2019;s letter, they were in Knysna on 20 December 1961.</p>

<heading>EXTERMINATION OF SEALS AND FISH-EATING SEA-BIRDS</heading>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>In moving the motion which stands in my name on the Order Paper, I should like, with the leave of the House, briefly to outline the historical background to this motion. This is not a sudden caprice; this is a matter which for many years has been receiving the attention of people who take a great interest in the protection of our supplies of fish and rock lobster in the sea with a view to expanding our important fishing industry.</p>

<p>It is only natural that the first people who noticed the devouring of fish and rock lobster <span class="col_2715-2716" refersTo="page_1374"/>by seals and predatory sea-birds were the people who had spent a life-time on the sea catching fish and rock lobster in order to make a living out of the sea. The observations of these people are of the utmost importance because although their approach is not always scientific, they speak as eye-witnesses as the result of personal experience and careful observation. It would be a great loss to our scientific research in these problems if we simply dismissed as fishermen&#x2019;s stories these people&#x2019;s estimates, observations and experience. Let me proceed at once therefore to move my motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider urgent measures for the extermination of seals and at least the most voracious fish-eating sea-birds, such as the various types of cormorants, in order to protect and develop our flourishing fish and rock lobster industries.</block>

<p>As far back as 1934, 28 years ago, the Board of Trade and Industries, because of the widespread complaints of people who were concerned with the fishing industry, obtained the views of the then Director of Fisheries. He submitted evidence to the Board and expressed the considered opinion that seals and sea-birds in particular were devouring a very large quantity of fish and sea-foods. The findings of the Board are recorded in the Board of Trade and Industries Report No. 180, 1934, pages 75 to 76, para. 346. The finding of the Board at that time was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, it cannot be denied that a vast amount of fish is consumed by sea-birds. The Director of Fisheries estimates that there are about 20,000,000 duikers along our coast and that they devour about 8,000,000 tons of fish, or about 300 times more than the total quantity of fish landed by the fishing industry.</block>

<p>It must be remembered that our fish and rock lobster industry has expanded enormously since 1934, as I shall show later on, and that the ratio between what the sea-birds devour and the catches brought ashore by fishermen has naturally changed considerably. The Board of Trade and Industries recommended at the time that proper investigations should be instituted along our coast to determine on a scientific basis the extent to which fish and rock lobster were being plundered. This matter received little attention and in 1953 and 1954 ex-Senator Pettersen, who had spent a long life at sea in the fishing industry, the man who had built and used the first whaling station in Southern Africa, made use of these figures which had been provided by the then Director of Fisheries, first by way of a question and then by way of a motion in the Other Place, in order pertinently to draw the Government&#x2019;s attention to this matter. The motion of the hon. Senator Pettersen, which was unanimously accepted by the Other Place in June 1954, read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to investigate the effect on sea-food sources of various fish-eating birds and animals and the advisability of taking steps to exterminate such birds and animals.</block>

<p>As the result of this motion and the strong reaction in favour of it, which was described in a subsequent report as having had a cool reception from the then Minister, the Fisheries Division of the Department of Commerce and Industries began to institute investigations and published their first report on these predatory sea-birds in 1955, a report drawn up by (later doctor) A. H. Davies.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that although in certain official and interested circles the allegation of the hon. ex-Senator is referred to in a rather sneering and disparaging way as grossly exaggerated, it must be remembered that the hon. ex-Senator was speaking in the first place from a life-long experience but that he based his estimates on the findings of the Director of Fisheries whom he could rightly regard as reasonably authoritative. Secondly, it is to the credit of ex-Senator Pettersen that in taking this action he induced the authorities to institute investigations, investigations which are being proceeded with. We already have three publications, in the shape of reports from the Department of Commerce and Industries, about the activities of these predatory birds, namely reports No. 18 of 1955, No. 23 of 1956 and No. 31 of 1958. The Division of Fisheries also started to investigate the eating habits of the seal, particularly the pelt seal, and to determine the numbers and the quantity of fish and other sea-food devoured by them. These findings are to be found in the publications of the Department on the Cape Pelt Seal, No. 21 of 1956 and No. 34 of 1959. In this case the reports were drawn up by Mr. R. W. Rand, M.Sc.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that everyone in this country who is interested in the growth of our fish and rock lobster industries and in the protection of our fish and rock lobster supplies, is very greatly indebted to the Department for this work and for these reports. We are very deeply indebted to the persons who conducted these investigations. They dug up extremely valuable and often thoroughly scientific data which are of the very greatest importance to the fish and rock lobster industries. If therefore I may be permitted later on in the course of my speech to be somewhat critical of these reports as far as the determination of the numbers of seals and predatory sea-birds, the quantites that they devour and the number of days per annum that they devote to their eating activities, are concerned, it must be remembered that I am trying to approach this matter on a scientific basis, with the realistic outlook of somebody who himself has been an enthusiastic angler all his life and as somebody who was and still is an amateur fisherman. My criticism of the reports must not be regarded as a rejection of, but rather as an attempt to encourage, more scientific and <span class="col_2717-2718" refersTo="page_1375"/>realistic investigation and a more scientific and realistic approach. My criticism of the reports is based on what I regard as clear features of certain sections of those reports. Some of these are admitted by the framers of the reports themselves, as for example that it is practically impossible to determine the numbers precisely or even approximately, that the research organization is not properly equipped to do the work as it should be done, and particularly&#x2014; a fact which the framers of these reports emphasized over and over again&#x2014;that their estimates of numbers, quantities of sea-food consumed, etc., are always very much minimal estimates, never near the maximum. They under estimate the figures very much, probably just as much as ex-Senator Pettersen and the then Director of Fisheries over-estimated, if indeed they did over-estimate the numbers and the quantities. And I say this in the first place because it is evident from the reports in respect of these predatory sea-birds that step by step as the investigations cover a wider and more comprehensive field, the estimates are higher and higher.</p>

<p>My other points of criticism are based on the clear impression that one cannot help forming that in the first stages at any rate the framers of these reports deliberately assumed that the previous estimates were grossly exaggerated. One cannot escape the impression that the research workers almost regarded it as their duty to refute those estimates and that they sometimes did so in a way which erred just as much in the other direction, that is to say, to estimate on the low side. I want to emphasize that any sea research worker who treats with contempt the consensus of opinion of people who have lived on and out of the sea their whole lives, only makes his task more difficult and thus harms science. Mr. Speaker, if on a Saturday I want to go out in a boat at False Bay to go and fish, I attach much more value to the judgment of an experienced skipper or boat-owner who is a fisherman himself than I do to the official weather forecast.</p>

<p>And the last point that I want to make in this connection is really a warning, based on my impressions from the reports and my impressions from long discussions with many persons closely connected with the fishing industry. This warning is one which the Board of Trade and Industries uttered in its Report No. 54 of 1925, and that is that our Department and our research workers must be fully alive to the danger of monopolistically inclined undertakings and groups of undertakings which form pressure groups and seek to give a certain colour to official findings, so that their monopoly will not be harmed by what would, indeed, appear to be the facts if the findings were examined without bias.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I be permitted to give a brief review of the importance and scope of our fish and rock lobster industries for the protection of which I am asking here. For various reasons, as will be indicated later on, certain figures with regard to the growth and the value of our fish and rock lobster industries are of great importance (a) to determine the growth and the value; (b) to indicate to what extent man has become an eater of fish. What has happened in South Africa has happened on a much larger scale in the great fish-producing countries, with Japan heading the list, followed by China, Russia, the United States of America, Great Britain, and then, highest on the list of the smaller countries, Norway and South Africa.</p>

<p>Our exports of fish and rock lobster in various forms expanded so enormously from 1934 to 1954, a period of 20 years, that I should like to submit the figures to the House. Since 1954 the production has been fairly constant, because of restrictions placed by the Department both on rock lobster and the catching of sardines and certain other types of fish. But in 1934 we exported 1,966,106 lbs., almost 2,000,000 lbs. of dried and smoked fish, and in 1954 the figure rose from nearly 2,000,000 to just less than 17,000,000, namely 16,933,000 lbs. As far as other fish (fresh and frozen) are concerned, we exported 853,972 lbs. in 1934, less than 1,000,000 lbs., and in 1954 the figure stood at 8,891,000 lbs., almost 9,000,000. In 1934 we exported 16.291 lbs. of miscellaneous fish (preserved), and in 1954 the figure rose to 2,794,000 lbs., almost 3,000,000. In 1934 we exported only 961,619 lbs., almost 1,000,000 lbs., of fresh and frozen rock lobster tails. In 1954 the figure rose to 3,545,000 lbs., a little more than 3,500,000 lbs. Over this period we exported only 500,000 lbs. more preserved rock lobster. In 1934 we exported 2,696,128 lbs., and in 1954 3,062,000 lbs.</p>

<p>The value of the exports of fish and rock lobster for those years can be given as follows: In 1934, R483,758; in 1954, R11,914,000. That is quite apart from our domestic consumption of fish and rock lobster, which increased considerably. These figures will probably be funished by other speakers. This goes to show what an important industry the fish and rock lobster industry has become, and it also indicates to what extent man has become an eater of fish. When the population of the world was still much smaller than it is to-day, mankind was able to exist on the food that was produced out of the soil, but with the growth of population groups throughout the world, with an increase of millions and millions of people in various countries, the yield from the soil is no longer enough, and mankind turns more and more to the sea to become a fish-eater and to take his food out of the sea. This point is very important, because I shall deal later on with the argument that we hear so frequently that if we exterminate our seals and certain sea-birds we will disturb the balance of nature.</p>

<p>What has happened in our country has also happened in other countries. I just want to mention the smaller fish-producing countries in particular. In Holland the catch has remained just about static over the years, but the fishing <span class="col_2719-2720" refersTo="page_1376"/>industry of Norway&#x2014;and I mention Norway with a purpose&#x2014;grew as follows: From 1910 to 1919 it was an average of 584,712 short tons; from 1920 to 1929 it rose to an average of 675,521 short tons; from 1930 to 1939 it averaged 913,697 short tons. The monetary value of the yield of Norway&#x2019;s fishing industry was 90,000,000 krone in 1930; there was a small drop in 1949, but from 1950 to 1954 the yield averaged 1,584,005 short tons.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. Then I come to Sweden, and I mention Sweden, too, in view of the question asked by the hon. member. The average production of Sweden, which is adjacent to Norway, was 96,000 short tons from 1931 to 1935; from 1936 to 1940 it rose to an average of 116,000 short tons, and from 1948 to 1960 it increased to an average of 184,000 short tons. In 1952 it was 204,000 short tons, and in 1957 222,000 short tons, two and a half times as much as in 1931-5. I particularly mention Norway and Sweden as comparable small countries, but also because the Norwegian Parliament&#x2014;and this is the reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question&#x2014; passed a law as far back as 1899 to exterminate seals and the most important fish-eating predatory sea-birds, not merely to limit them, but to exterminate them altogether. In that year Norway&#x2019;s production of fish had dropped to a meagre &#x00A3;500,000. The Act of 20 May 1899 provided for the extermination of 25 types of birds, of which seven types were fish-eating and the other grain-eating. In South Africa we are faced with the same problem in the shape of finches and the English starlings, which are grain-eaters and fruit-eaters respectively.</p>

<p>The value of Norway&#x2019;s fishing industry, as a result of this, rose from 2,000,000 krone in 1899 to 545,550,000 krone in 1954.</p>

<p>In its wisdom, the State has considered it right and important that we should protect our industries here, and we do protect our valuable fish and rock lobster supplies in the first place by limiting the catching season for both fish and rock lobster to a longer or shorter period; in the second place by closing the breeding areas of the rock lobster from time to time; in the third place by providing that no female rock lobster that has eggs may be caught, and that no rock lobster measuring less than three and a half inches from the neck to the tail-head may be caught; in the fourth place, by prohibiting human divers from diving for rock lobster on a commercial basis; in the fifth place by prohibiting the use of fishing nets of a smaller mesh than that laid down for sardines and horsemackerel and mackerel; in the sixth place, by providing that big fish may not be caught with sardine nets. There are many contraventions of these rules. I hope that the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) and others will draw attention to the fact that these rules laid down by the Department are often contravened with impunity; I hope they will do so. This is one of the many important ways in which we try to protect our fish and rock lobster industries.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to show the House what we are doing to protect our fish against excessive catching. I come now to the question of seals and sea-birds. Although we give all this protection to the industry and limit our catch to 250,000 tons, as far as sardines and horsemackerel are concerned, and although we place all those restrictions on the breeding areas, so that nobody may enter the breeding areas or catch the smaller rock lobster, we leave the Cape cormorant, the malagash and other predatory birds free to devour fish in season and out of season to their hearts&#x2019; content. We allow the seals to eat as many fish as they like. We allow predatory birds and seals to catch rock lobster on a large scale, and particularly the small rock lobsters in the breeding places before they really have shells. According to the reports of the Department of Fisheries, the quantity of rock lobster to be found in the stomachs of these predatory birds is not unduly large, and the same applies to seals. But the report itself&#x2014;I refer to the Report on Pelt Seals of 1959, at page 31, col. 1&#x2014;mentions that the small seals (and the Department itself admits this) devour young rock lobsters throughout the whole of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the quantity of rock lobster devoured by these predatory birds cannot be determined. I shall tell you what my own observations were. One day at Salamander, the promontory opposite Saldanha, I sat in a boat out at sea and watched the Cape cormorants for hours through binoculars. They sit there on the rocks the whole day; they are too lazy even to swim and to go and catch fish themselves. What do they sit and do? They sit and wait and when the water recedes and the small rock lobsters are exposed they grab here and they grab there. It must be remembered that the gastronomic potentiality of a cormorant is such that within an hour that small rock lobster has been digested and has become an unrecognizable pulp. The same also applies to the young seals which devour young rock lobsters. The malagash and the cormorant digest everything they eat and within four hours they have digested 74 per cent of even the hardest fish. The fact that at certain times of the year the trekduikers eat many small rock lobsters of an average length of 3 cm., that they catch the small rock lobsters when they are still in the <i>puerulus</i> stage, is supported by this inquiry report at page 19, col. 2. In Inquiry Reports Nos. 18 of 1953-4 and 23 of 1954-5 it is recommended by the Department of Fisheries that no steps should be taken to check the raids of these predatory birds, and the latest Report of Inquiry on Pelt Seals, No. 34 of 1959, regards <span class="col_2721-2722" refersTo="page_1377"/>as adequate the control measures over seals in the shape of slaughtering and catching whelps and bulls, the former for the pelt industry and the latter for the leather industry. Nevertheless the Division of Fisheries in its Report of Inquiry No. 31 of 1958 on the Predatory Activities of Sea-birds in Commercial Fishing, came to the conclusion that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reasonable approach to this problem would be to control the number of birds so as to reduce their consumption of fish and to make available more fish to the commercial fisheries for direct human consumption.</block>

<p>This represents great progress after the initial approach that those people who had warned from time to time and insisted on extermination, were exaggerating out of all proportion. The report recommends, however, that the control must and can take place by means of ]carefully controlled breaking of eggs&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, however well that may have been meant, &#x201C;carefully controlled breaking of eggs&#x201D; is not only impracticable but unscientific. How is one to set about it if one wants to break, say, one out of four eggs in every nest if one does not even know always where the nests are and how many there are? How is one going to know whether one has thrown out half the eggs in the nests if one does not know how many there are and where they are? One simply cannot control it carefully. The attitude was adopted in these reports that these predatory birds (the malagash, the cormorant and the penguin) devour only 22 per cent of our total catch of fish. But the percentage will rise considerably if we also add the seals, and on the admission of the framers of the reports themselves this estimate is very much on the low side.</p>

<p>Let us accept for the sake of argument that sea-birds only devour about 30 per cent of our total catches of fish and that together with seals they devour 40 per cent or more; is that fact in itself not a very urgent reason why these birds and seals should be exterminated? What do we do in respect of the jackal, the lynx and other vermin which deplete our sheep population? I am informed that it is estimated that our sheep population is between 35,000,000 and 40,000,000; secondly, that every year the jackal and the lynx, etc., kill between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of our sheep population. That is why we exterminate the jackal and other vermin, although they only destroy 2 per cent or 3 per cent of our herds as against approximately 40 per cent of our total catches of fish destroyed by seals and predatory birds.</p>

<p>What is the use of seals and predatory seabirds; of what use are they to mankind? They are of absolutely no use. Reference is made to the valuable guano that they produce for us. This fertilizer is only used really by vegetable farmers. Penguins do produce delicious eggs but this is the third successive year that no penguin eggs have been available. The collection and distribution of guano and penguin eggs&#x2014;penguin eggs show a profit <b>and </b>guano shows a loss&#x2014;involves the State <b>in an annual </b>loss of something like R19,200; that was the position in 1955. In 1954 the loss was R31,300. In that year no penguin eggs were collected.</p>

<p>I know that some of the smaller vegetable growers, particularly along our south coast, in the direction of George, set great store by guano that they buy from the State at a price which is far below the world price, with the result that the State suffers a loss through the collection of guano. My hon. seconder will give the House some idea of the quantity of fish that is devoured by birds in order to be able to produce this handful of guano, because probably 9/10ths of it is lost in the sea. The little that is collected, we have to collect at a loss. I am not indifferent to the lot of the vegetable growers who use guano, but I am sure that to-day we could easily produce a fishmeal which would have the same properties as guano. I think all we have to do is to hand over this matter to Onderstepoort, and I am convinced that they would produce a fishmeal which would be just as good as guano.</p>

<p>What do we get out of the seals, Mr. Speaker? We get an average of 11,000 pelts a year from whelps; we get an average of 3,500 skins from bears and an average of 22,000 gallons of oil. I have not even taken the trouble to work out how much this represents in terms of rand and cents because it is minimal in comparison with what they devour in order to produce such a small amount. The value of this would represent an extremely low percentage of what they devour, as I shall indicate later on.</p>

<p>The argument is used that sea-birds and seals are harmless little animals. The jackal is a much more useful little animal than the seal, and it is a much prettier animal too. The jackal used to keep the field mouse and the rock rabbit pest in check, but we destroy it because it eats our food. Why not exterminate predatory birds and seals which exterminate our rock lobster and fish supplies to a much greater extent? The finch is a useful little bird; it eats the commando worm but it also eats our wheat. That is why thousands of finches, which settle in trees overnight are destroyed with bombs and flames and nobody, not even the S.P.C.A., has ever objected to these stringent and, one might almost say, murderous steps taken against finches, jackals and lynxes. Having said this I have also disposed of the argument about cruelty. I shall come back to it later on when I indicate how this extermination can take place. I want to say that although jackals only destroy 2 per cent or 3 per cent of our sheep it would indeed be a brave farmer who stood up in this House and asked that jackals should be protected! I should also like to hear one of the farmers using guano advocating that we should protect the jackal and the lynx.</p>

<p>The argument is also used that these sea robbers only eat a small portion of fish which is of commercial value. This argument is not based on facts; it is an incomplete picture based <span class="col_2723-2724" refersTo="page_1378"/>on the stomach contents of sea-birds and seals. But even if that was true, and even if it were true that a fair proportion of what they eat is fish scraps and non-commercial fish like anchovy, cuttlefish and octopus, etc., they are still eating the food of the commercial fish. Sea creatures are the favourite foods of the Cape salmon (kabeljou and geelbek), the albacore, the mackerel, the sardine, etc. Seals and predatory birds eat this food which the commercial fish would otherwise have had in order to grow up and to become fat. These robbers therefore fall in the same category as the locust and the commando worm on land. We destroy locusts and commando worms because they devour the food of cattle and sheep and not because they devour our livestock. These predatory birds and seals eat the food of the commercial fish that we use.</p>

<p>I want to refer now to the argument that if we exterminate seals and sea-birds we shall be disturbing the balance of nature. The reply to this much-misused argument is simply that the balance of nature was already disturbed when mankind became a fish-eater on a large scale. That introduced a new consumer of fish. We must either give preference to the claim of mankind to the fish of the sea or we must give preference to the seals and the predatory seabirds.</p>

<p>The hon. member might do so once perhaps but then he would never touch it again. The seal is a useless voracious nuisance to any fisherman, and there is not a fisherman who will not tell you that the one enemy he has in the sea is not the shark or anything of that kind but the seal. If a seal comes to the boat from which you are fishing, you may as well pull up your line and go away; there is simply no more fish there; the fishes see that they get away, and the seal goes so far as to eat the fish off your hook if you have been fortunate enough to land one. Sir, I have given you the figures in respect of the expansion of our fish and rock lobster industries. Our duty now is to restore the balance which has been disturbed. We must eliminate one or more of the old fish-eaters, because the question we have to decide is this: Must we stop eating fish or must the seal and the predatory sea-bird stop being fish-eaters? No sensible person could have any doubt in this regard. Just as we exterminate the jackal, the lynx, the locust and the commando worm because they devour our food or the food of our food, so too we must deal with sea-birds and seals.</p>

<p>We may find in the papers to-morrow, if they give any attention to this matter, that a great hullabaloo is raised on the ground that we are proposing to practise cruelty towards animals. I can imagine organizations like the S.P.C.A. and others saying, &#x201C;Oh please, do not exterminate the beautiful seals and the poor birds.&#x201D; But they never say that when we exterminate finches and jackals. There is no nation on earth that is more sentimental in respect of animals than the British nation. The Britisher is well known for the fact that he tries as far as possible to keep sentimentality out of his normal relationships, but when it comes to animals he is as sentimental as anyone else could be. Britain is the homeland of the S.P.C.A. and I give them credit for having done a great deal to obviate cruelty towards animals. Britain also set the pattern for us for the protection of wild animals, of birds, of seals and robbers of that kind. Like us, Britain has protected seals and sea-birds by legislation. But in 1954, only eight years ago, the British Parliament withdrew the protection extended to various kinds of predatory sea-birds. Today they may be killed without restriction. These sentimental Britishers passed a law to say that seven kinds of sea-birds may now be killed. Hon. members will find that in the British Act passed on 4 June 1954, in Chapter XXX, Section 2. I would also refer hon. members to Schedule II, page 67 of the Public General Acts and Measures, 1954.</p>

<p>I shall come to that. Now I come to the question: What about the pelt seals? I want to deal more fully with this aspect because I shall leave it to my seconder to deal with sea-birds; I myself shall only refer to the question of sea-birds in broad outline. It clearly appears from the 1959 report (page 6, col. 2) that this investigation was instituted because the Government had been asked on various occasions to exterminate seals in order to protect our fish and rock lobster supplies. The framers of the report adopt the attitude that the estimates on which these requests were based, were grossly exaggerated.</p>

<p>One cannot escape the impression that they erred in the opposite direction so as to prove the case of the Department of Fisheries. Let me refer in the first place to the way in which the numbers were determined. It was not done strictly scientifically (see pages 10 and 11). Their method was to take aerial photographs and to try to determine the numbers from what they could see on enlargements of these photographs. But everybody knows that on an aerial photograph one can only see the seals which lie on the rocks; one may see an occasional seal in the water, but on an aerial photograph one cannot see those which are below the surface of the water and which swim about singly in the sea&#x2014;because they are constantly hunting. This method of determining the numbers of seals is not strictly scientific. It is admitted in the report itself that they were ill prepared for this task (page 6, col. 2). Apart from that, the report only covers seven and not all ten breeding places along the Cape coast. It only covers the breeding places between Kleinsee in Namaqualand and Quoin Rock, this side of Cape Agulhas. The other breeding places&#x2014;Mossel <span class="col_2725-2726" refersTo="page_1379"/>Bay, Knysna and Port Elizabeth&#x2014;were not included in the report. We can safely take it for granted that there are at least 50,000 full-grown seals but the report says that of those about 18,000 are whelps. I say that if we take into account the defects of the method that was used in determining the numbers, we can take it for granted that there are fully 50,000 full-grown seals at these seven breeding places. To that must be added an additional three-sevenths for the other breeding places, that is to say, another 21,426, a total of 71,500.</p>

<p>And what do those seals eat? It must be remembered that a female seal weighs about 300 to 400 lb. and a male may weight as much as 800 lb. I should like hon. members to bear this in mind when they look at what this report gives as the quantity of fish consumed by a seal per day. The quantity on which the report is based is 4 lb. per seal per day. and that is in such conflict with the data mentioned elsewhere in the report itself and it is so much on the low side that it cannot be accepted as scientific. Sir, imagine an animal weighing 800 lb. eating only 4 lb. of fish per day! The report itself admits that all the authorities are of the opinion that pelt seals in captivity have to be fed from 5 to 15 lb. of fish per day just to keep them healthy, not to fatten them. The method of cutting open the stomachs of seals at random and trying to determine according to the contents what they eat is very useful and to a certain extent scientific, but for the purpose of determining the quantity of food they eat it is practically useless. In this regard the only scientific method is that applied by Wilke in the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, U.S.A. He found that just in order to remain healthy a pelt seal daily consumes anything from 6.9 lb. to 9.3 lb. It can safely be accepted that a seal in captivity eats less than the seal living in the sea. That is so in the case of all wild animals in captivity, and the most important reason for that is that they eat less because they use much less energy inasmuch as they do not take part in long hunts. The daily quantity that a full-grown seal devours cannot therefore be put at less than 10 to 15 lb. per day, on a scientific basis. Let us say that the average is 10 lb.&#x2014;and it can be considerably more in the case of the seal which hunts in the open sea.</p>

<p>My strongest objection, however, is in respect of the low number of days given in the report as the days on which the seal eats. The report is based on the assumption that the seal only eats on 200 days a year and then only 4 lb. per day! On that quantity a seal is supposed to grow up and become sleek and fat! I just cannot imagine how any scientist could accept this. It is practically impossible to determine accurately whether a seal lies on the rocks the whole day and night for weeks. It is said&#x2014;and photographs have been taken of them&#x2014;that sometimes seals lie on the rocks the whole day without moving. But what about the night? Did they also take photographs at night? And it is a known fact that the seal does hunt at night. One need only ask the fishermen on the west coast who set up their nets at night and then find in the morning that their nets are full of holes made by seals going in and out of the nets and devouring the fish. But even if we were to accept that for 165 days, that is to say, five and a half months, the seal eats nothing, which is incredible, the report itself tells us that during those long months of fasting he lives on his own fat. Let me put this to hon. members: If a seal has eaten 4 lb. of fish per day for only six and a half months in the year and then lies on the rocks living on his fat for the remaining five and a half months of the year, where on earth did it get that fat? It could only have got that fat, as any dietitian will tell you, by grossly over-eating on those days that it did eat. It could only have got that fat by devouring much more food than it needed to remain healthy and to remain active.</p>

<p>One must either accept, therefore, that the seal ate his maximum during the shorter eating period&#x2014;and that could easily be as much as 35 lb. per day&#x2014;or one must accept that on an average throughout the year it eats at least 10 lb. per day.</p>

<p>Yes, then it eats throughout the year, and it has been found that it has to be given from 5 to 15 lb. per day.</p>

<p>The report estimates that, out of the 50,000 seals, the number determined with the aid of aerial photographs, only 32,000 remain after deducting the whelps. Their formula then is that the quantity devoured is:</p>

<p><img src="fig01_p1379"/></p>

<p>and that gives us 12,800 short tons. I work it out as follows: If the numbers are properly determined, it will be found that in the area of the seven large breeding places from Klein-see to Quoin Rock alone there are more than 50,000 full-grown seals. I work it out that they eat</p>

<p><img src="fig02_p1379"/></p>

<p>or 91,150 short tons, that is to say, 182,300,000 lb. The value of this in the raw state is approximately R800,000, and in the processed state it would give us an amount of R3,554,850. If we then add the other three breeding places, namely Mossel Bay, Knysna and Port Elizabeth, we get an additional 39,063 short tons on the basis of three-sevenths, and the total value of that in the raw form is R312,524, and in the processed form R1,423,457. The total tonnage therefore is 130,213 short tons per annum and the processed value is R4,978,307, that is to say, almost R5,000,000.</p>

<p>I want to hasten and dispose quickly of this question of predatory sea-birds and simply give a few facts in broad outline as to what they <span class="col_2727-2728" refersTo="page_1380"/>devour. The three reports of the Department of Commerce and Industries to which I have referred and which set out the results of the investigations into the eating habits of predatory sea-birds, agree in this respect that the worst fish and rock lobster eaters are (a) the Cape malagash (<i>Morus capensis</i>)<i>,</i> (b) the Cape trekduiker (cormorant) (<i>Phalacracorax capensis)</i> and the Cape penguin (<i>Spheniscus demersus</i>)<i>.</i> The figures given in each of these three reports, both with regard to the extensiveness of the coastal area, the quantities which are devoured and the numbers to be found, are very divergent. The one authority contradicts the other. I hope that my hon. seconder will also concentrate on this matter in particular. All I want to say is that my misgivings in respect of these figures are similar to those which I have already expressed and I hope also substantiated in respect of seals. As far as the quantity devoured by these three types of predatory birds is concerned, the total figure given in the latest report is that they devour 98,000 tons of commercial fish every year. Here, just as in the case of the seals, I also included the other sea-food which could otherwise have served as food for the commercial fish. Furthermore, I am not satisfied with the minimal amount on which these estimates are based in view of the fact that it has been proved clearly that all these types of birds frequently consume considerably more food in the course of one meal. No provision is made either for the waste by these voracious birds, and here I am thinking particularly of the black cormorant which is just like a vulture; he makes such a glutton of himself that he is unable to take off from the water, and if he gets a sudden fright he simply disgorges everything, flies away and starts eating all over again.</p>

<p>The report then proceeds to deduct long periods for breeding time, etc., but no provision is made for the fact that once the little ones have been hatched, the parents actually eat twice; they eat once and then fly back to the nest to disgorge what they have eaten in a semi-digested form, as food for the little ones, but then they go back to have their own meal.</p>

<p>I cannot accept either that for something like four months in the year (144 days) these most voracious of all sea-birds stay entirely without food. It has been proved by way of experiment that a Cape cormorant in captivity must be given at least 10 oz. of food every day just to be able to say alive, otherwise he loses strength and dies within a short space of time. I therefore apply to these predatory birds the same formula that I applied to seals. In that case I have found that the figure indicated in the report has to be increased if all the breeding places of the seals are taken into account, if the numbers are brought more into line with the numbers indicated in other reports and if we accept that they eat a reasonable quantity every day at a reduced average. The same applies in the case of sea-birds. The joint total figure which is given in the latest report and on the strength of which they already recognize that the numbers should be limited by breaking a certain number of eggs, is 89,000 tons. Calculated on the same basis that I used in the case of seals, the new total works out at <img src="fig03_p1380"/> tons per annum, that is to say, 633,700 tons of commercial fish and other non-commercial fish and sea creatures devoured annually by these predatory birds. In the processed form this quantity would have yielded R25,348,000. Jointly therefore seals and these three types of predatory sea-birds devour 91,150 tons and 633,700 tons every year, a total of 724,850 short tons. To this must be added three-sevenths for the other three breeding places, and therefore the processed fish value of what is devoured by seals and predatory sea-birds amounts to a sum of R30,326,307 per annum. I ask whether we can continue to afford this? Can we continue to afford it even if the exact figure is only half of that? I think the reply must be a very definite &#x201C;No&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) and certain other people are concerned, and rightly concerned, about the way in which seals and sea-birds can be destroyed and ought to be destroyed. How the extermination is to take place is a matter of departmental decree. The very first principle, of course, must be that it must take place in the most humanitarian way, that is to say, the most merciful way. As far as seals are concerned, it is generally accepted, in spite of what the S.P.C.A. says, that the safest and the best way is to club them to death on the rocks where they lie. It is done with a stout club by people specially trained for it and who can club down the biggest of seals with one hefty blow. This method is used every year both by the Department and by private contractors who are authorized to do so. I have already given the House the figures as to the number of whelps and bulls killed annually in this way. If the present protection given to these animals were simply taken away the result would be that all fishermen would go out to sea with rifles and shoot at these animals. It is difficult to aim from a buoyant boat. A case has already occurred where instead of hitting the seal an occupant of the boat was hit. In addition to this many of these animals would be wounded, which would cause unnecessary suffering. I suggest that the method which is already being used should be continued but that to start with we should allow twice as many to be killed every year. In this way the pelts, the skins and the oil could be kept and sold for what they are worth. If it then appears to be necessary the pace should be stepped up until the sea around our coast is reasonably free of this vermin. As far as the predatory sea-birds are concerned, we should obviate indiscriminate shooting of these birds. The best way is to trace the nests and to remove and to sell the eggs which are of commercial value, as is already done from time to time in the case of <span class="col_2729-2730" refersTo="page_1381"/>penguins. It should be done every year, however, and as many eggs as are found in the laying season should be removed. The eggs in the nests of the other two types, the malagash and the Cape cormorant, could simply be broken on the spot. These eggs are of no or little commercial value and would not cover the cost of collecting them. When the task in respect of these three types of predatory birds has been completed, attention can be given to other types of predatory birds at sea if the research, which ought to be extended to them in the meantime, justifies it.</p>

<p>If these methods were followed there would be no cruelty. The birds would live their natural span of life; their numbers would not increase, however, but would gradually be reduced. In the case of seals, we would set about the matter as we are doing at the present time, but the pace would be doubled and quadrupled, if necessary, so that our coasts would be cleared in the shortest possible time of what is really a completely useless glutton.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank you and I thank hon. members of the House for having listened so patiently to my speech.</p>

<p>I second the motion and at the outset I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) on the clear exposition he has given us of his motion. When the hon. member asked me to second his motion, I was somewhat surprised. I discovered subsequently, however, that he had asked me to do so because my name is the same as that which he wants to protect, namely visse (fish).</p>

<p>But you are a fish on dry land.</p>

<speech by="#visse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSE</person>:</from>

<p>As said, I am perhaps a fish on dry land because I represent a constituency which is very far away from the sea. But in spite of that I am very interested in the sea and also in fishing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort said that I would deal with the fish-eating sea-birds in particular. There are 11 varieties of predatory birds around our coasts and the most important of those for the purpose of this motion are the following three: The malagash, the cormorant and the Cape penguin. I shall deal with the eating habits of all three of these important predatory birds. I shall deal with the eating habits of the malagash first. Many of us who come from the interior see these sea-birds but we do not know what they are called and what their eating habits are. The malagash is a large white bird with its wings outlined. They are limited to the southern coastal area of Africa and they breed in September and February in large flocks on islands. They live exclusively on fish You find them in large flocks flying up and down the coast looking for fish in the water. These birds often rest on the sea and can remain on the sea for days on end. When they are far away from their nests in particular they rest on the water. When they notice a shoal of fish these birds dive in a characteristic way with their wings spread out half-way straight down on to the fish and they swallow the fish whole. The bird lays a single egg for breeding purposes, and the incubation period is six weeks. The chicken is usually more gluttonous than the big bird and has a particularly big appetite. After investigation it has been found that the malagash live exclusively on the following kinds of fish: Firstly sardines, then the marsbanker, then the anchovy and then the harder and other kinds which are not sufficiently important to mention. Practically 50 per cent of the fish which the malagash eats consists of sardines. The total weight of fish that has been found in the crop of a single malagash has been 2&#x00BC; lb. A malagash itself only weighs 2&#x00BD; lb. That means that it devours practically its own weight at a single meal. If you take it that a malagash eats twice a day &#x2014;which he very probably does because he sets out on his fishing expeditions early in the morning before the sun rises and it takes his digestive system three hours to assimilate the contents of his stomach&#x2014;the malagash catches his own weight one and two-ninth times in fish per day. In the St. Helena Bay area which is only a small section of our coast where research work has been conducted in respect of the malagash, it has been ascertained that there are approximately 200,000 of these birds. That was in 1954. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort has said that there was a difference of opinion between research workers and it was subsequently determined that there were less than 200,000. However, I accept this number because the fishermen in that area, which is alive with malagash. do not think that 200,000 is an over-estimate. If you take it that a malagash eats its own weight one and two-ninth times in fish per day, and if you take it that there are 200,000 malagash in the St. Helena Bay area, you find that in that area alone they devour 80,000 tons of fish per annum. The total sardine and marsbanker catch is plus-minus 420,000 tons annually. If you think that the malagash in that area alone devour one-fifth of the total catch of fish which is permitted, you realize what a terrific amount of fish these birds devour. 420.000 tons are permitted, and the malagash catch 80,000 tons. That is phenomenal.</p>

<p>The second bird which catches fish is the cormorant. There are four varieties, the most important being the Cape cormorant. It is a black bird and you find huge flocks of them along our coast. If you are at the coast early in the morning you will see large flocks of these birds flying over the water. His diet consists mainly of fish as well, the most important being sardines and marsbanker. Like the malagash he also eats anchovy fish and in addition the cormorant eats the Cape lobster. That is his main diet. The average weight of a cormorant is 2 lb. A cormorant has been known to have had plus-minus 20 sardines of an average length of 3 inches in its crop. It is estimated that a cormorant eats approximately one pound of fish per meal. The hon. <span class="col_2731-2732" refersTo="page_1382"/>member for Fort Beaufort has told us that this bird was very gluttonous and we can take it that he eats twice a day. It, therefore, eats a maximum of 2 lb. of fish per day. This is a very conservative estimate because some people who know them maintain that a cormorant eats the whole day through and not only twice. If we take it at 2 lb. of fish per day per cormorant we are being very conservative. It is estimated that there are 30,000 cormorants in the St. Helena Bay area&#x2014;I will concentrate on that area in particular. If you take it at 2 lb. of fish per cormorant per day, more than 22,000 tons of fish is devoured annually in that area alone by those cormorants. According to the Director of Fisheries there were more than 20,000,000 cormorants along the coast of the Republic in 1934 and they devoured 8,000,000 tons of fish per annum. There are no indications that there are fewer Cape cormorants to-day. We can take it that their numbers are the same.</p>

<p>The next bird is the Cape penguin. We all know the penguin; we all know what it looks like and it is not necessary for me to describe him to hon. members. Throughout the year the penguin is found near his nest. It breeds twice per annum. It breeds two eggs at a time and breeding takes place in March and in September. The incubation period is five weeks and as soon as the chickens are approximately six weeks old, they start looking for food themselves. Penguins cannot fly but we find them over 60 miles away from the coast where they catch fish. They are excellent swimmers. As in the case of the malagash and the Cape cormorant their main diet is sardines and marsbankers. Like the cormorant they also eat lobster. Little is know about their fishing expeditions. They are never bold but they are undoubtedly very active and good fishers. It is believed that penguins devour a considerable amount of fish and lobster. On investigation a penguin has been found to have seven young lobster of an average length of over an inche in its crop. When lobster is available they shun all other fish and concentrate on lobster alone. They prefer that to any other fish. Mr. Davies, one of the research workers, found on an investigation based on 244 eating days, that a penguin devoured 854 lb. of fish per annum. I do not know why he based it on 244 eating days because that means that there are 121 days on which the penguin does not eat. Obviously those are not consecutive days. I suppose he based his calculation on that figure because it was alleged that the penguin could not find fish or lobster every day. For the sake of argument I accept that there are 244 eating days and also that one penguin devours 854 lb. fish per annum. That is a considerable amount of fish and if you calculate that, Sir, you will find that every penguin devours 3&#x00BD; lb. of fish per day. Unfortunately we do not know how many penguins there are along our coast. I realize that it must be difficult to determine the figure. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort has already said that it is difficult to estimate. But if you take it that a penguin devours 3&#x00BD; lb. of fish per day and that there are not few but very many penguins along our coasts, you can come to no other conclusion but that these penguins devour a considerable amount of fish in weight per annum.</p>

<p>The next one is the seal. True it is not a bird, but in any case, as the hon. mover of the motion has already said, it is one of the most wasteful fish-eating animals in the sea. Seals are found all along our coastal waters, and they have been found as far as 100 miles from the coast. The young seals usually remain close to the land and the older ones go further away to catch fish. The fish they catch are usually deep sea fish. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort has told us that the male weighs 800 lb. and the female averages between 200 and 300 lb. I agree with him that a seal cannot live on a few pounds of fish per day. It is estimated that there are more or less 50,000 seals along the coast of the Republic. I take this figure for the purposes of calculating the weight of fish they devour. The seal catches its prey individually. They go about individually. They only come to the surface when they want to overwhelm large organisms. Otherwise they remain under water and devour the smaller fish there. According to research which has been conducted it is alleged that the seal eats during the day only. I agree with the hon. member for Fort Beaufort that is not correct. I have seen fishermen along the west coast which I visit often setting their nets at sunset in the evening to catch harders, mackerel and other fish and the nets are pulled in before the sun rises. It is often found when the nets are pulled in in the morning, that seals have eaten of the fish in the net and that the net has been completely ruined and cannot be used again. They do a tremendous amount of damage, not only because of the fish which they have eaten, but also because of the net they have ruined. The diet of the seal consists of the large variety of fish, cephalopoda and crustaceans. The large fish consists mostly of snoek, geelbek, yellow-tail, red stumpnose, galjoen, etc. The cephalopoda are the octopus which seals are very fond of. The crustaceans are the lobsters. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort has already told us how many lobsters are devoured by seals, and I do want to repeat that. There are different theories as to the amount of fish a seal eats per day. A large seal has been known to have up to 23 marsbankers weighing a total amount of 23 lb. in its stomach. Another one was found with 29 lb. of cephalopoda in its stomach, mainly octopus. Seals are very wasteful eaters. They only eat the stomach of the fish and the rest goes waste and is not eaten. That often happens in the case of trawler nets and where fish are caught on a line. If you take it that a seal eats an average of 10 lb. of fish per day&#x2014;that is a very conservative estimate; but an acceptable one according to investigations&#x2014;the seals along the coast of the Republic eat over 1,000,000 tons of fish per annum. If you accept it&#x2014;and there is no <span class="col_2733-2734" refersTo="page_1383"/>reason why you should not&#x2014;that the aforegoing are the amounts of fish devoured annually by these three types of fish-eating birds and seals, you realize, Sir, that the time has arrived for us to give serious consideration to the motion which is before us to-day.</p>

<p>Neale-May, one of the research workers, wrote in 1950 and said that a further attempt should be made to determine the amount of fish consumed as a result of these predatory activities. He wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is estimated that there are 10,000,000 birds along the West Coast whose entire diet consists of sea food. The average weight of these birds can conservatively be taken to be 2 lb. and in view of the fact that it is accepted that each bird eats its own weight in fish per day, on calculation it appears that the birds alone take something like 10,000 tons of fish per day or approximately 3,500,000 tons of fish per annum out of the sea.</block>

<p>That is according to May. In his report on seals in <i>Commerce and Industry</i> of August 1959, Mr. Rand says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The phenomenal progress in the sardine/ marsbanker industry, the introduction of essential control measures and many inexplicable fluctuations in the catches have all contributed to forcing fishermen to augment their income from the sea in some other way. It is inevitable, therefore, that fishermen. in their search for some measure of relief, doubt whether seals and birds have a right to exist because the seals as well as the birds are regarded as dangerous competitors as far as edible fish are concerned. By destroying the birds and seals it will be possible to relax certain control measures which hamper the development of the fishing industry at the moment. It will mean that more factories, more boats and more avenues of employment will come into existence.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Fort Beaufort has already mentioned that all the birds over our waters are protected to-day. The hon. member said that the reason for that was the guano which these birds provided. Large quantities of guano are obtained from the islands where these birds sleep at night and that is why they are protected. However, those quantities are not so very large. Will it not be better to look at the matter from the commercial point of view, having listened to the hon. member for Fort Beaufort, and rather destroy the birds and catch the fish for commercial purposes? I certain think so. As the hon. member for Fort Beaufort has said the guano is sold at a subsidized price. I think &#x00A3;1 subsidy was paid on every ton of guano in 1955. There is a great demand for guano, of course, and that demand cannot be met. Guano is only supplied to the vegetable farmers to-day. The annual yield of guano is approximately 5,500 tons. In his 1956 report Davies alleges that Hutchinson has calculated that the birds have to eat 9.7 tons of fish in order to provide one ton of guano. If this allegation is correct, it means that the birds eat only 48,500 tons of fish per annum in order to produce these 5,500 tons of guano. This allegation is not correct, Mr. Speaker, because these birds are over the sea for the greater part of the day&#x2014;and I take a day of 24 hours. They are catching fish during that period. We are all acquainted with the habits of birds. We all know that he cannot wait for the evening when he is back on his island before he gets rid of the guano. No, the world is big and the sea is even bigger and I am sure most of the guano is dropped over the sea and lost to us. At least half the guano is lost in that way and the fish they have had to eat to produce the guano as stated, must, therefore, be very much more than 9.7 tons per day.</p>

<p>What other benefits do we derive from the birds? As has already been stated the penguin lays two eggs twice a year. These eggs are occasionally marketed. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort said that no eggs were marketed during the past three years. No income has been derived from the sale of penguin eggs over the past three years, therefore. The only argument that can be advanced in favour of protecting the birds and penguins is because of their guano and eggs. And the losses which are suffered by the fishing industry outweigh that. The food which these birds and penguins eat is of far greater value. It is a source of income to many people. Whatever the position, people who know the sea, and they are mainly the fishermen, allege that there are so many birds and seals that they definitely affect the fish catches. I again wish to quote from <i>Commerce and Industry</i> of 1955. They say the following as far as the commercial side of the matter is concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is interesting to consider the value of the sardine and marsbanker catches in respect of the quantity which is devoured by birds and the relative value of the bird products such as guano and eggs. The total catch for the Union of South Africa during the year 1953 was 142,023 tons sardines and 87,271 tons marsbankers. Before processing this was valued at approximately &#x00A3;917,000 but when it had been processed into canned products, fish meal and fish oil, its total value was approximately &#x00A3;4,548,000. On the same basis the 51,350 tons of sardines and marsbankers which the malagash and cormorants eat will be worth approximately &#x00A3;205,400 in the raw state and over &#x00A3;1,000,000 in the final fish product state. It must be remembered that the annual fish consumption by penguins is not taken into account. If the fish which the penguins eat in the St. Helena Bay area is included, it is not unreasonable to place the commercial value of the fish which is devoured annually by the three most important guano producing birds in this area at over &#x00A3;1,250,000, calculated on <span class="col_2735-2736" refersTo="page_1384"/>the basis of the value of the final fish product.</block>

<p>You will notice, Mr. Speaker, that this writer thinks that it is not to our benefit to protect the penguins and the birds and the seal&#x2014;which is after all also one of the fish-eating animals. He concludes by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the face of it it may sound unreasonable to protect sea-birds which produce an essential product to the value of &#x00A3;65,000 but which in reality means a loss of &#x00A3;9,600 to the State.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort has also mentioned this. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It may appear even more unreasonable when it is borne in mind that the potential value of the fish devoured by guano producing birds in one area along the West Coast is approximately &#x00A3;1,250,000.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is only in respect of the St. Helena Bay area. How much more is it not in respect of the entire coast line of the whole Republic? The hon. member for Fort Beaufort also advanced certain arguments against the motion and the main argument that can be advanced against it is that the balance of nature may be upset by destroying or decreasing the number of these birds and seals.</p>

<p>In other countries where it is already being done&#x2014;he mentioned those countries&#x2014;the birds are controlled and no detrimental effects have been noticed. The balance of nature has already been upset by the establishment of fisheries along our coast and in order to restore that balance it will be necessary to destroy those birds and seals.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to direct a special word of appreciation to the Department of Commerce and Industry, particularly to the Fisheries section. A fair amount of research has already been conducted as far as birds, seals and fish are concerned, and although there are contradictions we realize that it is very difficult to come to the correct findings within such a short space of time. We are grateful for the fact that so much has already been done, particularly by the Fisheries section. I wish to conclude by repeating that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort has given us a very clear exposition and that no one can doubt that these birds and seals should definitely be decreased or, if need be, destroyed in order to safeguard the people of the Republic of South Africa and our fishing industry.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, like the seconder of the motion, I should like to say that the motion introduced by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) is one, I think, of very considerable importance. It affects one of our major industries, as well as a very large number of people who deal with the food supplies particularly of the lower and middle income groups, as well as other important factors. I think the hon. member in introducing it, leaving aside the merits of the motion for the moment, has given food for thought on a matter which requires quite a lot of thought and a matter in regard to which I think we are all entirely in agreement, viz. that nothing must be allowed to take place which would adversely affect our fishing industry. Thereby I think the hon. member himself has done a distinct service in introducing the motion.</p>

<p>I want to say at the outset that we may have differences of opinion with regard to the methods to be applied. The basic fact that something has to be done or considered in order to protect this industry is one on which I think we can find general agreement. I think perhaps before dealing with the motion in its detail it would be of value to try to assess just what is the industry we are concerned with.</p>

<p>I think the growth of our fishing industry has been so rapid and phenomenal that relatively there are few people in the Republic who have any conception of what our fishing industry to-day really stands for, or of the very wide ramifications which it directly affects When we study it, the fishing industry to-day embraces at least six major sections, every one of which could be affected, adversely or beneficially as the result of the suggestions put forward by the hon. member. First of all, I will take the section dealing with deep-sea trawling, which is not so greatly affected by this motion. The type of fishing they do is not so subject to depredation by birds or seals and consequently it is not so much affected by the methods the hon. member for Fort Beaufort wants to apply, but in itself it is one of the fundamental pillars of our fishing industry and its welfare must be associated with the rest of the industry. Next in importance there is the big pilchard and related fishing industry, and everything that is associated with it in the way of factories and canneries, an industry which to-day is making most rapid strides and has already assumed major importance. Then there is another section of the fishing industry, equally important to the people associated with it and equally affected by the depredations of the birds and seals, and that is the in-shore line fishing and the off-beach trekking which in turn have to support many hundreds of families and again is linked up directly with many other industries in the country. There are also literally thousands of people in the <span class="col_2737-2738" refersTo="page_1385"/>country who never catch a fish or go to sea, but who are directly affected in their daily livelihood by the stability and progress of the fishing industry. There is the already large ship and boat-building industry. Practically every vessel used in the fishing industry today, with the exception of a few old craft still left over from bygone days, is produced in our own country, largely from our own materials and built by our own people, and the livelihood of many thousands of people are involved in it. There is also the textile industry. I wonder how many people in the country realize how much their livelihood depends on the fishing industry, the people who make the nets, the lines and the anchors and all the hundred and one things used in the industry. Take our huge transport industry, the car manufacturers who manufacture the vehicles used in the distribution of fish throughout the country. It is largely done by specially insulated motor vehicles and by the Railways and there are thousands of people in this industry who rarely see the sea but who depend on it for their livelihood. One could give quite a number of examples, but I think I have said enough to show how greatly the industry we are dealing with affects other people. Take the can manufacturers alone, and link them up with where they get their basic materials from, the ore that must be mined to make the tinplate in which to put the canned fish. It is an endless chain, and again there are literally thousands of people who depend for their livelihood on the sea, so that when we discuss the motion of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort I think we must direct our minds far beyond the man who actually catches the fish. It is an old saying amongst fishermen that the man who makes the money is never the one who catches the fish, but the middle man, and I think that applies to our fishing industry also.</p>

<p>Take the industry from its financial point of view, and its effect on the finances of the country through its export trade and the foreign currency this earns. There are quite a lot of things linked up with this fishing industry, and we have to keep all these features in mind.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort and his seconder, in an endeavour to prove the benefits of the policy they advocate, have given us many statistics dealing mainly with the consumption of fish by sea-birds, duikers, cormorants and seals, and they have given us quite a lot of statistics about similar conditions in other countries where restrictive measures or measures of extermination have been put into effect. I want to say at the very outset that, whilst I go quite a long way with the plea for the careful examination of the subject and protection, I certainly cannot go all the way with the hon. member when he pleads for extermination of sea-birds and seals. I think, when we talk about extermination and we bear in mind the figures the hon. member himself quoted. 20.000,000 duikers and hundreds of thousands of seals, in the first place we are talking about something which is physically impossible and, secondly, we are talking about something which, I believe, needs a tremendous amount more of examination before we are able to accept it at the value the hon. member has put on it. We are attempting to interfere with the balance in wild life&#x2014;an action which can have incalculable results which nobody at present has considered sufficiently, and the extent of which no one can foresee. I want to mention just one example of how these things hit back. A few years ago, due to the depredations by crocodiles in the Rhodesian rivers and pools, the toll of animals and humans killed was so big that crocodiles were declared open game, and anyone could shoot them. What happened? After a few years so many crocodiles had been killed that it was found that the Rhodesian streams and pools were being overstocked with the fish on which the crocodiles had lived. The crocodiles had kept the balance. As the result of the over-increase in the number of fish, the fish developed diseases because they did not have enough food to grow properly. To-day Rhodesia has to protect the crocodiles in order that, by this, they may protect the other forms of fish life. I believe that the evidence we have at the moment in regard to our fishing industry is not sufficient, so that, if we adopt the policy of wholesale extermination advocated by hon. members, we must be careful that we do not upset the balance of nature, for which we may have to pay very dearly in future. I want to take hon. members&#x2019; minds back 14 or 15 years ago, when False Bay was invaded by large shoals of sardines, pilchards and marsbankers, with the result that you had millions of fish dying. They were coming to the surface in tens of thousands, and there were solid masses of dead fish. Nobody could understand what had happened. Then the scientists got to work on it, and one of their final conclusions was that, due to the over-stocking of the bay with fish, they were exhausting the oxygen in the water faster than it could be replenished, and, as the result, they were suffocated or poisoned by the gases they generated, and, on that occasion, literally millions of fish died. It went on for about six weeks. You could even smell the dead fish as far as Muizenberg. I have looked at the figures given a few days ago by the Fisheries Development Corporation&#x2019;s annual report. Frankly, at the moment I can find nothing in these figures to support the argument, heavy as the feeding of the penguins, duikers and seals undoubtedly is. I can find no trace in the official figures based on last year&#x2019;s fishing results and issued only about ten days ago of anything to support the view that, at the moment, the fishing industry is being adversely affected by these birds and seals. These latest figures can be regarded as a barometer which would clearly indicate any factor operating either to the benefit or the detriment of the fishing industry. I think we can expect the report to reflect whether <span class="col_2739-2740" refersTo="page_1386"/>there were any substantial adverse effects as the result of the actions of the birds and the seals. The report shows such substantial increases in the catches being made and such a substantial improvement in the quality of the fish caught that I believe those figures do not support the argument that we must exterminate the birds and the seals. Dealing with the last fishing year ended September 1961, and comparing it with the report for the previous year, the intake of fish has increased from 731,000 tons in 1960 to 937,000 tons in 1961. It is an increase of something like 25 per cent. It is true that there was an increase in the number of vessels catching it, but it still does not show any substantial decrease in the quantity of fish caught. And that increase is not confined to any particular part of the coast. One would expect the areas where these seals and birds are most prevalent to be affected adversely, whereas another area without birds might not be affected at all. But the figures cover the whole fishing industry along our coast and that of South West Africa. In 1960 in the Republic we landed 425,000 tons of fish, and in 1961 it was 557,000 tons. In South West Africa it increased in that period from 306,000 tons to 380,000 tons. Take the production of fishmeal, which depends largely on the quality of the fish caught. In 1960 the fishmeal production as a whole was 149,000 tons, and in 1961 it increased to 221,000 tons, an increase of over 52,000 tons or 33 per cent. In South Africa it increased from 93,000 to 123,000 tons of fishmeal, and in South West Africa, where we find these birds in huge flocks, the increase was from 55,000 tons to 78.000 tons of fishmeal. One of the features one should examine carefully in order to see what is happening to the fishing industry is the production of fish oil, because the oil content of the fish is closely associated with the quality of the fish. The production of fish oil to a large extent reflects the quantity of fish caught, as well as the quality. The production of fish oil in 1961 shows an increase of just under 50 per cent over 1960, although the increase in the fish caught was only 25 per cent. That is a clear indication that the quality of the fish was good. To my mind that refutes the argument that the depredations of the birds and the seals is depleting the shoals so heavily.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I was not dealing with crayfish. I will deal with that later. The quantity of fish oil produced in 1961 was 58,000 tons against only 40,000 tons the previous year, and it was equally divided all along the coast. For South Africa the increase was from 25,000 tons to 41,000 tons, and for South West Africa it was from 14,000 tons to 17.000 tons. It is quite evident that the official figures showing increased production in all spheres do not support the claim that there is a serious danger to the fishing industry as the result of the depredations of the birds and the seals, but they rather incline one to the view that in fact they play an essential part in maintaining the balance between the fish and the other forms of marine life which all have to exist side by side in the same quantity of water and eat from the same quantity of food to enable them to develop.</p>

<p>I want to refer back for a moment to the occasion I have mentioned, when 14 years ago we had evidence that you can have an acute danger of over-crowding and that in consequence there will be tremendous loss of marine life. I want also to refer to another feature in the report of the Fisheries Corporation, because this has an important bearing on the motion. The report stated that two features dominated the past South African fishing season&#x2014;this report was published only a few weeks ago&#x2014; it says that the return of the vast shoals of pilchards to the waters adjacent to the main concentration of factories on the St. Helena Bay coast and the high qualities of the pilchards being landed was an encouraging feature. That, I think, to some extent contradicts or throws doubt on the value of the argument that the birds eat as much fish as they are stated to do. In fact, I think it indicates the contrary.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred in his motion and in his speech to the penguins, a bird which is also a big fish-eater. Part of the report of the Corporation deals with the waters in the vicinity of Dassen Island. Dassen Island is one of the big penguin homes and much guano is collected there from the penguins. One would have expected that if their consumption of fish was so great we would find the effect of it in an area like that, but we find that actually the report completely contradicts that. It says that one large factory drew 85 per cent of its raw fish from the waters north of Dassen Island, as compared with only 22 per cent in the previous season, an increase of 63 per cent in the fish caught for one factory alone, and it goes on to say that the increase in the quantity of the fish this year made it possible for the factory in question to increase its canning of fish by over one-third of the previous year&#x2019;s output. It went on to say, and this is the point I wish to make again in connection with the fact that these figures do not support the arguments advanced in regard to the depredations of the birds, that in two factories the exceptional figure of 33 gallons of oil extracted from one ton of fish processed was maintained for a short period in mid-season. One can hardly claim that those figures substantiate the claim that the birds exterminate the fish to such an extent. I think that the complete extermination of seals and birds in our waters may be a considerable danger rather than a benefit.</p>

<p>What about the increase in the world population?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Do you suggest that we should exterminate some of them because their numbers <span class="col_2741-2742" refersTo="page_1387"/>are increasing? I am dealing with the extermination of birds now and I am also dealing with the increase in the production of fishmeal and fish oil, which helps to feed the increased world population. I want to deal with the quantity of fish-meal exported during 1961, because there again the report revealed that our production of fishmeal in 1961 was a record one, and that as the result of the methods of controlled marketing now adopted we obtained a 50 per cent increase in the price. But I want to emphasize that this official report I have quoted, based on official figures obtained in our own country, to my mind do not support the drastic action asked for in the motion, the complete extermination of she birds and seals.</p>

<p>Let me touch for a moment on South West Africa. If the figures produced by the mover of the motion and his seconder are substantially correct&#x2014;not so much that the figures are correct but that their effect is correct&#x2014; one would expect that the authorities in South West would be somewhat worried and would be taking steps to more drastically control the amount of fish caught in those waters. But only this week the Administrator of South West Africa announced a very big increase in the quotas for fish caught in South West African waters. We have announced a substantial increase in the amount of fish the industry is allowed to catch for the six factories at Walvis Bay. They have increased the quota for pilchards and marsbankers, two of the fish mainly eaten by the birds, from 375,000 tons which was allowed for the year just ended to 435,000 tons, an increase of 60,000 tons. When you take that figure into consideration and translate it into boatloads of fish caught and take it at the low figure of 100 tons per catch, or about ten boatloads per 1,000 tons, it means that they will be allowed to catch 600 extra boatloads of pilchards above what they were permitted to catch the previous year. That hardly bears out the thought that the Administration in that area has any grave doubts about the growth of fishing around their coast and about any. need at the present moment to curtail fishing. I think of one of the most striking pieces of evidence to be obtained by reading the reports of the Fisheries Development Corporation, which to my mind goes in an opposite direction to the line indicated by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort and is that in 1960, the year before last, the South Afrcan Fish Canning Industry was able to produce 720,000 cartons, with 48 tall tins per carton, of canned fish. In the year just ended they produced 994,000 cartons, a very substantial increase, which again shows that there has been no shortage of fish. One must also remember that it is only the very top layer of the fish caught by each trawler which goes into the canning process you cannot go down more than about nine inches in your catch; the lower portion has already been so heavily affected by squashing and various other factors by the time it is landed, that it then goes into fishmeal production&#x2014;it is not used for canning. It is only a very small proportion of the catch that is canned, and yet in spite of that there was an increase from 720,000 to 994,000 cartons. The most striking feature is that the 434,000 tons of pilchards delivered to South African factories between 1 January 1961 and 30 September 1961, embraced a lesser number of fish than the 345,000 tons for the equivalent period of 1960. In other words, we were able to produce from a smaller number of fish a much greater number of canned fish and fish products. The Board very rightly draws attention to the fact that quite apart from its economic value, it meant that the value of this particular development, that is to say, larger and better quality fish being caught or in other words the more matured fish being caught, needs no explanation from a conservational angle; in other words, the fish were allowed a better opportunity of attaining a fuller growth and therefore a better quality, a more matured, a larger fish more suitable for canning. That again does not seem to me to be on all fours with the argument that birds constitute a tremendous danger.</p>

<p>I want to touch just in passing on another matter. The aim of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, which I think is a very good motion for drawing attention to the need is to afford protection to our fishing industry, something which all of us want. But I have watched the fishing industry very closely; I have been an angler all my life; I have been associated with fishermen all my life, both line and inshore fishermen, and I believe that the danger to the conservation of our fishing industry, to its future development, lies not so much in the birds and the seals but with human beings who are to-day participating in the fishing industry&#x2014;these people who are not prepared to abide by the laws laid down by the State through the Fisheries Development Corporation for their own future benefit; by the poaching which takes place in areas where the laws of the land prohibit fishing; by the wholesale pilchard fishing which is taking place in False Bay within a quarter of a mile or a half a mile of the beaches, despite the fact that the regulations provide for a two-mile limit. I have seen boats fishing, their trawlnets out, in the bay at Fish Hoek amongst the nets of the trek-fishermen operating from the beach who themselves are controlled by very rigid regulations as to what they may and what they shall not do so. The mesh of the nets used for that type of fishing is a breach of the law. The nets themselves are not the type of net permitted to be taken in there, and the fish being caught are not the types permited by the laws of the country, as far as this type of net operation itself in False Bay is concerned, because it is only permitted in the case of pilchards and that type of fish. When you find fishing trawlers of this type netting, off the mouth of a fishery harbour at Kalk Bay, right inshore near the mouth of the harbour, catches of anything between 12,000 and 14,000 large white Steenbras, which run into 14 or 15 1b per fish, fish entirely outside the <span class="col_2743-2744" refersTo="page_1388"/>scope of the pilchard fishing industry, fish which are conserved as a rule for the trekkers and the inshore fishermen or the line-fishermen&#x2014;when you see that happening you wonder whether the dangers that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort envisages are not very real dangers. They are very real dangers indeed, but they are dangers which are largely due to the actions of these people themselves who break the laws of the fishing industry. One also sometimes wonders at the apparent lack of control by the authorities who should be there to control and protect the fishing industry from the very danger of depletion from which this motion seeks to protect it. It is a well-known fact that pilchard shoals do not rise around the period of full-moon and therefore you never find the pilchard boats operating for a couple of days each side of full-moon. But it is common talk in the False Bay area that the Fisheries protection vessels usually come in to protect the fishing industry in the full-moon period when the boats are not there. They are usually absent on the dark nights when the boats operate. But they do not only operate at night, they operate in broad daylight, and I believe that is an aspect which needs very careful examination when considering the motion of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort; it needs careful consideration in the overall interests of the protection of our fishing industry. I would go so far as to say this: I attempted at the beginning of my remarks to outline the widespread national importance of the fishing industry; I emphasized that it was of paramount importance that nothing should be done to jeopardize the future of that industry. I believe we are all agreed on that. But I believe that unfortunately the motion of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort is much too restricted and that the dangers to the future of the fishing industry are not only the dangers that he envisages&#x2014;and there are dangers such as those envisaged by him&#x2014; but other dangers as for example the long time that is taken in some cases before the control laws are put into effect and, in certain areas, the almost complete lack of observance of the present control laws. I believe that the time has arrived when there should be a complete investigation into the control of fishing in its various aspects and particularly the netting of fish. I remember well that in the days of Dr. von Bonde, when I assisted him in demarcating beaches in the False Bay area, beacons were put up outside of which a trek-fishermen was not allowed to trek. His net had to be a certain mesh; he was only allowed to operate under certain conditions, and his catch had to be landed on the beach. To-day you will find boats coming inshore there with a net, fishing from the boat, which is illegal; you will find set nets being set in the run of the harder shoals, which is illegal. You find various attempts being made to divert shoals of fish, which is also illegal, but nothing seems to be done about it.</p>

<p>I want to come back for a moment to seals. The hon. member has referred at length to the extermination of seals. About three years ago an attempt was made to reduce the seal population of Seal Island in False Bay. Incidentally, the waters around Seal Island, which is the home of thousands of seals, constitute one of the principal fishing grounds for the pilchard boats, and they favour it because they get such good catches there, and yet the seals live there. If we found a man in our dining-room taking the meat off our table, we would probably have something to say about it and we cannot complain if the seals do the same when we come alongside their front door to take their fish. An attempt was made, as I say, to reduce the seal population. People landed on the island and the first day they killed a large number of seals; they clubbed them to death under the most brutal and unsatisfactory conditions. The second day they did not get so many; by the third day the seals knew what was happening and they moved over to the False Bay side and they set up seal rookeries inside Cape Point where they have now located themselves. Those seals to-day destroy practically every harder shoal moving into False Bay, and instead of the trek-fishermen catching their usual catches of anything from 10,000 to 30,000 harders in a trek, they are lucky if they get 3,000 because the seals break up the shoals in the entrance to the bay. But my argument is that it is not only the seals which are to blame; it is the fact that we disturbed the seals on Seal Island by the attempt to exterminate them; we drove them away and they set up a new area where they have developed a new home-life, and they are now taking the food that comes past them. By so doing we have ourselves set up an obstacle to the trek-fishermen in the bay. And that is happening right throughout every harder season. If you look at the figures of the total number of harders being caught along those shores from Simonstown, Fish Hoek to Muizenberg, you will find that whereas catches used to run into hundreds of thousands, if you top 100,000 to-day it is a very good season. In places like Buffels Bay you hardly see a harder to-day because seals we drove from Seal Island are located off there. Once a harder shoal is broken up and scattered you can never bring it together again. The old fishery laws recognized that and that is why they stopped the practice of certain fishermen of holding a paraffin tin under water and beating it with the object of diverting the fish. It was made illegal to do it in terms of fishing regulations which were passed in the days of Dr. von Bonde. To-day, however, these things are done with impunity. These are matters, I believe, require examination so that the whole of our fishing industry can be brought under proper control. I believe that would go a long way towards doing what the hon. member wants to do. At the same time we can examine the question of the role played in this matter by birds and seals and get some more definite information on which we can base any future action. If we are going to embark on the extermination of birds <span class="col_2745-2746" refersTo="page_1389"/>and seals, then all I can say is that for heaven&#x2019;s sake let us embark on any reduction that we are going to bring about in a manner befitting the civilization that we are supposed to represent. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort referred in his speech to the reaction of the S.P.C.A. and other well-intentioned people. Sir, it is not the reaction of the S.P.C.A. and the other well-intentioned people that counts; it is the reaction of our own conscience. We represent a type of civilization in which humanity must play a very large part, and when we deal with wild animal life who through no fault of their own take what we feel is something that belongs to us, then let us do it in a manner which is in keeping with our civilization, that is if it has to be done at all. But I still have to be convinced that there is any necessity for this action. Let us have control by all means but I am not prepared to agree that there is any cause at the moment for the extermination proposed in the motion before us. I believe that it will be wrong. I believe that the ultimate effect on our fishing industry may well be just the reverse of what we expect.</p>

<p>It may sound anomalous if I as a cattle farmer and as somebody who represents a big cattle producing constituency take part in this interesting debate on fish and seals. I wish to say at the outset that in terms of its popularity I do not think fish will ever succeed in ousting beef. I think that no matter how common and how plentiful fish may be, people will always turn to meat. The fact that it is only during the last few years that there has been such a tremendous increase in the consumption of fish, proves that meat will not be ousted by fish.</p>

<p>Seeing that this is such an important debate, I should like to take part in it because, in the long run, the fishing industry is one of the most important industries in the economy of the country, and seeing that it plays such an important role in the economy of our country, one cannot afford to be neither fish nor flesh in a debate such as this, Sir, and for that reason I wish to take part in this interesting debate on this motion that the development of the fishing industry should be inquired into and which points out certain dangers which stand in the way of the future development of the fishing industry.</p>

<p>When business was suspended I was dealing with the important role which the fishing industry was playing in the economy of the country. The hon. member who spoke before me has already given the figures for the Republic, but the Republic cannot be separated from the area which I represent, South West Africa and I want to state briefly what an important role the fishing industry plays in the economy of South West Africa. The fishing industry in South West Africa is a relatively young industry. It started in 1922 with the catching of crayfish, but it was much later, only in the year 1946, that the fishing industry received its first real boost when a certain quota was allocated to the fish factories in South West Africa. The quota was originally 250,000 tons, but it was increased to 260,000 in 1959 and to 375,000 in 1960 and a week ago to</p>

<p>435,000 tons. That is the total quota of fish which the six fish factories may catch along the West Coast of South West Africa. The authorities in South West Africa have also thought it advisable to abolish completely the so-called closed season which used to stretch from 15 November to 28 February of the following year and that step will give the fishing industry in South West Africa a very big boost in future. There has been such an increase in production along the West coast of South West Africa alone that the total production of fish meal alone reached the figure of 69,000 tons last year, fish oil 17,000 tons and in addition no less than 378,032 tons of canned fish was produced. The annual production is valued at not less than R20,000,000. That means that the fish production which was 11,400 tons in 1948 has increased to 378,000 tons namely not less than 3,435 per cent over the past 12 years. There has been such an increase that we sell our fish to-day to countries like Australia, Belgium, Liberia, Ceylon, Fiji, France, Greece, Holland, Italy, Mauritius, New Zealand, the United States of America, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Porto Rico, Cuba, Egypt and even Singapore. Apart from the local consumption South West Africa is not lower than 17th on the production list for the whole world, and in Africa, including the Republic, South West is the second largest fish producer. Its production is higher than that of Mexico with 190,000 tons, Argentine 88,000 tons, Belgium, 57,000 tons, Finland 67,000 tons, Greece 82,000 tons, Italy 213,000 tons, to mention a few countries, and much higher than that of Australia and New Zealand together. The fishing industry has had a great affect on the other activities in South West Africa, particularly on industry. For example, in 1960 the coal consumption of the fishing industry in South West Africa was no less than 31,500 tons; the consumption of fuel alone was 763,100 gallons in that year; the wage cheque of the factory workers alone amounted to Rl,132,000. The canning factory at Walvis Bay which was only started in 1957, cans 300,000,000 tins per annum at a speed of 350 per minute. One out of every three persons in Walvis Bay is connected with the fishing industry. As recently as 1955 there were no less than 371 White fishermen and 336 Coloureds on the 72 licensed fishing boats and no fewer than 247 Whites, 173 Coloureds and 2,200 Bantu were connected with the factories. In 1954 already the total capital investment in the fishing industry at Walvis Bay alone was over R8,000,000. The fishing industry is the largest source of revenue for the area of South West Africa. The only <span class="col_2747-2748" refersTo="page_1390"/>industry which exceeds it is the diamond industry. Whereas the diamond industry produced R30,000,000 worth of diamonds last year, the karakul industry only R10,000,000 and the meat industry R12,000,000, the fishing industry produced no less than R20,000,000.</p>

<p>I merely wish to point out that these are phenomenal figures but that the actual future of the fishing industry is even far greater. Since 1950 the Administration of South West Africa has followed a definite pattern in respect of research into the fishing industry. We have acquired a number of research boats. They have endeavoured to ascertain precisely where the breeding grounds of the fish were and what their movements were. In order to ascertain their movements a small plate is attached to the back of the fish and when it is subsequently caught it is easy to determine from where it had moved in the meantime. We are smartening up our methods of fishing. To be honest, as far as that is concerned, South Africa is lagging somewhat behind.

<p>&#x2026; employ the most modern methods to catch fish. For example, they have electronic equipment with which they locate fish as deep down as 170 feet below the surface of the water by attaching a light to an eight-inch suction pump. The fish are attracted by the light, they approach it and get sucked up at the rate of one ton per hour. The entire Atlantic Ocean particularly the cold streams along the West Coast of the Republic and South West Africa are really lying fallow for the future development of the fishing industry of South West Africa and also that of the Republic. As a matter of fact, if offers so many possibilities that other countries have become interested in developing their fishing industries along our West Coast. They are so interested that during recent months no fewer than 30 Russian boats have touched at Walvis Bay. Whereas they fished far away from their native countries in years gone by, then took the fish to those countries for processing and then exported the tinned product to the consumer countries, the latest method is to have factory ships where the fish is processed at the site where it is caught, and those same boats touch at the harbours along the African coast and market their products. In this way fish can be produced very cheaply. It is a pity that our fishing industry has lagged behind and that it has not kept pace with this development. Apart from Russia, Japan and Canada, for example, also intend expanding their fishing activities along the West Coast of Africa on a fairly large scale. To me that will not only threaten our fishing industry to some extent but the presence of those boats may also constitute a military danger to us in time to come, something which I do not wish to discuss at the moment.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I merely wish to indicate how important the fishing industry is to South West, Sir. Having regard to the importance of the fishing industry, we find that there are fish eating birds and seals and other animals which wish to devour that fish with us on a large scale. A strict law of nature requires that there should be balance. That balance is beautifully illustrated in our game reserves. The position is this that if we do not place some restraint on those animals which destroy and devour the fish those beautiful fish supplies of ours will disappear completely in the near future. But, as I have said, we have the example of what happens in our game reserves to-day. That balance is beginning to get upset to-day in the Etosha game reserve in South West Africa, which is regarded as the biggest in the world where zebra, for example, have increased to 23,000. The lions have always been killed off and there are only 260 of them to-day, while the other animals, such as the eland and the gazelle and the kudu are gradually becoming extinct because people kill them for food. The result has been that we were eventually obliged to get rid of a great many of those zebra in the Etosha game reserve, and we have destroyed them to a fairly large extent. We simply had to restore the balance. We find the same balance in the empire of the sea. We have the following fish eating birds along the fish-producing waters along the coast of South West Africa: The Cape malagash whose scientific name is <i>Sula capensis,</i> we also have the Cape penguin whose scientific name is <i>Spheniscus diversa,</i> but our greatest enemy is the Cape cormorant (<i>Phala</i><i>cracorax capensis).</i> You find these birds in their millions along the coast of South West Africa. Whereas there are practically no authentic figures in respect of these birds in the case of the Republic&#x2019;s coast, we in South West Africa are in the fortunate position that we have been able to determine to a large degree of certainty what their numbers are. That was done by means of aerial photographs which were very greatly enlarged, and by dividing them into blocks and actually counting the birds, scientists have arrived at certain figures. For example, we have large guano platforms where these birds can be counted very accurately. There are two guano platforms at Walvis Bay and six at Cape Cross with a total surface of 88,929 square metres. Meinertshagen took a count in 1949 at the one at Walvis Bay which is only 17,000 square metres and ascertained that at that juncture there were no fewer than 444,000 birds on that platform. Most of them were cormorants, crowned cormorants, bank cormorants, and white-breasted cormorants. All the birds along our West Coast live on fish. The most important fish they eat is the sardine but they destroy other fish as well, as the hon. member <span class="col_2749-2750" refersTo="page_1391"/>for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) has indicated. The average amount of fish which those birds eat per annum is no less than 300 lbs. That has been scientifically determined: 300 lbs. of fish per annum per bird! Herman Winter who has one of these platforms is of the opinion, however, that there are at least 500,000 birds at Walvis Bay alone and that the birds which sit on one of those platforms eat no less than 75,000 tons of fish per annum. It is estimated that there are at least 3,000,000 birds on the eight platforms along the South West Africa coast, excluding the islands. If each one eats 300 lbs. of fish per annum (and I take a year to have 300 days to be on the conservative side) they devour 450,000 tons of fish per annum altogether, which is a terrific amount.</p>

<p>Similarly the seals along the coast of South West Africa play a large role in the destruction of our fish supplies. The varieties of seals which you find there, Sir, are mainly the arctocephalus pussilus. You find those in large numbers particularly at Cape Cross, also at Wolf&#x2019;s Bay and Atlas Bay and on the Holmsberg Island, Long Island, Albatross Rock, Sinclair Island, Staple Rocks and Boat Bay Rocks. These seals are protected to-day as a result of the ordinance which our local Legislative Council passed in 1949. As a matter of fact, the control is so strict to-day that if you are merely found in possession of a seal pelt you are liable to a maximum fine of R1,000 or one year imprisonment, or both. Only a small number of the seals are killed annually. The greatest number is only 50,000 per annum. An average number of 30,000 are being clubbed annually to-day. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort quoted figures in an attempt to indicate how much fish such a seal destroyed and he arrived at 10 lbs. per day. I have to point out that a seal eats practically as much fish as he can get and it is understandable that along the Cape coast where, as we all know, fish is not as plentiful as previously, he does not destroy more than 10 lbs. of fish per day. But along the South West African coast where fish is very plentiful and fish supplies practically inexhaustible the seals eat fish on a much bigger scale. As a matter of fact, it has been calculated that along the South West coast where fish is plentiful, the ordinary seal devours 30 lbs. of fish per day and on the basis that he only eats 300 days of the year, one seal devours 9,000 lbs. of fish per annum. Considering that it is estimated that we have 200,000 seals there it means that no less than 900,000 tons of fish is devoured by the seals annually. That means that annually the seals and the fish-eating birds together eat no less than 1,250,000 tons of South West Africa&#x2019;s good fish supplies. That is four times as much as the entire fish quota allocated to the six fish factories in South West Africa. For example, it is as much as half the total Russian fish production, which is the fourth highest in the world to-day. That clearly indicates that an end must be put some time or other to the destruction which is taking place along the West coast of South West Africa and the West coast of the Republic because our fishing industry has such a rosy future that we cannot be sufficiently on our guard to ensure that these fish eating birds and seals, from which after all the country derives very little revenue, do not destroy that profitable industry. The question which arises is what should you do with the seals and birds, Sir? Unlike the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) I am not in favour of shooting them left and right. We must try to retain the balance of nature. I maintain that we should at least reduce their numbers to such an extent that they will not constitute such a big danger to our fishing industry as they do to-day. You would have noticed, Sir, that the motion refers to the future development of the fishing industry along the West Cost of the Republic and of South West Africa. At one stage seal pelts fetched R60 each. The average price today is not more than R5. Seal oil sells at R40 per ton. The whelp yields .55 gallon of oil whereas the big seals, the klapmuts, yield something like 6 gallons of oil each. Thirty-three large seals yield one ton of fish meal. By merely destroying the natural increase of approximately 80,000 seals per annum, we will produce approximately 80,000 skins at a value of R400,000 and over and above that 100,000 gallons of oil, and as much as 320,000 tons of fish meal. In other words, the seal industry may become and important item in the country&#x2019;s ordinary revenue. The next question is what is to be done with the birds. I do not wish to go as far as the hon. member for Fort Beaufort who said that there were certain varieties whose eggs we should try to destroy. That will mean too great a loss to the industry and to the economy of the country. I think the best way of getting rid of those birds is to prepare them for the table. I do not know whether hon. members of this House have already eaten the Cape cormorant, but it is one of the tastiest delicacies to be found. Those people who are so keen on crayfish, oysters and abalone, will never look at those kinds of food once they have eaten a roasted Cape cormorant. I am convinced of that. If we could destroy 500,000 of these cormorants annually, just think what a wonderful source of revenue that would be to the country, Sir.</p>

<p>I think this motion has succeeded admirably in bringing home to hon. members the great destruction that is at present going on along the West coasts of the Republic and of South West Africa and I trust it will stimulate the interest of those with the capital and energy and enterprise to start one or other industry even if it is only the killing of those birds and preparing them as a tasty delicacy which we can all enjoy. It seems to me as though just by telling the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Bijl) about the Cape cormorant has made his mouth water. I wish to tell the hon. member for Fort Beaufort and the hon. member for Prinshof that we have appreciated the way in which they have introduced this motion.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down and also previous speakers, have given us a most interesting discourse on the value of the fishing industry. That is not exactly what we have before us in this motion. And may I say at once that from this side of the House we are out to do all we can to protect our valuable fishing industry. May I in passing say to the hon. member who has just sat down that I think when he comes here with his culinary proposals, he should be a bit careful. Judging by the look on the face of the hon. Minister of Justice just now the hon. member for Middelland may find himself banned if he is making proposals like that in the hearing of the hon. the Minister of Justice.</p>

<p>Sir, we have a proposal in front of us for the destruction, the extermination of seals and at least certain types of voracious seabirds. I want to come to this matter much more directly. I accept the value of the industry, I accept that we must protect it. What I am concerned with is the rough and ready proposals in regard to the methods of protection and I want to say that in my experience and in all my reading I have found that this type of proposal comes so readily to <i>homo sapiens </i>when he thinks that his interests are in any way being disturbed or adversely affected. So soon as mankind gets that idea in his head, he says &#x201C;Let us blot the other fellow out, let us get rid of him, let us exterminate him&#x201D;. But history is full of examples of how wrong such a policy of extermination has been. Over and over again has examples accrued in our history of steps of that nature being taken before an adequate and satisfactory and proved scientific basis for such steps had been established. That is the point I want to make here this afternoon I want to say at once quite frankly that I don&#x2019;t even go so far as this question of control which has been mooted. We talk glibly about the balance of nature. Now I defy any authority in the Republic of South Africa to tell us what is the balance of nature which upon being disturbed could have adverse influences on our fishing industry in South Africa in so far as the biology of the fish, the birds, the seals and the other marine animals are concerned.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that in all these measures when mankind uses measures which have been developed for the destruction of animals of all sorts, we have got to be careful that we do not really use those measures to our own hurt at a later stage. I want to give one or two examples if I may of what here in our country has followed from that kind of thing. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort dealt with locusts, army-worms, jackals, red-cats, and so forth. Let me for a moment deal with the question of locusts. Sir, up in Northern Zululand where we had frequent infestations of locusts many years ago and where breeding took place on a large scale, there was at that time a government, not the present Government, which decided to go in for large-scale poisoning of the &#x201C;voetgangers&#x201D; and poison-bait was put down in vast amounts over a very large area. The poison was picked up by the guinea-fowl in those districts, which existed there in countless thousands. All right, the locusts were destroyed, but so were the guinea-fowl, and the result to-day is that year after year we have some very widespread infestations of harvester ants. The harvester ant was the natural food of the guinea-fowl. The guinea-fowl was there in large numbers because it was preying on the harvester ant and the moment we destroyed the guinea-fowl, we destroyed the natural agent that was consuming the harvester ant. So to-day thousands upon thousands of acres of grassveld are denuded by the harvester ant year after year because in destroying the locusts we destroyed the predator for the harvester ant.</p>

<p>Hon. members must not be so simple in their thoughts. It is not necessary to use that particular type of destruction or destructive agent, that is my point. Let me give another example, and that applies in the Cape, in the farming areas, and I am a farmer myself. The hon. member made mention of jackal. There are areas today where there is no doubt whatever that the country is being overrun by dassies because the jackals have been destroyed. Hundreds upon hundreds of acres of grazing are being destroyed by dassies.</p>

<p>There are some things I would sooner have back than the hon. member with his interminable interjections. I listened to him most carefully when he was speaking, cannot he give me the courtesy of listening to me in the same way? There are two sides to this question, and I am putting this side for a scientific investigation into the whole of the basis of our fishing industry by people properly trained to carry out a survey of that kind, and to come to the Government. I want to say at once that in my opinion with an industry of the importance of the fishing industry, this ought not to be a private motion at all. It should be a matter to be dealt with at government level, and only <span class="col_2753-2754" refersTo="page_1393"/>when the Government is satisfied that the measures that it is proposing to take can be justified because of the clearest possible scientific information upon which it is acting, should steps be taken. I want to come for a moment to another example. In my own province, Sir, we put a very heavy price on leopards many years ago, and we killed them off till they were virtually exterminated. Then we found baboons increasing, monkeys increasing, wild pig, the bush-pig increasing. All over the country we were getting complaints of the damage being done by these various animals. Until we had a survey carried out to determine what the trouble was. Why this sudden upsurge in the populations of these animals, even alongside our towns? And the answer came back: You have killed out the leopards. And now, far from there being a price on the head of the leopard, the leopard is specially protected and very heavy penalties are employed. And the other day a survey was carried out in one of our nature reserves. We found that with the increase of the leopards, the baboons, the bush pigs, the monkeys, and what is more the jackals are being wiped out. Evidence was obtained and proven over and over again by actual spoor on the site of the remains that the leopards were killing out the jackal. Sir, until these things are gone into on a proper basis, it is hard to evaluate precisely the factors that operate in nature, and I want to say that so far as a proposal of this kind is concerned, only the clearest possible evidence should be used to permit of steps of this character being taken. We have people in the Cape here. I think for a moment of a known ornithologist, like Dr. Broekhuysen, I think of Dr. Dey, and others like that, people who are very highly qualified, and who could be used for the purpose, not in a month or two, but over a long period, to study this matter. Sir, don&#x2019;t let us try and disturb nature, don&#x2019;t let us talk about the balance of nature when we don&#x2019;t know what the balance is. Let us establish our facts. The figures quoted by the hon. member for Simonstown, the figures quoted by the hon. member for Middelland, they all show that the fishing industry is on the up-and-up. There is no immediate threat. There is time. We are not under pressure to get this issue settled in a day or a week. Time can be taken. Let us put the true interests of South Africa first, and let us see that we do not now in ignorance take a step which is going to jeopardize the future. Let us use natural means, if at all possible, and come last of all with our bombs and our guns, and destroy these creatures, even limit them, even control them, as it is called, unless it is clearly shown on scientific evidence that is the proper method to deal with the fishing industry. I want to make this point: All over the world wild life conservationists have shown that the loss of life in any given group of mammals and other types of animals is in the earlier stages and in the later stages of the life of the individual in that group. It is the babies and the old individuals that usually lose their lives the easiest. But a great deal of good is done to a species if you have got something which is continually preying upon the old and the ailing and the failing and the diseased in those particular groups. Where the young ones are concerned, that is a natural curtailing, and it may well be that we would like to see the animal life that preys upon the young fish done away with whereas we would leave those that prey upon the fish at the end of their lives. What we are concerned with is producing the greatest possible amount of fish in our waters of the greatest quality. And in my own opinion the hon. member for Simonstown made that point very admirably indeed. It is not merely the number, it is the quality equally, and that is the point that we have got to bear in mind. It is no good producing a lot of poor quality. It is better to produce less of a high quality. That is the point my friend made. Those are the kind of things that can only be dealt with by a scientific survey, and I hope the Government will refuse to allow itself to be jockeyed into accepting a motion of this kind until that survey has been made. When the time comes we must be able to establish beyond dispute that the steps taken are the best and the wisest steps to give us the maximum amount of fish of the highest quality to the benefit of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I wish, in the first place to express my appreciation to the mover and the seconder of this motion and other speakers for the way in which they have presented this matter to us. This is a matter where there are two sides to the picture. Some people are great champions of the idea of destroying the seals and predatory birds. On the other hand you have those people who equally champion the idea that nature should be allowed to take its course and that we should not interfere in the way suggested in the motion, namely that these seals and birds should be exterminated. The catching of seals and the gathering of guano along our coasts are very old industries. It goes back to the earliest days of settlement at the Cape. It is interesting to note that ships came here as long ago as that to obtain this valuable guano and these seal skins from our islands. There are numbers of islands around our coasts which are very inhospitable. They are exposed to the elements. There is no vegetation, but that is where these sea birds gather and deposit the guano and it is also the home of the Cape seal which has a valuable skin. Round about 1843 great interest was shown in this coast, namely in the island Ickaboe, close to South West. There was a big concentration and the entire guano industry in Africa was concentrated on that island. It was practically no man&#x2019;s land. Shortly after it was discovered that there were large deposits of this valuable guano, which was called white gold at the time, the ships of the world <span class="col_2755-2756" refersTo="page_1394"/>started to descend upon this island and at one stage in 1844, there were about 250 of these boats at the island. A storm came up and a great number of these sailing boats were destroyed. Some of the sailors who had been in the battle of Trafalgar said that the destruction amongst the boats was worse than in the battle of Trafalgar. Shortly afterwards the supply on that island was practically exhausted. At one stage there were over 400 boats loading guano. It was estimated that the guano was lying 40 ft. deep. That island was cleared of it but round about 1861 that island and other islands were annexed and became part of the Cape Colony. From the outset permits were issued to people to collect the guano as well as the seal skins, and it was only in 1898 that the division of State Guano Islands was formed. In 1951 that division was transferred from the Agricultural Department to the Department of Economic Affairs. It is the task of this Department to exercise control over these islands, over the collection of guano, over the destruction of the seals there, over the manufacture of seal oil as well as over the preparation of the skins before they are sent overseas. It has always been an important industry and it has never been in the danger in which it is to-day, because it was only since fishing on a commercial basis was started on a large scale along our coast that representations have been made that the seals should be destroyed and that the pedatory birds should be destroyed.</p>

<p>It is perhaps necessary to go into the commercial value of the guano as well as that of the seal skins before we consider this younger industry, namely the fishing industry which came into existence at a later stage and whose interests clash to a certain extent with those of the older industry.</p>

<p>As far as the guano itself is concerned, it contains nitrogen, phospheric oxide and calcium. It is a very important fertilizer which is used by vegetable farmers in particular. It is true that the cost per unit at which it is sold to the farmer, namely R33 per ton, is much lower than the cost of collecting it which is R44 per ton. But nevertheless there is a very big demand for guano because it contains a nitrogen/ammonium compound and urinic acid which is absent from the other kinds of fertilizer available in the country. Not only does it feed the plant itself but it also enriches the soil. The farmers regard this guano as being of greater value than any fertilizer in the form of artificial manure. Ordinary fertilizer sell at approximately R22 up to R35, that is the fertilizer which more or less takes the place of guano, but nonetheless farmers are very anxious to get this form of fertilizer because it is better. It has been said that fish meal could be used in its stead. I am not sure whether it was the hon. member for Fort Beaufort who said that, but fish meal is not used as a fertilizer direct into the soil. It is fed to animals and it is not a substitute for guano. Fish meal costs R80 per ton, which is much higher than the price of guano. This guano is only made available to vegetable farmers. There is a very big demand for it and the Department has always allocated it on a quota basis. In 1961, for example, allocations varied from one bag to 375 bags per applicant. The greatest number of applicants are in the Cape Province&#x2014;particularly in the Western Province&#x2014;and 86 per cent is allocated to them. Twelve per cent goes to the Transvaal and the other provinces receive far less. In 1951 nearly 56,000 bags were allocated to over 2,000 farmers. These farmers pay only R33 per ton. The actual cost of collecting it is R44 per ton but as in the case of all fertilizer a subsidy of R2 per ton is paid in this case. There is still a deficit and this is covered by a second subsidy. The whole idea is that the collection of this guano should not involve the Department in any losses, but neither does it make any profit out of it. I want to make it quite clear, therefore, that the Department of Commerce and Industry derive no profit from the collection of guano. It is a service which the Department is rendering and no administrative costs are included when calculating the costs of collecting it. All the administrative costs are set off against the revenue derived from the seal skins. Last year a total of 6,000 tons was collected and it was sold for R150,000. When you make a comparison with the figures for previous years it becomes clear that the collection of guano is showing a downward trend. Up to 1928 10,000 tons were collected. That has decreased and in 1960 it was a little over 4,000 tons. We see, therefore, that there is a downward trend and it is alleged that proves the fact that the birds are decreasing and that there are not as many of them as there were previously. In 1910 more than 600,000 penguin eggs were collected; by 1936 it had decreased to 400,000; in 1959 over 100,000 were collected. Those figures also show a downward trend. Far fewer penguin eggs are available on these islands. During the past three years no eggs were collected for the very reason that there were so few and because it appeared that the chickens were dying on a large scale on the islands. Penguin eggs were sold at roughly R2.50 per two dozen. That is over 1s. per egg. Seventy Whites and approximately 400 non-Whites are employed on these islands. They collect guano for nine months of the year and for the other three they kill seals. Legislation was envisaged in 1959. A Bill was actually introduced to protect these birds but it was withdrawn because even at that time strong pressure was brought to bear to withdraw all protective measures. That pressure came in particular from the large number of fishermen about whom we were concerned.</p>

<p>The position is somewhat different as far as the seals are concerned. This industry does indeed yield revenue. Since 1945 in particular there has been an increase in the number of seals caught. Since then it has practically trebled. When we make an analysis of the seal population it appears that since 1950 up to 1961, for example, the number of seals <span class="col_2757-2758" refersTo="page_1395"/>killed by the Union Government has increased from 10,000 to nearly 15,000. The number of seals killed by private people has risen from 16,000 to 28,000. There has therefore been an increase in the total of 27,000 up to 42.000. You see, therefore, Sir, that there has been an increasing attempt to kill seals. The revenue which is derived from the sale of seal skins, which are mostly sold in the United States of America, is approximately R137,000. A few are sold on the local market, but those are the skins which are discarded. The sale of seal oil overseas amounted to approximately R3,000,000. The total income, therefore, was approximately R430,000. The average price of a seal skin in the United States is $38. It costs R14 to acquire it. The estimated cost per unit to the Department is approximately R2.76. It shows a profit, therefore. According to the data which I have at my disposal it seems that since 1952 the total profit made from the catching of seals has been an average of approximately R40,000. Well, that is not a big profit. No strong argument can, therefore, be advanced that this is an economic industry. It pays for itself and it is doing a service as far as the provision of guano and the sale of the popular skins are concerned. But it is not an industry which is of very great economic value in itself.</p>

<p>As against that our fishing industry has developed particularly after World War II. We have had a great amount of data to show to what extent the fishing industry has developed, what proportions it has assumed. Hon. members clearly indicated that it was not only the people employed on the boats who benefited by the fishing, but that there were many associated industries which offered a livelihood to many other people. In 1961, for example&#x2014; these figures are in respect of the Republic alone: I also have the figures in respect of South West Africa but I do not wish to say too much about that&#x2014;our production of fish meal was 119,000 tons. But there is a very strong tendency upwards. Since 1958 the production of oil has increased by 13,000 tons to 40,000. Fish meal from 56,000 tons to 119,000. During the same year there has been an increase in canned fish from 770,000 tons to over 1,000,000 tons. Walvis Bay and South West Africa have shown the same tendency. Last year the total value of fish meal produced by both the Republic and South West Africa was over R12,000,000. In the case of canned fish the figure was R23,000,000; oil R6,000,000: the crayfish industry over R6,000,000. I am not including fresh fish. I am only dealing with the fish which are eaten by the birds and the seals, namely, the commercial fish. We derived something over R50,000,000 revenue from that. Having heard the other data which hon. members have given us, it is not necessary for me to re-emphasize the importance of the fishing industry. What these data do prove to us, however, is the fact that many more fish are being caught. There are approximately 58 factories. We are already sixth in the world as far as our exports of fish are concerned. We have a total fishing fleet of nearly 5,500. It is of great economic value, therefore. Reference has been made to the quotas in respect of South West Africa. Those have been increased. As far as our own commercial fish is concerned as well; fish have recently been caught on an appreciable larger scale. We no longer have the limitations on the tonnage wich he had previously, although there is a limitation as far as the duration of the season is concerned.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that we all agree that in spite of the seals and the predatory birds, fishing has increased appreciably along our coasts. It has not decreased on account of the fact that there are still so many seals. Sen. Pettersen introduced a motion in the Senate in 1954. As a result of that motion the Department issued instructions that research should be conducted into the predatory habits of these birds and a fairly accurate survey was made. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort said that there was convincing proof and he gave certain data. I do not want to go into all those details, but as far as the predatory birds are concerned, he referred to the three reports, namely that of Davies of 1956 and 1958. But further reports have since appeared. I do not know whether he is aware of that.</p>

<p>Further reports are available namely that of Rand which appeared in 1959-60, which is also in respect of these three variety of birds, namely, the malagash, the cormorant and the pengiun. It is clear that the latest data have been acquired on a much more scientific basis than the previous data. Certain factors were taken into account which were not considered in the other case. That was the very object so Davies and Rand were asked to work independent of one another so that we would have the findings of two scientists at our disposal. The results which they obtained are not precisely the same. It leaves room for a difference in approach but it has enabled the Department more or less to make data available which may be regarded as reasonably accurate. This research has lasted up till recently and there are reports which have not yet been published which are under consideration at the moment. Rand has followed up his recent reports with a report on the bird population of the islands round the Cape and the bird population of the islands off South West Africa; also with a further report on the Cape pelt seal and its habits on land and at sea. You will, therefore, see, Sir. that the Department is still conducting research, and further publications will appear shortly.</p>

<p>It is clear from these reports that there is a big difference between the calculations of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort and the Fisheries <span class="col_2759-2760" refersTo="page_1396"/>Department. As far as the seals are concerned, it appears from the data which have been acquired from surveys and aerial photographs, taking into account the seals which were not on the islands&#x2014;they even went further and took into account areas which were not taken into account when the first reports were submitted, so that this survey is in round the Republic, 18,000 of which are whelps, approximately 50,000 seals in the waters round the Republic, 18,000 of which are There are 10,000 along the coast of South West Africa of which 54,000 are whelps. There is therefore a total of approximately 200,000 seals. The following calculation is based on the assumption that a seal eats 10 lb. of fish per day, which is also the calculation made by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort. That is also taken as the basis in the latest calculation which has not as yet been published. On that basis it appears that the seals along our coasts eat approximately 16,000 tons of fish, of which over 13,000 is commercial fish&#x2014;sardine, marsbankers and mackerel, 2,800 Cape tons of other fish and crayfish 200 tons. Along the coast of South West seals catch a total variety of other fish to the tune of 50,000 tons. It appears from surveys made by people who went to live on the islands&#x2014;they did not only take photographs from day to day. but they studied the position; some of these scientists themselves went to live there&#x2014;that the seal does not eat every day and that his breeding habits were such that it could not go out to catch fish every day.</p>

<p>As far as sea birds are concerned, it is estimated that the bird population round the Republic is as follows: Malagash 82,000; penguins 197,000. cormorants 120,000. The figures in respect of South West Africa are fairly higher. As far as the fish which they catch are concerned, it is calculated that it is 10,500 tons per annum in the case of the malagash, of which practically three quarter is commercial fish. Penguins catch 16,000 tons, of which half is commercial fish. The cormorant catches 8,500 tons of which the majority is not commercial fish. It is estimated therefore, that as far as the malagash. the penguin and the cormorant are concerned, they catch a total of 35,000 tons of fish per annum, and the seals 16,000 tons per annum: a total, therefore, of approximately 50,000 of which 40,000 is commercial fish. I cannot agree 100 per cent, therefore, as a result of the calculations made by the Department and these scientists, that a total tonnage of something over 700.000 is caught. I am not sure whether the figures in respect of South West are included in that figure. There is a big difference, therefore, as far as this estimate is concerned. That of the Department, as a result of the investigations conducted by these scientists, is approximately 50,000 tons and that of the mover 700,000 tons.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>There is a big difference in the estimate, therefore. The Department is still trying to go into the matter scientifically as possible.</p>

<p>As far as South West Africa is concerned the figures are considerably higher. I have indicated that the seals are still being destroyed and it is calculated that practically one out of every four or five seals is being destroyed. In the United States of America where they are trying to keep the seals established without destroying them, they destroy only 4 per cent. We are already destroying 20 per cent. The data at our disposal indicate that the seals are being caught on an increasing scale and that the seal rookeries are getting smaller. There has also been a decline in the number of predatory birds as is proved by the supply of available guano. There has also been a decrease in the number of seals as a result of the rising tendency to destroy them.</p>

<p>During the course of the debate the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) has referred to certain happenings in False Bay. I can only say that by means of its research boats the Department is trying to keep an eye on what is happening and to prevent contraventions. We are envisaging a patrol boat at the moment. The money for it has already been voted and we hope that this patrol boat will shortly be built. In the meantime our inspectors are watching the actions of both the boats and the fishermen along our coasts. I can, however, assure the hon. member that if he will submit those complaints to me I shall get my Department to go into them very thoroughly. I hope we will be able to satisfy him and that we will be able to ensure that nobody commits a contravention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland (Mr. P. S. van der Merwe), has referred to South West Africa but I do not wish to say much about South West because fishing off the South West coast falls under the Administration there. The policy in respect of those waters is therefore not a matter which belongs here. Although the motion is sufficiently wide to include that as well. I do not think it falls within the ambit of my reply to say on behalf of the South West African Administration what is happening there and what their policy is. As far as the cormorants are concerned, the hon. member suggested that they should be exploited commercially and that the cormorant was very palatable. I think hon. members were somewhat surprised at that because I do not think anybody was aware of this new delicacy which he has discovered. I think we should suggest that he asks us to dinner. Although the fishing industry constitutes one of my responsibilities and he is a cattle farmer I wish to suggest to him that when he does invite us as his guests to that dinner, he should nonetheless provide an alternative beef dish.</p>

<p><span class="col_2761-2762" refersTo="page_1397"/>Reference has also been made to certain monopolistic groups which are alleged to be influencing the findings of scientists. I do not know on what grounds the hon. member for Fort Beaufort made that statement.</p>

<p>The scientific reports with which we are dealing at the moment are dated very very far from 1925. In case it may create the impression that it is in respect of the scientific reports of either Mr. Rand or Mr. Davies or even the scientist, Mr. Matthews, I want to state emphatically that I have gone into the matter and I have been assured that not one of these scientists has had pressure to bear on him by any group of people with monopolistic tendencies, or that he has allowed himself to be influenced by people like that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion is a very far-reaching motion. It amounts to the destruction of the seals as well as that of the predatory birds. Although we appreciate the importance of the fishing industry and although we wish to protect their interests at all times, I want to point out that we are still destroying these animals to some extent, that data indicate that the number of seals are decreasing, that data indicate that the predatory birds are diminishing and I can assure you, Sir, that the Department is keeping a very watchful eye over the position. If it should appear at all that the numbers are increasing action will be taken, either by destroying the seals on a larger scale or in a different way or by reducing the number of birds. The position is being watched in case it becomes a greater danger. In the meantime as soon as these data are available to the Department, data which will shortly be published, the whole position will again be gone into. But I really do not think that we should go so far as to accept it as policy that these seals and these birds should be destroyed completely. We should leave something to nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the one idea that has emerged very clearly from this debate has been the fact that the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs expects the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. P. S. van der Merwe) to invite him to lunch so that he can sample the delicacy of grilled cormorant. For the rest, Sir, there has been such a conflict of opinion that unless one is an expert in these matters, in marine biology, the fisheries industry and for that matter in natural life, it is very difficult to come to a conclusion that will do justice to the subject.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I am impressed by the fact that whereas the Deputy Minister has said that the diminution in the total available supplies of fish due to the predatory activities of both seals and cormorants and other birds of that type, is of the order of 50,000 tons a year, the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) says it is of the order of 70,000 tons a year.</p>

<p>It may well be, Sir, that was the position. What leads me to quite a different conclusion is the statement by the Deputy Minister that the number of seals and cormorants and birds of that type is in fact diminishing year by year. Now, Sir, if he is right in saying that, then far from the seals and the cormorants reducing the stocks of fish available, it appears that the fish are reducing the stocks of seals and cormorants available.</p>

<p>Why don&#x2019;t you read the report?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not claim to have read the report, Sir, but I have tried to listen as attentively as I could to the debate in this House this morning and tried to accept, as being made in good faith, the statements that were made both by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort and by the Deputy Minister. What I am suggesting, Sir, is that both those extremes of fact&#x2014;if you can call them facts&#x2014; cannot be correct. It is possible that, as usual, the truth lies somewhere between the two. Now the question arises whether there would be any public service rendered to the country by the proposal of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort that seals should be exterminated, and I would like to deal firstly with the seals. <span class="col_2763-2764" refersTo="page_1398"/>Extermination is a very drastic remedy for any sort of evil or so-called evil that arises from the activities of a living thing, whether it is an animal or human being. Therefore, one is reluctant to accept that as being the correct solution, but in the case of seals I, for one, believe that it might create a very peculiar situation if we were to adopt the recommendation contained in this motion, to exterminate all seals. For one thing, the Government would have to set itself the task by some means or other of making sure that seals would constantly be exterminated as they appeared. No one has the foggiest idea as to how that is going to be done and what the cost involved is in exterminating for all time all the seals that appear on our coasts. That is one problem which has not been touched on in the debate.</p>

<p>But looking at it from the point of view of the ordinary layman&#x2014;and most people are laymen where seals are concerned&#x2014;why should we go about exterminating this animal merely because it adopts the natural means of livelihood in the animal world of preying on another form of life? Is that in itself a reason why seals should be exterminated? Because in that case there is hardly a single form of life on this earth that justifies its own existence on the basis that it does not prey on any other form of life, and I speak of the entire universe in that respect because human beings also depend for their sustenance on living things, and they usually exploit living things. Thus I wonder whether hon. members will be very enthusiastic about this motion, as enthusiastic as the mover of the motion appears to be. I have a great deal of respect for a sealskin coat. I have never worn one, but whenever I have stroked a sealskin coat&#x2014;and, of course. I refer to the coat and not to the wearer&#x2014;I have been struck by the fact that it is a particularly gentle, glossy, warm sort of fur. It may be that we are rendering a public service on the one hand by exterminating the seals, but I submit that in a very short time when all the stocks of sealskin have been used up, and they cannot be kept in cold storage for very long, there will be a clamour going up from the women of this country about the fact that it is no longer possible to buy a seal skin coat because there are no seals left. With that I would like to leave the hon. member for Fort Beaufort to ponder on whether or not he is doing what he set out to do, a service to South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful to the House, and also to the hon. the Deputy Minister for the information he has given us. It seems quite clear that we did not always argue on the same matters. The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) thought that the whole motion was limited only to protecting the fishing industry, whereas the motion also refers to the expansion of the fishing industry. He should therefore note that if we want to expand the fishing industry to the maximum, we must in fact kill all those animals which exterminate the fish in order that the industry may expand.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member who spoke last that the difference between the calculation of the hon. the Deputy Minister and my calculation is that the Deputy Minister only took into account the commercial fish eaten by these animals, where I took into account all kinds of fish which they eat, because the fish which is not commercial fish serves as food for the other fish which are in fact commercial. If one takes 50,000 seals each eating 10 lbs. of fish a day throughout the year, it comes to appreciably more than the hon. the Minister calculated. But I have already said that I am grateful for the discussion and for the attention the Minister gave to it. I am sure he will continue to keep an eye on the best interest of this great industry, and with that I think I should now like to move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S.M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think in opening this debate I am taking the discussions of this House from the realms of the general to the realms of the particular. I find that in Public Service Commission reports year after year the same resolution is moved, and this has been done for many years. It is brought to the notice of the Minister year after year and I must say that I gathered the impression from statements made by previous Ministers in the House that they intended doing something about this, and that something has been done. But at this stage I think I should first state my motion as it appears on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that the Government should consider the advisability of the gradual application of the principle of equal pay scales for men and women in the Public Service where the work performed is of equal quality and responsibility.</block>

<p>To continue, I take, for instance, the fact that in 1958 when the cost of living was included <span class="col_2765-2766" refersTo="page_1399"/>in the salary scale and the attitude was adopted that the cost of living would be included in the salary scales of the men whether they were married or unmarried, but it was not to be included in the salary scales of women, and some 700 women suffered under that decision, it was put right the year after that by the Minister. But as I say, every year I find the same resolution and in the last report of the Public Service Commission which I have for 1960 there is once again a decision taken by the Public Servants&#x2019; Joint Advisory Council, saying to the Minister that this Council requests the Commission to devote further attention to the position of women in the Public Service having regard to the principle of equal pay for equal work. I want to say very clearly that this is the principle on which I stand. I am not asking to-day that women should be given equal pay with men for work that is inferior to that of a man, but if the woman does exactly the same amount of work as a man in the same grade, then I feel she is entitled to the same salary. And this is the trend in the modem world. We find that more and more women are going out to work. Whereas previously it was the unmarried woman who had to go out to work, and she worked as long as she was single, and when she was married she left the service &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>She stopped working.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S.M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>No, she only changed her employer and did not go back to the service. But now that is changed because of the changing conditions in our industrial world, because of the higher cost of living and because of the increasing difficulties that men find in caring for themselves and their families on their own salaries alone. Therefore more and more women go out to work. The trend in the modern world is that where women are employed in all industrialized countries society is becoming increasingly more aware of the injustice of the fact that there is not equal pay for equal work. I want to say that in the universal declaration of human rights this is one of the resolutions adopted. This was a world organization, and in this organization where all nations took part, this resolution was reached that there should be equal pay for equal work. In the International Labour Organization at the convention they held in 1955 they also decided that this principle should be adopted. This was immediately ratified by 14 member nations and it has thereafter been ratified by many more member nations. It is of course true that in some instances women have been employed in certain professions for as long as men. In others they have not been employed for such a long time, but have more recently come to be employed. I was rather interested to see the figures we have in our own Public Service. I find that in our administrative section where there are 15,385 men employed, there are 3,089 women. In the general B section, which is also portion of the administrative section, there are 16,954 men employed, but here there are 17,340 women. Actually there are more women employed in this particular section than men. There are, of course, other women employed in professional posts. In the higher administrative posts there are 250 women, while there are 5,469 men. In the vocational section there are 5,800 posts, and there are not quite 1,000 women employed there. In the technical posts there are 8,315, and of these only a small number of women. In the general A post, there are 3,599 posts and there are not many women employed at all. In certain of these professional posts there are equal salaries for men and women. This post is there as a post and the person who is appointed to that post draws that salary and there is no difference between men and women holding the post. When I quoted just now that the International Labour Organization at their convention decided that this should be applied as a principle throughout the whole of the Western world, I said that this had happened some years back in 1954 or 1955, but since then other nations have followed and I find that in 1955 there is a copy of a Treasury minute dated 2 February 1955, concerning the payment on Supplementary Estimates of certain sums required for the implication of a scheme of gradual introduction of equal pay for men and women civil servants. So that in Britain it was considered a matter of such importance that supplementary estimates were introduced to deal with the matter. I find it very interesting indeed that when Canada introduced it in 1957 there was a pamphlet issued by the Department of Labour which said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The Female Employees Equal Pay Act, which came into effect in October 1956, is designed to ensure that women doing work which was identical or substantially identical with that being done by men shall not be paid a lower wage rate than the latter.</block>

<p>Then it goes through the history of the matter and they also mention the universal declaration of human rights, where the principle of equal pay for equal work was proclaimed. But I find that in Canada they say that in a considerable number of occupations, both industrial and professional, some women have been employed as long as men; within the past few decades, however, the number of working women has increased substantially until at the present time they have come to be an essential and stable element in the labour force. Sir, I want to emphasize this, that they are a stable element in the labour force, because I have examined the figures of resignations in our own Public Service and I find that the resignations are more or less equal for men and women. Sometimes this is made a reason for not giving the women equal pay. The argument is used that the <span class="col_2767-2768" refersTo="page_1400"/>women will be trained and spend some years with the Department, that she will learn to do the job properly and when she has reached the peak of her production she will leave the service because she gets married, or for some other reason. But that is not true in the modern world, and as I have said, a study of our own Public Service will illustrate that very clearly indeed. But I will come back to that later.</p>

<p>I find that in Canada, which is a highly industrialized country, in which direction we are also moving&#x2014;I would not say that we in South Africa to-day are as highly industrialized as Canada but we are rapidly moving in that direction&#x2014;women are regarded as a stable and essential element in the labour force. They say that more than 1,250,000 women at present engaged in gainful work in Canada constitute 23 per cent of the total of employed persons; they form 22 per cent of all persons engaged in manufacturing, well over half of those engaged in service occupations, and 48 per cent of professionally engaged personnel, and even more striking are the proportions in certain essential and individual occupations. For instance, women constitute 97 per cent of all telephone operators, 96 per cent of all stenographers and typists, 89 per cent of all sewing machine operators, 72 per cent of all teachers, and then they go on to give the percentage of those engaged in laundry and cleaning and they say 62 per cent of all bookkeepers and cashiers and 55 per cent of all sales staff are women. This is an impressive figure and I want to say that this compares with the figures we have in South Africa. I want to say that I think that if all women civil servants downed tools today the Civil Service would not be able to carry on at all. While there has been an indication on the part of past Ministers of Labour that they intend equalizing the rates of pay for women in the various jobs I have mentioned, there are still a good many instances where the pay is far from equal, especially in the general B Section, where there are more women than men. These are the posts where I feel it is absolutely necessary that the Minister should devote attention to the matter.</p>

<p>In the modern world women have to play their part. It is no longer possible for a woman to stay at home, which we all feel is the ideal. We like to picture the woman in the home, sitting there looking after her children, darning her husband&#x2019;s socks and keeping his slippers warm, and I realize that I am speaking in a man&#x2019;s world. We all like to see that picture, but that is no longer a practical picture. The woman usually has to do that after she has come from work. Then she has the added burden of looking after the male of the species who is helpless and cannot look after himself. So I say that in the modern world the position is that in our industries and in every sphere of life women are essential, and it is time that more attention was paid to the women and to equalizing the rates of pay for the job where they are doing absolutely the same work as men. I am no feminist, Sir. I do not stand up here to play off the women against the men. I have no intention of doing it. I have maintained that unless a woman is able to do exactly the same job as a man, she should not try to do it, but I also say that there are many jobs which the woman does as well as a man, and I can only point to this honourable House. I have already said that in the professions and in the Civil Service there are posts which are advertised as posts and not especially for men or women.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will see from the Bill that it is a very brief Bill. It is an easy Bill to <span class="col_2769-2770" refersTo="page_1401"/>explain and one with but a single purpose. This Bill intends to provide that Native women whose husbands have been killed through the negligence or other unlawful act of any other person should be placed in the same position as any other woman who is in that position. There is nothing new in the provisions of this Bill so far as public interest is concerned and the Government&#x2019;s attention to the matter. It was raised earlier by the late Mr. Sarel Tighy in the first place. Then the Minister of Justice was asked a question in the House as to whether his attention had been drawn to a decision of the Supreme Court, which provided that Native women in these circumstances were not, through what I submit is a freak of law, able to claim compensation. The Minister of Justice at the time said that the matter had been referred to the Law Revision Committee. It was indeed referred to that Committee and it has been with that Committee ever since.</p>

<p>One must appreciate at the outset that a Native may marry in two ways. Firstly, he may marry according to Native law and custom and enter into a customary union, and under this system he may take more partners than one. On the other hand, he may enter into what is known as a marriage according to civil or Christian rites, whereunder he may not take more than one partner. As far as the Native woman is concerned who is married according to Christian or civil rites, there is no problem. She may recover damages where her husband is killed through the negligence of someone else. The extraordinary situation we have to-day is that if the Native husband is injured he can recover damages. If the Native wife is injured, she may recover damages, and the children may recover damages if injured. But if the husband is killed, we have the situation that the children of that marriage, no matter how the parents were married, may recover damages, but if the husband is killed through the negligence of somebody else the wife cannot recover damages. The anomaly is this, and I want to draw the attention of the Minister of Justice to this, that if such a case is tried in the Native Commissioner&#x2019;s Court a Native woman may recover damages if her husband is killed, where she is married in terms of Native law and custom. She may recover damages for loss of support of her dead husband. There are three Native Appeal Court cases on this that is the last word on this subject, to the effect that there is nothing which debars the widow in such circumstances from claiming. Boiled down to an even more simple form, what this Bill aims to provide is that where that woman&#x2019;s husband is killed by a European, or where that woman wants to sue an insurance company under the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act (it is only in those circumstances that she is debarred) she may recover damages. You see, Sir, a Native woman cannot sue an insurance company if her husband was killed by, say, a Native driver of a motor vehicle because the action would lie against the company and the company is not a Native, and only cases between Natives and Natives can be tried in the Native Commissioner&#x2019;s court.</p>

<p>I have purposely separated this Bill from what seemed to be the ancillary (and perhaps necessarily ancillary) matter of the status of a Native woman generally, and I have done so because I did not want to complicate this issue with a consideration of what affects a change of status of a Native woman will have if this law were to be applied in that way, and also because it is only this single injustice that I hope will be cured by this Bill.</p>

<p>This matter was raised, it would appear, some time ago when one of the hon. members of this House, a little distraught as to what the Law Revision Committee was doing, or rather what it was not doing, asked the parliamentary draftsman to draft a Bill providing for the same sort of thing as this. He apparently submitted it to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the <i>Star</i> of 18 May 1960 reported that the principle of this Bill had been accepted by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and I hope, seeing that the hon. the Minister of Justice is here, that he will see his way clear also to accepting and agreeing to the principle which is contained in this Bill.</p>

<p>This matter first came before the courts in a Natal case, a Zulu case, in which His Lordship Mr. Justice Holmes found that the widow could not claim for the reason that the plaintiff widow was not legally married to the deceased, and therefore she had no legal right to support and therefore could not claim against the insurance company.</p>

<p>She was in the position of an ordinary concubine.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that was the basis of the reasoning. It was a polygamous union and therefore was not recognized by the court. The affect of that is that the court said that it was against public policy to recognize such a marriage. Of course, one must appreciate when one talks loosely about these things, when one talks strictly about what is against public policy, when one talks about what is a concubine, that the learned Judges are there not to moralize, they are there to apply the strict law, and I think one must bear in mind when one considers these decisions that the Native Administration Act of 1927, which is the bugbear in this whole matter and which provides the block in the way of the widow seeking compensation, because in the further proviso to Section 11 (1) it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided further that it shall not be lawful for any court to declare that the custom <span class="col_2771-2772" refersTo="page_1402"/>of Lobola or Bogadi or any similar custom is repugnant to such principle.</block>

<p>That is to say, the principle of public policy! The custom of Lobola is an essential requirement of the Native customary union, and this proviso, read with Sections 22 and 23 of the Native Administration Act, makes it clear that the customary union is not against public policy. In fact, the Native Administration Act goes so far as to provide that if the Native Commissioner&#x2019;s Court were not to recognize it, then that would be regarded in itself as a breach of one of the instructions in that Act.</p>

<p>After this decision the General Council of the Bar submitted a memorandum to the Law Revision Committee, suggesting that a female partner to a customary union should be given the right to recover compensation for the unlawful causing of the death of her male partner. Then, as I say, it went to the Law Revision Committee, and the Ninth Report is concerned with the affect that the introduction of such a principle would have on the position of a wife in Moslem and other laws which permit of polygamy; that has nothing to do with this. In the Tenth Report, paragraph 7, we find that the Committee is still investigating the matter. I am coming back to that Report because the hon. the Minister of Justice necessarily will have to have regard to it, and I hope that I will be able to dispose of any of the difficulties that the hon. the Minister has in regard to that Report.</p>

<p>The final word on this matter has now been said. The Appellate Division decided in Fondo&#x2019;s case in 1960 that there was no right vested in a Native widow to claim compensation when her partner had been killed through the negligence of somebody else. The Appellate Division did say, however, that if there was a right to claim damages under Native Law in the Native Commissioner&#x2019;s Court, which they did not deny but which they did not decide upon as it did not concern them as they were applying strictly Roman-Dutch Law, it was an anomaly which could give rise to a feeling of absurdity. I think the hon. the Minister and hon. members will agree that it must give rise to a feeling of absurdity because in effect it means that if a Bantu female&#x2019;s husband is killed by a Native, then she can claim, and if he is killed by a European she cannot claim. The court went on to say (this is my translation because the judgment was in Afrikaans) that such result could be expected in a multi-racial community where the affairs of one race could be governed by a personal system of law operating within the framework of the common law governing other races. The situation is an anomaly, especially when one considers that the large mass of Natives to-day live in the urban areas as a permanent part of those urban areas, and the system of law which applies to them in every other regard is the system of law which applies to the European and to the other races in that area.</p>

<p>The Law Revision Committee said that it had considered this matter but decided that it was not desirable at this time to propose any legislation or to support any legislation dealing with this matter. I want to say at the outset that this Law Revision Committee consists of very eminent legal men including the Chief Justice or his representative, representatives of the Bar, representatives of the Judges President, the Side Bar, the State Attorney and so on, but they are not versed in Native Law. They are not versed in that system of law which governs the relationship between Native and Native. They are not versed in the practice of those courts in which the bulk of Native litigation takes place, which includes not only Native Law but the legal obligations which arise between Natives when Roman Dutch Law is applied, which are all the normal commercial dealings amongst them, and all the cases relating to their status, divorce and so on. At any rate, they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In die loop van die beraadslagings is onder meer die volgende sienswyses uitge-spreek &#x2026;</block>

<p>The first one is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indien die voorgestelde wetgewing sou deurgaan, met die gevolg dat &#x2019;n nie-Bantoe met inagneming van Bantoereg aanspreeklik gestel sou kon word, sal dit die eerste geval wees van deurbraak van Naturellereg in die lewens, verhoudings en reg van die Blanke en van ander nie-Bantoes.</block>

<p>I do not believe that this is a valid point to make, for the simple reason that both systems of law overlap. They overlap to a large degree. I think perhaps one of the classic examples is the provision which is made for a civil marriage in which it is specifically provided&#x2014;a civil marriage, of course, is not a customary union&#x2014;that the Lobola contract is ancillary to that marriage; it is a wedding of the two legal systems. Sir, the argument that Roman Dutch Law cannot recognize a duty of support, which is the effect of these judgments, beyond the limits it lays down, cannot, I think, hold any water on examination. You cannot say that because some rules of Native Law are applicable to a primitive society that the other rules which are exactly the same as Roman Dutch Law are to be debarred from recognition. Sir, the duty of support, when found in Roman Dutch Law, cannot be found to be uncivilized or against public policy where it is found in Native Law, and it cannot therefore be found in principle to be not applicable. In any event Native custom has been recognized by the highest courts in our land, and I think the classic example of that is the case of Sigcau v. Sigcau, which is the case which determined the paramount chieftaincy of Pondoland. I do believe <span class="col_2773-2774" refersTo="page_1403"/>that the present incumbent, Botha Sigcau, is there as the result of that decision. In that decision the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court decided, having heard the evidence as to Native custom, who was the legal heir and who should be declared by the court to be the legal heir, having regard to the fact that this question could only have been determined by an examination of the custom, the laws of inheritance, as to which house the heir was to be found in&#x2014;the Great House, the Qadi House of the Great House or where&#x2014;dealing entirely with this polygamous system of marriage.</p>

<p>The second reason given by the Law Revision Committee was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit sou die eerste stap kan wees in &#x2019;n rigting wat op &#x2019;n reeks ander dergelike wysigings van ons reg kan uitloop, en die implikasies van so &#x2019;n ontwikkeling is moeilik te voorsien.</block>

<p>I do not think that this is facing the issue. Let us meet the difficulties if and when they arise, and if justice merits that we unbend to meet the situations that arise, then I say that we should do that if justice merits it. But the most extraordinary thing is that the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, No. 30 of 1941, not only provides but binds any employer, whether he is a European or not, to compensate the dependants of a workman who died in circumstances laid down there, which generally are circumstances of negligence, even less than negligence&#x2014;in fact very often less than negligence. The most significant part of that Act is Section 4 (3) which provides that in the case of a Native, &#x201C;widow&#x201D; includes any woman who was associated with the deceased Native workman in a conjugal relationship according to Native Law and custom where neither the man nor the woman was a party to an existing marriage. I would have thought that would have put an end to any argument such as that which was put forward by the Law Revision Committee. In other words, our law already provides that if a Native is employed and falls within the purview of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and he meets his death, perhaps through his own negligence, then his wife, if she is his wife by virtue of a marriage according to Native Law and custom, may recover. So long as that exists I do not see that there can be any argument in principle against the provision of this Bill, which is that in circumstances where someone else has been negligent, where a European has been negligent, or where it is desired to sue an insurance company under the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, the widow can claim. It seems to me that there can be no argument that can be produced against that in the light of the principle established and practised by both Governments of the Union and the Republic since 1941.</p>

<p>But, Sir, this question perhaps merits attention from another point of view, the point of view of the conflict of laws, and if this Government is going to pursue its policy, which for convenience I will call the policy of Bantustans, the policy of separate development, and if as the hon. the Prime Minister indicated these Natives are to have rights in those areas only and they are to be regarded as belonging there and as domiciled there, then it seems to me that the question of the conflict of laws becomes even more important in the consideration of this matter. The example is given that these people will be like Frenchmen working in Italy. They work in Italy but they have their rights in France. By the same token, if one of those workmen was killed in Italy, his wife would be able to claim for loss of support if she could prove that her marriage was a lawful marriage. That is the point here. This is not regarded as a lawful marriage. If by the same token a Frenchmen in South Africa is killed, his wife could claim if she could show that according to the law of her husband&#x2019;s domicile she was legally married. And, Sir, that is what is going to happen in these areas, in these countries the Bantustans. The law of the domicile will have to be looked at to determine whether this is a valid marriage or whether it is not, and I submit that in those circumstances the courts would have to find that in fact that marriage was valid.</p>

<p>With regard to the third point raised by the Law Revision Committee, I feel that the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is the answer to the principle which they lay down&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die benadering is gegrond op die feit dat die Naturelleverbintenis nie in ons reg erken word as &#x2019;n wettige huwelik nie want dit is &#x2019;n konkubinaatskap wat net soos by Blankes, byvoorbeeld waar twee persone buite-egtelik as man en vrou saam woon, nie aan die vereistes vir so &#x2019;n aksie voldoen nie.</block>

<p>This is the essence of the approach of the Law Revision Committee. Sir, how can they liken this situation to the situation of a European having a few concubines? If our law tolerates customary unions between Natives, which it does&#x2014;there is a Bill before this House now to provide for the compulsory registration of customary unions&#x2014;then we should endeavour, so long as we recognize that customary union, to secure justice for the partners to that union.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that. I think that is another one of the objections which is made in this report of the Law Revision Committee. When one looks at the <span class="col_2775-2776" refersTo="page_1404"/>attitude adopted in this report, what do they want? I am dealing with this because I know that the Minister, holding the portfolio that he does, will have to have regard to this when he determines his attitude to this Bill. What do they want? Do they want just to abolish all these customary unions, to make them unlawful and revert to the stage of chaos that existed in the Transvaal before the passing of the Native Administration Act in 1927? Sir, it is absurd even to try to think as this paragraph indicates that they did.</p>

<p>Objection No. 4 is similar to the one I have just dealt with. Objection No. 5 is the point which the hon. the Minister raised a moment ago, and that is that on account of the polygamous nature of the customary unions, there will be a greater number of parties concerned and the inclusion of dependants who as dependants would not be recognized under our law. I think there is firstly a great fallacy. A dependant in our law, and in any law, is anyone who is the child of a man, whether it is the child of the man through a concubine or the child of a man through a wife; whatever it is, it is his child, his dependant, and he is obliged in our law to support that child. No exception is made to this case as far as the Bantu are concerned, and I can only presume that in talking about dependants the Law Revision Committee, consisting of Roman-Dutch lawyers having no knowledge of Native law, which has to be proved to them, are talking about dependants as we know them to be, and if that is so then they are wrong. The basis upon this socalled reason is given therefore falls away. But in any event do any of us here really think that every Bantu who enters into a customary union in the first place has the means or in the second place the intention of establishing a large polygamous household with six or seven wives and all the children that go with them? I do not think so, Sir. In fact I go further and say that it is a fact that it is only a minute fraction of Bantu who are polygamously married, that is to say, married to more than one person.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have no statistics, but I base my figures on the reports which have been given to me by members of the staff of the Department of Bantu Administration of the Natal University, and I have no reason to dispute them.</p>

<p>Every colonial power in Africa has always had regard to the conflict of laws, and the Portuguese in 1929 specially decreed the principle that where there is a conflict between the two legal systems, the conqueror&#x2019;s system would prevail, but that in the conflict of individual rights, where the superiority of the law of the colonial power was not in question, the solution had to be sought on a purely equitable basis. I do not think anyone will deny that this is the proper approach to a system such as this. The hon. the Minister raised the question, &#x201C;What about all the partners to the union?&#x201D; If I understand the hon. the Minister correctly he is referring to the multiplicity of actions that might arise and the number of wives who have to be compensated. Do I understand the Minister correctly?</p>

<p>To this I say that if, for instance, there were five wives all claiming, they could still only claim the amount which in fact the husband provided for their combined support. Each one can only claim her <i>pro rata</i> share of the amount which he in fact was earning and did in fact contribute towards their support out of his earnings. It may be a matter of inconvenience in those cases where there are five wives in fact and the actions might be brought separately, but I submit that in a case where there are five wives, they usually live together in the same kraal and their actions would be brought simultaneously as a matter of convenience to them themselves. In any event this is a matter really of detail and that should be left to the courts to decide what amount has in fact been lost to the widow.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is for this House to lay down the principle that the court can give relief. At the moment the court cannot give relief, and that is why this situation has arisen. But in any event this is one of the prices that has to be paid for the toleration of customary unions. The possibility has also been raised that there might be a fraud perpetrated on the courts, that someone who really was a concubine in fact would say that she was a partner to a customary union. Now in Natal this situation was met by providing that it was compulsory to register customary unions. If a customary union was not registered, the party could not prove her marriage, and there is this Bill presently <span class="col_2777-2778" refersTo="page_1405"/>before the House to make similar provisions throughout the country.</p>

<p>The second last of the objections which was raised by the Law Revision Committee is that there are different Bantu communities, each with its own legal system, and that it would make the position even more complicated. Well, Sir, of all the woolly statements that I have ever seen, I think that is it. Of all the statements which indicate that there are these difficulties and that they don&#x2019;t know what they are, that is it. I don&#x2019;t blame these learned gentlemen for feeling that way. They don&#x2019;t know what the difficulties are, and they don&#x2019;t pretend to try and understand them. But they did have the memorandum at that time of someone who did know all about this, namely, Prof. Kerr. Now I regard this reason advanced by the Law Revision Committee as trying to cloud the issue. I submit this Bill can be adapted to each of these legal systems.</p>

<p>What about the argument of the Moslem wives?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I anticipated that the hon. the Minister might ask me about the Moslem wives, because that also appeared in some of the articles that have been written. The simple answer to that is: I don&#x2019;t know anything about Moslem wives, and I don&#x2019;t think it has anything to do with this Bill. This is a Bill to provide relief for Bantu widows. I don&#x2019;t know anything about the Moslem law and the complications which might arise in regard thereto. But if in fact under Moslem law there were injustices perpetrated by reason of the fact that was not recognized, then I should say in principle that this right should be extended also to that case, if in fact injustices resulted from a refusal to recognize it.</p>

<p>Other difficulties have been raised, difficulties about assistance. Now in Natal all Native women are perpetual minors. This is not the case in the Cape if one is to believe Seymour and Whitfield, who are authorities on the subject. Native women may sue in their own name in the Cape, but in Natal, at any rate, Native women are perpetual minors. That is clear. It has been suggested that these difficulties might outweigh the conveniences. I submit that is not so, because the court can always appoint a guardian; if the guardian is unwilling to act, if a guardian cannot be found, the court can always appoint a <i>curator ad litem.</i></p>

<p>Another difficulty that has been suggested is that a court in awarding a sum of money as damages, might also have to determine to whom that money should be given because normally it would go into the kraal of the guardian of that woman because she is under permanent tutelage. Sir, once again the Bill does not impose any fetters upon the court which can order that the money be given to a <i>curator bonis</i> or that it should be paid into the Native Affairs Department which administers an awful lot of trust moneys for the Native peoples; or it could be paid out such as other benefits are in fact paid out now under the Workmans Compensation Act to these widows of Bantu married in customary union.</p>

<p>The last reason that is given I think is very sad to see. It says &#x201C;There is too little known about the subject to go into all its implications and to recommend any legislation at this stage&#x201D;. I think this is an unfortunate reason for the Law Revision Committee to have put forward, for the simple reason that they acknowledge at the end that they don&#x2019;t know anything about it and they have been fiddling around with this for about three years &#x2026;</p>

<p>For five years and nothing has been done, despite the fact (if one is to believe the report in the <i>Star)</i> that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is in fact in favour and even supports the principle involved in this Bill. Sir, you cannot expect a Native woman when she decides whether she is going to marry by customary union in accordance with Native law and custom, or by a civil or Christian ceremony, to have regard in making that choice, to the possibility or probability that her husband is likely to be run down by a motor-car. It is inequitable in any event that the legal or fictitious guardian according to Native law should be burdened with the support of such a widow for the rest of her life because of the wrong-doing of somebody else I believe that it is desirable to prevent such a woman becoming a charge upon the state and that the person responsible should pay the compensation, and I am sure that the hon. the Minister will agree that it is not right according to modern trends that a Bantu woman, especially with children, should not be entitled to sue for the loss of support where someone has killed her husband. I say that the intention of this Bill is to overcome the freaks of past laws and to vest a right where it does not exist now generally, although it does exist in circumstances which are less in their gravamen than the circumstances which this Bill proposes to cover. I hope that this Bill will have the support of the Government. I believe it fits into the scheme of things, it fits into the concepts which I believe even this <span class="col_2779-2780" refersTo="page_1406"/>Government has towards the urban Bantu, and I hope the hon. the Minister will give it his blessing.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>At the outset I want to say that I have great sympathy with the case stated here by the hon. member, but the fact that I am sympathetic does not mean that I allow my reason to be clouded by it, because at this stage I consider that there are still real objections to the acceptance of this legislation. I want to mention, in the first place, that Native marriages are recognized by the Natal Code, which also prescribes the requirements, but in the other provinces that is not the case, so much so that one does not always know when a Native marriage exists and when it does not. I just want to indicate the attitude of the Native High Court in regard to this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Native High Court in Natal declared many unions to be marriages where the essentials had not been carried out. Their decisions were based on the presumption of a marriage between persons who had lived together as man and wife and were actuated by a desire to legitimize the children of such union. In consequence of such judgments it was impossible to say when any union was a marriage or not in the absence of the essentials until the court had decided.</block>

<p>I am quoting now from Stafford&#x2019;s book on Native law. That is the case in Natal, where the requirements in respect of a Native marriage union are prescribed, and it is even much more true in the case of the other provinces where the requirements for a Native marriage must still be proved in terms of Native law and custom itself, which varies from tribe to tribe. One does not know. A Native man and woman live together and often it is presumed that a marriage has been contracted according to Native law, but no lobola was paid. They say they are man and wife and they live that way. We know of such cases, but there is nothing to prove that they were actually married according to Native custom. That is the one objection. At this stage there is to much confusion in regard to what a Native marriage is, or rather in which cases there has really been a marriage according to Native custom.</p>

<p>There is a second objection, namely that we know that in terms of Native law a man can have more than one wife. He can marry six wives according to Native custom. Now one will have the position that the husband is killed in a road accident and there is a claim for damages, and the defendant or his insurance company will be faced with six or seven claims, and in respect of each one of them it will first have to be proved whether there was a marriage in terms of Native custom or not before the claim can really be proved. The courts will therefore be faced with a twofold case. They will first have to investigate whether the marriage was really one according to Native custom, and then the question of negligence will have to be investigated. At the present stage it is an impossible state of affairs. But I believe that the Government is also sympathetically inclined towards this matter, and I want to refer the hon. member to the Bill which has just been tabled by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Take Clause 10 of that Bill. In terms of that clause the State President will be empowered to issue regulations to provide for the registration of customary unions and for declaring null and void, or dissolving, customary unions. But there is also the further objection at this stage that a Native marriage can be dissolved at present merely by agreement between the parties. It is a difficult proposition. They may have separated by agreement, but in fact it was well known that this was her husband, and now after the death of the husband she lodges a claim. He is no longer there to deny that they did not break up their marriage by mere agreement, and then a claim is lodged which really is an illegal claim. In view of the fact that the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development now wants to make it compulsory that these Native marriages should be registered, and also to register their dissolution or their nullity, we now have something tangible on which to work when once this legislation has been passed. I may also say that the matter is being investigated by the Department of Bantu Administration and they want to ensure that there is legal clarity in regard to this matter, and when once there is legal clarity as to what a Native marriage is and when it was contracted or when it was dissolved, and what the consequences of it are, that will be the appropriate time for the hon. member to introduce this legislation. I think at the moment the hon. member is a little precipitate with this Bill. At this stage I want to move&#x2014;</p>
