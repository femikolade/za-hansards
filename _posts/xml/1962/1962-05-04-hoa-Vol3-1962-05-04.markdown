<from>Mr. E. G. MALAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any cases in the railway service have been reported since 1 December 1956, where (a) officials left their places of work while on duty, to go fishing or dancing and (b) a passenger train was operated by unqualified staff; if so, (i) where and (ii) when did these cases occur;</li>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development" to="#malan">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1), (2) and (3) The hon. member has apparently based his question on the contents of a private and confidential circular letter issued to heads of departments as a purely domestic measure in September 1959, to which he should not have had access. The letter had as its aim the tightening-up of supervision and discipline, and to this end referred in general terms to incidents of infraction of hours of duty and discharge of duties which were known. These irregularities concerned two servants at Komatipoort early in 1959 and another servant at Marble Hall in May of the same year. In the last-mentioned case a train was admitted to the station by an unauthorized employee. For the information of the hon. member it may be mentioned that the servants guilty of these offences were all punished in terms of the disciplinary regulations.</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes; and</li>

<li>(2) no. I wish to add, by way of explanation, that the C.S.I.R. has been approached by various bodies in regard to the standardization of kaffir beer. It will be possible to collect all the data which are needed by the S.A.B.S. to formulate and administer standard specifications, but none of these bodies has, up till the present, been prepared to provide the necessary funds for this purpose. Approximately R14,000 will be required for the collection of the data alone to which must be added the funds which will be required by the S.A.B.S. for the formulation and administration of any standards that might be laid down.</li>

<heading>Use of Automatic Food Machines in Trains</heading>

<question by="#wood" to="#minister_of_transport">

<num>*VI.</num>

<from>Mr. WOOD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<p>Whether consideration has been given to the installation of automatic food-dispensing slot machines on trains in respect of which the running of dining-cars is not justified.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development" to="#wood">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Automatic food-dispensing slot machines on passenger trains have been tested by various railroads abroad, notably in the United States of America, and the experiments have shown that with the exception of a few heavily patronized trains which in any case were provided with dining-cars the use of vending machines did not meet with success. Apart from other practical problems it was also found that the oscillation and vibration of moving vehicles had an adverse effect on the delicate mechanism of the machines. The position on railroads abroad is, however, watched, in order to keep abreast of developments.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a statement by the head of the Radioactivity Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, reported in the <i>Daily News</i> of 20 April 1962, that the latest American nuclear tests in the Pacific might be followed by radio-active fall-out in South Africa; and</li>

<li>(1) Whether any persons from outside South Africa (a) have visited the Republic <span class="col_4949-4950" refersTo="page_1101"/>since 1 January 1962, or (b) have been or (c) are to be invited during 1962 to visit the Republic, as the guests of his Department; if so, what in each case was or is (i) the name and age and (ii) the official position or other qualification of the guest, (iii) the reason for the invitation and (iv) the cost to the State;</li>

<li>(2) whether his Department has rendered any assistance in regard to guests invited by the South Africa Foundation; if so, what assistance; and</li>

<li>(3) whether he can give the details, as requested above, in each of these cases.</li>

<p>Mr. Andr&#x00E9; Villers: age unknown; correspondent for: <i>La Libre Belgique, Het Laatste Nieuws; Europa Magazine; Science et Voyages;</i> Member of the Association des Ecrivains Beiges; Member of the Association de la Mer et de Outromer Paris.</p>

<p>Mr. Roger Vincent, 42 years old; Director of a Press Agency named Liaison et Diffusion and Co-editor of <i>Presse Information Paris.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Fritz Ernst, 55 years old; Director of Radio Basle, Switzerland; at present visiting the Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. Heinz Behrens: age unknown: journalist and expert on public relations; from Hamburg, West Germany.</p></li>

<li>(iii) As regards Mr. Behrens, one of the reasons he was invited was for consultations regarding publicity matters in West Germany. In addition he, and the other guests, were invited to have them acquaint themselves with the Republic. Particular success has been obtained with journalists who were invited as guests and many positive and objective articles, radio programmes and even several books have resulted from their visits. Besides prominent journalists the Department plans in the future also to consider inviting as guests other key figures in public life, such as statesmen, industrialists, bankers, etc.</li>

<li>(iv) The accounts pertaining to the guests mentioned have not yet been finalized and the costs to the State are thus not yet known. State expenses on some of the guests are less than others, especially when they have made other arrangements regarding their return passage and the Department is only responsible for local expenditure.</li></ol></li>

<li>(c) Plans for other guests to be invited during 1962 await confirmation.</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) Yes; the Department renders continual assistance in respect of guests invited by the South African Foundation, when invited to do so. This assistance is, in most cases, rendered within the framework of the Department&#x2019;s normal services and has, in the current financial year, not resulted in any extra monetary liabilities. In the main the assistance consists of helping to arrange interviews and short tours on the spot to State projects in which Foundation guests may be particularly interested. In the current financial year, however, the Department has provided for payment of half of the travel costs of a maximum of 20 guests of the Foundation.</li>

<li>(3) Further details of guests of the Department will be available at a later date.</li></ol>

<heading>POPULATION REGISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Report Stage,&#x2014;Population Registration Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>In Clause 1,</p>

<p>Amendments in Clause 1 put and agreed to.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>In Clause 1, to add the following proviso at the end of the clause:</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that no person who at the commencement of the Population Registration Amendment Act, 1962, had been classified or who had applied to be classified in terms of the principal Act, shall be reclassified in terms of this definition except upon the written request of such person.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. I will deal with the amendment and with the reasons which have caused it. The effect of the amendment which I have moved is to exclude from the operations of the new definition contained in Clause 1 of this Bill, those people, in the first place, who have already been classified, and in the second place those people who have applied to be classified but whose classification has been frozen by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department for various reasons, one of the reasons apparently being that their classifications had not been made because the Department was awaiting the passing of this Bill into law.</p>

<p>The persons who will fall to be protected under the amendment which I have moved are those who have already been classified as White. The effect of the definition is to exclude from the status of being a White person certain people who would, but for the amendment in this Bill, be entitled to be classified <span class="col_4959-4960" refersTo="page_1106"/>as White. In other words, Sir, the amendment is designed to give security and protection to those people who have got home as White under the old definition but who will be excluded from the status of being a White person in terms of the new definition. My amendment, therefore, protects persons who have been classified as White in the first place, and who would, but for my amendment, become non-White by law as soon as this amending Bill is passed. As far as they are concerned, I want to say that in terms of this definition there could be thousands of people who overnight, by operation of law, will become non-White people. The sort of person whom I have in mind and who this amendment is designed to protect, is the sort of person contemplated in Clause 1 (b). That is the sort of person who is dark in colour and therefore falls to be dealt with in terms of the new definition under (b); the person who might not have any non-European blood in him at all, the person who before, although he was dark in colour, was accepted as a White person and was entitled to be classified as White. Those dark people, although having no Coloured blood, fall now, in terms of the law, to become non-European overnight. This is the one class of person which this amendment is designed to protect.</p>

<p>The other type of person this amendment is designed to protect are the persons who, although they have been White for generations, admit of a Coloured ancestor somewhere along the line. My amendment is designed to provide that those persons who honestly admit that somewhere along the line they had a Coloured ancestor, will not be re-classified in terms of the new definition. Were it not for my amendment, anyone who makes such an admission hereafter will automatically be excluded from the position of being a White person.</p>

<p>As I have said, this amendment is also designed to protect those persons who have applied to be classified but whose classifications have not yet been made. There are many thousands of them. The effect of this amendment would be that all those persons, when they are classified, should be classified in terms of the law which existed at the time they made their applications for classification.</p>

<p>The reason why this amendment has been moved is that the hon. the Minister gave an understanding that he would not re-classify persons who have already been classified. He would not use the new definition to exclude anyone who had managed to get home as White from that position. That is the only reason for this amendment, Sir.</p>

<p>To illustrate I want to deal very briefly with the case of Mrs. Singh. I will not dwell on it; I will just refer to it in passing. It is a simple isolated incident. But the hon. the Minister did say that Mrs. Singh was one of the people who he wanted to have the power to deal with in terms of the new definition. I think the Minister has in fact dealt with that in terms of the amendment which he accepted to this clause in the Committee Stage, namely that a person cannot just admit that she is a Coloured person by descent. You cannot just do that and become non-White. It is possible for the Minister and his Department or for anyone else to prove that the admission that the person is not White is in fact not true. So Mrs. Singh does not become an obstacle to the hon. the Minister accepting the amendment which I have moved. That objection, in my submission, therefore falls away. Not faced with that difficulty, I submit there is no other valid reason why this amendment should not be accepted by the hon. the Minister. As I have said the hon. the Minister has given this undertaking. And if that undertaking means anything then I submit this amendment must be accepted.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the objections which have been raised to the acceptance of this amendment. I want to suggest that none of them has in fact any substance. It is precisely this amendment, in precisely the form in which it was moved in the Committee Stage, that was rejected by the hon. the Minister in the first instance, because he said it would prevent other persons from objecting to the re-classification of any person under the principal Act. That was his first reason for rejecting this amendment. If one looks at the words of this amendment it is very clear that is in fact not so. In the first place it does not in any way amend or try to interfere with any of the other provisions of the principal Act and certainly not with the provision that other people may object to the re-classification of any other person. In the second place, Sir, the amendment says that they shall not be reclassified in terms of this definition. So that they may be re-classified, persons may object, and they may all be re-classified. But, Sir, they can only be re-classified in terms of the old definition. They may not be re-classified in terms of this definition. So I think that objection of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s falls away.</p>

<p>The other objection the Minister had was met by a further amendment. The hon. the Minister said that if there was an error, then in terms of Section 5 of the principal Act, it would not be possible for the Registrar to put right what he called a <i>bona fide</i> error. My submission is that also is not true for the same reason, Sir, viz. that it is not correct to say that The ability of people to object to other persons&#x2019; classifications will be affected by this amendment. As before, Sir, the provisions relating to <i>bona fide</i> errors in the principal Act are not dealt with in this amendment, and in the second place, all that this says is that they cannot be re-classified in terms of this definition. They may be re-classified in terms of the old definition, but not in terms of this definition.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister dealt with another matter and he said there was a number of other people who will want to be re-classified and who will not be able to be re-classified unless they avail themselves of the admission provided for in Clause 1. As far as that is <span class="col_4961-4962" refersTo="page_1107"/>concerned, that is dealt with in this amendment. It provides that you can be re-classified in terms of the new definition if you so request it.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested that if this amendment were accepted, it would not be possible to have people judged by the definition which has been repealed by the legislature. I submit that again is not a valid argument. This sort of thing has been going on for years. Ever since this Parliament has been here laws have been passed changing the law and its application in the future in respect of certain people. I submit that is precisely what comes into play here. Laws are not made retrospective unless the Statute says they are. This will, therefore, only apply to people in the future and anyone in the past whose rights fall to be determined will be determined by the law which existed at the time their rights became, what I will call, vested, that is up to the time of the passing of the Statute. I want to give an example of this because this was an objection raised to this amendment, namely, that having repealed the old definition you could not classify anyone in terms of it. I want to give an example which comes readily to mind and which fits the Bill. The legal fraternity on the other side of the House will appreciate it. I think it was in 1933 that a law was passed by this Parliament that persons in Natal who had the right of dual practice&#x2014;that is they could practice as an advocate and as an attorney&#x2014;should not from then on be entitled to practice in both capacities. From then on they were obliged either to practice as an attorney or as an advocate. From that moment on, Sir, the law said that anyone who came to be admitted to the Bar or to the Side Bar could only be admitted to one or the other, and not to both as in the past. But, Sir, at the same time those persons who were admitted before that Act was passed as attorneys or as advocates, were entitled to practice as both and their rights to-day are determined by the law which existed before that law was passed in 1933 prohibiting anyone in the future from practising in both capacities. In that example. Sir, the law was repealed, but the rights of the persons&#x2014;many of them are still alive and still practising&#x2014;are determined in accordance with the provisions of the law which was in fact repealed. That is precisely what is going to happen here. And so, Sir, I think that objection also falls away.</p>

<p>There is one other objection which the hon. the Minister might in a fanciful moment take and that is that it might affect his rights or power to classify, in terms of Section 5 (1) of the principal Act, Coloureds and Natives into ethnic groups. I submit, Sir, that does not enter the picture. That is a subclassification to be determined only after the main question is determined&#x2014;which is what this Bill deals with&#x2014;as to the main classification into White, Coloured or Native.</p>

<p>I suggest that there is no reason to refuse this amendment. There is no reason why the House should not accept this amendment unless the House feels that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance was not given properly. I am sure that no one will suggest that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance was not given properly. I am sure that this House will, therefore, give effect to the assurance that the hon. the Minister has given, unless the Minister intends to re-classify members of already existing classified family units, or unless he intends also to classify differently those persons who have applied to be classified as Whites and who, under the existing law, will be entitled to be classified as White, and classify them as non-White in terms of the new definition. I ask this House and the hon. the Minister to honour the assurance which has been given by the hon. the Minister, regardless of the change; this was an assurance given by the Minister on behalf of the Government and I feel that in view of this assurance we are entitled to ask that such an assurance by the Government be put on the Statute Book. Surely we have not reached the stage yet where one&#x2019;s rights are to be determined by assurances. I submit that this amendment should be accepted because individuals are entitled to know from the law what their rights are, not from assurances by the hon. the Minister, but from the law. They should be able to look at the law and say; I have certainty, I have safety, I know where I stand. If for no other reason than that they are entitled to security, to safety and certainty from the law, and not from the whim of the Minister, this amendment should be accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the words &#x201C;harbour or port of access&#x201D; are defined in the Admission of Persons to the Union Regulation Act, Act 22 of 1913, as a place on the coast of the Republic or a railway station or a place in the Republic near or on one of the borders through which persons enter the Republic. In view of the fact that in the Act no mention is made of airports, aircraft or persons entering the Union by air, and the definition does not include these concepts either, it was necessary to provide in the Aviation Act of 1923 that the provisions of Act 22 of 1913 would also apply to airports, aircraft and persons entering the Republic by air. My colleague, the Minister of Transport, has already amended the Aviation Act of 1923. and in this Bill we make the provisions of the Admission of Persons to the Union Regulation Act in respect of entry through the seaports and other ports, and other provisions applying to it, applicable also to airports and aircraft. In essence all we are doing in this brief Bill is to make the provisions of the Aviation Act of 1923 applicable to this Act also.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This is a comparatively simple measure which is designed to overcome a problem which came to my notice when I appointed the Deputy Minister for South West Africa. This Bill is designed therefore to deal with two possible difficulties, neither of which is really serious. The one flows from the fact that, as hon. members are aware, my Department and I are responsible for the administration of South West Africa. When I sought to relieve my duties to a certain extent by appointing somebody to assist me in respect of South West Africa affairs, the problem was what his designation should be. It might have caused considerable confusion and given rise to complications to call him the Deputy Prime Minister, and it was obviously impossible to do so. That was the one problem. After all, if a person is appointed to assist the Prime Minister, he cannot be called the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The second problem was that here we were dealing with a special sphere of work, which actually falls under various Ministers and Departments. In other words, the Minister of Bantu Administration also has certain duties in connection with South West Africa, and so has the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The solution that was then found, and which was perfectly legal, was to appoint this person and to describe him as a Deputy to the Prime Minister in connection with the latter&#x2019;s duties in respect of South West Africa, as a Deputy to the Minister of Bantu Administration in respect of his duties with regard to South West, and as a Deputy to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in so far as South West affairs are concerned, and to make it known that since he was to be a substitute, in terms of the existing law, for each of these Ministers and was to act in respect of their Departments, he would be described for the sake of brevity as Deputy Minister for South West Africa. But what I think would be the right course would be to amend the Constitution in such a way that it confers the right to appoint a Deputy Minister for a specific task. The change which I propose here therefore is simply that whereas it is stated to-day that if a Deputy Minister is appointed he is the substitute for a particular Minister in respect of his particular Department, the wording is now being altered so that the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s title can indicate what functions are entrusted to him, even though it is a limited function within one Department, or a limited function within quite a number of Departments. It is a question therefore of making an appointment for a specific purpose for which somebody is needed. In this case, where a Deputy Minister for South West Africa was appointed, I must say that it has worked very effectively. It is useful in connection with the co-ordination of the work of the various Departments with reference to a particular subject. That is the whole key to this Bill, that it entitles one not only to appoint a Deputy Minister as a substitute for a particular Minister and then limiting his functions to a particular Department or a series of Departments, as has been done legitimately up to the present, but to make a direct appointment for a specific task with a suitable title which describes that particular task. That is what is being done in this Bill.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a few words are being omitted which are redundant because they also appear in Section 17 of the Constitution. I refer to the indication that he is not a member of the Executive Committee. That is already stated <span class="col_4967-4968" refersTo="page_1110"/>in Section 17 of the Constitution; it is tautology therefore and that is why we are omitting these words.</p>

<p>For the rest the clause is divided into three parts for the sake of clarity. No other substantial change is proposed here. The third part (c) of Clause 1 is necessary only because reference has already been made since then in other legislation to a substitute for a Minister, and since we are now bringing about the change in (a) which I have just explained, namely that one can describe the Deputy Minister in terms of his task and give him a special title in accordance with his task, instead of appointing him directly as the full substitute for a Minister in respect of his whole Department, it is also necessary to indicate in (c) that under other legislation that has since come into being, these functions can be performed as now provided for in (a). That is all the Bill contains.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House have no objection to this legislation, but it does raise one or two rather interesting points. The first is this, that in the Republic the State President has the right to establish a State Department. In Britain I believe the various Departments or Ministries can only be established by statute. We are in the fortunate position that the State President can do so. One wonders whether in fact this legislation was necessary if the State President was in a position to establish a separate department to perform the functions which it is now proposed to bestow on the Deputy Minister. The result in Britain has been interesting, in that whereas it was found necessary to appoint a Minister to deal with Commonwealth affairs and colonial affairs in the absence of a statute it was found necessary to appoint a Secretary of State because only a Secretary of State, of which there are nine, seven functioning at the moment, can take over the functions of various ministries, and is held to have a roving brief of that sort. Now it seems that we are in the position that the Deputy Minister can be appointed to perform any odd function in the Department without the approval of the State President, and one wonders what the hon. the Prime Minister has in view in respect of this particular point, in that it would seem that here we have a Deputy Minister who will impinge upon the duties of a variety of Departments run by different Ministers. We would be grateful if the Prime Minister would give us an indication of the exact functions of the post he is now creating so that we can get some idea of what the scope of this Bill is and how he proposes to deal with matters in future. He is now in the position where in the past we had a deputy appointed for a particular Minister, to perform one or more of the functions of that Minister, but now we have a deputy who is apparently appointed to perform odd functions of the different departments of different Ministers, and one is inclined to ask who is his boss, who sees to it that he performs his job, or does he only fall under the Prime Minister, or is he responsible to each individual Minister in so far as he impinges upon the duties entrusted to those particular Departments? We should be grateful to have clarity in that regard. I may say we are more than relieved to find that, leaving out words with reference to him not being a member of the Executive Committee, it does not have the meaning we feared it might have, that Deputy Ministers also became members of the Cabinet. We already have 18 Cabinet Ministers, whereas a country like Britain has 21 now, and one feels that the Cabinet is quite big enough and the Opposition is having quite enough trouble as it is in keeping an eye on the various Ministers, and if one has to scatter oneself too widely it becomes a little difficult to devote attention to all of them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can comfort the hon. the Leader of the Opposition by saying there is no intention whatever to increase the size of the Cabinet. As far as the other point of the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, it is not the intention to establish a separate department and therefore in such cases it would not be in accordance with our intention that the State President should be deprived of any right he has at present, namely to establish a Department or not, or that he should be asked to exercise his right in such a direction.</p>

<p>That also leads me to the reply to the other point, and that is that any Deputy Minister remains according to this Bill under the jurisdiction of a Minister. It says that the State President may appoint any person to hold office during his pleasure as Deputy Minister of any State Department or Deputy Minister of such other description as the State President may determine, and to exercise or perform&#x2014;and the following refers to both these positions&#x2014;on behalf of the Minister any of the powers, functions and duties entrusted to such Minister. In other words, when there is a Deputy Minister for South West Africa any function which he performs is performed on behalf of the Minister who is actually and finally responsible. Therefore, when he operates on my behalf he has to act in accordance with instructions given by me, or under my control. If the same person has to perform certain duties for the Minister of Bantu Administration, he acts not under my jurisdiction but under the control of that particular Minister.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is no conflict possible, because at present I have my duties and that Minister has his duties, and if there can be no conflict between me and the other Minister, each performing his duties in respect of South West Africa, then there can be no conflict if a certain deputy becomes a useful link between these two Ministers <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="page_1111"/>in similar matters. That is actually how it works out. To-day I find much greater co-ordination in performing all tasks in connection with South West than we ever had before. This fear of conflict, I can assure the hon. member, need not arise.</p>

<p>But it could happen that a person is appointed as Deputy Minister for a specific task within a Department, like the Department of Economic Affairs, although I am not suggesting that this will happen. I am just giving an example on the spur of the moment. Supposing that within that Department we thought that attention should be given to planning we could want to appoint a Deputy Minister entrusted particularly with the task of planning. This planning might bring him in touch with other Departments but it would be the function of the specific Department to which he is appointed. Under such circumstances the Prime Minister might stress the fact that he does not want him to relieve the particular Minister of his duties in other respects. I could not make such an appointment before, but I can now, if it should be necessary. That is all there is to this Bill.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, in terms of Section 77 of the Customs Act, 1955, approves of notes which were exchanged on 14 and 15 June 1961 between the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the United Kingdom confirming South Africa&#x2019;s agreement to an amendment of the Ottawa Trade Agreement of 20 August 1932 between South Africa and the United Kingdom arising out of the association of Finland with the European Free Trade Association, copies of which were laid upon the Table on 2 May 1962.</block>

<p>I am sure hon. members will remember that during last year&#x2019;s session Parliament approved of certain exchanges of notes between the Republic and the United Kingdom in which South Africa agreed that the Ottawa trade agreement could be amended in certain ways in order to enable Britain to comply with its obligations in terms of the Convention of the European Free Trade Association. Hon. members of course know that the Convention for the establishment of the Free Trade Association, or EFTA, came into operation on 3 May 1960 and that seven countries, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and Portugal, belong to it, and that this Association has become known as The Seven as contrasted with The Six of the European Common Market. On 27 March 1961 an agreement was signed in Finland in terms of which Finland could be associated with The Seven. The result is that the United Kingdom will now have to reduce the tariffs on the imports of industrial products from Finland to the same rate as those of imports from other EFTA member states. In other words, when Finland becomes associated with The Seven, Finland will have to be granted the same tariff preferences as the other members of The Seven. In all these cases the date set for the total elimination of tariffs is 1 January 1970, but in the light of the recent resolutions taken there the pace of the elimination or reduction of mutual import duties has been hastened, and the probability is that the total elimination of export duties between members of that association will take place before that date, provided the EFTA Convention remains in force. I say provided the EFTA Convention and the agreement with Finland remain in operation, because in view of the fact that the United Kingdom has now applied for membership of the European Common Market, the continued existence of EFTA has become uncertain. The result of the United Kingdom&#x2019;s negotiations with the European Common Market cannot, however, be anticipated and in the meantime it is necessary for the United Kingdom to obtain this exemption in order to apply the EFTA Convention and the agreement with Finland.</p>

<p>The exchange of notes which was approved by Parliament last year grants exemption to the United Kingdom to eliminate the contractual preferences on certain products enjoyed by the Republic in the United Kingdom, as against the other EFTA member states, in terms of the EFTA Convention. The products in respect of which South Africa&#x2019;s contractual preferences in the United Kingdom are affected by the agreement with Finland are precisely the same. In other words, last year I asked the House to grant Britain the right, in respect of a whole series of articles, to reduce the preferences South Africa has always enjoyed in respect of the other members of The Seven; and now I am asking the House, in respect of precisely the same commodities, also to forgo the preferences which South Africa enjoyed in Britain, in favour of Finland. I refer here to the following products: (1) Blue-veined cheese, a special kind of cheese made in Denmark; (2) wattle-bark and wattle extract; (3) mealie products, excepting those included in Schedule II of the Rome Agreement and which are therefore regarded as agricultural products; (4) whale products; (5) oyster-shell grit; (6) goatskins; (7) boxwood; (8) asbestos; (9) sausage casings; (10) ostrich feathers; (11) canned rock lobster; and (12) quick-frozen fillets of hake.</p>

<p>The British Government already requested the South African Government in April 1960 to agree to exempt it from the import duties on these products, in terms of the agreement with Finland, and to amend the Republic&#x2019;s <span class="col_4971-4972" refersTo="page_1112"/>preferences in regard to these products. After the matter had been carefully considered by the Government, the British Government was informed that the South African Government was prepared to grant the desired exemption. Notes were exchanged to confirm the Republic&#x2019;s agreement, and the House is now being asked to approve this exchange of notes.</p>

<p>Over and above the products I have mentioned, unsmelted copper also appears in the notes exchanged. The preference on this product has, however, never been put into operation, in view of the fact that it was subject to the condition that Commonwealth production should be offered to British consumers at not higher than world prices.</p>

<p>Hon. members will perhaps ask me now what the effect of this approval will be on South Africa&#x2019;s trade, and in that connection I want to say the following: According to the published statistics of the United Kingdom, none of these products, with the possible exception of boxwood, is exported to the United Kingdom by Finland. In other words, in this sense we will not be affected. Boxwood is not indicated separately in the British statistics, and therefore it is not known whether Finland in fact exports this product to the United Kingdom or not. South Africa&#x2019;s exports of boxwood to the United Kingdom in any case amounted to only R4,696 in 1959 and R1,052 in 1960, a minimal amount. According to the Forestry Department, supplies of boxwood are very limited and there is no possibility of extending the export trade to any appreciable extent. Therefore it is clear that the elimination of the relevant preferences will have practically no deleterious effect on South Africa&#x2019;s foreign trade.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to emphasize that the United Kingdom, as the result of the above-mentioned exchange of notes, has now been given the liberty to eliminate South Africa&#x2019;s preferences on the products I have mentioned only in respect of Finland; in respect of the other countries outside EFTA the preferences in regard to these products are retained. South Africa&#x2019;s contractual preferences in the United Kingdom on other export products like fresh and canned fruit and wine are not affected, because the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of customs tariffs between the EFTA member states applies only to industrial products, with certain exceptions.</p>

<p>Although it is not relevant to the motion under discussion, I just want to refer briefly to the position in regard to non-contractual preferences. South Africa&#x2019;s non-contractual preferences in the United Kingdom on industrial products are in fact affected, because the United States is at liberty at any time to eliminate these non-contractual preferences.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the Minister for his full statement on this matter. It is quite clear from his full statement on this occasion as well as his full statement on the same matter last year, that this whittling away of our preferences is the inevitable consequence of the fundamental trading changes taking place in Europe, the establishment of EFTA and the fact, as the Minister himself has mentioned, that the Common Market is beginning to cast its shadow over EFTA too. I suppose that there is not very much that the Minister can do about it; as I say, this is the inevitable consequence of the big changes which are taking place, but we on this side do feel that the Minister can probably keep himself far more informed as to what is happening in Europe and what is happening as regards EFTA and the Common Market, because it is rather alarming, when one reads the newspapers and the proceedings of the Chambers of Industry, to see how poorly South Africa is represented, for instance, at Brussels, the headquarters of the Economic section of the Common Market, compared with certain other countries who will have to face the same consequences that we will have to face here. As the Minister himself has said, this deals specifically with EFTA but there seems to be very little doubt that further development will bring in the Common Market too.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter too. The Minister spoke of compensation last year for the whittling away of these preferences by the United Kingdom. There is also mention of compensation in the present notes that have been exchanged. I should like to know from the Minister exactly what type of compensation he envisages, because it is rather difficult to imagine what compensation we can get from the United Kingdom except to GATT. It certainly cannot be a question of re-establishing preferences in respect of other products; at best it can only be the reduction of certain tariffs, through GATT, which, of course, would be extended to all other parties to GATT too. I should very much like to hear from the Minister what sort of compensation he envisages and whether any steps are being taken in this respect.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>This is the second occasion in just over a year that we have had to deal in this House with the question of EFTA. As the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) has indicated, this is a position which is going to continue and continue in one form or another. The hon. the Minister, I think quite rightly, said in the course of his remarks, &#x201C;If EFTA should continue to exist&#x201D;, because with the development which is taking place in Europe to-day on the economic front, it is more than probable that EFTA in its present form may change very considerably. Sir, we are faced with one undeniable fact, and that is that the picture of economic trading throughout the world is moving into a completely new era. The circumstance of Finland joining EFTA is merely another indicator. If the United Kingdom were not considering joining the Common Market or if her application to the Common Market were not accepted, one would presuppose that there would be other countries, <span class="col_4973-4974" refersTo="page_1113"/>which are untied to these two organizations, which would join with EFTA.</p>

<p>This question of our representation abroad to watch these developments is causing us a great deal of concern. The hon. the Minister mentioned under his Vote that an economist was going to be sent to Europe to watch the position, but I would like to refer the Minister to his speech exactly a year earlier when he said exactly the same thing, namely that we are watching the position; that our ambassador is accredited and that we are going to send a trained economist to watch the position. That was in May 1961; to-day we are in May 1962. Where is that economist? Has he been appointed; when is he leaving?</p>

<p>Sir, the tragedy is that this Government will go down in history as the Government of &#x201C;too little too late&#x201D;, because we find in so many of our economic facets that too little is done too late. After the war when considerable expansion was taking place, many vast schemes were stopped when this Government came into power. We found that we could not export our minerals because the Railways could not handle them. We do not want a similar situation here in regard to EFTA or any other institutions which are set up to deal with exports. Sir, I could give another example but you would probably rule me out of order, and that is the question of immigrants, where we had exactly the same thing&#x2014;too little too late. Now in the year of our Lord 1962 we start looking for immigrants.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see some of the figures in relation to these items which have been mentioned by the hon. the Minister and which are dealt with in the notes. In regard to goatskins, in 1959 our exports stood at R87,000; they dropped in 1960 to R42,000. In the case of wattle extract, we exported wattle extract to the value of R2,260,000 in 1959 and it dropped to R1,664,000 in 1960. I think we would like the hon. the Minister to give us some explanation in regard to those figures. I am not suggesting that the drop in these exports occurred as a direct result of the concessions that we have had to make in regard to EFTA. I think there has been a drop in the last year in the price of hides and skins, but we would like to have some explanation from the Minister with regard to the drop in these figures and whether this question of EFTA has affected these particular products.</p>

<p>I have listened attentively to the points raised by hon. members opposite, points which, with all respect, were not always directly concerned with the exchange of notes we are discussing here. But those are matters which can, in the near future, I hope, be raised under my Vote. The question was asked in the first place whether South Africa is fully informed about what is happening in Europe. Whether we have a full-time economist in Brussels or not, that is not our only means of obtaining information about what is happening in Europe and Britain. The Department has numerous channels and contacts by means of which it is continuously kept <i>au fait</i> with what is happening in Britain and Europe. The hon. member suggested that because we still do not have a properly trained economist in Brussels, we do not know what is going on there. We have our departmental representatives in all the capitals and also in other places; we have our embassies in those places, and through our diplomatic and other channels the Department is kept informed as to what is happening there at the moment. In regard to the appointment of an economist in Brussels, that is also a matter which may perhaps be raised under my Vote. We shall then be able to devote more time to that matter. It is not so easy to find an economist suitable and available for such a post. We would not like to appoint anybody there unless we are quite sure that he is the right person for that type of work. Attention is being devoted at the moment to the appointment of a person there, and unless we receive setbacks again, we hope within the near future to have a full-time economist there.</p>

<p>A question was also put in regard to compensation for the preferences we are now abandoning. The form of this compensation is not really relevant now. I would not like to give an indication now as to the form in which we would like to be compensated, but we think that we will be able to use it in future in further negotiations with G.A.T.T., when we discuss certain of our tariff obligations at G.A.T.T. Opportunities will also arise again when we seek exemption in respect of certain of our obligations under G.A.T.T., and on that occasion we hope to be able to make use of these sacrifices in order to obtain those exemptions from G.A.T.T.</p>

<p>I think those are the only points raised here. I do not want to go into the matter raised by the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin), namely that the Government does too little too late. I can just say that his Government did not do too little and too late; it did nothing at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>We have now come to the final stage, as far as this House is concerned, <span class="col_4975-4976" refersTo="page_1114"/>of the Unemployment Insurance Amendment Bill, and those of us who have taken an interest in this matter since it was introduced by the Minister, know that we on this side of the House have done everything in our power to persuade the Minister and his supporters to withdraw certain of these clauses and to modify others, and finally we did attempt to persuade the Minister to limit the life of this Bill, all because we were of the opinion that it is a very bad measure indeed. We intend voting against the third reading and we are going to ask for a division in the hope that there will still be some members on the Government side who will have a conscience about this measure and support us in our attempt to defeat this Bill and thus prevent it from going forward to the Other Place.</p>

<p>This is a Bill which is full of tricky little legal amendments, and to try to put the effect of these amendments, the actual contents of this Bill, into plain ordinary language is not easy without being accused of not putting the true picture before the House.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to speak for any length of time, but what I wish to do is to put the position with which the Bill has now presented us as clearly and as concisely as I can, bearing in mind that I may not deal with anything other than the contents of the Bill before us.</p>

<p>It would appear that there are three things which are of grave importance as far as the contributors to the Unemployment Insurance Fund are concerned. The first of these is that no allowance will be paid in respect of illness, unless the contributor has been employed as a contributor for at least 13 weeks from the date upon which his unemployment is deemed to have commenced. We referred to this as an attempt to save money at the expense of sick people who are no longer able to work. That is the first serious point that I wish to make in connection with this Bill. The second is that a contributor shall not be entitled to maternity benefits unless she has been in employment as a contributor for at lease 18 weeks during the year immediately preceding the expected date of her confinement, no matter what credits she may have earned over the previous years. Here we are attempting to save the assets of the fund at the expense of expectant mothers. The third proviso is that a contributor shall not be entitled to benefit unless he has been employed as a contributor or otherwise for at least 13 weeks during the 52 weeks immediately preceding the date upon which a period of employment is deemed to have commenced. Here we are being asked to agree to a very severe interference with what has been possible in terms of this fund in respect of a person who is unemployed for a lengthy period of time. In connection with this particular feature you will remember, Sir, that we had quite a lot to say at the second reading, and during the Committee Stage the main point at issue was whether the interpretation that the Minister places upon this particular clause and Section 39 (2) and (3) of the principal Act could be reconsidered by the board on appeal from a contributor who has been refused benefits as the result of the fact that he has already had 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits in a particular year. That simple issue could be summed up in this way, that the Minister is of the opinion that at any time when a contributor has had his benefits curtailed and is not in a position to qualify for further benefits, he has the right to appeal to the board and the board in its discretion will be in a position to extend the benefits if it seems fit to do so, notwithstanding the new qualification of 13 weeks. In other words, if the contributor has not worked for 13 weeks in a particular financial year, his hope of getting a second period of benefits is remote indeed. The Minister is not concerned about that so much because he believes that contributor can on appeal be given those benefits despite this qualification of 13 weeks. The Minister has promised to go into that point and if necessary to introduce an amendment in the Other Place if my interpretation proved to be correct. I may say briefly that the interpretation that I have placed on it is that because of the restrictive wording of Section 39 (3) it is not possible for a claims officer to grant benefits because we are dealing with a claim for benefits in a subsequent year and not in the particular year with which the claims officer is concerned.</p>

<p>If I were to put these three points in simpler terms I would say this, that unless a sick person works for 13 weeks whilst he is sick, he can receive no benefits. Secondly, unless an expectant mother has worked for 18 weeks in the year immediately to the birth of the baby she will receive no benefits, and, thirdly, unless a contributor who is willing and able to work gets employment for 13 weeks from the date on which he is deemed to have become unemployed, he will receive no benefits. These are the three principal groups on which the Minister estimates that the fund will save a total of R2,800,000. I ask you, Sir, does the Minister believe that the 768,000 contributors to the fund who are in employment and who may be temporarily out of employment will appreciate the fact that their fund is being protected by withholding R2,800,000 from the sick, the expectant mothers and those who are able to work but are unable to get employment? I wonder if the Minister appreciates these points? Here the workers are being asked to agree to a proposal which means that the saving effected at the expense of their former colleagues who are sick, who are unable to get work although they are prepared to work, is to be used to make their fund more secure. I think this must be a very sorry day indeed for hon. members on the other side and particularly for the Minister of Information who regards this as a laughing matter.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I could not resist in passing just mentioning that. There is another feature that I do not think has been raised at any other stage, but it is very pertinent in view of the amendments in this Bill and that is the question as to whether or not the Minister has had any discussions with his colleague, the Minister of Pensions and Social Welfare, whom I am pleased to see here this morning, because as a result of these amendments a considerable number of contributors to this Fund who would enjoy at the present time under the Act subsequent periods of unemployment benefits, are now going to become the responsibility of the Minister of Pensions because they are going to apply for the old-age pension, whereas under the Act as it now stands they would be able to get at least six months in a year benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. The Minister of Pensions can expect an increase in applications from those who are going to be affected by this Bill to quite a considerable degree. I hope that some consultations have taken place between these two hon. Ministers, and I hope that the hon. the Minister of Labour when he replies to this debate will tell us whether such discussions have taken place.</p>

<p>There is another point that is tied up with this issue as well, and that is that an old-age pensioner who applies for the old-age pension, he suffers as a result of the means test, and if the Department of Pensions takes into account the credits which a contributor may have to his account in the Unemployment Insurance Fund and looks upon those credits as an asset, where is the prospective old-age pensioner going to land? It is an issue which has to be considered. We have the position that there will be contributors who have not got a month but perhaps three or four years of credits built up and who will not be in a position to get any benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. That is the issue that is facing so many as a result of these specific amendments which the Minister has introduced, and the proof of it is that the Minister hopes that he will save this Fund an amount of R2,800,000 as a result of introducing these particular provisions. An amount of R2,800,000 is going to be taken out of the pockets of those who are least in a position to afford it, the sick, the expectant mothers and the persons who are able to work but cannot get employment. Those are the three groups who are going to sacrifice R2,800,000 per year so that the rest of the workers who are able and fit to work may know that their fund is secure for them when they should fall unemployed. The more one thinks about it, the more one realizes how desperate the future must be for the categories that I have mentioned, and I think the hon. the Minister of Information is going to have a lot of trouble to explain this away to the people in South Africa and also overseas. I do not intend to go any further, Mr. Speaker. I think I have said enough to convince this honourable House that in voting for the third reading they are doing a great disservice to the workers of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member has summarized his objections under three headings. The first was in regard to no allowances to contributors who suffer from chronic illness.

<p>That I admit. I think I have pointed out on at least six occasions in the course of the passage of this Bill that the Unemployment Insurance Fund is not there for the purpose of providing payments to persons who have ceased to be on the labour market through illness. It was never intended that this Fund should provide a source of income for persons who have left the labour market on account of chronic illness.</p>

<p>Yes. I have pointed out almost <i>ad nauseam</i> that it is an insurance fund, and they may even have credits.

<p>We on this side of the House strongly object to the provision in this clause by which a jackal club is permitted to cut a wire fence, and we appeal to the Minister to amend this accordingly. We say that, if a jackal-proof fence is cut, it can never be restored to the condition it was previously in. It is absolutely impossible to do so. I claim that a jackal-proof fence once cut would be very difficult to restore back to the condition of it being a jackal-proof fence. I think these are powers which are not necessary, and I think the hon. the Minister should rather make provision for bridle gates to be put into fences where there is a great length of fence through which a jackal club could proceed in following its game.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member is rather exaggerating the objection he is raising now. If one studies the matter, the effect is not so bad in practice. The clause only provides that the registered club shall have the right to cut a fence when hunting vermin. We must view the content of this clause against the background of the actual problem. The actual problem is to exterminate the jackals or other vermin. When we think of the annual losses amongst our sheep, amounting to approximately 300,000, we realize how serious the problem is. The loss of 300,000 sheep a year amounts, at a very low estimate, to R1,500,000 per annum. In the light of that, this is really not a great sacrifice the farmer is asked to make. And fences will not be cut everywhere. What fences will actually be cut?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened to the objections and I must agree with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat that the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) now seems to have the impression that the cutting of fences is being encouraged. I maintain that the provisions of the clause are so protective that a registered club will be very careful. It is provided in the Provincial Ordinances that a minimum of five owners and tenants of land, i.e. farmers, can form such a club. Therefore it is farmers who will have to implement the provisions of the Act. It <span class="col_4983-4984" refersTo="page_1118"/>is further provided that if such fence-cutting takes place, they must guard the spot until it is properly repaired, and they must restore it to the state, within practical and realistic limits, in which it was before. These are strict provisions, and to accept that as a result of this provision they will just cut vermin-proof fences at random is far-fetched. I want to point out that where there are vermin-proof fences from one farm to another, so that all the farms are fenced, then the procedure is that the club notifies its members that a hunt will take place. The farmer inspects his fencing to see that there are no holes, and if a jackal is in a camp its chances of getting into another camp are very slender. But what may happen is that the inside fences are such that they do not quite stop the jackal. Not only the South African Agricultural Union, but also other farmers&#x2019; associations, had the opportunity to discuss this matter over and over again for almost two years, and I think we can accept this provision without any fear. It was suggested that I should provide that gates should be erected. My reply to that is that the owners are at liberty themselves to determine on the specifications of their fences. We do not lay down specifications for fences, and they are at liberty to provide gates at convenient places. Therefore there are preventive measures which can be applied. But I do not want us to view this danger just from the angle of the inconvenience it may cause. We must also bear in mind the protection afforded in the Act for the elimination of serious damage which may be done by a reckless person or hunter.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) stated last night we on this side of the House have the traditional right on liquor matters to vote as individuals. I think this is a good Bill. Had this Bill been brought forward last year instead of the Bill which was to give European liquor, or White liquor as it is now called, to the <span class="col_4987-4988" refersTo="page_1120"/>Bantu in free supply, it would have been a better thing. The Bantu have now got used to having his own beer in the quantity in which it will now be available to him. To the Bantu kaffir beer is like whisky to the Scotsman. Both of them look upon it as a real food. I will agree that when you are cold and feel generally miserable a good tot of whisky does you a world of good. So does a good half gallon of beer do a Native good when he feels cold and empty and when he gets home on a wet day after having done a day&#x2019;s hard labour. I am going to call this beer by its traditional name, namely kaffir beer, although the hon. the Minister kept on harping upon the title of Bantu beer last night. We have never heard of that before. The Native knows it as kaffir beer and so do we. A rose by any other name, you might say, Sir, applies here. The traditional kaffir beer is a very good food and is a yeast food which balances the diet of the Native. I disagree with the statements made by my colleague, the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). He said that farmers were going to find it quite impossible to do milking on a Sunday afternoon. Mr. Speaker, I have been a dairy farmer all my life. I have no difficulty with Sunday afternoon milking whatsoever. The Native boys are always all there. In Natal we have the right to allow kraal heads to brew beer in reasonable quantities for themselves and for the inmates of the kraal. Every kraal head on my farm has that right.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was dealing with what I called the exaggerated picture painted by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) as to the evils of this Bill and the proposed legislation and the harm which may result from the freeing of beer from full control, as it is to-day. He went so far as to say that it would not only undermine the health of the Bantu population as a whole but that it would lead to a tremendous increase in TB and that the whole farming community would have the greatest difficulty even in getting their cows milked on a Sunday afternoon. I have pointed out that in Natal we have had the traditional right of allowing our Natives to brew their own beer. The owner of the farm gives that right in writing to the kraal head, and that has never been abused. I have been a dairy farmer all my life and I have had no difficulty at all in this regard. I think it is a poor farmer who cannot control his own Natives as far as that is concerned. [Interjections]. I do not mind saying it. I have heard it said before that if Natives get their traditional beer you cannot handrear your calves because you have to turn your calves in with the cows on a Sunday afternoon. I was told that when I first started farming on my own some 40 years ago. But I have never had difficulty. I will not put up with drunken Natives in my cowshed at any lime. I think it is a pity when those sort of exaggerated statements are made on a question such as this. In giving the Native back his right to brew his own beer in his kraal and consume that beer in his own home and on his own premises, is a good thing. It will lead to much less drunkenness amongst the Natives. If the Native cannot brew his own beer and drink it with his own family in his traditional way before we took full control and deprived him of that right, he starts looking for liquor which he usually obtains illicitly. He ends up by drinking skokiaan and all sorts of concoctions which only do him harm.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? The hon. member has not answered my previous question. My question was whether he realized that beer would be controlled under a new Act. Then I would like to ask him how does he know that under the traditional system there was less drunkenness?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I will answer that question, Sir. As a youngster we visited the Zulu reserves in our area and we saw them on our own farms. They have the right to brew their own beer as long as the farmer gives them the right in writing to brew sufficient beer to meet the requirements of the inmates of that kraal. I have not had any drunkenness to any extent. When you get to the peri-urban areas where there is strict control and they do not have that right, you see the drunkenness which takes place on a Sunday afternoon. They go looking for drink. That is why I say that I know what I am talking about when it comes to this question of beer. As I have said, every kraal head on my farm comes to me every year and I give him permission in writing to brew beer for the requirements of his own kraal. I have not had that right abused. If he did abuse that privilege I would give him notice on the turn to get off my farm.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the point raised by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) in relation to Clause 13, that the definition of who is the occupier or owner of the premises on which that beer can be brewed and stored. I think in terms of this present wording it could be held in court&#x2014;it certainly would be challenged&#x2014;that the owner is the occupier. After all, every labourer on a farm is an occupier of the premises provided by the employer. Here, I think it is necessary that an amendment should be introduced in the Committee Stage, as suggested by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories, making the definition quite clear as to who is an occupier and giving the right to the owner of the property, not the employee, to say whether beer shall be brewed, stored and consumed. I think we should be very clear on that and I hope the hon. the Minister will accept an amendment in <span class="col_4989-4990" refersTo="page_1121"/>the Committee Stage clarifying that position. I understand he will be prepared to accept such an amendment. I support the hon. member for Transkeian Territories in that this should be clarified so that it is water-tight. We are giving back to the Native a right which he has enjoyed in the past. I think this will make a much better law than the one which came into being last year according to which they were given White man&#x2019;s liquor. As I said in my opening remarks if we give him back this right you will find he will not abuse it, whereas there will be abuse in respect of the consumption of White liquor. I think this will do away with quite a number of our shebeen queens and put an end to illicit drinking to a great extent in the peri-urban areas. Beer is a good food and I think this is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>I can see nothing in the statement made by the hon. member for Albany, who keeps on wanting to ask me questions about farm labour and kaffir beer, that this is similar to the tot system. He draws a parallel between the tot system which operates in the Cape and the consumption of kaffir beer. I do not think that is a true picture. If the Native consumes kaffir beer in his own kraal, on his own premises, it is something quite different from the tot system under which the cheaper types of sherry and &#x201C;dop&#x201D; and other cheap liquor are consumed. In many instances this liquor is given to the Cape Coloured, under the tot system, as part of his wages. There is no question here of this beer being given to the Native as part of his wages. If the employer wants to give his employees a little kaffir beer it cannot do any harm. You will have to give him a large amount of kaffir beer before he will get drunk. Under the tot system, however, a few tots of a very cheap brandy or sherry will make him the worse for liquor in a short space of time. So I welcome this Bill. I think we are giving back to the Native something which has been taken from him, and that is a good thing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Last year I, as a wine farmer, voted in this House in favour of the motion for White man&#x2019;s liquor to be supplied to the Natives and I have not regretted it, and to-day I am glad to have the opportunity as a wine farmer to support this measure. I think it is only fair that in view of the fact that we have the privilege of drinking the liquor which we as White people produce in the Western Province, the Bantu should be able to obtain the liquor to which they are accustomed freely, and that we as Whites, as well as the Coloureds, should also be granted the right to drink it. But I must say that at the same time I, as a wine farmer, also have some objections to this Bill. My biggest objection is to the fact that this liquor is sold very cheaply. It is sold in the Paarl beer hall at 20c a gallon. My objection is that it will perhaps have the effect of more kaffir beer being sold and our natural wine not being sold as the result of the new taxes levied on it for the first time now. I can see that I am touching the heart of the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan), and I want to quote a few figures to show the House that there is some substance in what I am saying. Up to this Session it was the custom for wine farmers to be taxed indirectly on the alcoholic content of the liquor produced, but natural wine was not taxed. To make a comparison, I want to point out that if our whole wine crop of 600,000 leaguers is converted into pure alcohol by volume, we will find that every year 8.8 million gallons of alcohol is produced from the vine. That was the product which produced the taxes, but now we pay right through on our wine. As soon as we have made the wine we pay the tax on it. I just want to mention that the extra taxation just from natural wine this year is expected to produce R17,000,000, and now I come to kaffir beer.</p>

<p>According to statistics we get from the Mealie Control Board, last year 1.4 million bags of sprouted kaffircorn was sold, which can be used for one thing only, namely the making of kaffir beer. That does not take into account the amount traded by the Bantu amongst each other, just as little as account can be kept of what we wine farmers trade amongst each other, but now I come back to my argument, to the amount of &#x201C;kick&#x201D; which is sold. That is the alcohol in that beer. The standard recipe used by the beer halls is that from every four bags of sprouted grain of 180 lbs. each, they make 1,240 gallons of beer with an alcohol content by volume of 4 per cent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>How much &#x201C;kick&#x201D; is that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>It is just twice as much kick as all the products of the vine can produce in a year. It is over 17,000,000 gallons of pure alcohol, and not a cent of taxation is paid on that. If we convert that into the number of bottles consumed and we levy a tax of 1 cent per bottle, it will produce R26,000,000 in a year. But I do not want to be unreasonable. I do not say the Minister must do that, but I just feel that we wine farmers should not be treated less fairly than the people who are now going to drink kaffir beer. I am very sorry for the producer of kaffircorn. He must make a living, and I grant him that, and I do not want him to pay a cent in taxation, but the man who buys the sprouted grain should in all fairness pay a tax in order to do justice to the wine farmers. [Interjections.] I do not want to weary the House further with figures. I just want to say that one of the arguments used by people who oppose this legislation is that the farmer will no longer have any control on his farm over what the Natives, or even the Coloureds, drink. As the position is to-day, one already has enough trouble with these people. They make kaffir beer and other brews in any case, but it depends on oneself. If you, as the owner, do not exercise control, it is your own fault. Here the landowner will now get the opportunity to tell his employees: I am granting you <span class="col_4991-4992" refersTo="page_1122"/>consent to brew beer, but if you abuse it I will deprive you of that right. Therefore I welcome this Bill, with the proviso that I hope something will be done to make the price of Bantu beer a little more higher in order that we wine farmers may be able to compete.</p>

<p>&#x2026; will compete with the wine farmers because Bantu beer will also have a certain amount of &#x201C;kick&#x201D; and will not be subject to excise duty, whereas a duty is payable on wine. The hon. member has told us how much &#x201C;kick&#x201D; there is in every tot of Bantu beer. But since he has given us that information, why does he not tell us also how much &#x201C;kick&#x201D; there is in every &#x201C;tot&#x201D;? [Laughter.] I just want to warn the hon. member for Karoo that the Minister of Finance is only too inclined to exploit every possible source of revenue, and he must not put the idea into his head of imposing a duty also on kaffir beer. No, I see no objection to or danger to the wine farmer in the passing of this Bill. On the contrary, I think this measure is necessary after the passing of the Liquor Act last year, as I shall explain in a moment. But I want to come back to the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker).</p>

<p>The hon. member raised many objections to the passing of this Bill. He told us how bad the position was on his farm, but I want to tell him that the position that he complains about exists under the present Act, and that I have had that experience myself. It is not the outcome of the Bill that we are discussing here. But I want to say this: If the passing of last year&#x2019;s measure, which provided for the supply of wine and brandy to the Bantu, or the passing of this Bill is going to change the drinking habits of the Bantu and the Coloureds, we will have achieved a great deal. The hon. member for Albany will concede that it is not the drinking of Bantu beer which places him on Sunday afternoons in the position that he has complained about. He must admit that position is caused by the people who make all sorts of concoctions. I know of cases where yellow sugar and torch batteries are added to the beer, or a rat in an advanced state of decomposition. It sounds far-fetched, but that is the truth. Even meat which has reached a certain stage of decomposition is thrown into it in order to give it the &#x201C;kick&#x201D; which causes all the trouble experienced by the hon. member for Albany. Mr. Speaker, we have placed restrictions on the Bantu in brewing his traditional liquor, and we give the owner of the land the right to allow only a certain quantity of Bantu beer to be brewed, but that quantity is never sufficient to meet his requirements. It is in those circumstances that the Bantu tries to put the &#x201C;kick&#x201D; into it, to which the hon. member for Karoo referred; he tries to put as much &#x201C;kick&#x201D; as possible into the quantity that he is allowed. No, this argument advanced by the hon. member for Albany holds no water. I am certainly as much concerned as he is about the drinking habits, not only of the Bantu or of the Coloureds, but also of the Whites, and I am equally anxious to see less alcoholism amongst our people. I know that the hon. member for Albany reads his Bible very regularly and believes in it, and if he reads his Bible he will see that wine was used at the particular wedding at which Jesus officiated.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>There are many cases of drunkenness referred to in the Bible. Even Father Lot was also a little under the influence. There was drunkenness in those days too, but that is no justification for allowing more drunkenness to-day. As a matter of fact, the object of this measure is to keep people more sober. Once we have succeeded in teaching the Bantu to use liquor in a civilized way, whether it be kaffir beer or wine or brandy, we shall have gone a long way. Like the hon. member for Albany, I, too, have had a great deal of trouble because these people always have a certain amount of fear that whatever liquor they prepare for themselves for the week-end will be destroyed by the police in a raid, so they try to get under the influence of liquor as quickly as possible. I know of many hon. members whom I would not call drunkards, but who do have a drink and who benefit from it, and the hon. member for Albany must not begrudge the Bantu and the Coloured the same opportunity. The hon. member for Albany made a strange statement here when he said that the Bantu of 18 years of age, to whom we want to give the right to obtain Bantu beer without restriction, only has the intelligence of a child, and will never grow up. I find that a strange argument coming from the hon. member, bearing in mind the fact that it is the same hon. member who, according to their federation plan, wants to give the franchise to these people, and who is prepared to share with them the responsibility of governing this country.</p>

<p>After the introductory speech made by the Deputy Minister, it required only three further speeches to indicate immediately what divergent views are held on the merits of this Bill. We were told by the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) that this Bill represented a step in the right direction and that he was convinced that it would be in the interest of South Africa, yet a few minutes later the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) said that this was the worst thing that could ever happen, and that he felt ashamed to be in this House when such a measure was discussed. I leave it to you to imagine, Sir, what this hon. member will feel like when this Bill becomes law. The point is that there are many people outside the House, as well as in it, who feel exactly the same as that hon. member. This is an extremely controversial matter, and I think that at least we should agree that this Bill, coupled as it is with the introduction of the operation of the Liquor Amendment Act, on the same day, represents a very important departure from established practice. I submit that the consequences of this may be of such enormous proportions and significance that it requires more than the wit of one man to estimate the socio-economic consequences, and its effect on the people of South Africa. We are virtually asking the country to take an unchartered course by the provision of liquor, virtually without restriction, to 11,000,000 people who have up to now been restricted in their opportunities to acquire liquor in any form; and not only will they be given their traditional liquor, Bantu beer, but also every other kind of liquor. [Interjections.] I do not know whether the Minister of Information was here last night when the Deputy Minister made his speech. One of the things he said was that this Bill would come into force on the same day as the amended Liquor Act.

<p>Well, it appears that people outside this House find it easier to persuade the Minister of Information than I do. Surely he realizes that the moment a Bantu can buy not only Bantu beer without any restriction, and brew it without restriction in some cases, but on top of that he can mix his drinks by buying any kind of &#x201C;White&#x201D; liquor, the consequences go beyond the supply of Bantu beer. We do not require a sociologist to explain that, so I will not pursue it. What I say is that we are now about to set sail on an unchartered sea. This is a very serious measure and it should be very carefully considered. [Interjection.] The purpose of my speech is to ask the House which, judging from the speeches made, is clearly not <i>ad idem</i> on the Bill, to ask the Deputy Minister to reconsider, if not the whole Bill, then certain aspects of it. The point I am trying to make is this. The Minister has said that the Bantu will welcome this Bill. That may be so. In fact, expressions of opinion in certain quarters indicate that they will welcome it, but there have also been other expressions of opinion, particularly from those organizations which speak on behalf of Bantu women. I am sure the Deputy Minister is aware of the fact that as far as expressions of opinion by Bantu women are concerned, they do not welcome this Bill, and for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>I may be wrong, but I say that expressions of opinion from Bantu women do not indicate that they welcome the Bill, and for obvious reasons. Surely hon. members realize that the experience of the White community in regard to the use of liquor in this country or in any other country has led many women&#x2019;s associations to take a very strong stand against the distribution of liquor, for the obvious reason that the man, being the wage-earner, gets the money before it goes into the family purse, and he being the one who is usually inclined to drink, rather than the female of the species, the amount of money spent on drink is, in the view of the women, money of which she and her family find themselves deprived. With respect, I suggest that I speak with some experience in regard to what local authorities know about the distribution of Bantu beer and the effect of it, and the matter is far from being so simple that anyone can say with any authority that this is a step in the right direction, and that it is in the best interests of South Africa. I do not want to be dogmatic, because this is not a matter about which anyone can be dogmatic. It is a matter very much of opinion&#x2014;and of experience&#x2014;as to how it will work. I want to tell you, Sir, that in regard to the rather friendly argument that has arisen just in front of me between these two hon. members, I do not intend to intervene because I have practically no experience of the distribution of Bantu beer, or B.B.&#x2014;(of course, if you said &#x201C;B.B.&#x201D; in Europe, people would understand something else)&#x2014;<span class="col_4995-4996" refersTo="page_1124"/>amongst the rural Natives. This Bantu beer, according to the hon. member for Albany has interfered on Sundays with the milking of his dairy herd. He speaks from his own experience, and yet the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) says, &#x201C;nothing of the kind!&#x201D; In his experience, his employees have not kept on drinking until the cows come home, and so they were ready to milk when the cows did come home; but apparently in the case of the hon. member for Albany, his employees kept on drinking until after the cows came home, and then they could not tell the difference between the milk and the beer. I sincerely hope that we will not lightly dismiss the argument advanced by the hon. member for Albany. There you have your first clue as to what my views are about Bantu beer.</p>

<p>But what I want to deal with mainly is the distribution, in terms of this Bill, of beer to the urban Natives. Sir, the greatest and best justification, in my experience, that anyone has ever been able to find for the large-scale undertaking of beer-brewing by any local authority in South Africa&#x2014;and this has become a traditional argument&#x2014;is, that from the profits of that Bantu beer or kaffir beer, it can provide those amenities for Natives which the local authority, it is said, would otherwise not have been able to provide. And, Sir, since it has been said <i>ad nauseam</i> that the bulk of our Native population, even after the independence of portions, as proposed by that side of the House, will remain in the so-called White South Africa, and since we have in the cities the largest concentration, in any given area at any rate, of the Bantu population of this country, and since we have in the case of a city like Johannesburg, 750,000 Bantu living in close proximity to the White population, it is that aspect of the matter which, I think, requires the greater consideration because it will require the greater control, if there can be any control.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The answer is a very simple one. The Deputy Minister, being wise in his generation, has not sought to prejudice the local authorities by depriving them in any way of their present monopoly. He knows which side his bread is buttered on or he knows which tankard his beer is in, and he is very quick to say in this Bill that in certain cases&#x2014;and obviously those that are established cases will continue&#x2014;the local authority becomes the monopolist, the only authority or person or undertaking (for the benefit of the hon. member for Albany) which can brew and provide Bantu beer; so the question, in the case of Johannesburg, for example, of private enterprise or a bottle-store impinging on this monopoly in regard to the manufacture of kaffir beer cannot enter into the matter because it will not be possible for them to do so. In terms of what the Deputy Minister has told us&#x2014;if anything, the bottle-store will now become the client of the local authority with its enormous brewery undertaking. The bottle-store would be able to buy this beer and sell it to its clients. And, Sir, one of the amazing things about the whole situation is that the Deputy Minister asked us to accept as one of the merits of this Bill the fact that kaffir beer or Bantu beer would now be freely available to Europeans through their bottle-stores in the ordinary way. Now, Sir, I want to test this.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>That is perfectly true, of course. What I mean is that they will buy it there, and there will be no more difficulty about buying that than buying other traditional types of liquor. I was going to say that is an extraordinary situation. We are asked to believe that we are now about to exchange compliments with the Bantu people, &#x201C;We&#x201D; being the White people; we are going to drink their traditional liquor, Bantu beer, and they are going to drink our traditional liquor, being the all-sorts, because on the same day and at the same time I. as a European, will then have the privilege of going to my bottle-store, which traditionally has made enormous profits out of selling me the conventional liquor&#x2014;to the extent where some of them have a goodwill of R200,000&#x2014;and say to them, &#x201C;Send me a dozen bottles of B.B.&#x201D; With due respect, I do not regard that as a privilege, and not entirely because I have never found kaffir beer palatable; but I do not regard it as a privilege&#x2014;I do not know whether I am in the minority in this House, possibly a minority of one&#x2014;I do not regard it as a privilege and I do not regard as an inducement for me to support this Bill, the fact that I, as a European, will in the future be able to buy kaffir beer, because in any case one&#x2019;s tastes having become accustomed to a certain type of beer, the beer drinker does not lightly change. In any case, I believe it is quite unreasonable to ask that this Bill should* be supported on the ground that we are now being given a concession. I submit to the Deputy Minister with great respect that those who can afford to buy whisky are not going to buy kaffir beer from any bottle-store; but the converse, of course, is the important consideration, and that is that those who cannot afford whisky, being the new-found Bantu drinker, who traditionally has been drinking his Bantu beer, to whom it has been, as we have heard over and over again, not only drink but food, this new drinker who cannot afford whisky will now be able to buy whisky. To me that is the greater consequence of this coincidence in the date of application, a very important coincidence, and it would require more than my time this afternoon to try and outline even the remote consequences of it.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with the position of the local authorities, to whom the merit in the <span class="col_4997-4998" refersTo="page_1125"/>brewing and the sale of beer has always been held out as being the opportunity to earn the profits out of which certain amenities could be provided for Natives. I think it should be placed on record what has happened, for example, in the city of Johannesburg. In regard to its Non-European Affairs Department, the recreational facilities that had already been provided up to 30 June 1959&#x2014;and I personally have taken various Cabinet Ministers to various sites for recreation since that time, in 1960 and 1961&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>No, one would hesitate to play with any Cabinet Minister. Sir, here are the facilities that had already been provided up to 30 June 1959&#x2014;the significance of this is enormous, and I think these facts should be known: The number of sports fields was 59; the number of American basket-ball sports 5, athletic tracks 3, children&#x2019;s playgrounds 23, club-houses 14, cycle tracks 2, dance arenas 2, enclosed sportsgrounds 2, one gymnasium, recreation halls 4, skittle alleys 2, sports stadia 2 and tennis courts 24, a total as at 30 June of 143 recreational amenities for an enormous and a very hard-pressed population. I give this evidence gratuitously as evidence to those who support the argument that the sale of kaffir beer by the local authority, which will have the monopoly wherever it wants it under this Bill, should be encouraged because in this way you provide them with the amenities. And in case hon. members doubt the position as to how these amenities can be financed merely by the sale of this very cheap commodity, kaffir beer, which according to the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux) could even stand an impost of 1 cent a bottle&#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, I do not like to use the word &#x201C;tot&#x201D; when I am talking to him because I do not know him well enough&#x2014;but I think he said 1 cent a bottle. The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) yesterday did touch on this question of the provision of amenities by the local authority. I do not know whether he should have attempted to give the details or not, but I would like the House to know how these things are financed because this is directly concerned with this Bill; this is the justification for the greater part of this Bill. In the case of Johannesburg again, in the year 1959, the income for the year 1958-9 on its Native beer halls, which are obviously the distributing outlets for its brewery, was R2,600,000. I am not talking about the odd gallon or 50 gallons of beer that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) or the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) has to contend with when his boys are drinking on a Sunday. We are talking of big business here; this is enough to make the South African Breweries tear their hair out with envy. The income was R2,600,000. The expenditure incurred in order to earn this income was R1,300,000. The surplus for the year ended 30 June 1959, was R1,300,000.</p>

<p>The hon. member said, &#x201C;shame Sir, you may well ask how much capital is required to earn this apparently enormous profit of 100 per cent, and I will tell you. The capital outlay on these beer halls as at 30 June 1959, was just over R1,000,000; so there you have a very fine business proposition where, with a capital outlay&#x2014;which remains pegged, which is not subject to taxation&#x2014;of R1,000,000, you do a turnover of R2,600,000 a year. And let me tell hon. members that this has increased since 1959, by I think, 16 per cent. With this capital outlay of R1,000,000 or just over R1,000,000, you have an annual profit of R1,300,000.</p>

<p>There you are&#x2014;this hon. member says &#x201C;disgraceful&#x201D;. I am often told that we are not very clever in Johannesburg. For all I know the brewery in Pietermaritzburg works on a bigger profit, but in spite of this complaint, the position is that the justification has always been, &#x201C;See what we do with the money&#x201D;. I have already told the House what Johannesburg does with the money. Despite the fact that one can hardly evade the necessity for providing these amenities for the Bantu in the urban areas and one cannot readily find other means, a certain ethical doubt must creep in as to whether you are doing the right thing in encouraging people to drink&#x2014;some people would say, to drink themselves into a stupor&#x2014;in order to give them recreation to enjoy when they come to. There must be a certain ethical doubt, and of course that doubt becomes magnified where a local authority, which is not an individual or a company&#x2014;and one knows that individuals and companies are not necessarily bound by ethics (they are bound by law)&#x2014;where a public body like a local authority, representing the will of the people in its particular area, can indulge in this sort of practice, which we have been assured over and over again is the beginning of the process of deterioration, as the hon. member for Albany referred to it, of an increasing degree of alcoholism which may eventually become very serious. How does one square that circle; how does one get over the fact that, for example in 1960, the then Chairman of the Committee on Alcoholism of the American Medical Association, a very eminent doctor by the name of Marvin Block who visited South Africa, in addressing the National Conference on Alcoholism which I opened&#x2014;I cannot say that I had any pleasure from it, but I opened it&#x2014;said that France had an incidence of alcoholism, pro rata the population, of 6 per cent. He said that the United States was just behind it. a very good second&#x2014;if you can say &#x201C;good&#x201D; in that context&#x2014;<span class="col_4999-5000" refersTo="page_1126"/>but having spent some weeks in this country, having investigated many, many statistics, having had discussions at Governmental level, he went on to say that we were lying right next to the United States, second on the list as far as alcoholism is concerned. Now, I must ask myself, and I think we should all ask ourselves and I am not going to come to the sort of conclusion to which the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) came the other day when he said, &#x201C;I said this to myself and I said that to myself&#x2014;and then I signed the affidavit I cannot sign any affidavit) but I am obliged to ask myself whether it has been shown beyond any doubt that this Bill is one which is in the best interests of South Africa. Contrary to this belief, I would point to the example of France. We all know that on the Continent generally, but particularly in France, which is a very large wine-producing country, there is no difficulty for anybody of any complexion, of any economic or social status, to obtain liquor; you can drink it in a cafe, on the pavement or you can sit in the gutter&#x2014;not you, Sir, of course, but one can sit in the gutter and drink. And there we have a situation where it has been established by the Government that 6 per cent of the population is alcoholic already; more are being turned that way all the time, and it has become such a serious problem that one particular Prime Minister recently tried to enforce a no-drinking ban; he substituted milk-bars and he was out of office before the sun had set, as it were. I want to say that whereas one can see, perhaps in a rather sardonic manner, the funny side of this situation sometimes, it is not something that can be dealt with lightheartedly. If we have to-day 5.6 per cent of our population classified as alcoholics&#x2014;and people have gone on record with facts to prove that&#x2014;how many more will become alcoholic as the result of what one can only call the liberalization of liquor for all the races in South Africa, and more particularly for the Bantu? How can anybody say at this stage that it is undoubtedly in the interests of South Africa?</p>

<p>Somebody over there says that there will be less; I do not want to labour my point but I merely say that there is at least room for a little doubt, for a little soul-searching about this matter.</p>

<p>In regard to the actual provisions of this Bill, it is laid down in Clause 4 that any person may for domestic consumption and any employer may for supply free-of-charge to his employees brew Bantu beer. One of the things that struck me was the fact that this, like most of the other clauses of the Bill, is something which has no ceiling; in fact the sky is the limit. Any quantity of Bantu beer can be brewed by an employer, for example, and clearly if any quantity of Bantu beer can be brewed, then any quantity of Bantu beer, in terms of the Bill, can be supplied by an employer. I am concerned in this clause not so much with the position of the local authority which has a certain record, which has a certain know-how, in regard to both the brewing and distribution of Bantu beer; it can assess the position as to whether drinking is on the up-grade or rather whether the curve is going upwards, or whether it is on the down-grade. It has a background of experience. But what do you do with an employer who suddenly discovers that under this clause he is entitled, assuming he employs 25 or more Bantu over the age of 18, to provide Bantu beer without restriction?</p>

<p>I realize that, but consider the position in regard to any other commodity of which you pile up stocks; that stock becomes a pressure, or generates a pressure&#x2014;In this case, literally&#x2014;if you stock pile Bantu beer, you know what happens as a result of the pressure. I want to submit that a private employer is now going to be permitted not only to supply this beer, but to brew it and supply it on an unrestricted basis as to volume, and there will be a natural inclination both on the part of management to give more away and on the part of labour to take more of it away; that must be so. I would like to ask the Deputy Minister therefore at least to take another look at this Bill. Once he fixes the number at 25 he must also have some idea&#x2014;and if he has not, I think I and others in this House can give it to him&#x2014;as to what would be a reasonable potion for the Bantu-worker to obtain at, say, lunch-time and, say, at 5 o&#x2019;clock. Whether it should be one pint or one gallon I do not want to say now; it is a matter of the individual point of view, but we must put a limit on this, and say that in respect of 25 employees an employer may only brew, shall we say, 50 gallons of beer a day.</p>

<p>The hon. member here rightly says that we should make use of the experience of the mines, and I would say that we should make use of what is even more to the point, that is, the experience of the local authority. There must be a limit&#x2014;that is my first point in regard to the Bill itself otherwise you will have the situation where an employer for his own reasons wants bigger and better production on a particular day and wants everybody to be &#x201C;hopped up&#x201D;, as the Americans would say, and then the party is on, at lunch-time; they can drink as much as they like as long as they get through the work afterwards. I think it could almost be said to be an immoral way of inducing the happiness of your Bantu labour.</p>

<p>In Clause 5 (3) it is provided that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A local authority shall not sell or supply <span class="col_5001-5002" refersTo="page_1127"/>Bantu beer to any person under the apparent age of 18 years.</block>

<p>I think that may be a source of some difficulty in the future. I am assuming now that this Bill will be passed. I think the Minister knows better than I do that the apparent age of a Bantu is not a very simple matter to determine. In fact, I think it is more complicated than our search for a definition here just a few days ago which seemed to last for a year but was only five days for a definition of what is White, what is Coloured and what is Black. If you speak to a Bantu and ask him what his age is, usually, or very often if he has just come from the Platteland, he will tell you that he does not know, and if you look at him he could be 18 or 23, or 40 or 60. I want to suggest that this apparent age of 18, if any age is going to be laid down at all, should be stepped up to the age of 20 or 23. I do not want to advise the Minister once I have made my point, because he will know how to deal with it. But it will be easier at that age to determine what the apparent age is rather than at the age of 18, when any man, whether he is White or Black, is either still adolescent or just emerging from adolescence. It is easier to define the apparent age when maturity has been reached. I would like the Minister therefore to take another look at this clause.</p>

<p>In Clause 5 (4), which deals with sites or premises on which no female person shall be, there is a proviso to this effect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that a description of any such site or premises or such part of any such site or premises restricted in respect of female persons shall be conspicuously displayed or notified on or in such site or premises.</block>

<p>This restriction of the premises in so far as the access of females is concerned, may and, certainly, in the experience of the local authority, can cause a certain amount of difficulty. You see, Sir, the gentlemen of all complexions who go in for a &#x201C;quick one&#x201D; after work have been known to linger. In fact, it is almost conventional to linger. In the Bantu townships of Johannesburg, at the end of a working day, there are thousands of Bantu women who, having waited long enough for the spouse and the head of the house to come back, decided that they want to go and fetch him from the Beer hall, and I submit to the Deputy Minister that where a female, regardless of her colour, wishes to embark on such a necessary and even hazardous expedition, no legal barrier should be put in her way. She should be entitled to go and look for her husband and to say, &#x201C;It is time you came home and gave me the balance of the wages,&#x201D; he having spent the greater part of it on beer. I leave it at that. I am not speaking here to champion the rights of women.</p>

<p>Clause 13 provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person may be in possession of Bantubeer on or in any private site or premises without the consent of the owner or lawful occupier&#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) has moved an amendment, which has already been supported on this side, and possibly on the other side too. I, too, wish to support that amendment because I think it would be quite wrong to allow a person who occupies a room as an employee of the lawful occupier of the site or the premises, to have any rights in this matter of bringing liquor into the premises. This has caused a lot of trouble in this country, particularly in the larger cities, in the past, and one does not want to see a recurrence of this on a larger scale because the garden-boy can now argue that he is the lawful occupier because he occupies a room belonging to what we call the lawful occupier. This question of the consent of the owner is something which I think requires re-examination. How often must that consent be given, since no permit, no written consent, is involved here? Is it sufficient, for example, for the employee to say to the employer at the beginning of his term of employment, &#x201C;I intend to bring alcohol or liquor into my room; have I your consent?&#x201D;, and then if the owner has said &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, does that mean that for the duration of that contract of employment, which, as we know, is on a weekly or monthly basis only, the employee then has the right at all times to bring in any quantity of liquor? Is that the position? The Minister must know what he means by &#x201C;consent&#x201D;, because I interpret it in one way only, that is that every time liquor is brought there by whoever it may be, every time the threshold of the premises or the building site or the yard is crossed, whoever is employed on that site must have the lawful occupier&#x2019;s consent for every such delivery. With due respect to the Deputy Minister, as it stands here this &#x201C;consent&#x201D; can be interpreted in such a way as to read only to friction.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I was a little puzzled by Clause 19 (b), which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed as prohibiting&#x2014; <br/>(b) any employer from acquiring Bantu beer for sale on behalf of the local authority concerned, to persons in his employ.</block>

<p>I was told by one of my hon. friends here with considerable legal knowledge that I was unnecessarily perturbed, because all that the employer could do here would be to act as the agent of the local authority and merely collect the money for it. But what I am not clear about is whether, in the event of a price having been established by the local authority for the supply in bulk of Bantu beer, and the employer then, having acquired the Bantu beer for sale in terms of Clause 19 (b), acts on behalf of the local authority and hands it over for cash to his employee&#x2014;whether it is quite impossible for him to say, &#x201C;I have bought it at <span class="col_5003-5004" refersTo="page_1128"/>so much a gallon in bulk; I am supplying it at so much per bottle in plastic bottles and there is a difference in price because of handling, storing, labour etc.&#x201D; In other words, whether there is any possibility here of a markup as between the price charged by the local authority and the price charged by the employer who is only purporting to act as the agent for the local authority, and whether in that difference there is not perhaps the opportunity of quite a substantial profit for those who are unscrupulous enough and those who employ thousands of Natives, for whom this will be an important or attractive feature of their employment. I want to ask the Deputy Minister to clarify that.</p>

<p>Sir, having said that, I want to assure you that on this subject of the Bill and its effects a great deal more can be said, and I hope it will be said by hon. members. I hope it will not be allowed to die a natural death and simply be put to the vote, merely because of the fact that there is to be a free vote. This is something, I submit, which will lead inevitably to a flood of beer pouring across the greater part of this country. Sir, we know what happened after the great flood which brought a certain Noah into public prominence, but I am not able to forecast the consequences of this new flood. Sir, I ask the Deputy-Minister who, I know, has the interests of the the Bantu at heart, and I ask all the members of this House who have been able to and can still give this matter some thought, to consider carefully all the implications of this Bill before a flood is let loose upon South Africa, the consequences of which are completely unknown to us, beyond the fact that larger revenue will be earned by local authorities; there will be more sports fields provided by them, certain farmers will not have trouble with the milking of their cows on a Sunday afternoon. In the purely sociological sense, I submit, we have not got enought facts to say dogmatically that this Bill is in the best interests of South Africa&#x2014;the converse may well prove to be the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital has raised many points here, some of which are important, and I want to deal with a few of them, but he also raised many points which in my opinion should be dealt with in the Committee stage. I want to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister on this legislation, and I do so because to a large extent I agree with what the hon. member who has just sat down has said, and that is that the two dates should coincide; in other words, when we make the White man&#x2019;s liquor available to the Black man in this country, we should at the same time make available his own liquor to him. I regard that as very important because, like the hon. member, we are all reluctant to encourage alcoholism in this country. We will want to guard against the Black man&#x2019;s becoming an alcoholic. That is why I welcome this Bill because I am convinced, with my knowledge of their customs and their background and their traditions, that we cannot withhold his beer from the Bantu in South Africa. If we do not give him what is his natural beverage, namely Bantu beer, he is going to buy other concoctions and mix all sorts of poisonous elements with it. We know that in many respects we ragard the Native as a mystic; we as Whites only partially understand his make-up. But we know that his Bantu beer is one of the things around which his tradition revolves, and that there are certain Native ceremonies which can only be performed when they have their own beer available. Failing that, they have to resort to something else. As I know the Bantu in South Africa, the good beer that he brews for himself has never made an alcoholic out of him and it has never had a bad effect on his family life. But the hon. member for Hospital suggests that if we make Bantu beer available to him, the Bantu will spend his wages on beer, and that his wife and children will suffer. I contend that the opposite is true, and that is that the very thing that the hon. member is warning against is what is happening to-day; because what is happening to-day is that the Bantu gets into the wrong company when he visits shebeens. When he finishes the day&#x2019;s work and feels like a mug of beer, he ends up in the shebeen where he is given intoxicating liquor. Instead of going home and being able to enjoy the beer there that his wife has prepared for him, a wholesome beverage, he has to go to the shebeens or to the beer halls to spend his money, and in addition to that he is robbed there by the bad elements with whom he has to mix. I think this is a much more serious matter and one which goes much deeper than many people realize. I would go so far as to say that it is this attempt on the part of the White man to withhold his traditional beverage from the Bantu that is responsible for much of the hatred and animosity on the part of the Bantu against the White man. It is due to the control over liquor as presently applied. Take the case of such a family wishing to hold some function or other, to celebrate an engagement or wedding or some big occasion in the life of the family. The police arrive on the scene, all the liquor is thrown out, all the preparations are upset and people are arrested and conveyed in police vans to prison. Can you imagine what bitterness this causes in the family circle! While meaning to do well, we have aroused feelings of hostility that will take many years to wipe out. We have caused that hatred by enforcing legislation of that kind. I think that in his natural home environment, in his family circle, in his own circle of friends, the Bantu will seldom if ever overstep the mark provided he can get wholesome Bantu beer. I am very pleased that this step is being taken, because I have been convinced for a long time that the existing conditions are responsible for most of the trouble that the police and the authorities have had with the Bantu, who by nature are law-abiding individuals. As I say, the Bantu in South Africa are by nature law-abiding people, but when one behaves in an unreasonable way towards other people one cannot expect that <span class="col_5005-5006" refersTo="page_1129"/>there will be no reaction from them. I say again that the way in which we have withheld from the Bantu his natural beverage, which is not an alcoholic beverage but one which he practically regards as his food, has caused bitterness which to a large extent has been justified perhaps, in spite of the fact that we have done this with the best of intentions.</p>

<p>I am also pleased that now at last we are also making Bantu beer available to the Whites, not that I believe that the Whites will consume Bantu beer on a large scale, but why should people in the remote areas who find it difficult to come into town to obtain supplies of ordinary beer, not be allowed to brew their own beer? I want to give hon. members the assurance that a glass of cold kaffir beer on a very warm day is one of the most effective thirst-quenchers that one can get. And there is nothing wrong with it. It all depends on how it is prepared. It is a beverage from which the White man can derive great benefit, and it is a very nice drink. I am not making propaganda against wine. I must say that last year I voted with very mixed feelings for the legislation that we then passed, because I regarded it as a serious matter to vote for a measure which makes the White man&#x2019;s liquor freely available to the Bantu in South Africa. But there were certain problems to which I could find no solution and, moreover, I did not want to go against the wine farmers in this country unnecessarily. I thought that if we could find a market for their good, wholesome wine, we should not stand in their way. But I welcome this legislation in terms of which the White man&#x2019;s liquor is to be made available to the Bantu, but at the same time we are making his own national beverage available to the Bantu in a more liberal and better way. I hope that this Bill will receive the blessing of this House and that it will usher in a new period in which there will be a better understanding between the various racial groups in South Africa&#x2014;and that is probably more important to-day than any other issue. We must do away with things that unnecessarily cause ill feeling.</p>

<p>I think I have replied to the more general points raised by the hon. member for Hospital, but before I sit down I just want to give him the assurance that the Bantu women of South Africa will undoubtedly welcome the day when their husbands will be able to come home once again and enjoy their Bantu beer in their own homes instead of having to get it in a shebeen or in a beer hall. I hasten to say that I have nothing against a beer hall as such, because it is a good and essential institution for the Bantu who is living away from his family. The hon. member for Karoo has stated that kaffir beer should be subject to excise duty. I want to tell the hon. member that a great deal of good is being done for the Bantu population out of the profits made on beer halls. As a matter of fact the hon. member also referred to it. But the beer hall system has one great defect and that is that the Native is obliged to go to the beer hall instead of being able to return to his own home and to drink his national beverage in his home circle.</p>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased that the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) at the end of his remarks suggested that the House should take this matter very seriously, because I know that there are large numbers of people outside this House who are taking this matter very seriously, and some have expressed surprised that this debate is receiving very little attention in the Press. Many people are anxious to know just how seriously the House is taking this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my first impressions on reading this Bantu Beer Bill were much the same as those expressed by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). It seemed to me that this Bantu Beer Bill would tend to mitigate to some extent the dangers and in fact the disasters which some people fear might follow when the Liquor Bill passed last year is brought into force. But on second thought and further consideration, I have come to the conclusion that view was really a superficial one, and after further considering the matter I feel that the Bantu Beer Bill will not mitigate the dangers which may very well flow from the Liquor Bill that was passed last year. This Bill is regarded by some as the lesser of two evils. On the contrary it seems to me that in fact you are going to have one evil added to the other. Although some hon. members may disagree, I feel that we are going to have virtually indiscriminate brewing of Bantu beer, with the result that added on top of the White liquor being made available freely to the Bantu throughout South Africa, will mean that the Bantu in South Africa will be flooded with liquor. He will be able to get all the liquor he wants, and what the effect will be upon people who have not had free access to liquor, remains to be seen. Personally I fear that the results are going to be much more serious than people imagine.</p>

<p>Before going further, I would like to refer to a remark made by the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux), when he estimated that possibly four times as much alcohol from kaffir beer would be made available as is now being made from the product of the vine. That was the estimate of somebody who is well connected with the liquor trade, and therefore I think I am correct in stating that we are going to have the country flooded with European liquor and Bantu liquor. What the effect of that is going to be, nobody can as yet foresee.</p>

<p>Personally, I have intimate knowledge of the Western Province where I lived for many years and also of the Border Area where I have lived for many years. Many people may be under a misconception as to the attitude of the Bantu when it comes to this matter of liquor. Many base their opinion on what they see here in the Western Province. I want to draw attention to what goes on in the country towns of the Western Province on a Friday afternoon and a Saturday morning when the police go <span class="col_5007-5008" refersTo="page_1130"/>around in their vans picking up the Coloured men as they come out of the bars and fall into the sloots, taking them away in van-loads. I mention this because the Coloured man is an individualist. When he has had his drink, he comes out and may start a brawl with another individual; he is taken away and that is the end of it.</p>

<p>But when you come to deal with the Bantu in the big Bantu areas, especially in the cities, the situation is very different indeed. When the Bantu has too much, he comes out and starts a brawl, but the Bantu&#x2019;s mentality is to go about in teams. For the Bantu young man stick-fighting is his sport; it is his Saturday afternoon&#x2019;s football. They work in teams and when one Bantu gets into a brawl with another Bantu of another kraal or of another tribe his pals come round to support him and then you get the big fight in which there are heavy casualties, and if the police try to intervene, the net result is very often that the whole lot then attack the police. I warn hon. members that thing is likely to happen. I have seep it happening under present circumstances, and when strong liquor is available along with kaffir beer, I am afraid nobody can say what is going to happen. To my own way of thinking I fear that the police will find the position uncontrollable in many instances. The position will be much more serious than many people who do not know the Bantu areas may anticipate. To my way of thinking, this House is creating a Frankenstein monster which will be far beyond their control. It will not only have serious repercussions on the Bantu people, but also on the economy of the country; when these brawls take place which develop into riots, the economy of the country suffers; there is nothing that the Press overseas like to take up more than trouble we are having with our Bantu people; the repercussions can be serious, and I would not be a bit surprised to find that this will have serious repercussions not only for the country as a whole, but also for the Government which last year brought in the Bill to supply the White man&#x2019;s drink to the Bantu and now comes with this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) (Mr. Field) has painted a very gloomy picture here, but when we look at the Bill which is before us to-day and the control measures which are going to be applied, we must ask ourselves whether the position is going to be any different from what it is to-day. I personally have certain misgivings with regard to certain things that I should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister and in connection with which I should like to have some advice. In terms of this legislation the position is that in the future it will be possible to brew Bantu beer without restriction, and in certain circumstances it will also be possible to supply it free of charge. This Bill also provides that it will be possible to obtain Bantu beer in unlimited quantities. Thirdly&#x2014;I should like to enlarge upon this for a moment&#x2014;employers will be able to give their employees Bantu beer when there are more than 25 Bantu working in a factory. But the hon. the Deputy Minister has given us the assurance that where local authorities have the sole right to brew beer, they will retain the sole right to sell it. I want to say a word or two this afternoon in that regard. We have heard pleas here that home-brewing should be extended and that the Natives in this country would like to be able to brew their own beer, in accordance with their traditional custom. But the position of the urban Native differs very much from that of the rural Native. The urban Native no longer believes in the old tradition of brewing his own beer in his hut; he does not believe, as his forefathers did, that the ingredients of the beer have a nutritional value. All that he is concerned about is the alcohol content of the beer, and there I agree with the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) who asked whether the Bantu was interested in the nutritional value of the beer or whether his sole purpose was to get drunk. There I agree with the hon. member: The urban Native, when he brews beer at home, wants a beer that is as potent as possible. I would therefore urge the Minister not to allow the brewing of beer to be taken out of the hands of the local authorities in the urban areas, because the local authorities concentrate on the nutritive value of the beer; they see to it that the beer that is given to the Natives has the right nutritional value, and they can also exercise control as far as the alcohol content of the beer is concerned. But if we allow home-brewing, we are going to find that it will not be possible to control the alcohol content of the beer, and we will then have the chaos to which certain hon. members have referred. I am convinced that the hon. the Minister will not allow those powers to be taken out of the hands of the local authorities. The impression is created that if home-brewing is allowed, it is going to create a bigger market for mealies and kaffir corn. That is an erroneous impression, because the Native who brews at home will not concentrate on the nutritional value but on the alcohol content; he will add things to increase the alcohol content instead of using more maize or kaffir corn. I want to urge the Minister therefore not to yield on this point. Where it is in the hands of the local authorities to-day, let it remain in their hands. It was said in this House yesterday that city councils were making enormous profits out of Bantu beer. Here I have an extract which shows precisely what it costs a city council to brew beer. And it must be remembered that the Department of Bantu Administration has fixed the price of beer at 20 cents. No city council has the right to charge more than 20 cents for kaffir beer. There are various city councils which are charging much less. It is perfectly true that the prices vary from place to place. But the position is that if you brew up to 1,500,000,000 gallons a year, the ingredients of the kaffir beer will cost 8&#x00BD; cents per gallon; if you brew up to 2,000,000. gallons it will come down to 8 cents per gallon, and if you brew more than 2,000,000 gallons the cost will be 7 cents per gallon. That does not <span class="col_5009-5010" refersTo="page_1131"/>include transportation and distribution costs. I want to tell hon. members that this figure of 7 cents per gallon is very low, and to that figure must be added the distribution costs which amount to 4.2 cents and the transportation costs amounting to.18 cent. The position to-day is that the locations are far apart and the city council are not making unheard-of profits out of beer. Their profits on the sale of beer is comparatively little, and all the profit that they make is ploughed back again for the benefit of the Natives. If we allow home-brewing to take place on a large scale, the local authorities will not be able to make this profit which is to-day ploughed back and used for the benefit of the Bantu. The only person who is going to benefit is the home-brewer.</p>

<p>Another aspect that worries me in connection with this legislation and that I should like to bring home to the hon. the Minister and to hon. members is that here we want to allow the national alcoholic beverage of the non-Whites to be brewed in the White areas, but if a White person wants to put up his own small still he is forbidden to do so. Is it fair towards the White man not to allow him to have his own small still when we give that right to the non-Whites? In this legislation the hon. the Minister provides that any Native may buy any quantity of beer at a beer hall. The great danger that I see in this is that while proper control is applied at the beer hall and in the beer garden, if the Bantu is allowed to buy as much beer as he likes and to go and consume it at home, what control will there be? Is that fair? I as a White person am not allowed to buy more than a certain quantity of liquor. If I want to buy more than a certain quantity I have to go to the head of the police and obtain a permit. I agree with the hon. member for East London (City) that we are going to have chaos if we allow large quantities of Bantu beer to be purchased at the beer halls. Why not maintain the limitation of four gallons per day? I believe that is more than sufficient for any Native as head of the family. If he wants more, let him get a permit in the same way as the White person.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister referred yesterday to Clause 9, and I should like to draw his attention to it once again. This is a matter which disturbs me very much. Clause 9 provides that if an employer has more than 25 employees in his service he can supply Bantu beer free of charge to his employees on the premises. If this is going to mean that the iniquitous tot system which is in vogue to-day in the Cape Province is going to be extended to the Transvaal and the Free State and to Natal, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to re-consider it very seriously and to delete this provision immediately. In the older cities to-day we find that many of our industries are situated within White residential areas. Not all our industries are established in these modern industrial zones. Many of them are situated in White residential areas; they are surrounded by residences and I would strongly urge that careful attention be given to this matter. I can see what the hon. the Minister is aiming at. He is anxious to get rid of certain beer halls which are situated within White areas; he is anxious to destroy the evil connected with beer halls in White areas, but at the same time we want to create facilities for the Bantu to obtain liquor at his place of employment. I am convinced that we are going to create a greater evil than we have to-day, because here we are going to make it possible for the employer to supply beer free of charge to the young Bantu who is employed at the factory and who has never cultivated the habit of visiting the beer hall to have a drink. And when he leaves the factory in the evening, or between one and two o&#x2019;clock, he has to catch his bus and his train in the White residential area. We are going to create a very great evil here. If this legislation remains unchanged, then I want to make a serious appeal to the Minister to see to it that this concession is only given to factory owners by a senior official, in co-operation with the local authority, because they know the circumstances there, otherwise we are going to create a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying to the hon. the Deputy-Minister that we are convinced that now that Bantu beer is going to be available freely, it will remove great evils because we know that when something is freely available, people are no longer so anxious to get hold of it. But at the same time I want to warn the hon. the Minister against the evils that may result from this.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to support the hon. the Deputy Minister in connection with this legislation. The hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) has made it perfectly clear that this is one of the ways in which we can reduce the pin-pricks, the friction, which has existed in the past between the White man and the Native. I entirely agree with that, and I think all hon. members in this House, when we have to take a decision on such an extremely important matter as the question of making Bantu beer freely available to the Natives, are deeply conscious of the seriousness of the decision that we are called upon to take. I think everybody who has to deal with legislation of this kind will ask himself immediately whether it it in the interests of South Africa, whether it is in the interests of sound race relations; whether it is in the interests of the Native himself who is affected by it. I have come to the conclusion that what we have to consider is the attitude of the Native who is affected by this legislation, whatever the attitude of the White man may be at this stage. Last year we gave the opportunity to the Native to obtain White liquor. It seems to me that it would have been a contradiction if we had not allowed the national liquor to which the Bantu is accustomed to be made available to him, just as we were prepared to make White liquor available to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for East <span class="col_5011-5012" refersTo="page_1132"/>London North (Mr. Field) has stated here that &#x201C;we will be flooding the country with Bantu beer and with European liquor.&#x201D; What is the object of this Bill? Is it to give White liquor to the Native? No, I am convinced that the provisions incorporated in this legislation will in fact encourage the Native to make more use of his own national liquor. I do not want to detain the House in this connection, but the hon. the Deputy Minister and others have told us that Bantu beer is not only an alcoholic beverage but that it is also nutritious.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) says that this is rubbish, but I do not know whether he knows what the scientific composition of Bantu beer is.

<p>Of course he can also get it in other ways. But the hon. member knows that the foodstuffs in which that important vitamin is found, are not always easily available to the Native. But that is not all I want to say to the hon. member. He himself will know that in earlier days our old people used to pick kukumakranka and make kukumakranka and buchu brandy with the specific object of using it as medicine. To this day it is still kept in the pantry and in the bedroom as medicine.</p>

<p>Let me tell the hon. member that I have personally ascertained from a particularly good source, which I do not doubt, that Bantu beer is not only wholesome food but that it is also a sort of tonic; it is also a sort of medicine.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am very interested in the type of interjection that the hon. member for Mossel Bay makes. This Parliament decided last year to make available the White man&#x2019;s liquor to the Native, which is a very serious matter, and the hon. member for Mossel Bay must tell me whether he thinks that is preferable to giving the Native the opportunity to make freer use of his own national liquor? Would he prefer not to have this measure placed on the Statute Book so that the Native will then be restricted to the White man&#x2019;s stronger liquor? Let the hon. member answer that. Because, Mr. Speaker, after all that is the choice that we have before us to-day. I say that if I can make it possible for the Native to consume less of the White man&#x2019;s stronger alcoholic liquor, having regard to the serious consequences that may flow from it, I will gladly do so, and that is why I am in favour of this legislation to give him the opportunity to consume his own national liquor.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>It would be very difficult for me to tempt that hon. member when it comes to liquor. The next point that I should like to make is this. I said at the beginning that we must be fully conscious of what we are doing here and that we must have regard particularly to the attitude of the Native himself. I have no great experience of the Native, but I do have some little experience and I know what the main source of the trouble was that we had with them in the past. A year or two ago, for example, we had a report in connection with the trouble at Sharpeville and Langa, and unless I am mistaken it appeared from that report that one of the main grievances of these people was the fact that their own liquor was not available to them and that they had to pay such exorbitant prices for the other types of liquor that were made available to them at shebeens and other places where liquor is misused.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>And there are also the raids.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there are the raids. And take the position on the farms. It is a source of irritation to the Natives on the farms that they are subjected from time to time to police raids. When we talk to the police, they tell us that they regard it as an unpleasant and difficult duty to have to do that sort of thing.</p>

<p>I have read through this Bill very carefully and I have discussed it very thoroughly with the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes), who is a lawyer. I have come to the conclusion that as this measure reads, it does not mean that there will be altogether unrestricted consumption and unrestricted brewing of Bantu beer. If every person could <span class="col_5013-5014" refersTo="page_1133"/>do what he pleased and brew as much as he liked, without proper control and without limiting the alcohol content, I would have been one of the first to vote against this legislation. But because it will be under proper control I am prepared to support this legislation.</p>

<p>What impresses me particularly is Clause 4 of this Bill. In the past the farmer has never been able to give beer to his Natives. He could allow them to brew beer themselves, and they did so without any control by the farmer. Clause 4 now contains the provision that the farmer or owner of the farm who has Natives in his employ, may allow them to brew beer under proper supervision by him. He may also supply beer free of charge. The practice on most farms is that liquor, whether it is of low alcohol content or whether it is hard liquor, is usually given to those people free of charge. And, Mr. Speaker, my experience is that it is precisely because the Natives have not been able to use their own liquor and because of the permit system, that whenever liquor is given to them they prefer to drink the White man&#x2019;s liquor. But in terms of Clause 4 the farmer will now be allowed to brew beer for his employees, and in this way I am convinced that we shall be able to influence those people to make better use of their own national liquor. And talking about the term &#x201C;national liquor&#x201D;, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said a year or two ago that Bantu beer might still become the national liquor of South Africa. I do not know whether we are all so optimistic about Bantu beer; I do not believe that will happen. I cannot imagine that South Africans after a game of tennis or a rugby match will go and sit down at a table with a glass of kaffir beer. But if we can encourage the consumption of this Native liquor, for the sake of the traditions of South Africa, I say that it is all to the good. It is something that we should retain as part of the South African way of life and tradition.</p>

<p>I do not believe that this is dangerous legislation because this whole matter will be properly controlled. Clauses 5 and 6 make it perfectly clear that the most stringent control will be exercised through the local authority where the Bantu are living in an urban area and where such a Native area is under the control of the local authority. The whole thing will be under proper supervision, with proper control exercised by the State, and I cannot see therefore how there can be any abuse.</p>

<p>The last point that I want to touch upon is one which has also been mentioned by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout), and that is the question of the brewing of the liquor itself, and not only through the local authority. The hon. member has mentioned the fact that no wine farmer is allowed to distil his own spirits. The strictest control is exercised; he has to take his grapes to the local cellar, or whatever it is called, where the grapes are converted into wine or brandy. In that respect everybody is under the strictest control. But here we are prepared to give the local authority the right to manufacture kaffir beer itself. I am just wondering whether in this respect we are not seriously interfering with the principle of private enterprise. I do not say that we can do everything at this stage; I do not want to suggest that we have already reached the stage where we can say that private enterprise should be allowed to manufacture this type of liquor itself. At the present juncture it is necessary perhaps that it should be done by the local authority. But I do feel that when it comes to brewing and supply of Bantu beer we should consider whether it is the right principle that the local authority should be given the oppotunity to do this. In terms of the Liquor Act that we passed last year, the local authority may sell liquor, but it cannot manufacture the liquor itself. It is allowed to use the profit for its own purposes. I am just wondering whether when it comes to supplying and brewing Bantu beer we should not follow precisely the same principle that we follow there. The brewing of Bantu beer should be left to private enterprise. I can well visualize that a local authority or municipality might be able to make just as much profit out of it, or perhaps even more. Private enterprise would not need such a huge staff and such big buildings to brew this liquor. I believe therefore that this is something which should be left to private enterprise.</p>

<p>Then I come to my last point. When it comes to domestic consumption, it is provided that any employer of Bantu labour may brew Bantu beer for private supply to his employees. I do not think that the provision with regard to domestic consumption should be left unchanged because at present there is no limitation. I definitely feel that some provision should be inserted to ensure that brewing for domestic consumption is kept within reasonable limits. I do not think a person should be allowed to have 50 or 200 gallons of kaffir beer in his home, and there is no way of controlling this.</p>

<p>The point is not whether the man will do so or not; the point is that as this clause reads at present, he is allowed to do so. I feel that it must be limited to reasonable domestic consumption. In that way we would ensure that no Bantu abuses the concession provided for in Clause 4.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just spoken, my friend from Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), at the commencement of his speech laid emphasis on the nutritional value of Bantu beer. However, I would like to point out to the hon. member that recently Dr. Fox of the South African Medical Research Bureau commented upon the nutritional value of Bantu beer. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;One mug of beer has the same food value as four ounces of bread. To get the value of a 2 lb. loaf the Native must drink eight mugs of beer and pay 4s. for it.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Dr Fox of the S.A. Medical Research Bureau <span class="col_5015-5016" refersTo="page_1134"/>further points out that milk, vegetables and fruit have all the valuable food substances which are part of the beer but yet have it in a very much higher percentage. These foods also contain many other valuable elements without the bad effects of alcohol. I think, Sir, it is obvious that as far as the nutritional value of Bantu beer is concerned, this particular aspect is being over-emphasized in this debate. We must be realistic and face the fact that the majority of Natives do not partake of this liquor so as to obtain a nutritional value. They partake of it to satisfy the alcoholic desire to drink alcohol. The provisions of this Bill, as I read them, are consequential upon the Liquor Amendment Act of last year. When that Bill was discussed in this House, I, amongst others, opposed it in principle. As such, Sir, I intend opposing this Bill in principle. I oppose it in principle because I believe that it is an extention of the facilities for the greater consumption of alcohol. I believe that the evils of alcohol, which is the abuse of alcohol, constitute one of the major social problems of present-day civilization. When we look about us we see the tragedy of the abuse of alcohol. We see the wrecking of family life; we see broken homes; we see children in institutions; we see all these tragedies, let alone the tragedy of accidents and death on the roads caused by the abuse of alcohol. Yet we in this House, or some of us, are prepared to pass a Bill which further extends the consumption and encouraged the drinking of alcohol. Because with the extension of those facilities the only purpose can be to increase consumption. Those who say that kaffir beer has a lower percentage of alcohol, being only 3 per cent, that it is not dangerous, are under a misapprehension. Mr. Speaker, I believe this is the lesser of two evils. The stronger alcohol which was made available to the Bantu in terms of the Bill which this House passed last year, is perhaps more drastic and more evil than the beer provided for in this particular measure. When that Bill was introduced it was said to be an experiment. But before that Bill has been put into effect so that anyone could judge the degree of success or otherwise, or the tragedy of having passed such a measure, this Bill is now being introduced consequential to it. So before any results of that experiment can be seen a further extension of the provision for alcohol is now being made. In considering this matter, Sir, you must also take into account as to whether the Bantu people themselves so desire these extended facilities. It is interesting to note that, although the Bantu beer has a lower alcoholic content, it has been proved that with the increased consumption of Bantu beer a taste is acquired for stronger liquor. It is merely the whetting of the appetite of those who wish to partake of alcohol. The drinking habit often commences with the drinking of beer. As that habit increases so the desire for stronger liquor becomes stronger. We are now making available to these people who are the least developed and the least civilized of our population, this strong liquor with its accompanying dangers.</p>

<p>The African people have from time to time expressed points of view. I would like to mention here that the Transvaal Inter-denominational African Ministers&#x2019; Association expressed certain points of view. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;A respectable African woman at Orlando expressing her opinion on beer halls said: The City Council should give us schools&#x2014;not beer halls. Beer halls turn our boys into loafers and tsotsis. The beer halls should be removed from our townships. They have turned our townships into hells on earth. Under the influence of liquor young hooligans attack and beat us, law-abiding citizens.</block>

<p>It was further disclosed at this Inter-denominational African Ministers&#x2019; Association Conference that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Illicit traffic continues. If beer halls had reduced the illegal selling of liquor, police beer raids in the townships would be few and far between. The truth about beer halls is that they reduce the ability of the African to pay rent.</block>

<p>Here, Sir, I believe is another important factor where they state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And there is the danger of the mob. As beer halls go up this new danger of mob violence comes into our townships.</block>

<p>Another important aspect is the fact that this Bill allows the sale of Bantu beer to persons over the apparent age of 18 years. They state here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to African custom young men were not allowed to drink beer. Now they can walk into a beer hall and drink where their parents can&#x2019;t see them.</block>

<p>I will come back at a later stage to the aspect of the young African youth that is being exposed now to the dangers of alcohol.</p>

<p>The extension that this Bill provides for the greater consumption is bringing about a further phase in the abuse of alcohol. I believe that with the establishment of additional beer halls and, with the relaxation of certain controls that have been in existence in the past by making liquor easier available, we will find a deterioration in the behaviour of our urban Bantu people. The position of our detribalized Bantu population is one of grave concern to this country. With detribalization taking place and more money being spent by these people on liquor and as the ties becomes looser in regard to their responsibility towards their dependants, so we will find other evils arising. Other important and serious problems such as malnutrition will arise. I woul like to say that in the constituency of Durban (Umbilo) there is one of the largest non-European hospitals in this country, the King Edward VIII hospital. There one sees children hospitalized daily due to malnutrition, and due to the advanced stages of malnutrition, kwashiorkor. <span class="col_5017-5018" refersTo="page_1135"/>There is a high mortality rate amongst these children, sometimes over 200 per month. They die of malnutrition. So the question of the breadwinner spending more money on alcohol, will mean that there will be less money to buy food for those children. And that will aggravate this very serious problem of malnutrition among the Bantu people. I feel very strongly on this matter, Sir. By extending the facilities to get liquor, by encouraging the Native to spend more of his meagre earnings on liquor, we will seriously affect the position in regard to malnutrition.</p>

<p>We must also take into account the crimes that are committed whilst persons are under the influence of liquor. Over and over again we read in the daily Press of cases of violence, of crimes that have been committed and the guilty party invariably puts forward as an extenuating circumstance that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. This is a matter of grave concern to those who wish to see a reduction in crime in South Africa. With this further availability of liquor I think there will be an increase in the incidence of crime. Various surveys which have been carried out show what influence liquor has in regard to crime. For instance, a survey was carried out in America in respect of juvenile crimes. That survey, I believe is very relevant due to the fact that we are now making liquor available to young Bantu youth. That survey covered 12,000 cases and it was found that no fewer than 31.7 per cent were linked directly with liquor.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is strong liquor; this is weak liquor.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but this is the first stepping-stone towards their taking strong liquor. The extent to which crime is linked with liquor has been accurately assessed by the survey which was carried out in America. The young urban Bantu presents a very serious problem when he misbehaves himself. We know that the tsotsi problem in the larger townships is one of grave concern. In an article written in Penal Reform News of October last year states that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The tsotsi problem of youth is decay. He is problem No. 1 in our urban African townships.</block>

<p>The figures which were supplied to this House some weeks ago, detailing juvenile crime, showed the extent to which the Bantu was involved in juvenile crime. For instance, in 1958 the figure of juvenile crime&#x2014;these are convictions&#x2014;was 144,076 in 1958; 145,392 in 1959; and in 1960, which is the latest available figure, 150,647. These are the figures in respect of convictions in respect of juvenile crime amongst the Bantu people. I believe that by making this liquor available to these young people will lead them to commit crime whilst they are still juveniles. It will set them on a path along which they will not utilize their lives to the fullest benefit to mankind.</p>

<p>The whole question of the effects of the abuse of alcohol as it affects welfare organizations and children, was clearly stated by the National Welfare Organization Board when they studied the problem and reported on the dangers of alcohol. They came to the conclusion that every possible effort should be made to combat this evil. They even state, if you will allow me to quote from this pamphlet, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One recommendation is that legislation should be introduced to prohibit the advertisements which mislead the public by creating the impression that alcohol helps, among other things, to make one physically fit and strong.</block>

<p>They go on to suggest that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A national campaign should be launched indicating how disease, wastage of manpower, wrecking of homes and loss of property result from the excessive consumption of alcohol.</block>

<p>These are all matters which are of grave concern to welfare organizations and indeed to Government departments which continually have to deal with the problems arising from alcoholism We know that the Government has appointed a Committee which has recently reported. Although we have not had the benefit of seeing that report, we are looking forward to the day when some active steps will be taken to reduce alcoholism and to lessen the degree of the abuse of alcohol that is taking place in South Africa.</p>

<p>That is why I am disappointed to find introduced into this House a Bill which will lead to the greater consumption of liquor, which will create better and more facilities for the consumption of that liquor. Another matter, Sir, which I think we must bear in mind is the question of the driving of motor vehicles. Over the last Easter Holidays South Africa had a record number of accidents. The question of persons driving under the influence of liquor is a very serious matter indeed. We must remember, Sir, that the Bantu people are becoming drivers of vehicles in increasing numbers, if not of their own vehicles then of other vehicles. An increasing number of Bantu are taking their drivers&#x2019; licences and taking driving lessons. As the evolution of the Native people continues, so more and more of these people will become drivers of motor vehicles. I feel that the danger to which we are exposing them, the danger of driving under the influence of liquor, killing innocent people on the road, is another matter of grave concern. I may quote from a Road Safety pamphlet which I have here. They state that the most dangerous part of a motor-car is the nut behind the wheel, especially when the nut is a bit too tight. So the whole effect of this Bill is that it will lead to an increased consumption of liquor. There are certain aspects of the Bill which I would like to raise further in the Committee stage, but at this stage I just want to mention <span class="col_5019-5020" refersTo="page_1136"/>them to the Minister. Firstly, under Clause 3 it gives the percentage by weight of absolute alcohol for Bantu beer, but it merely limits it to the beer manufactured by the local authority or the employer. But in the very next clause authority is granted to any person to brew beer for domestic consumption and I believe that the 3 per cent should apply to that case also. The question of the age limit of eighteen years is one which I hope to raise with the Minister in the Committee stage. Unfortunately when the Liquor Amendment Act was passed last year such an amendment was rejected, but I would like to mention that in view of the fact that the Bantu people have a custom that their young people should not partake of this liquor, some consideration should be given to raising that age limit. Under our present laws, with the White youths, extreme difficulties have often been experienced. I have personally seen youngsters of 15 and 16, who are still attending school, under the influence of liquor, and when I asked them how they obtained the liquor they said they obtained it in a bar lounge. There is a great deal of laxity about in regard to the supply of liquor to these youngsters and I believe it is a great tragedy that there is not stricter control. I hope similar circumstances will not develop in terms of this Bill. I realize it is a difficult problem and that 16-year-olds can pass as 18-year-olds, but I believe it will be much more difficult for the 16-year-old to pass as 21 if the age limit was set as 21. The other matter to which I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention is the penalties, which I believe are far too low in this Bill. I would like to see far higher penalties imposed upon any persons committing offences in regard to the abuse of liquor. These penalties will not act as a deterrent. For these reasons I believe that this is not a good Bill and therefore I do not intend to support it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to differ from the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, because I respect the attitude he adopts, although I think he is wrong because we are not now discussing liquor generally, but the traditional drink of the Bantu which he has used over the years, and whether we pass an Act in this Parliament or not they will still drink that liquor. The object of this Bill is to exercise a certain amount of control in regard to its use.</p>

<p>I should like to put a few questions to the Minister. The first is in regard to the control which he or the police will be able to exercise in regard to the percentage of alcohol. The Bill provides that it shall be 3 per cent, but the Minister himself has admitted that if this beer stands for a long time it can go up to 12 per cent. How will those tests be able to be made by the police or by the officials? If a person makes Bantu beer according to the correct recipe and it has an alcoholic content of 3 per cent, but he does not drink it on that day and it stands over for a week or so and the alcohol content goes up, will that be an of fence? I should like to know from the Minister what the position will be.</p>

<p>The other question is in regard to the remarks made by the Minister, and the Press reports, that the intention is that Bantu beer will be used by Whites also. I should like to ask the Minister whether there were any consultations between the Mealie Control Board or the Agricultural Department and himself in regard to the development of any other type of beer, or any change in the recipe of the ordinary Bantu beer, to make it more attractive to Whites, because there have been rumours that the idea is that by means of the same recipe a different type of beer will be developed which is more acceptable to Whites. [Interjection.] Seeing that the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) has so much to say by way of interjection, I want to ask him to participate in the debate. This is a free House. There is nothing to prevent him from getting up, and I challenge him to do so. We on this side are at liberty to speak according to our conscience. He is not allowed to do so, but he makes interjections, and when questions are put to him he remains quiet. I ask the hon, member to get up and to tell us what he thinks and how he will vote. He is so inclined to make interjections, but we on this side are at liberty to speak as we like.</p>

<p>But whilst I am addressing the Minister, there is a final question I want to put to him. Has the Minister made any recommendation to the Agricultural Department to change the name of &#x201C;kaffir corn&#x201D; to &#x201C;Bantu corn&#x201D;? Because I want to know how one makes Bantu beer from kaffir corn. One uses kaffir corn, but when one uses the sprouted grain one gets Bantu beer. There are &#x201C;kaffir watermelons&#x201D; also. Is he going to change that name also? I want to tell the Minister that whatever laws he passes, the name &#x201C;kaffir beer&#x201D; will remain in use. I do not want to repeat stories I have heard from others, but the Minister will find that the word &#x201C;kaffir beer&#x201D; will still be used because it is part of the terminology in our language, and has been for all these years. But seeing that he wants to eliminate the use of the word &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D;, I want to ask him whether he is also going to eliminate the use of the name &#x201C;Scotch&#x201D;, because that is also the name of liquor?</p>

<p>No, we got that from the Minister of Bantu Administration. When we challenged him he said that he was a &#x201C;White African&#x201D;, and the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) also had something to do with it. I hope the Minister will give us information about the control and the other brews which may possibly be developed.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to this measure, I feel very much like the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). <span class="col_5021-5022" refersTo="page_1137"/>I voted against the measure which was before the House last year, but it was passed by Parliament and became law. It seems to me that when that Bill was passed last year, the present measure became inevitable. So often, in looking back over history, we think to ourselves that if only this or that had not happened, how different the position would have been, but that gets us nowhere in regard to this problem, or most problems. We are faced with the history of this measure and with the problem of doing what is best for South Africa. I have tried to find out how it could be put crisply, and I think that any measure that is capable of reducing alcoholism can be said to be in the interests of South Africa. We do not know that this measure will have that effect. We are still groping in the dark. We have nothing by which to judge as to whether this measure will result in a reduction of alcoholism. We have to use our own judgment and deal with it piecemeal. When Parliament passed the Act last year, it seems to me we were faced inevitably with the measure now before us. But I am concerned particularly with one aspect of this matter, and that is that when Parliament was asked to pass the Act last year a picture was painted of the Government having now adopted a completely radical approach to the liquor problem. We have seen over the years the building up of growing hostility and friction between the police and the mass of the Bantu, particularly in the urban areas. We saw the growing trouble, more and more people being arrested and more and more hostility being created, because in the enforcement of the law the police would at night and under conditions which created disturbance do their duty. People came home for the week-end hoping to have a quiet time, but the police interfered and that led to trouble, and it resulted in some very sad tragedies. So the Government decided to come with a radical approach, last year&#x2019;s Bill. Presumably, therefore, one of the hopes, and that hope was expressed again here, was that hostility would be a thing of the past, that the old troubles would gradually disappear and that through the provisions of this measure there would be a tendency towards a peaceful administration of the liquor laws. Sir, I want to say with all respect to the Deputy Minister that I fear the Government is going to be very disappointed if they believe there will be less need for official control by the police, and less friction and hostility created. The truth of the matter is that with last year&#x2019;s measure and this one the stage is set for just as much trouble as we ever had in the past. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories said that we must view the future with great concern. I agree with that. We do not know where we go from here and no man can tell us. Only experience can show us. I am going to support this measure for one reason only, namely that the Bantu people have been accustomed to having their beer throughout the years and it is part of their lives. It was not introduced to them by the White man. It was part of their social customs, in the same way as drinking is part of our social customs, and I hope hon. members will not be offended if I point out that the question of drinking at parties is one of the first things mentioned in the New Testament where water was turned into wine at a wedding. It is a fact. We are not guilty of bringing kaffir beer to the Bantu. It is part of their tradition and it goes back to the Dark Ages. If this Bill will result in the Bantu rather spending their money on kaffir beer than on hard liquor, I will be justified in my own opinion and my conscience for the vote I am going to give to this measure. I do not want any man to be the custodian of my conscience in this matter. I want to stop or reduce alcoholism by any means in my power, and if this will have that effect, and I believe it may, I will support it. I say it may, because I repeat that none of us can say for certain. What is worrying me is that we know that what has grown up over the years is the creation of shebeens and illicit liquor selling and we know that the ordinary Native, with the amount of money he has available, goes for the strongest liquor he can buy and the greatest volume of it for his money. He has not the palate of a connoisseur of liquor. I am sorry the hon. the Minister of Lands is not here, because when I think of connoisseurs I naturally think of him. The average Bantu is not interested in that. He wants as much as he can get for his money, and he wants it to have as much alcohol content as possible, and the result is that is what led to shebeening. It was the fact that they wanted to supply this ready market. So you got the position arising that various ingredients were used like carbide and bluestone and methylated spirits and sugar and honey, to give content and bulk. Adulteration was the basis of the manufacture of what was peddled by the shebeen queens. It is that which I fear. What I am afraid is that the basic beverage, kaffir beer, will be used for further adulterations to give as great a bulk and as high an alcoholic content as possible, because it will be so difficult to detect. Under last year&#x2019;s Act hard liquor can now be obtained legally by the Bantu, and kaffir beer can be obtained legally under this Bill. You have a position which the police have never had to deal with before, where it is legal for the Bantu to have liquor. The police will be faced with an intolerable situation in enforcing last year&#x2019;s Act and this Bill, and if unfortunately history goes that way there will be no other course open to us in Parliament but to retrace our steps. On the other hand, if the Bantu are going to stand by their traditional way of life and spend their money on kaffir beer, we will have done a good thing for South Africa, because it will reduce alcoholism which is becoming so rampant, particularly among the Bantu in the urban areas.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to some extent to differ from the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) when he says that the police will find it very difficult to exercise <span class="col_5023-5024" refersTo="page_1138"/>control, particularly with regard to the shebeens. I want to make the point that making available this Bantu beer and also White man&#x2019;s liquor to the Bantu to a large extent eliminates the shebeens. Their existence is now being made more difficult, because if one tries to see what gave rise to shebeens, we find that they owe their existence to the control which made it difficult for the Bantu to obtain liquor. When the Bantu had to buy at high prices on the black market liquor made from grapes, and could not obtain Bantu beer either, the shebeens came into existence. Now that liquor is made available to them, the necessity for the shebeens is eliminated, and also the difficult task the police had to perform. That brings me to the idea expressed by the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel), who said that the Bantu women do not want this Bill. But if he reads the police reports he will clearly see that it has been stated in those reports year after year that more than one-third of the money voted for the police is spent in controlling liquor, and in eliminating the shebeens. They also tell us clearly in the reports that incidents like Sharpeville and the other incidents we have had, the arson and the murders, can to a large extent be ascribed to the fact that the Bantu women were the instigators and that they did so because they wanted to give their husbands Bantu beer but the law prohibited them from doing so.</p>

<p>I want to express another idea which has not yet been expressed here before, namely the cultural value which the Bantu attaches to his own liquor. Here I also differ from the hon. member for South Coast, who said that as the result of his limited purchasing power the Bantu wants to buy the greatest volume of liquor with the highest alcohol content possible, but that is not inherent in the Bantu nature. The Bantu is proud when he can tell his friend: My wife can make better beer than yours. In other words, in the beer the wife gives her husband he recognizes a cultural value, a manifestation of her efficiency and her love for him. If one attends a large Bantu reception or meeting, one finds that after certain weighty matters have been discussed the meeting is adjourned at a given moment and then, in a very nice traditional manner mention is made of the fact that the throats of the spokesmen are parched and sore and must be doctored. Then the beer is not just served in a tin. No, in the traditional manner two young girls must carry in the beer pot and a third must bring a basin of water, and she must wash her hands and with a grass strainer she must skim off the husks and strain it, and then she must put the beer into a special clay pot, and it is first handed over to the tester who must see that it is pure, and then it is offered to the guests of honour. In that way, over the years, a cultural value has been attached to Bantu beer which is much more deeply ingrained in their minds than merely the idea of drinking and becoming intoxicated, and that being so, this Bill is very necessary, because it will restore to the Bantu his national pride and self-assurance if he can use his Bantu beer in the traditional manner.</p>

<p>That brings me to what was said by the hon. member for Hospital, that this City Council makes precisely 100 per cent profit on the beer sold by them, and that on a capital investment of R1,000,000, they had a turnover of R2,000,000 and made a profit of R1,000,000. Then the hon. member for Brakpan says that they make a much smaller profit. The difference is that the Brakpan Municipality sells it at 14.4 cents a gallon, and Johannesburg at 20 cents a gallon.</p>

<p>Now I want to put this question: In view of the fact that the Johannesburg City Council exploited the Bantu by charging these high prices, has it not had less peace and harmony in its Bantu areas than Brakpan? Is that not perhaps one of the reasons why Johannesburg has trouble with its Bantu, because it exploited them? Therefore I want to ask the Minister to pay attention to the maximum amount which may be charged for this beer, so that there will not be other city councils like Johannesburg which make 100 per cent profit. That is not fair towards the consumer.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member wants to justify the profits by mentioning the facilities provided. I want to ask him this: Why should one, out of the profits on Bantu beer, comply with the requirements which any person has the moral right to demand? Why should you provide facilities out of the beer profits which you must provide in any case? I think it is the responsibility and the task of every employer to provide the necessary recreational facilities for his employees, and it is also the responsibility of every city council to provide facilities for the various racial groups, irrespective of their colour. Why should the facilities for the Bantu be financed out of his own beer, while those for other people come out of the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket? That is not fair and just. The Johannesburg City Council should not ask that Bantu beer should be made available by the local authorities, which make these enormous profits, and then seek to justify it by saying that they provide facilities for the Bantu, which they are in any case obliged, morally and otherwise, to provide, whilst facilities for the White people are not provided out of the profits made on their liquor. To my mind, there is a cultural value attaching to Bantu beer. I am glad to see that provision is made in this Bill for allowing the ordinary Bantu to brew his own beer, so that he need not go and buy it at the beer hall belonging to the local authority or elsewhere. In the past the position was that the Bantu family in the rural areas was entitled to brew only four gallons of beer. I feel that provision should disappear and that a Bantu family <span class="col_5025-5026" refersTo="page_1139"/>should be entitled to brew as much beer as they like, because in the first place it is a food. What some hon. member said here is true. The hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) looks at me askance, but I want to tell him that a man who has an ulcer need only drink a little Bantu beer for that ulcer to disappear. If a person who is too thin drinks Bantu beer, he will soon gain weight; it makes him healthy. I agree that the Bantu should be limited in regard to the amount of beer which he may brew and sell. We do not want to turn all the Bantu into liquor dealers who can brew and sell Bantu beer. But please allow the Bantu family to brew as much beer as they want to. I want to remind the House that four years ago I pleaded here under the Juctice Vote that we should make liquor freely available to the Bantu. I then used an example; I said that in the two months during which I specially went to investigate liquor and the drinking habits of the Bantu in Portuguese East Africa, I did not come across one intoxicated person; I did not encounter a single one who was under the influence of liquor.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>I asked myself why that was so. It is so because liquor is not a prohibited article there. There the Bantu can buy as much intoxicating liquor as he likes in every Indian shop or any other little shop, and he can brew as much liquor as he likes. In other words, if one makes liquor freely available, if it is not a prohibited article, one immediately eliminates drunkenness to a large extent. Therefore I say that we should not destroy the cultural value the Bantu has always attached to his beer, particularly at his various functions, at the indabas they hold. For example, if a young Bantu wants to get engaged to a Bantu girl he sends a messenger who takes along a beast or a young heifer to open the mouth of the father so that he can talk, and when he has opened his mouth to talk they pour beer into his mouth. It is then an occasion on which to drink beer, and if thereafter the young Bantu himself comes to put the question, and the girl agrees, and he hoists the white flag over his house, beer is again consumed. If a death has occurred, then after a certain period of mourning, they take off the mourning signs and the ceremony is accompanied by the drinking of Bantu beer; it is not done in any other way. A special big function is held and beer is consumed to end the mourning. In that way, over the centuries, a cultural value has been attached to Bantu beer. Therefore I repeat that I agree with the hon. member for South Coast. This is not a measure which will increase the number of alcoholics; it is not a measure to allow people to drink more, because they will drink in any case, just as they did in the past. This is a measure to stop the illegal drinking, the poisonous drinking, because the liquor sold in the shebeens causes tin or lead poisoning; they put all kinds of things into the beer, and this measure will to a large extent eliminate that.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say this, and I do not want the idea to get abroad that there is an over-production of wine or of kaffir corn and that therefore we want to make Bantu beer and other liquor freely available. This is not a measure to promote the sales of those articles. It is only a measure which makes it possible for the Bantu to buy liquor cheaply and legally, and not illegally on the black market. Therefore I think that this is a very desirable measure.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I think this talk of cultural background and traditional drinking is quite irrelevant. I do not think it matters what the Bantu do when there is some special occasion in some small area in the Reserves. I do not think we are dealing with those conditions at all. We are dealing with the practical issue of providing Bantu beer for the drinkers, and the drinkers are the everyday drinkers and not the occasional drinkers. Whether we call it kaffir beer or Bantu beer or African beer, what it really means is that after a day&#x2019;s work these people are going to go along to the nearest shop and buy themselves some beer to drink because they like it; it has nothing to do with the question of culture.</p>

<p>This Bill before us has one or two faults, as I see it. I support the Bill in principle. I did so when we were dealing with the hard liquor Act. I then said that I would like to see an extension of the supply of Bantu beer. But I have some difficulty in regard to two matters. Firstly I think it is a great mistake to sell kaffir beer in bottle stores. If it is not possible to have beer halls available where the Bantu can buy beer, I think special beer shops should be erected by the local authorities, especially in the towns.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>In the Native areas or even at places on the way home to Native areas, e.g. near railway stations and so on. I know what happens when a person goes into a shop to buy anything, whether he goes in to buy a carton of kaffir beer or whether he goes into a shop to buy a tie. You always see something else that looks attractive and you start thinking about buying it. I am just afraid that the man who is going to go in to buy a carton of kaffir beer is going to be attracted by a small bottle of brandy. That will do two things; it will strengthen the kaffir beer later on and secondly it is quite easy to open on the way home. I think that it is a terrible thing to do to sell kaffir beer and hard liquor in the same place, and I want the Minister to give this matter considerable thought, because I am not talking without some knowledge of these things. I say to him that beer shops should be erected. We have the example of the malt and wine <span class="col_5027-5028" refersTo="page_1140"/>licences in the case of Whites, and that was introduced primarily to combat the sale of hard liquor. Why then should there be a distinction now in the case of the Bantu, why should he be allowed to have both hard liquor and kaffir beer in the same place, if the White people themselves over the years have been restricted?</p>

<p>The other reason why I think we should have these beer shops is that the price of the beer could then be very easily controlled, and the profits obtained from the sale of that beer could be controlled and handed over to the local authority to be used for the benefit of the Bantu. I am pleased that the question of profits has been raised, because I hate to think what would have happened to the amenities which have been provided for Bantu people if these profits had not been used for that specific purpose. It is a good thing that the local authorities, especially in the large cities, took it upon themselves to use that money for the establishment of Bantu amenities. I think we should continue along those lines. Do not let us squander the profits from individual stocks, however small they may be, because the total profit that will be made will be quite considerable over the years.</p>

<p>The other fault that I find is that this Bill does not provide for a restriction in the size of beer halls. I am afraid that if you are going to encourage the erection of beer halls, there will be no control over the number of people who can drink in a beer hall at any one time. In my opinion the trouble does not arise so much from the amount of beer that is consumed during an hour or two; the trouble almost invariably arises from the disturbances that take place between groups of people in large beer halls, and I would like to see the Minister restrict the size of beer halls so that at no time shall there be more than 100 individuals in a beer hall.</p>

<p>I do not know why we even take any notice of the hon. member because he always makes these irritating interjections.</p>

<p>I feel that we are not really going to encourage greater spending by the erection of smaller beer halls, and I do not think that the provision of beer is going to make for greater spending amongst the Bantu. On the whole they are a responsible group of people. I think they have a great deal of experience now of how to work out their budget, and I think it is only the irresponsible Bantu who are going to over-spend on Bantu beer. Sir, I am not so sure that the point of overspending is valid.</p>

<p>The question of allowing 18-year-olds to buy Bantu beer is important, and here I agree with the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) that it is wrong, however difficult it may be to estimate the apparent age of a Bantu youth, to allow a Bantu youth of 18 to go into beer halls to drink. Sir, if you look at the statistics published by the Education Department you will be amazed to find how many youths over 18 are still at high school. Although the Bantu at 18 may be able to do a good day&#x2019;s work, the middle-class Bantu is very often still at school at 18; he has not reached matriculation yet, and we are virtually going to allow schoolboys free entry into beer halls. I think if you raised the age to 21, there is a possibility of telling who is an adult and who is a juvenile, but from 16 to 18 it is very difficult to tell the difference between an adult and a juvenile merely by appearance. I should like the age to be raised to 21 therefore.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about crime in relation to beer drinking. I do not think that the consumption of Bantu beer in itself causes much crime; it is the lacing of the drink that causes crime, and here again I want to plead with the Deputy Minister to separate the purchase of Bantu beer from that of hard liquor; do not put them together on the shelf; do not tempt the Bantu to buy hard liquor in the same shop where he goes to buy his Bantu beer, because he will lace that beer. Whenever he has an extra shilling I feel that drinker is going to lace his Bantu beer with hard liquor, and it is that which is going to lead to more crime. The shebeen woman is going to go into direct competition with the producer of Bantu beer, whether it is the local authority or not. These women are shrewd business women, and if it is true that the Bantu wants as much as possible in bulk and a drink as strong as possible for as little as possible, the shebeen woman is going to give it to him. You may still have difficulty in trying to cope with that situation where she competes with the legitimate producer of kaffir beer.</p>

<p>Whether this measure is going to affect the accident rate is a moot point. I think that those people who own motor-cars are getting their fair share of hard and soft liquor. They pay a little more for it but they are getting it. I think that every Bantu who owns a motor-car to-day knows where to go with that motor-car to get a little extra brandy or whisky.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, there may be something in that but I do not think it is going to increase the accident rate very greatly, as presented by the hon. member for Umbilo. I also think that the brewing of beer domestically is not a good thing to allow; because that will almost legalize the shebeen queen&#x2019;s activities. After all, none of us to-day are allowed to make alcohol; if a still is found <span class="col_5029-5030" refersTo="page_1141"/>in a man&#x2019;s house he is charged. I do not think the right should be given to the Bantu to brew his own beer domestically, whether it be in the town or in the rural area. If a farmer to-day wants a bottle of beer he does not make it himself, he buys it. We have now reached the stage where we can keep Bantu beer for days on end without its exploding in the container, and in the circumstances there seems to be no reason why in every town there cannot be a deep freeze where Bantu beer can be kept. When the farmer wishes to go and get beer for his workers, or when the individual himself wants to go and get beer, let him go to the local beer shop and buy it and take it home. But once you allow home-brewing of beer you will have all sorts of difficulties and the police will have their hands full in dealing with the abuses that will take place through the unauthorized production of beer. It will be unauthorized because you will have no control over the alcohol content of that beer.</p>

<p>I think so too, Sir. We have gone all over the platteland.</p>

<p>There is one last point and that is this question of the food value of kaffir beer. I do not treat this matter very lightly. I think there is very great food value in Bantu beer and whether the prohibitionists like it or not, the proof is that it is there. The hon. member for Umbilo has proved the value of Bantu beer from a food point of view. The hon. member showed us how much bread you have to eat to get the same value as from half a gallon of Bantu beer.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, it is easier to drink eight mugs of beer than to eat four loaves of bread. Then there is another point. Bantu beer also has great medicinal value. I do not think we should all go and start drinking this medicine, but these points are important, and as long as people do not abuse these privileges I think it is a good Bill. I think it needs sorting out and tightening up here and there, but once we have decided to give the Bantu the right to drink not only Bantu beer but hard liquor, I think this is the sort of thing that will encourage him to drink his own type of liquor, and that it will possibly keep him away from hard liquor.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to say much about this Bill. In the first place, I just want to differ from the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) where he asked the Minister to consider allowing the Bantu on the farms to brew as much beer as they liked. I do not agree with that at all. I do not think we should allow every Bantu &#x201C;stat&#x201D; to become a bottle-store, because that is precisely what it will amount to. If we allow the Bantu on the farms to brew as much beer as they possibly can, we will be opening the way to abuses which we will not be able to control.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to raise is this: I want to ask the Minister, seeing that raids <span class="col_5031-5032" refersTo="page_1142"/>are made from time to time and investigations are made on various farms on various occasions, and the police look for those who contravene the Act in so far as the volume of Bantu beer brewed is concerned, whether we cannot more usefully use the time spent on that by testing this beer and ascertaining whether the beer contains other constituents which are harmful to the Bantu, because that is our great problem. It is not the Bantu beer which creates the problem; it is not the amount of Bantu beer a Bantu drinks in a given time, but it is the extra ingredients added to that beer which create a problem.</p>

I think the hon. the Minister should devote some attention to that, because it creates a very real problem for us.</p>

<p>For the rest, I am satisfied that this Bill facilitates the distribution of Bantu beer and its availability, and that it affords the proper channels of distribution and closes up certain channels of distributions and to a certain extent controls certain evils associated with the distribution of beer as the result of the activities of certain types of people who distribute Bantu beer.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The Bill before us has such important features that I do not think it is a measure on which one should give a silent vote. My own views with regard to the sale or the use of alcoholic liquor are well enough known to the House, but I must say that in this particular case I find myself very much in agreement with the views expressed by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). We on this side of the House have a free vote. No member has the right to speak on behalf of any other member. We are each called upon to make our own declarations. Whatever views are expressed by a member are not binding on his colleagues and therefore I feel that this is a matter on which one should make one&#x2019;s own position clear. I am not happy about the Bill. I believe that there are features in it which can well cause difficulty and leave us in a pretty bad mess. We hope that will not happen, but as has been said by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), the only test will be the test of time after the measure is implemented. In other words, the test in this case will be supplied by the drinkers of the beer. I do feel that whereas in last year&#x2019;s measure we committed ourselves to the supply of hard liquor, the tendency will be for this measure to divert drinking to this type of liquor which we understand is not so potent, which may be more nutritious and will certainly not be so damaging to the individual from the point of view of its alcoholic content if the production is controlled as it is intended to control it. For myself I feel that there are only two courses open. You either accept what we did last year and let it go at that and oppose this Bill, or if one feels that this particular Bill is an improvement then one will accept this one. My own feeling is that whatever one&#x2019;s personal feelings are, there seems to be only one common sense view, in the interests of the country, and that is to accept this Bill. I therefore propose to support this Bill, although I opposed last year&#x2019;s Bill, and although I would oppose any extension of the powers laid down in the Bill last year. I think they are two different things, they are on two different planes, they affect two different lots of people and there is certainly a far bigger potential for evil in the one than in the other.</p>

<p>But in regard to this Bill there are certain features (I am not going to elaborate on them because they have already been dealt with) which require consideration in the Committee Stage. I am in agreement that to a certain extent the profits derived from the sale of this liquor should, to a reasonable extent&#x2014;because no one from a commercial point of view enters into this trade to give away all his profits&#x2014;but to a reasonable extent be diverted back to the benefit of the people who are drinking the kaffir beer, in other words the Bantu themselves. That is an essential. I also believe the control which would ensure that, and the control which would probably limit any damage that the Bill is likely to do, would be best vested where it is possible to do so, in the hands of either the local authority or such other authorities as exist in the various places&#x2014;in control of the people to whom the liquor is to be supplied. There may be practical difficulties, and no doubt there will be such difficulties in the country districts where you have got widespread areas, but I think that is an avenue that has to be explored in the Committee Stage to see what we can do in that respect.</p>

<p><span class="col_5033-5034" refersTo="page_1143"/>I believe also that we want to examine very carefully the question of the type of premises in respect of which permits are to be granted as kaffir beer halls, or whatever you may call them, for the consumption of liquor, because I believe that in the case of all liquor, but particularly this one, we should try to create in such premises the other attractions which will take the many away from sitting down for a steady drinking session, will mix it up with other interests where the drink comes in as a secondary consideration. It should not be just made a drinking shop. The drink should only be a portion of a man&#x2019;s evening&#x2019;s relaxation. In other words, you create as far as you can for these people a sort of club atmosphere in which you take their minds off solid drinking. I believe that is something that also has to be looked into.</p>

<p>I think also, Sir, that the question which has been raised by the previous speaker with regard to his objections to domestic brewing by the family warrants consideration, but I am afraid I find myself in complete difference with the last speaker. I believe that one of the measures of effective control, certainly in the better ordered families, the well-ordered families, will be the domestic brewing of their own liquor, where it will be under the control of the head of the house, or the woman head of the house. I think one can expect there, more control and more discipline in the supply of liquor to that particular family circle than one can achieve by forcing them to go to shebeen queens, or whatever other supply which may be available. I see no reason against the sale of this liquor under properly controlled regulations through the normal liquor channels, the bottle stores. Surely there also the law of the land provides what we assume to be adequate control over that type of sale. There are penalties applying not only to the individual who abuses the supply obtained, but the supplier himself, and I believe there are many areas of the country where it would be beneficial for that type of sale to take place in that way. I have had a long association with the control of liquor as a member of the old type of liquor licensing board, and I have usually found that the licencee in general&#x2014;you find in that trade the same as anywhere else the odd black sheep-has a sense of responsiblity and that he will endeavour to carry out those responsiblities to the letter and not only in the spirit of the Act. Therefore I see no reason for the objection lodged by the previous speaker against the sale of this type of liquor through bottle-stores.</p>

<p>As I say, each one of us has to sum this up as you feel best, as you can square with your own conscience, and despite my own personal feelings with regard to the general usage of liquor, I find myself in this position with regard to this Bill that I have no alternative but to support what I feel to be the lesser of the two evils, that is this Bill, in the hope that it will offset to some extent the damage that may be done by the Bill that was passed last year.</p>

<p>This has really in every respect been a pleasant debate to listen to, and one asks oneself how pleasant this debate could have been if the control over Bantu beer had not still existed. I think the spirit of this legislation has had a good influence on hon. members, and I also think that the discussions we had here have been very interesting, but I would like to divide it into fundamentally two types of statements which were made here. Firstly, I would say that we had fundamental objections to alcoholic liquor as such. In so far as that is concerned, that is not really relevant here to-day, because the distribution of alcohol in general, whether it has a low alcoholic content or a high alcoholic content, is really a matter which falls under the Liquor Act as a whole. Then, secondly, there were doubts expressed in regard to the Bill, and there were hon. members who wanted to see improvements made here and there. It is perhaps possible to suggest certain improvements. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) and certain other hon. members referred, for example, to Clause 13, and we may possibly consider an improvement there. I think, however, that it will be desirable briefly to deal with certain matters in general.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker), hon. members will perhaps agree with me if I say that the opportunity to reply to this debate should really have been given to the hon. member for Albany, but of course the rules of the House do not allow this procedure, and therefore I will have to reply, although of course I would not be able to deputize for him, and I would not be able to say what he would have said had the opportunity been given to him. The hon. member&#x2019;s approach was a fundamental approach. He is against intoxicating liquor whatsoever, whether it be of a high or a low alcohol content. I think therefore that I cannot go into his arguments because we are concerned here with a Bill that is really supplementary to the Liquor Act, and this is not a Bill which deals with liquor primarily. The hon. member for Albany had some objections and observations in respect of the provisions of this Bill, but I really think that this measure will promote freer distribution and freer consumption of Bantu beer, which in its turn again should act as a deterrent on excessive consumption of both Bantu beer and other alcoholic liquor. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s fears are not founded. I must remind hon. members that where we come with this Bill now, we do not for the first time introduce Bantu beer for the Bantu&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps for the Whites, yes, but not for the Bantu in South Africa. We have had <span class="col_5035-5036" refersTo="page_1144"/>Bantu beer all these years, although under stricter control than that envisaged in this Bill. We have had Bantu beer all this time, and this is merely a question of extending the distribution and consumption of it, and I may say perhaps that it is merely the introduction of a better balanced and more logic distribution, especially if we compare it with alcoholic liquor in general.</p>

<p>It was also a very interesting experience for me to be almost in absolute agreement with the hon. member for Transkeian Territories. That is something that has happened very rarely, and it is perhaps the first time that has happened. The only thing he suggested, is something that I can accept, and that is his amendment. That also is a very exceptional occurrence and I wonder what the hon. member for Albany will say if I say that we have to thank the Bantu Beer Bill for such an improvement in the relations in this House.</p>

<p>*We also have all kinds of suggestions made by other hon. members. The hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) asked that action should be taken against the bar system in connection with Bantu beer. He said that beer gardens should be encouraged. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that in regard to Bantu beer the bar system has not existed hitherto in the form in which we know it in regard to the ordinary strong alcoholic liquor. It is the beer hall system, and in recent years also the beer garden system, which is encouraged, and as hon. members have, I suppose, also read in the Press, many of the municipalities are inclining to the idea of Bantu beer being distributed more in accordance with the beer-garden system in the Bantu residential areas around the cities than under the ordinary bar system. I also want to give the hon. member for Christiana the assurance in regard to the one point he raised that the introduction of this Bill and the distribution of Bantu beer should not be viewed as a method of making money on a large scale for all kinds of social facilities, etc. Other hon. members also referred to it. I can give them the assurance that is not the intention. That is the great difference in the viewpoint of those hon. members and that of the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), who was one of the last speakers. The making available of Bantu beer must be seen not so much from the practical point of view but more from a traditional point of view. The more logical and more balanced system which we are introducing now has a traditional basis, because the Bantu regards beer as a traditional part of his way of life. That is why there is price control. There is price control in regard to the prices charged in the Bantu residential areas. That has been so for all these years, and it will be maintained. There is also control even where employers, in a limited number of cases, are allowed to sell it. Therefore the whole tendency is that prices should not be so high as to result in large profits. Of course they cannot work at a loss, and what profits are made must be devoted to the social interests of the Bantu himself. That is the standpoint. But the motive is not to make big profits. The motive is to make available the traditional drink of the Bantu. The hon. member for Karoo also raised a few points. He referred to an excise tax on Bantu beer. That, as other hon. members have already pointed out, is not relevant here. We can provide here that an excise tax should not be levied, but if the Minister of Finance at a later stage deals with income tax measures, it can simply be changed again. It is not relevant here.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Hospital also spoke at length and even now I am not yet sure whether I should take him seriously or whether his speech was meant sarcastically. Anyhow, I want to assure the hon. member that we all enjoyed his speech and I must give him credit that he definitely read the Bill, which perhaps we cannot say of all members, for some of them may not be interested and others may not have had the time. One of the most important automatic exemptions here is in respect of the fact that the individual may also now brew beer under certain conditions, and that is about the only major extension in the distribution and consumption of Bantu beer. Because as I said just now, the consumption of Bantu beer in South Africa is not something new. We have here only an extension of the distribution in certain respects. So I do not think that there will be such enormous consequences as the hon. member envisages. As regards the control of Bantu women, I may remind the hon. member that there is a provision for regulations whereby such control can be introduced, where necessary. So far also under existing conditions we did have control over Bantu women in beer halls in the locations of the towns and cities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital referred to the employer who will be in a position to brew and to supply beer on his property and he asked whether control would be exercised in that respect. Now, Mr. Speaker, I think the control there lies in the system of the distribution of Bantu beer itself and in the quality of Bantu beer. In the first instance that employer cannot sell generally. So why would he then brew more beer than necessary? An employer won&#x2019;t step up his costs very high to brew huge quantities of Bantu beer if he cannot dispose of the beer in the correct way. So I do not think the hon. member need have any fears on that count. Of course the employer won&#x2019;t give away more than his employees should get and can absorb, and he won&#x2019;t give to his employees so much Bantu beer that it will affect their work on his premises adversely. So I really think the most important control factor lies in the system of distribution and in the quality of beer. If for instance he is brewing too much beer, he will find out in a day or two that he cannot <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="page_1145"/>use that beer anymore because it becomes sour or deteriorates in other respects. If therefore such control measures were introduced in regard to employers as the hon. member suggests, you would introduce the necessity for police raids and control whereas we must try to avoid such raids as far as possible, as is the general intention of this Bill of course.</p>

<p>*The hon. members for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) and Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) also emphasized the importance of the traditional aspect of this matter. It amounts to this, and that is where the hon. member for Rosettenville was wrong in his approach, that we should not regard Bantu beer in the way in which we regard it, but in the way it is regarded by the Bantu, and to the Bantu his beer is, as the hon. member for Wakkerstroom has said, part of his culture. I want to go so far as to say that it forms part of his religion, in the broad sense of the word, and for that reason the ready availability of Bantu beer is the primary consideration here and not the profit motive. Whatever the temperance people may say, this beer is in fact a food for the Bantu, whether it has a low food content or a high food content. It has a nutritional value to him, and it has this religious or cultural value to which I refer. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom gives an example which reminded me of a certain episode which took place which I just want to mention here, to illustrate how deeply his ideas in regard to Bantu beer are steeped in Bantu tradition. The hon. member told us how the Bantu uses beer as the yardstick by which to measure the efficiency of his wife, as contrasted with the wife of another Bantu. His wife can make better beer and therefore she is a better wife. The hon. member went a step further and also told us how beer plays its part when the Bantu is looking for a wife, and indicated how it plays its part during a time of mourning. Now I want to tell a little story here. It is said that on a certain occasion a former Minister of Bantu Administration, or Native Affairs as it was then called, had to appear before a large Bantu audience and that the Minister&#x2019;s words pleased the Bantu and they felt very happy and they were very satisfied with what he had said. One of the old headmen who got up to thank the Minister for his speech then said: I just want to tell the Minister that to-day we feel just as happy as when we see the young women coming along with the beer-pots on their heads. That is the approach of the Bantu. It is an integral part of his life, and that is the approach which we adopt in this Bill, and not the &#x201C;more practical approach&#x201D; of the hon. member for Rosettenville. He had a very practical approach. The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) also mentioned a few interesting points, but I think most of these points can be dealt with better in the Committee stage. His most important point, however, was that as far as possible the local authorities should retain the monopoly. I just want to point out that as the Bill reads now the position is that where this monopoly exists, where local authorities alone may brew Bantu beer, that position is automatically maintained, and it can continue in that way. If it is to be abolished and there is to be home brewing within the Bantu area of a local authority, that can only come about if the local authority in the first place takes the initiative and asks for it. Then the Department can approve it or not. But the initiative, in introducing the dual system where home brewing is also allowed, must come from the local authority. If a local authority wants to do that, it does so on its own responsibility, and it will surely have considered the implications fully. In that case the objection raised by the hon. member for Brakpan will also be negatived.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) I think also approached the matter fundamentally. His protest here to-day was not against the extension of Bantu beer, but against the consumption of alcoholic beverages in general. His was a fundamental approach and although I have respect for that view and sympathy for that view, I think that argument is not really relevant here because we are dealing here with a supplementary Bill to that which was passed last year.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>As regards the penalties, the penalties in this Bill are brought on the same basis as the penalities in the general Liquor Act, so in this case also we follow the standards set by the principal Act. I cannot deviate from what is in the Bill in regard to the penalties, I am afraid. In regard to age limit, I would like to say that up to now 18 years was the age limit for the supply of Bantu beer to individuals in the locations, so we just extend the age limit also for the purposes of this legislation. The experience we have had so far does not justify the raising of the age from 18 to 21.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) also participated in the debate and I want to tell him that it is a new experience to be able to agree with him. I hope it augurs well for the future. The hon. member first referred to control of the alcoholic content. The percentage of alcoholic content only applies to Bantu beer brewed by the local authorities and the employers.</p>

<p>Yes, that was also the case in the past, and I must say that we have gained very satisfactory experience in regard to local authorities as far as that is concerned. I know <span class="col_5039-5040" refersTo="page_1146"/>of no local authority which on the sly tried to increase the alcoholic content much above that level. We have every confidence in the local authorities that they will be honest. Tests can of course be made. The C.S.I.R. can test it if necessary. But hon. members should note that it is 3 per cent at the time of manufacture, and it is therefore obvious that if the beer is kept for a long time, the alcoholic content will increase, but then it is a <i>bona fide</i> increase which, one accepts, will not be too high. Because the local authorities regulate their supplies in such a way that they need not keep the beer very long, so that before the alcoholic content increases the supply will be exhausted. I do not think the hon. member need be concerned in this regard.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the C.S.I.R., and the machinery by means of which the beer is brewed can of course also be tested. Then the hon. member asked whether there were consultations with certain other departments to ascertain whether the standpoint in regard to the supply of Bantu beer can be changed so that Bantu beer will be made more acceptable to White people. Here there is a small point of difference between the hon. member and myself, which I really regret. On this point he agrees more with the standpoint of the hon. member for Rosettenville, who is now sitting next to him. The object in supplying Bantu beer freely is not to satisfy the White man, but to satisfy the Bantu. In other words, the question is, as I said in the beginning: What is the traditional conception of the Bantu in regard to Bantu beer? We are not making Bantu beer more freely available to enable the White man to obtain Bantu beer. That is a secondary result; it is something which is connected with the main principle. Our main object is to make Bantu beer available to the Bantu and therefore our first consideration should be the requirements, the character and the nature of the Bantu and the value he attaches to Bantu beer, and not that which the White man attaches to it. Therefore, if the hon. member for Durban (Point) must now drink Bantu beer which is really brewed to suit the taste and traditions of the Bantu, and it does not satisfy him or me, we will either have to cultivate a taste for it or not drink the beer at all. That is the only solution. But we approach the matter from the point of view of the Bantu and not of the White man.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>No representations were made to ask for it. There was consultation in those circles, but they never raised that point. I may say that we had consultations with other bodies. For example, we had very valuable co-operation from the Institute of Managers of Non-White Affairs. They are the people who have had experience of this matter all these years. They gave us very valuable assistance, for which we should like to express our appreciation.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member did something which many other hon. members also did by way of a joke, namely to refer to the name &#x201C;Bantu beer&#x201D;. He asked whethter we were now going to change the name of &#x201C;kaffir corn&#x201D; also to &#x201C;Bantu corn&#x201D;. And another hon. member asked, by way of interjection, whether we were going to change the name &#x201C;kaffir watermelon&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, we must really think fundamentally about this matter. This is a serious point. The name of this beer has never yet been kaffir corn beer. If the name had always been kaffir corn beer, then the hon. member would have had us cornered. But hon. members know that the word &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D; has never been an official term anywhere in our legislation dealing with the Native. In common parlance the word &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D; was used in various ways, to denote concepts. Kaffir watermelon was mentioned here. I now want to give hon. members a very nice figure of speech in Afrikaans which they will not be able to change; but there the word is used figuratively. It is to say: The Ikeys gave the Maties&#x2014;no, no, no, surely that cannot happen!&#x2014;the Maties gave the Ikeys a &#x201C;kafferpak&#x201D;. We cannot change the word &#x201C;kafferpak&#x201D; because it is idiomatic. It has nothing to do with a Native; it is a figurative expression. But the name of this liquor has never been &#x201C;kaffir corn beer&#x201D;. It was &#x201C;kaffir beer&#x201D;. Therefore it has nothing to do with kaffir corn. It should be noted that kaffir beer need not only be made from kaffir corn, although it is mostly made from it. The word &#x201C;kaffir beer&#x201D; therefore does not come from &#x201C;kaffir corn&#x201D;. It only comes from &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D;; and all those names which are derived only from &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D;, we have changed to &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;, whether hon. members like it or not. That is the explanation for this name. Whether it will be used generally or not remains to be seen. We only hope hon. members will help us to let it become an accepted term.</p>

<p>I think, Mr. Speaker, that I have now dealt with all the points raised, and also in so far as the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) is concerned I am pleasantly surprised by the general agreement there is between him and us on this side. I therefore thank hon. members in general for the very positive contributions they made to the debate, and I hope that we will also receive their assistance in the next stage so that the Bill may be passed in as sound a form as possible.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to reply further to questions which have already been replied to. The question of housing for the aged was raised by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) and by several other members. I quite agree that as far as possible one should always endeavour to improve housing as much as possible. I would, however, like to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that in 1961 we had 84 homes for the aged and 19 more under consideration. This compared favourably with the position at it was in 1948-9 when there were only 25 subsidized houses. These are all in respect of White aged persons. As hon. members know we always encourage the private sector to establish these houses and the response has been very good indeed. Three thousand White aged people are being accommodated under subsidized schemes. As I have said, private welfare organizations have responded splendidly. In 1961 other improvements were made, for instance the subsidy <i>per capita</i> was increased from R8 to R10 in respect of the infirm people in these homes. Also in 1961 the subsidy for furniture was increased from R30 to R90 per inmate. Moreover, I can say, Mr. Chairman, that the means limit has been raised from R28.4 per month to R40 per month, thus providing for people to receive the subsidy. Hon. members can rest assured that everything is being done as quickly as possible to provide more and better accommodation to the aged of our country. I can also say that these improvements have been very well received by welfare organizations, especially by the National Council for the Care of the Aged. Since these improvements have been made I have not had any further representations.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about the possibility of appointing an inter-departmental committee. I think the hon. member suggested the appointment of what one may call an overall committee, to go into all aspects of pensions, grants and gratuities and benefits administered by my Department. I can say this that whereas the work of this Department covers such a wide field, different committees have from time to time been appointed to investigate different aspects of social welfare. It will be very difficult indeed again to submit these matters to an over-all committee of inquiry. As I said previously in the course of my reply, social welfare work, as we all know, can never be static. Social welfare work is like Shelley&#x2019;s &#x201C;Cloud&#x201D;, an ever-changing phenomenon. I have given the House a full explanation as to the working of the existing machinery, founded on the triangular basis of church, State and society. In this way the whole field is covered by the work of what one might call standing committees of people who take an interest in the cases of those in need, in the closest collaboration with the Department. All the different aspects of this field are covered in different ways. Perhaps the first committee is this House in Committee, and that is why I have asked hon. members from year to year to put forward suggestions for improvements that can be investigated. I can give hon. members <span class="col_5043-5044" refersTo="page_1148"/>the assurance that all suggestions put forward by them will be duly attended to.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what his attitude is in regard to the establishment of an inter-departmental committee to investigate the relaxation of the means test, firstly with regard to the income received by applicants and secondly with a view to raising the property values beyond the present figure of R2,400.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I have already given my reply to that question as regards the means test. I have said that it is very difficult either to abolish the means test <i>in toto</i> or to relax it. As a matter of fact, this means test has been relaxed from time to time, but it is a very difficult question. It would be very difficult indeed to appoint a special committee of inquiry to go into these points. I have also told the hon. member already that we investigated the whole question of housing and that we could not find a solution. We are still going into this matter and if we can find a solution I shall be only too willing to have the matter investigated further.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of the compulsory contributory pension scheme in the private sector. This matter, as the hon. member knows, has become a hardy annual. Someone once said that it had become an &#x201C;annual hardy&#x201D;, but in 1960 a statement was made on my behalf by the then Deputy Minister to the effect that it was not the intention of the Government to establish such a scheme to displace, wholly or partially, the present machinery in regard to social pensions. On that occasion he added that after very careful consideration had been given to the matter it was resolved not to embark on such a State scheme as far as the private sector was concerned, but to encourage private pension schemes on a contributory basis. I asked hon. members at the time, and I again ask them, to assist us by urging the private sector to establish such private pension schemes. As the hon. member also knows, these private pension schemes fall under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Finance. Legislation was passed by this House about three or four years ago in terms of which a Registrar of Pensions was appointed so that proper control could be exercised over these pension schemes. Under the circumstances and in view of the vast amount of additional cost involved, I cannot accede to the hon. member&#x2019;s request. I may also add that I sent an official of my Department overseas to investigate these pension schemes overseas. His report was also in the negative.</p>

<p>*I just want to say a few words in connection with the pleas made by the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Mr. W. L. D. M. Venter). I wish to thank the hon. member for his contribution and for the way in which he has dealt with a number of intimate aspects of the problems which confront us. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) is a person with very wide experience, particularly as far as child care is concerned, and he always makes a valuable contribution to the debate when we discuss the question of child care. Amongst others, he spoke feelingly about family life. I do not think there is any hon. member in this House who does not feel strongly about this matter, because as long as we are able to keep family life and the family structure in this country on a sound basis, we will be doing what every one of us ought to do and that is to ensure the future of our nation. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) has also confirmed what I had emphasized, and that is that parents should be encouraged to care for their children themselves as far as possible, and on the other hand children should also be encouraged to care for their parents when they can do so. That being the position, it is essential that we should do as much as we possibly can in this country to establish family life on a sound basis. Let me put it this way: It is our task and our duty to make our nation family conscious and to centre all the activities of our national life round the family. The hon. member referred to the family year. Most of us were concerned with the family year and with the Family Congress which was held in 1961 as a result of it. I also wish to thank the hon. member for the appreciation which he expressed in that connection. As hon. members will know the main objective of that Family Congress was to concentrate on the upbringing of the family. The focal point of the discussions at that Congress was the stabilization of family life as a means of security for the future. It must be clear to every one of us that the strength of the continued existence of our society on an orderly basis lies in this, that if you save a family&#x2014;every hon. member who is interested in social work will know that this is true&#x2014;you save the child, and if you save the child you save the future of the nation. The hon. member also asked what the outcome of that Family Congress was. That Family Congress found that the guarantee and the maintenance of the family structure was not always a question of economic value; that it was, in the first instance, a question of personal relations. It is where those personal relations are disturbed in the family circle that the family circle disintegrates, and from that disintegration usually flows the question of economic relations. With that in mind and after a lengthy discussion, that Congress resolved that a deputation from the continuation committee of the Congress should come and see me. They came and spoke to me shortly afterwards&#x2014;the chairman of the Congress, Dr. Nicol. Dr. Luckhoff and Prof, de Villiers. I had a long discussion with them. Amongst others I also discussed with them the question of formulating what could be called a basis for family policy to be applied in future in the circumstances in which the world and South Africa found themselves to-day. After that, as hon. members <span class="col_5045-5046" refersTo="page_1149"/>know, I appointed a committee to investigate the question of family allowances. The terms of reference of that committee were very wide and it investigated that question very thoroughly. I received the report in January already and I assured this House that as soon as it had been translated I would be only too willing to Table that report. It is a very valuable report; it is a report which I think not only every member must study, but it is a report from which we can obtain directives and suggestions for the guarantee we are looking for to protect family life. I also asked that the continuation committee should continue to have discussions with my Department and they are doing that at the moment. I will also see them again on a later occasion and we will ask the chairman of the committee which is inquiring into matters concerning family life, to co-ordinate the entire position, and to have a discussion with them in that connection. I hope that when we have attended to this during the recess and when we have come to finality, I will be in a position next session to enlighten the House more in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs asked me why the bonuses were only paid in respect of the basic pension and not in respect of the supplementary pension in the case of war veteran pensions. I may just say to the hon. member that in this connection representations were made to me recently by the B.E.S.L. with whom we are continually in touch, and I can assure the hon. member that this question is receiving attention. He and other hon. members also raised the question of waiving wireless licence fees in respect of pensioners. Although I am Minister of Social Welfare, I do not think I can rightly be expected to look after the welfare of the Department of my colleague. That is a matter which really falls under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but because we always refer suggestions which are made here to the Departments concerned, that has already been done in this case. It was done in 1960 and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has conveyed that request to the Broadcasting Corporation Board who replied and said that after thorough consideration they were sorry but for reasons mentioned by them they could not consider that. Hon. members will appreciate that is a question which I cannot decide upon.</p>

<p>The hon member also spoke about those people who were discharged from work colonies and where the maintenance grants were stopped the moment those people were discharged. I can assure him that the allowances are not stopped immediately a person leaves a work colony. They are continued until the end of the month in which he is discharged. If he is discharged at the beginning of the month, the allowance is paid for the current month. If he is discharged right at the beginning of a month, he still receives the allowance for the balance of the month. There is this further provision that if the person is healthy when he is discharged from the work colony, he must start work and those people are in general not discharged unless they can go into employment immediately after their discharge. I will in any event go into the matter again and if any improvement can be effected in this respect, I will be only too willing to do so. The hon. member also raised a few other matters and I want to give him the assurance that we will also give attention to those matters and see what can be done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) who is not here at the moment referred to Sonop. He asked that the settlers at Sonop should also be brought under the new scheme which is in operation for tenant farmers on settlements. That has already been done at Ganspan and we are already doing that at Karatara. Settlers can choose between being settlers or tenant-farm settlers. It will not be possible for settlers who do not qualify for a social pension or allowance, to change over. We are also changing over to the same system at Sonop. The hon. member also referred to the increased allowances of the settlers on existing settlements, and I can tell him that this matter is already under consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) raised a very important matter when he spoke about the loneliness of the aged in our midst. I agree with the hon. member that the aged very often suffer on account of loneliness, and that is why we have these homes for the aged, established and cared for by private welfare organizations, as I have already stated in this debate. A great deal is being done by these private organizations to make the aged feel that they are not absolutely isolated from society, and that is why we do not want to abolish these homes which are being run by the private sector. In these homes the inmates are brought into close contact with the rest of the community, and this gives the inmates the feeling that they are not altogether isolated. That is why I have been trying all along to encourage the establishment of these homes for the aged.</p>

<p>The hon. member has also asked that the first visit by any doctor to the inmates of these homes when they become ill should be free of charge. I can only say that when these people do become ill, there is always somebody, either a relative or a friend or someone in the private sector, who gets in touch with these people, and the person concerned can then get in touch with the district surgeon immediately. Free medical services and hospitalization are then made available immediately. If there are any difficult cases, especially in the cities where people may be really isolated, we would like to get the particulars from hon. members so that we can give our attention to that matter as well.</p>

<p>*I have already replied partly to the questions put by the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. P. J. Coetzee) in connection with the means test. That also applies to the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). I have already said that if we extended the means <span class="col_5047-5048" refersTo="page_1150"/>test the number of pensioners will increase to an incalculable number. In 1959 I had this question investigated to determine what it would cost. The information which I obtained at that time was the following&#x2014;and the costs will be much higher to-day: If we abolished the means test in the case of persons over 70 years of age, it would have meant an increased annual expenditure of plus-minus R20,000,000. If we abolished the means test in the case of persons over 75 years of age, it would, in 1959, have cost plus-minus R11,000,000 per annum. I have already stated that the means test plus pension was R180 per annum in 1947; in 1962 that was raised from R180 per annum to R324 per annum. In other words, it has been raised by 80 per cent. In the case of the war veterans the increase was not 80 per cent but actually 225 per cent, whereas the average cost-of-living figure throughout the years has been only 65 per cent. I may also add that a married couple who do not possess anything may earn R30 per month jointly and in addition they receive the monthly maximum pension of R24.50. We are, of course, trying to improve the position gradually in accordance with circumstances, but it will be impossible for us to abolish the means test completely or to give an undertaking that we will relax it to this or that extent. That will be impossible because you simply cannot determine what additional costs will be entailed.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the case where a child lived with its grandmother. I just want to tell hon. members that they can bring individual cases to my notice and I will immediately attend to them. Perhaps this is a matter which comes under the definition of &#x201C;guardian&#x201D; in the Children&#x2019;s Act; it is a question of whether that grandmother is the guardian of the child in terms of the Act or not. I should, however, very much like to have the details of such individual cases so that I can attend to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) has referred to the case where one of the two aged spouses who live in a house dies, and where the surviving spouse finds himself in the difficult position of having a higher means test applied to him whereas he only receives a single pension. I may tell the hon. member that this matter was already put right in 1961. It was done in this way: Where an aged couple live in a house and one of them dies, the surviving spouse continues to receive the full pension which he or she received previously in spite of the increase in the value of that house, subject to the condition that person must occupy the house. People who were already single when the change was made, were also placed on the new basis, and the only condition imposed was that they should occupy that house. There may be cases where the people do not know that this is the position, but that is the position to-day. We felt that it was necessary to effect this improvement and it has already been done.</p>

<p>The hon. member made an interesting speech in respect of the demands laid down by the community for the care of our aged people. There are certain essential requirements which they need and which they cannot do without. I agree with the hon. member, but I merely wish to add that we are trying to provide them with those essential requirements by way of contributions on the part of the Government but that the private sector and relatives should also do so as far as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member also specifically referred to the question of establishing homes for the aged. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) also referred to little townships for the aged. The hon. member for Drakensberg associated herself with that to a certain extent but she said that she did not believe in little townships for the aged; that she was more in favour of the so-called &#x201C;cottage schemes&#x201D;, within the community itself; smaller schemes under which individual houses can be built for them in the community itself. We see, therefore, Sir, that when it comes to the practical side of the matter hon. members often differ amongst themselves. I can tell both hon. members that we are already engaged on the establishment of &#x201C;cottage schemes&#x201D;&#x2014;single houses in a small complex, everything together&#x2014;or the establishment of little townships.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) made certain suggestions in connection with the provision of houses. I have already replied fully to that, but I may just add that the suggestions which he made here, to me privately, at a later stage will be thoroughly investigated. We will consider those suggestions of his. I wish to thank him and all other hon. members for their positive contributions to this debate, and for the manner in which hon. members have given their attention in this Committee to this very important matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) asked that we should continue to pay hospital allowances until the person is in a position to take up employment after he has left the hospital. He referred to ex-servicemen in this connection. I just want to tell the hon. member that if such an ex-serviceman appears to be unfit to take up employment when he leaves the hospital and cannot resume his employment, he can apply for a supplementary pension and this will always be readily considered, until such time as he can take up employment again. The hon. member also spoke about the abolition of the means test, particularly in the case of the war veterans of World War I. I can just say to the hon. member that the means test in respect of the war veterans of World War I has from time to time been considerably raised. It was R180 in 1947. To-day it is R324 per annum in the case of persons over 70 years of age. In that case there has been an increase of 80 per cent and in the case of persons over 70 years it has been raised to R644 per annum, which means an increase of R257. The hon. member will agree with me when I say that the total abolition of the <span class="col_5049-5050" refersTo="page_1151"/>means test in the case of these people is a difficult question and one to which you cannot give a reply readily. I will go into the matter and let him have my reply at a later stage.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was done in their case, but the hon. member will agree with me that in that case the number of people affected was very small and they had to wait years and years before anything was done in that respect, whereas in the case of those who fought in World War I they practically started to enjoy benefits under the schemes immediately after the cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L H. van Niekerk) made an interesting speech on personal relationships, to which I have already replied. He also spoke about a matter to which I have already referred, namely, surplus food. He asked us to see to it that surplus food was made available for social welfare purposes. I can just tell the hon. member that is not such an easy thing. I will bring this matter to the notice of the Minister concerned and the hon. member is of course also at liberty to raise it under the Vote of the Minister concerned and to inquire from him whether that can be done and if not, why not.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) pleaded for marriage guidance. The hon. member spoke with feeling but I think he makes one mistake when he speaks and that is that he exceeds the speed limit. He talks at such a rate on such a number of subjects, that it is difficult for anyone to follow him; even the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) cannot follow him. But that is just by the way, Sir. The hon. member pleaded for marriage guidance but he referred more in particular to marriage guidance at school. I just want to tell him that a National Council for Marriage Guidances already exists where these problems are discussed. As far as I know this National Council for Marriage Guidance is doing excellent work but as far as the schools are concerned, I suggest to the hon. member that he approaches those people who are more specifically concerned with it, and that is the Provincial Administrations under whom schools fall. I think the hon. member probably knows more about the workings of the Provincial Administrations than I do. I just want to add this in all sincerity that this is not only the task of the schools, and of the Government and the National Council for Marriage Guidance; it is also the task of the parents in every home.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the inadequacy of the recent increase in existing pensions. I have already explained how these increases are gradually effected in the course of time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) with his singular knowledge of this matter as a medical man, <i>inter alia,</i> gave us a comprehensive survey of what was done in the past to improve the schemes and of the increases which were effected. I wish to express my gratitude to the hon. member for that, as well as to other hon. members for the contributions they have already made and to those who will still in the course of this debate come forward with suggestions with a view to improvements. I just wish to repeat that we are doing everything in our power to improve the lot of those who need our help and assistance.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has spoken tor more than an hour, before the debate was adjourned and again to-day, and I have listened very carefully for some crumb of hope, something positive and something tangible to come from his reply to the debate in the interest of those cases with which we all have to deal, the cases of human tragedy and suffering, which are the hallmark of social welfare. We have heard words, words and more words, platitudes and promises, committees of investigation, &#x201C;this will be done&#x201D; and &#x201C;that will be considered&#x201D;, but I have yet to pick out of this debate one positive, practical suggestion, where the Minister says: &#x201C;We realize the hardships and we are not merely going on investigating them. We are going to do something tangible about it.&#x201D; With the exception, of course, of housing for the aged where he gave us specific figures of progress made.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo pleaded tor a departmental committee. It was rejected. There were pleas that the Minister should do something in the field of entertainment so that old age pensioners could enjoy free radio licences. The Minister says that he has tried but that it has been rejected and that it is not his business. There was a suggestion that food surpluses be handled through Social Welfare; the Minister passed it on to the Department of Agriculture&#x2014;it will be investigated. Surely, Mr. Chairman, we cannot evade the responsibilities of social welfare by passing these matters off to another Department. If the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs won&#x2019;t, for instance, grant free licences to old age pensioners, then the Department of Social Welfare must make provision. The same with food surpluses. The Minister of Agriculture is not going to give away food for nothing. He is going to say that it must be paid for, and then it comes back to the Department of Social Welfare.</p>

<p>To every member in this House, on both sides, who has to deal year in and year out with these cases, who year in and year out goes into some of these homes&#x2014;many of them hovels&#x2014;where people are living below the breadline, where they have virtually no clothes, where they struggle through on next to nothing to eat, where they have no money to pay for illness, except through public hospitalization <span class="col_5051-5052" refersTo="page_1152"/>when they are often too old to get there, illness is a very serious matter. It is all very well to say that they can send for a district surgeon. The Minister refers to the part charity must play. But there are people, and I have come across these cases over and over again, where charity has not found them, where they have lain in a bed without being discovered. I can mention the case of a man who, for 14 years, had been bedridden until somebody happened to find him just by chance. Then we were able to find out his real hardships and difficulties, and it was possible to get that corrected. Actually he had been underdrawing his allowances for many years and it just happened through a library service that the real situation came to light in connection with this person. But these cases are cases which occur again and again, human tragedies for which we as society have a responsibility. I submit that all the words and words and words, the pleas that we make in this House from both sides, do not help the sufferers. It does not help them if we talk about these cases once a year. It does not help to hear that matters will be investigated when no positive practical relief is forthcoming. I really do feel that this House and the Government&#x2014;it is not a political issue&#x2014;should recognize in this age where society and life is becoming more selfish, where life moves faster, where people are more concerned with their own affairs, where families are broken up and there are no longer children or parents or close relatives taking an interest in their own family, that in these changed circumstances there is a change in the ratio of responsibility of the Government. Twenty or 30 years ago, family bonds were much tighter. There were all these other organizations which would seek to provide the help to which the Minister keeps referring as an essential part of social welfare, but to-day a greater responsibility devolves on the State as such.</p>

<p>I want to mention one group to which the Minister has not referred. It is a group which is now going to be excluded from unemployment insurance benefits by a measure passed by this House and at present before the Other Place, which is going to throw hundreds upon hundreds&#x2014;perhaps thousands&#x2014;of people on to the streets without benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. We have asked the Minister of Labour over and over again what he is going to do for these people. All we could get was that it is not his business, that it is a matter for social welfare. I want to ask what the Department of Social Welfare has done to plan for this new group of people who are going to require help, within a matter of months&#x2014;people who prior to this were entitled and were drawing unemployment benefits, people who are willing to work but cannot get work. Now they are going to be cast onto the streets without unemployment benefits and their only source to turn to is the Department of Social Welfare. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what he is going to do in regard to that class of persons who are going to become his responsibility in the very near future? It is no use waiting another year, and then coming to this House again and the Minister saying that he will appoint a committee and he will go into it. By that time the hardship will already exist and we want to have it dealt with before the hardship becomes a reality.</p>

<p>We asked the hon. the Minister again about a contributory pension scheme. It has become a hardy annual, as the hon. the Minister calls it; the question of the means test comes before this House year after year and year after year we talk about it. We all agree that the means test mitigates against thrift and that the person who is thrifty in his life is discriminated against when it comes to social welfare benefits. Then we do nothing until the next year and we come back and debate it again. It has happened again this year. We have discussed the means test in regard to old age pensions, the means test in regard to war veterans. We discuss it and we agree on it, and then we all shrug our shoulders and say that there is nothing we can do about it, because it is going to cost too much money. Then we come back next year and spend another three or four hours out of the whole year giving attention to these cases which I believe should form a much more important part of the responsibility of every Member of Parliament and of Parliament itself. I am afraid once again this year we will go away and come back next year and get more words but very little done in these cases of genuine hardship. There were innumerable aspects which were raised in this debate, point after point where the hon. the Minister thanked members for raising these matters and where he promised to go into them. The Department will go into all these matters. But the Minister knows that most of these points have been raised before, last year and the year before. In the pleasant atmosphere when Social Welfare is discussed and there are no politics involved, it is very easy to say: Thank you for your suggestion, I will investigate the matter. And then everyone says &#x201C;Thank you very much&#x201D;. And then we have to wait for another year. Suggestions even came from hon. members on the other side of the House, not new suggestions, old suggestions&#x2026; [Interjection.] I admit not from the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker); I have never yet heard any suggestion from him in regard to an old age pensioner or anybody else. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has made the speech which he has just made. Had he sat on this side of the House he would never have made such a speech, because as a member of the Opposition it is the easiest thing in the world to plead with the heavens to descend on to the earth. We are dealing with a position which demands the attention and understanding and goodwill of every member of this Committee. The hard fact remains that everything which is done in the sphere of social welfare must be paid for <span class="col_5053-5054" refersTo="page_1153"/>by the taxpayer and we know to what extent the taxpayer is already contributing towards pensions and the rest of it. I do not think there is anybody in this country who is on pension, irrespective of which field of life it is, who complains about the way in which this Government is looking after them. They are also grateful for the amounts which appear in these Estimates. Those people realize that the money does not fall out of the sky. Somebody has to pay for it. We have to provide the funds and you cannot recklessly spend the money of the taxpayer, Sir. We have been told that we only have words and words from the Minister. I am convinced that members on the other side of the Committee also realize that we have a very sympathetic Minister, and we do not promote a good cause by making such an allegation without proving it. All we had from the hon. member was words, words and words.</p>

<p>I have an instruction from the branch of the Vrouefederasie of Lichtenburg, which proves the exact opposite of what the hon. member has just alleged. A few years ago the Vrouefederasie of Lichtenburg had the bright idea of establishing an old people&#x2019;s home there. They approached the public and received very strong financial support. It was ultimately decided to commence with the building. The National Housing Commission was concerned with this; they had to provide the building; Social Welfare in turn subsidized the project, and the third party which was concerned with the erection of the building was the Committee of the Vrouefederasie. They constructed a semi-detached building and it is the policy of the Department of Social Welfare not to subsidize semi-detached buildings. When the building was completed the Vrouefederasie decided to let the 36 inmates move in, but the Department of Social Welfare decided that they could not subsidize those 12 inmates who would live in the semi-detached building. A deadlock was reached. I was asked to approach the Minister as well as the Secretary for Social Welfare. The Department of Social Welfare and the National Housing Commission were doubtful, and the Women Committee on the other hand. The Minister and the Secretary of Social Welfare gave the women the benefit of the doubt. Had it not been for that concession those buildings would have remained empty and the 12 inmates for whom they were originally intended would have been unable to take occupation. Yet we have to listen to the ranting of the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) who has no practical knowledge of these matters. I am convinced that in the person of the Minister and the head of the Department, we have two persons who are as sympathetically disposed towards this whole matter as you can expect in the whole world. It is merely a question of stating your case in the right way. On behalf of the Vrouefederasie of Lichtenburgh I wish once again to thank the Minister and the Secretary for Social Welfare for their decision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come back to the means test and in doing so I want the hon. the Minister to understand that I am not asking for any new principle to be introduced in respect of the means test, but I want to ask him to extend a facility which he granted last year and which has been a great help to many old people. You will remember, Sir, that two years ago we asked the hon. the Minister that where a husband and wife were enjoying the old-age pension and in the means test the value of their home was not high enough to preclude them from each getting a pension, consideration should be given to the position of the remaining spouse if one were to die. We pleaded that in such a case she or he should retain the old-age pension and the facility of that home. Last year in this House the hon. the Minister stated that had been granted. Now I want to go further: I have had to deal with single women who had inherited their homes and who were in a very difficult position. I quoted one case last year, but I have heard nothing that has been done about this very hard case. I referred to a woman who had lived for 70 years in the one house, inheriting the house in the end from her mother who died in her nineties. The heir was almost a complete invalid herself, and she lost her old-age pension on the day that she inherited that home. She was left without a penny other than her home, which she had promised her mother she would leave to a very elderly brother, who was then in his eighties. She would not sell it. There are several cases of that nature. Her application was turned down. The same applies to another woman of 70 years of age who does not own a home, who has not inherited the house, but who only has the usufruct of the house, and who apart from that has not got one bean of income, not a cent; she has to live entirely on charity; because of the value of that house, a very old house, becoming dilapidated, she cannot get a pension. Every eight years there is a municipal valuation, and as a result she is precluded from getting one penny. I have put the case forward several times and have done everything possible, but without result. If I have had, as is the case, some five or six cases during the last three years, how many cases must there be in the Union! Not such a great number that it would wreck the financial position of our state, but surely enough cases to realize that there is a necessity to extend this facility to those old people who in two instances I know of have nursed their parent in the last years of their life. It seems to me a tremendous hardship, especially where an old lady, an invalid, has just the use of the house, but has no power to sell it. She stays there and the trustees have a say over the house. They say that under the terms of the will they cannot give her permission to sell the house. She has the use of the house for her life, but she has not got one penny income. She was a teacher, but because she taught music and other things not in the service of the Government, paying her way all her life, she is now suffering tremendous hardships. I ask the Minister <span class="col_5055-5056" refersTo="page_1154"/>again, as I did last year, to investigate that case and see if the facilities which are now given to married couples where one of the married couple dies, cannot be extended to these single persons.</p>

<p>The second point I want to put to the hon. the Minister is the question of the use of surplus agricultural products through the social welfare societies. The hon. the Minister replied to hon. members, but I think the reply was not satisfactory. The hon. the Minister says that it falls under the Department of Agriculture. But surely the hon. the Minister as Minister of Social Welfare, could, as they did during the &#x2019;thirties, distribute thinking like dairy products and others at cost of production to people on the welfare society books, so that they could get these surplus products at cost of production. I am sure that with the help of the control boards, that could be arranged to the benefit of everybody concerned. Every one of these cases on the welfare societies&#x2019; books has been investigated, and those people through the local authorities were in those years allowed to obtain dairy products and certain other surplus products at cost of production, and the producers were only too happy to let the Department of Social Welfare have those surpluses at cost of production prices. I think the hon. the Minister will do everybody a service if he will take this up again as part of his Cabinet responsibility, so that those surpluses can be used to best advantage of the country as a whole. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to go into that point particularly with the Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I am very sorry that the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) saw fit to attack the hon. the Minister and to insinuate that the hon the Minister has contributed little towards the debate and that he will not investigate requests that have been made in the course of the debate or consider the recommendations of hon. members.</p>

<p>I wish to plead the cause of a small group of people under Item K, under the heading &#x201C;War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions&#x201D;. This is a small group of people whose numbers are getting smaller and smaller and who will possibly disappear within the next ten years or within the next decade. I want to plead the cause of the war veterans of the Second War of Independence who left South Africa in the course of time and moved to African countries north of our borders, namely the Congo, Kenya and Tanganyika, Uganda, Nyasaland and so forth, people who are to-day again returning to the Union as a result of the chaotic conditions which have developed there because of the uncertainty which exists there. Unfortunately, however, those people who are returning to the Republic do not comply with the residential qualifications in respect of the granting of a war veteran&#x2019;s pension. The regulation reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the time of applying for a pension an applicant must live in the Republic, the area of South West Africa, Basutoland, Swaziland or the Protectorate of Bechuanaland and must be domiciled there and must have lived in one or more of those areas for a period of five out of the ten years immediately preceding his application.</block>

<p>The case I have in mind at the moment&#x2014;I have a number of these cases in my constituency&#x2014;is that of a person who is still deemed to be a South African citizen. In other words, they do qualify for the war veterans&#x2019; pension in that respect, but they do not comply with the residential qualification in view of the fact that they have not been living in the Republic for five years out of the past ten years. In many cases they are people who were well-to-do in the areas which they have left, but who are poverty-stricken at the moment. It may be that they are too proud to apply for old age pensions, although I do not think they will come into consideration for that either. We know that they can follow the procedure, for example, of submitting a petition to the House of Assembly in which case every petition is treated on its merits, but that is a very, very cumbersome procedure and I wish to plead with the Minister to waive that residential qualification in those cases. I may point out that a precedent has already been established in the case of war veterans who fought in the Second War of Independence, those who emigrated from Angola. The present Government did that in 1959. An even better precedent was established by the United Party Government in 1938 when such a concession was made to war veterans from the Argentine. In view of the two precedents which have been established, I wish to plead the cause of the war veterans who qualify for the war veterans&#x2019; pension in every respect, but not in respect of the residential qualification. I think this is the right psychological moment to make my plea, and on behalf of those war veterans, I wish to ask the Government and the hon. the Minister to do something about it.</p>

<p>I feel that there is no part in our life here in South Africa that shows us up in a better light than the social welfare work that so many of our people do, voluntarily and unselfishly. They don&#x2019;t do it spasmodically, but they go about it year after year without ever asking for any personal reward. Arising from that work, there is a movement afoot which I think we should bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister, a movement to establish a town for those people who are retarded mentally or through some accident of birth, and it is felt that by doing this type of work and bringing together these large groups of people who are to-day separated in various schools and homes, and so on, we may be able to correlate the work in a more satisfactory manner and give these people, who in many cases have become terrific burdens to their families, some permanent home and a feeling of security.</p>

<p>The people who are going about this work <span class="col_5057-5058" refersTo="page_1155"/>to-day and who are setting out in developing this plan, are most sincere and serious in their efforts, and I feel that before they go too far in the matter, the hon. the Minister should meet these people and discuss the project with them. It would be a pity if they spend many hours of time and spend money in trying to develop such a scheme, only to find later that it is unworkable. These people have gone already as far as drawing up plans for such a town.&#x2026;</p>

<p>After the Vote is passed, I should like to discuss the matter with the hon. the Minister and to tell him all about it. But as I say, they have got a grant of land stretching over many acres and they have gone as far as drawing up plans for this type of work. I feel sure that the hon. the Minister has not been informed about this project and I think the time has come, before they go too far in the matter, for him to know more details about it, because I can only envisage that this project will cost many hundreds of thousands of rand and at some stage or other the Government will be asked to put their hands in their pockets and to help in the running or the establishment of this project. For that reason I feel that the time has come now that he should know more about it and that those people who are interested in that project should reach him so that they can discuss it with him, and he shall determine then, with a special committee of the Social Welfare Department if necessary, whether the project is feasible. I should not like such a scheme to go forward and then to find that it is a white elephant, or alternatively that sufficient funds are not available to run it properly.</p>

<p>The second point I want to raise may appear very minor, but actually it is of major importance in respect of social welfare work, especially in the field of cerebral palsy and in the field of retarded children who have to be cared for. Sir, the cerebral palsy child to-day is looked after in a school and almost invariably lives at home. I am afraid from what I have seen and heard that there is a strong possibility that the link between the home and the school may fail. That link is the transport group. There are various voluntary organizations which carry children from their homes&#x2014;and from elsewhere of course&#x2014;to their schools. This work is done voluntarily and it means that those organizations have to find money to replace the transport, these caravans, motor-cars and small buses, etc., which they have. I am afraid that one of these days we are going to find that there are not sufficient funds to continue with this transport effort. The Minister will then perhaps be faced with the unexpected position that the schools are there but there is no transport whatsoever between the homes and the schools of these children. I will also discuss this matter with the Minister after his Vote has been passed and give him details.</p>

<p>Those are the two points which I think the hon. the Minister must go into and I will be only too pleased to meet him at his convenience to give him any further information he may wish to have.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to reply to the debate which we have just had. It is peculiar but the hon. members who have spoken from the opposite side have given the lie in a devastating manner to the attitude which the hon. member for Durban (Point) has adopted. During all these years that hon. member has not constituted a contributory factor to the debates on social welfare work at all. All he does is to raise hares. I asked hon. members in a very decent, and courteous manner that if they had any suggestions to make they should make them because I was very anxious to hear those suggestions. It is obvious, and even the hon. member for Durban (Point) ought to understand this, that no Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions can simply get to his feet in this House and say: I accept everything that you say. If the hon. member for Durban (Point) cannot understand that, he ought not to be here. But in spite of that the hon. member gets up and talks the nonsense which he did this afternoon, and that after a debate such as the one we have just had. After he had finished, two hon. members on his side of the House made their contributions to the debate which I appreciated very much. Let us differ from one another, but let us at least differ on a basis which is worth while. We had the case of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) who has just told me that concession was made last year in connection with pension matters which he greatly appreciated. He went on to say that all he wanted to ask at this stage was whether I could not extend that concession. How do the arguments of the hon. member for Durban (Point) weigh up against such an attitude; how do they compare; how do they reflect compared with such an attitude? The hon. member who has just spoken told me in a very decent way that certain organizations were operating amongst the public outside. He expressed his appreciation and I appreciate the appreciation which he has expressed to the numerous welfare organizations who, without any remuneration, devote so much of their valuable time to welfare work. He mentioned certain organizations which I do not know about. He mentioned those things to me otherwise I would not have known about them. At the commencement of my speech I referred to the case of the blind persons in Johannesburg and that people from Johannesburg had told me that the blind persons there were in a very difficult position. I personally went and investigated the position thoroughly. I assisted the committee there to collect money and within a period of five <span class="col_5059-5060" refersTo="page_1156"/>months they collected R20,000. That was what the public of Johannesburg did. It is not a political organization. The chairman of that undertaking is English-speaking, Mr. Ramsey. One of the members who is really a pillar of strength in that organization is Mrs. van der Merwe. I went there and attended to the matter. I mentioned several cases during the course of my speech where improvements had been effected over the past years and where we had tried to effect improvements. I mentioned the case of the National Council for Ageing Persons. That National Council was established during the time that I have been administering this Department. Most of the increases which I have mentioned were effected in recent years. But the hon. member for Point has no taste for that; he ignores that; he does not want to know anything about that. He only wants to act negatively and to talk a lot of nonsense in general&#x2014;yes, he says, all we hear every year are stories and stories and nothing is accomplished. The first member opposite who spoke under this Vote was the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). He referred to the tremendous increases in the amounts which had appeared on the Estimates for this Department in recent years. He pointed out that there had been a tremendous increase, and seeing that he referred to that increase, what has happened to it if nothing was done with it, if it were only simply a matter of hollow promises, as the hon. member for Point wanted to make the public and this House believe? I am not speaking for myself. The hon. member can say about me what he likes. My integrity is unblemished as far as this matter is concerned and he can say about me what he likes in this House. With a speech such as that the hon. member cannot detract from what I have tried to do, and not only I but my Department and the legion of welfare organizations&#x2014;we have always worked together because there is continual consultation. He cannot blemish my integrity and he cannot detract from that love to serve.</p>

<p>In fairness to the hon. member I want to say this that he did say&#x201D; formerly family bonds were much tighter than they are today That position may be due to the development which has taken place. But if I have to do what the hon. member says I should, we will be undermining that sense of responsibility towards the family completely, &#x201C;these bonds will be less tight than they are to-day&#x201D;, That was exactly what I was pleading for and that was the matter which I emphasized so much when I said in my speech that we should tighten these family bonds as much as possible. I say again to the hon. member and to everyone, that I am deeply convinced that if we do not retain those family bonds and if we do not keep the family structure intact as a unit, a sad future awaits us in this fatherland of ours. The hon. member also raised the question of unemployment insurance. He wants to know what happens to the people when they no longer draw unemployment insurance benefits. Those people have made their contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund; periodically they receive unemployment benefits but later on they no longer receive them. He wants me to give an assurance that they will receive those benefits. Mr. Chairman, that scheme was introduced by the Department of Labour as an insurance scheme, subject to specific conditions which have applied all these years. It is an insurance scheme with the same element of risk which you find in any other insurance scheme. Certain people enjoy the benefits but others do not. People do not know when they are going to die. Nor can they say when they will be unemployed. That difficult day may, however, arrive. In principle it is an insurance scheme against that difficult day which may arrive. When that day does arrive they can draw the benefits. Let me just say this to the hon. member that when anybody finds himself in such a position&#x2014;when he is unemployed and he cannot find work and he can no longer draw benefits under the Fund&#x2014;the doors of the Department are open to him and he can apply for grants-in-aid under the assistance schemes which operate to-day. There is nothing to prevent him from applying.</p>

<p>In spite of what the hon. member for Point has said, I adhere to what I had said that I will always feel myself at liberty to appeal to the good sense of hon. members of this Committee to conduct this debate in the spirit of making suggestions to improve the position. Wherever possible I will carry them out but it is not possible to carry out all of them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) referred to a certain concession which I made last year. I know the hon. member appreciates it as well as welfare organizations. We are glad whenever we can do something. He mentioned the case of single women who have inherited the homes in which they live. There are apparently such specific cases. I want to tell the hon. member again that when specific cases are brought to my notice I will immediately go into them. We must bear the fact in mind that when we make a concession or when we make provision for something, we must consider how wide the effect of such a provision will be. We must bear in mind whether it can be carried out in practice.</p>

<p>I will be very pleased, Mr. Chairman, if the hon. member would furnish me with these particulars. If he does so I shall reply to him writing as soon as possible. I have done so previously. I have written letters to several members. If hon. members wish to ask me anything at any time I will be only too pleased to give my reply to them in writing.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that concessions as far as usufruct cases are concerned, are fairly liberal. Taking everything into consideration this is my information that these concessions are fairly liberal. If somebody&#x2019;s case has been turned down it must be assumed that the <span class="col_5061-5062" refersTo="page_1157"/>value of the property over which he enjoys a usufruct must be fairly high and must render a reasonable rental. In these circumstances it is hardly likely that the person concerned has no income at all. I reiteriate, where there are hard-luck cases, individual cases, I will be only too pleased if the hon. member will furnish me with the information so that I can attend to those cases.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) asked me a question in respect of the war veterans who fought in the Second War of Independence who may return to this country in these times in which we are living from areas outside our borders. Historically he quite correctly referred to what happened in 1938 when people returned from the Argentine to their fatherland. Completely unprejudiced, the hon. member said that was done during the regime of the United Party. After that we had the people from Angola. We made provision in their case. To-day we have the position that people are returning. We keep our fingers on the pulse of the whole position. People may come, for example, from Kenya, from Nyasaland and even from other places. I can, however, assure the hon. member that we are attending to this matter in order to ascertain to what extent we can circumvent that residential qualification so as to make provision in the case of these people. In the case of Kenya especially arrangements will have to be made. A person may want to come here from Kenya but he may still have possessions there. Those possessions cannot be sold. There is no demand and he comes here without a penny. The position is that we will have to be assured as to what he actually possesses there. They will have to give certain definite undertakings, if we are successful in these arrangements, that when those means are again available to them at a later stage they will once again fall back upon their own resources, as is the position in our own fatherland. These are the points which hon. members have raised, Sir. I merely wish to say that the hon. member for Rosettenville referred to another very important matter, namely the co-ordination of care.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville also raised the question of establishing a town for people who are retarded so that all the organizations can be correlated as one. I want to tell the Committee that some time ago I visited the Rudolph Steiner school at Hermanus and I was greatly impressed by the wonderful work which is being done at that school&#x2014;it is a little township of its own. It is a place in the sun for these retarded people. In collaboration with my colleagues, the hon. the Minister for Education, Arts and Science and the hon. the Minister of Health, I have made arrangements to send officials to investigate the position at the Rudolph Steiner school and to report to me as soon as possible.</p>

<p>*I think I have more or less replied to everything that has been said so far. If there are any points to which I have not replied, I shall be pleased if hon. members will tell me. Once again I wish to express my appreciation for the manner in which this discussion has taken place and the particularly instructive and objective spirit in which the debate has been conducted.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half-hour? The funds to be voted for the Press Commission fall under the Vote &#x201C;Interior&#x201D;. At the outset I wish to give this assurance that I do not want to say anything about that portion of the report which has already appeared and the recommendations contained therein&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Have you read the report?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_kock">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE KOCK</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to say anything about it, in the first place, because of the fact that it is only half a report. Or at least, we hope it is only a half and not only a quarter. And in the second instance, because the hon. the Minister said that having studied the report the Government had decided not to do anything about the matter at this stage.</p>

<p>In recommendations in reports such as this one only assume a meaning if and when the Government reacts to them. I think, however, that there are certain things in the report which deserve closer attention and which we should go into. Hence the following:</p>

<p>The Commission was appointed in November 1951. It is only 11 years and three months later that the House of Assembly has been favoured with the first part of that report. It is a bulky report consisting of two big volumes with 809 pages altogether, plus 19 supplements consisting of a further 1,947 pages; innumerable tables, 39 maps, some of which are very tastefully and neatly coloured and which must have cost a great deal. It is indeed a monumental task which would have caused surprise or commanded admiration had it not been for the fact that it had taken such a long time and had it not consumed such a great deal of valuable time. Nevertheless, one is surprised at the mass of detail which must practically be unequalled&#x2014;I do not think it has been equalled in the report of any commission which has been laid before this House. Perhaps the reason for this mass of detail is partly due to the fact that certain members of the commission were very ignorant on the subject. As a matter of fact only two members were experts. I am referring to a former Minister and a former chief editor of the <i>Volksblad,</i> Dr. van Rhyn, and Mr. Archibald Frew of Reuters. They were experts. Both of them, however, only served on the Commission for a short time, with the result that the remaining members had to study the widespread and diverse branches of the newspaper industry <span class="col_5063-5064" refersTo="page_1158"/>from the start. That took time of course. That necessitated the collection of a mass of detail to serve as a basis for the inquiry. There are literally pages and pages of what our Netherlands forefathers would have called &#x201C;waarheden als koeien&#x201D;. In other words, truths of which everybody is aware. There is endless repetition and deductions which in my opinion are not always indicative of logical reasoning. An immense amount of detail has been collected and there are repetitions <i>ad nauseam.</i> All that go towards making the reading of the report a difficult task and also a somewhat boring one.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when you have read everything you cannot avoid asking yourself whether the same deductions and the same findings could not have been arrived at with less work, in a much shorter space of time and at a much lower cost than the nearly quarter of a million rand which have already been spent on it.</p>

<p>What has happened now? After all this time only a partial report is submitted. There are only two recommendations of any significance. That is the outcome. That is the result of all the labour and all the time taken&#x2014;only two recommendations of any significance. And one of them actually throws the onus for further investigation back to the Government. There is a small number of lesser findings but they are all buried under a mass of monotonous detail and repetition, analyses and unnecessary arguments. One can indeed call out: <i>montes parturiunt et mus inflatus nascitur,</i> which when translated means: The mountains are in labour and a flatulent mouse is born. It is difficult not to suspect that there was an irresistible urge to draw out the proceedings as long as possible. I have to qualify what I have just said, and say that nobody denies the value of a large part of the report. I refer in particular to the wide and complete exposition of the entire newspaper industry in South Africa: We are given the whole picture, how there is co-operation and collaboration between the various owners; who is in control of what or who can exercise control. You cannot do otherwise than give the Commission credit for that. They have performed a tremendous task. As far as circulation and distribution figures are concerned, however, as far as readers and potential readers of newspapers and similar matters are concerned, you must bear in mind, Sir, that all that is based on the 1951 census figures. You must conclude, Sir, that this data is out of date. That is an unpleasant awakening. The conclusions which are drawn can hardly be regarded as authentic and reliable. During the 11 years there has at least been a natural increase in the population. Over 11 years the reading circle of South Africa has grown. During that time there has been a great movement of the population from the platteland to the urban areas. All that must considerably change the figures which are used here. But it is not only in this respect that the report is out of date. To judge from the reaction of prominent Press organizations&#x2014;and I refer in particular to two of the most important organizations which support the Government party&#x2014;it seems that the conditions as painted by the Commission are also out of date in other respects. The report creates the impression that the relationship between Sapa and the Afrikaans Press is not satisfactory. The <i>Burger,</i> on the contrary, states that the contribution of the Afrikaans Press to the news service of Sapa is no longer as insignificant as alleged in the report. The <i>Volksblad</i> states that the English Press organizations which are the co-owners of Sapa do not use their power on Sapa in an endeavour to disregard the Afrikaans Press. You get the impression from the report that the Afrikaans Press is struggling to exist. The <i>Burger</i> takes exception to this and states that the Afrikaans Press is no longer a struggling child to-day, but is a virile young man which can be left to himself, and I quite agree with that. Anybody who has watched the progress of the Afrikaans Press during the past years knows that is the position and that the Afrikaans Press can stand on its own legs. Having produced all this the Commission has only fulfilled half the instructions given to it. That is all it has been able to fulfil. That took 11 years. The second half must still be tackled. Mr. Chairman, how long will it take to carry out that task? The first half of the report comprises 2,758 pages. How long will the second report be? Will there be further reports later on? The first part has cost nearly R250,000. How much more money will have to be provided? The hon. the Minister can tell us what sum has to be voted this year. If the same tempo is to be maintained in the future as in the past, how much of the next report will also be out of date? That will be inevitable. If that has to take an equally long time, how much more out of date will the data and the assurances be? According to the report the Commission is very concerned about the unilingualism of English-speaking journalists. That seems reasonable but its own report has been drawn up in English only. How irreconcilable! What must you think of that? The Commission has still to report on numerous important matters, <i>inter alia</i> what assists in creating an enlightened public opinion on political questions at issue. They will first have to find a definition as to what is actually meant by &#x201C;enlightened public opinion on political questions at issue&#x201D;, and that will be quite troublesome. As long as there is political prejudice, and as long as that is reflected in the Press, which is unavoidable, there cannot be an enlightened, unprejudiced public opinion on political matters, because people buy and read those newspapers which offer them the things in the political field which they want to read. You cannot get away from that. That has been the experience of all newspapers in the country. The Commission is looking for something which it cannot find. Anything like that simply does not exist in South Africa. In a country like ours where party politics is such a deciding factor, you look in vain for unprejudiced public opinion. <span class="col_5065-5066" refersTo="page_1159"/>The numerical strength of the Commission has in the meantime dwindled to only four. You can, therefore, take it, Sir, that they will require much more time and that their task will be even more difficult. South Africa awaits the next instalment of this serial with interest. So far it has been a tedious business, and the results have been poor. If that has to continue I think it is advisable for the Government rather to leave the matter at that and not to continue with any further inquiry.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the hon. member for Pretoria (Rissik) (Mr. de Kock) was the first speaker on the Opposition side, not because he was the first speaker, but because he asked for the halfhour to discuss the report of the Press Commission. Of this half-hour he used only 17 minutes and then he had nothing more to say, and that whilst he was discussing a document which, as he himself said, contains almost 3,000 pages. The hon. member objects to the fact that the report he saw was printed only in English. [Interjections.] How long does the hon. member think it would have taken to translate that report, together with all the schedules? Was he prepared to wait until it was translated, or did he prefer to see what the Press Commission had done so far? The hon. member, it seems to me, has done what most hon. members in this House have done who have looked at the report thus far; he has just paged through it a little. I do not believe that he read those 3,000 pages, because then he would have told us more about the contents, but he told us very little about that. But the hon. member now wants to know what the Government is going to do about the report. Sir, he did not have to make a speech about it. Surely he knows that the Government stated a long time ago, after the report appeared, that it would postpone any action in connection with this report until such time as the further portions of the report are published.</p>

<p>The hon member says another ten years. I say another year. Perhaps the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) can tell us how many years it will still take. I do not think it will take long now. But the point is that here we have half the work of this Commission, which made a very thorough study of Press matters. This thing has great historical value, apart from its practical value, and we are grateful to the Commission for all the information contained in the report, and I hope that in the portion which still has to appear more data will be given, which will be a revelation to us in many respects. I say that instead of asking for the half-hour, the hon. member could simply have put a question on the Order Paper to ask the Minister what they were going to do with the report, and then he would have received the reply already given, that we are awaiting the final report. I do not think the Minister would have told the hon. member much more than he has already told us.</p>

<p>But whilst I am on my feet now, I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question about something which affects his whole Department, in regard to the Public Service as a whole. He has not been in charge of this Department for long yet, but I want to ask whether he has considered the question of the future expansion of the Public Service and the salaries attached to the higher posts in the service. What I have in mind is this.</p>

None of the hon. members who interjected have read the report at all, I am quite sure. Sir, this Minister&#x2019;s Vote is somewhat circumscribed because we have three pieces of legislation <span class="col_5067-5068" refersTo="page_1160"/>which concern his Department. The Publications Bill makes it impossible for us to discuss publications in detail because that legislation is still pending. The Population Registration Amendment Bill gave us an opportunity of criticizing the Minister&#x2019;s Department last week, and the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill is also pending, so if the Minister is not kept busy here for such a long time as in the past he will not put it down to the fact that we have nothing to criticize, but rather to the fact that our criticism is spread over a wider field.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to Vote 21, Census and Statistics, and I would like him to indicate when he expects his Department to complete the analysis of the last census which took place in 1960. I would also like the Minister to indicate what progress has been made in his Department. Generally one would say that there has been improvement in latter years, but I think there is room for better co-operation between the Department of Census and Statistics and the commercial and agricultural community who are asked from time to time to complete census forms to provide the Department with information. I am sure the Minister will appreciate that to-day we live in a mechanical age and many business firms lay down their programme for collecting information through mechanized means, and it is often quite impossible to comply with the requirements of the Department when a form is submitted just after the end of the financial year. For example, if a form is issued by the Department of Census and Statistics, requiring information for the year ended 30 June 1962, that form may be issued in July, and the Minister may require the form to be completed by the end of September, and in many cases it is quite impossible to fill in the form in that time. First of all, the form is set out in such a manner that it requires information which is set out under various headings. It means that they read a section from the expense account and then a section from the revenue account, and a great deal of time is spent in sorting out the information, or alternatively they do a tremendous amount of guesswork, because at the end of the financial year, with the additional work thrown on the staff in preparing balance sheets, etc., that gets priority and the filling in of this form takes a very bad second place. So eventually when the form is completed, if it is done accurately&#x2014;and I question whether it is done accurately in many cases&#x2014;it reaches the Department two or three months late and generally after a final warning, and eventually the members of commerce and industry who read the statistics published accept them with a certain amount of reservation because they realize how much guesswork was contained in their own forms. I suggest that the time has arrived to consider planning ahead. If he proposes getting information, he should indicate what he is going to ask for in 1963-4, so that when companies commence their new financial year in 1962 they will have some indication of the kind of information they will be asked for in a year&#x2019;s time. Then when planning their mechanization or collecting their statistics they can make provision for the information required by the Minister. To-day various State Departments require information and they go to the Department of Census and Statistics and ask them to collect it, and one knows the procedure. A complicated form is published in the <i>Gazette,</i> and a much more complicated form is sent out in due course to the people concerned, and it is quite impossible to re-arrange the whole business system to comply with the requirements of the Department, so there is a hasty collection or estimation of information, and nothing is heard again for three or four years. What we sadly need to-day in planning for agriculture and industry is regular information, not necessarily annually&#x2014;in certain cases it would have to be annually, and in other cases every three to five years, but it should be compiled in a form which will indicate well in advance the type of information required by the Department. One appreciates that in many cases the information required is wanted by agriculture and commerce and industry for their own purposes, and if we are going to plan properly for the future of the State and for the future welfare of all concerned, it is essential that the planning should be done on a sound basis and that the basic data on which the planning is based should be accurate; and that can only be done if sufficient notice is given to the people who have to provide the information. In the past, time after time forms have been issued at the end of the financial year and it is quite impossible to give accurate information. Only a year ago I saw a form issued to all garages to supply certain information, how much was earned in repairs and how much of it represented labour and how much represented material of a local nature, and how much was purchased. There was the biggest lot of guesswork imaginable in the majority of cases. I should say over 50 per cent of it was guesswork. If the Minister wants such information, a much better way would be to go to the industry concerned and indicate, say a year in advance, what information will be called for. Then the firms concerned can plan their records accordingly and give the necessary instructions to their staff, and they can introduce an additional column in their books of account giving this information, or alternatively, can provide for an extra column in their mechanized bookkeeping system in such a manner that at the end of the year when the form comes along the information is readily available in the books. In that way we will save manpower and time and ensure that the figures given to the Department are more accurate and on that basis the Minister can provide a better service and will cause less friction between the departments concerned and the public.</p>

I ignore the testimonial he gave in regard to knowledge of Press matters the Chairman of the Commission and Mr. Lamb and Mr. van Coller and I have, and that he gives a good testimonial only to Dr. van Rhyn and the late Mr. Frew.

[Interjections.] I cannot understand why hon. members interrupt me so much. They are concerned to know why the Press Commission has sat so long.

<p>I allege that the hon. member has not read this document in which we explain why it took so long, otherwise he would not have made such a nonsensical speech. I want to read it. This is what the Chairman of the Press Commission wrote to the Minister of the Interior, who tabled it here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The inquiry and report is taking such a long time on account of the wide terms of reference and enormous quantity of material that has had to be collected and considered. The inquiry has been lengthened further by the complex and intricate nature of the facts that had to be investigated and the matters that have had to be reported upon&#x2026; Because of the enormously wide terms of reference, there is practically no aspect of the Press which the Commission is not required to investigate and report upon. In addition, the work entailed in reporting on most of the terms of reference is so great and so varied in nature that they could each well have been the subject of an inquiry by a separate commission. This, however, was not possible because the matters calling for inquiry are so interrelated that they could only be effectively reported upon if they were dealt with by one commission. The adoption of this procedure has also had the advantage of eliminating duplication in the collection, sifting, ordering and considering of the material necessary for the report on these matters. On the other hand, the referring of all these matters to one commission has inevitably meant that a much longer time has been required to report on these matters. The size and divergency of the inquiry has also made the task of the present Commission a very onerous and difficult one.</block>

<block name="quote">The terms of reference that can each be categorized as being a very big task are: (i) the measure of the concentration of control of the Press, and its effect on the contents of newspapers; (ii) the accuracy in the presentation of news in the South African Press, i.e. the contents of the Press; (iii) the accuracy in the reporting for foreign journals, i.e. the accuracy in the foreign reporting; (iv) the tendency towards monopoly in the collection of news for internal and external dissemination; (v) the tendency towards monopoly in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals and the interlinking in the publication and distribution of newspapers.</block>

<block name="quote">The task of reporting on all the matters referred to the Commission has also been greatly complicated by the size of South Africa and its racial and linguistic pluralities. In nearly every instance these matters have increased the amount of work that had to be done and have made the general findings more difficult and complicated. These circumstances, too, have contributed to the time taken by the Commission to report.</block>

<block name="quote">Under 3 (i) the Commission has had to investigate the measure of the concentration of control, financial and technical, of the South African Press and its effect on editorial opinion and comment and presentation of news. This entailed investigating the control of more than 600 South African newspapers and periodicals, some of which are published chiefly for Europeans, some chiefly for Natives, some chiefly for the Coloureds and others chiefly for the Indians. The Commission has also had to investigate the effect of the concentrate of control on the editorial opinion and comment and the presentation of news in these newspapers and periodicals. It was an impossible task to investigate so large a number of journals in detail and in many cases little practical purpose would be served by such an investigation. For these reasons the Commission limited the scope of its investigation to the newspapers which are of real importance to each of the four groups of the population and the periodicals which are financially interlinked with these newspapers. The remaining newspapers and periodicals have been dealt with only in general terms. Even after this limitation the Commission found that it had to investigate the measure of the financial and technical control of 24 European, two Coloured, six Native and three Indian newspapers. The owners of practically all of these newspapers are companies. Some of the owners are single companies, others are members of groups of <span class="col_5071-5072" refersTo="page_1162"/>companies. Some of the companies are controlled by companies not owned by newspapers, others by voting agreements amongst shareholders and others by trusts and still others by associations. In order to give a picture of the measure of the concentration of control in respect of these newspapers, the Commission has had to investigate the constitution and shareholding of over 100 companies and 12 trusts. In many instances the control is regulated by involved voting provisions. In all cases the shareholdings required careful analysis over long periods in order to determine the ultimate control of the various newspaper companies. The constitution of the boards of the various companies had also to be investigated to determine to what extent the control of the newspaper owners is affected by interlocking directorships. All these facts pertaining to these aspects had to be collected, analysed and correlated in order to define the ultimate control so as to be able to determine the measure of the concentration of control and its effects on the contents of newspapers. The inquiry into and the drafting of the report on the above matters in itself has been a long and arduous task requiring careful deliberation.</block>

<block name="quote">Under 3 (ii) and (iii) the Commission is required to report on the accuracy in the presentation of news in the Press in the Union of South Africa and South West Africa, by correspondence in the Union and South West Africa, having particular regard to (a) selection of news; (b) mixing of fact and comment; (c) use of unverified facts or rumours as news&#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or as basis for comment, and (d) reckless statements, distortion of facts or fabrication, and the use of any of these as news and as basis for comment. This term of reference deals with two subjects which required separate investigation, viz.: (i) an inquiry into the contents of the South African Press, and (ii) an inquiry into the contents of the foreign reports emanating from South Africa. To arrive at a fair and accurate assessment, the Commission has had to take cognizance of the conduct of the Press when supporting the Government and when opposing the Government. For this reason it was found necessary to examine the contents of the newspapers both before and after the change of Government in 1948. This has entailed the examination of newspapers over a period of eight years. During this period the 24 newspapers selected for examination have published over 45,000 issues. This means that for this period the Commission has had to investigate over 45,000 copies of newspapers and as each of the 25 newspapers generally carry not less than six news pages and the larger newspapers a considerably larger number of news pages, it meant that the Commission was called upon to examine well over 270,000 news pages.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not propose to follow the hon. member for Standerton. I would like to ask the Minister in regard to one or two items under his Vote. Under the population register reference is made to a senior Bantu Affairs commissioner. What is the precise position? There is no money voted under this sub-head this year. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what the exact position is. Then I am concerned at the amount of expenditure on temporary assistance, also for the population register. The note indicates that there are 229 additional staff units at a cost of R230,000 as against 338 other staff at a cost of R298,000. The expenditure under this subhead seems to me very heavy indeed, and when one bears in mind the importance of the population register and the fact that temporary assistance in the past, and I suppose in future, will be of a kind that cannot be relied upon to do very efficient detailed work, such as is called for by the population register, it seems that we are spending a great deal of money on a large number of temporary staff. Would the Minister tell us what his views are with regard to the future? Are we to continue year after year employing a large number of temporary staff on such important work, or is the intention to build up a permanent staff sooner or later? The money voted for permanent staff this year is less than last year, although it is also true that the temporary staff are drawing less than they did last year. But it is still a very large number of personnel and it is a very large sum of money that we are providing for temporary staff.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>I know the hon. member does not understand this at all, but he should not advertise his lack of understanding so widely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The magnitude of this task can better be appreciated when it is realized that each news page carries not less than 1,000 words. On a minimum assessment the examination of the news content of these 24 newspapers means the examination of well over <span class="col_5073-5074" refersTo="page_1163"/>270,000,000 words. In regard to the inquiry into the contents of the foreign reports emanating from South Africa, the Commission was faced with the problem of discovering by whom and to whom the reports were despatched and what the content of these reports were. By calling upon the postal authorities to supply copies of all Press material filed for despatch abroad, the Commission was able to find out by whom and to whom despatches were sent and what their contents were. Though the Commission limited its investigation to the Press material despatched over a certain period, it nevertheless meant investigating reports amounting to over 9,000,000 words of cabelese, i.e. more than 30,000 foolscap pages typed in double line spacing. This news was despatched to a number of world news agencies and newspapers in many parts of the world. It was despatched by approximately 300 persons. Before an assessment of the contents could be made, the cables had to be sorted for the addressers and addressees. In some cases an addresser had more than one addressee. The addressees had to be sorted for countries. Thereafter the reports had to be read for their contents. This was the only way to assess the accuracy of the news emanating from South Africa for us by the Press beyond the borders of the Union and despatch by correspondents in the Union and South West Africa. On this aspect the Commission also investigated approximately 35,000 cuttings from foreign newspapers involving newspapers in some 10 languages.</block>

<block name="quote">Under 3 (iv) and (v) the Commission is required to report on the tendencies towards monopoly or the concentration of control in regard to (a) collection of news for internal and external dissemination; and (b) the distribution of newspapers and periodicals; and generally the extent to which the publication and distribution of newspapers are interlinked.</block>

<block name="quote">The investigation and the report on the tendencies towards monopoly or the concentration of control in regard to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals and the inter-linkage of newspapers and newspaper distribution is a very big task. The investigation involves inquiring into the distributing activities of all the owners of newspapers and periodicals and in detail into the shareholding, constitution and boards of over 32 companies. The terms of over 80 contracts for distributing newspapers and periodicals have also to be investigated and correlated. This latter is in itself a very big task. These facts had to be viewed in relation to the elimination of competition; the marketing of newspapers and periodicals in various markets; the markets themselves; the sales policy of the distributor; the nature of the organization distributing the newspapers and periodicals; and the population with due regard to diversity of languages. Then again it had to be considered whether the findings on any of these matters militate for or against a free Press, a free expression of opinion through the Press and the formation of an informed public opinion on political issues.</block>

<block name="quote">In addition to the above the Commission was also required to report on (a) existing restraints on the establishment of new newspapers in the Union of South Africa and South West Africa and the desirability or otherwise thereof; (b) the adequacy or otherwise of existing means of self-control and discipline by the Press over (i) editors, journalists and correspondents serving local newspapers and periodicals; (ii) correspondents of overseas newspapers and periodicals; and (iii) free lance journalists serving the local or the overseas Press; and (c) the incidence of sensationalism and trivialism in the make-up of newspapers.</block>

<block name="quote">Finally, there is the overriding term of reference requiring the Commission to report upon the extent to which any finding militates for or against a free Press, a free expression of opinion through the Press and the formation of an informed public opinion on political issues.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik (Mr. de Kock) did not even have the courtesy to remain quiet and to listen to how comprehensive the work is. I want to give him the assurance that what we have submitted now was only to report on the concentration of control, technically and financially, and the distribution of newspapers, but not on the content of those newspapers or on the content of foreign reporting. I can assure him that the Press will like the rest of the report just as little as they liked this part of it.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the report about the content of newspapers is still coming, and then the hon. member for Rissik can discuss it.</p>

<p>I just want to make one remark about the unilingualism of the report. It is not that I do not know English, or that Judge van Zyl, or Dr. Diederichs or Dr. van Rhyn or Mr. van Coller do not know it, but there were two English-speaking members of the Commission, Mr. Willie Lamb and the late Mr. Archie Frew, and they were not able to read the Afrikaans text which he drafted, and at their request, merely as a courtesy to them, we wrote it in English and the report was drafted in English. It sounds strange to me, that when we on this side really made a concession to those people who insisted that persons who shared their views should also be appointed, we should now be reproached for the fact that we made this concession out of the kindness of our hearts and out of our innate courtesy. It is one of the things for which I will never forgive that side of the House, <span class="col_5075-5076" refersTo="page_1164"/>that they blamed the Minister for the fact that this document was drafted in English only.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (Rissik) referred to the fact that the newspapers object to our statement that the contributions of the Afrikaans Press to Sapa&#x2019;s newspool is so small. It is small, Mr. Chairman, and it may be that the Afrikaans Press feels just as badly about it as the Commission did, because Sapa&#x2019;s newspool is contributed, for the greater part, by the English newspapers. The reason for that is very simple, namely, that there are many more English newspapers. There are also other reasons. The matter goes much further than simply the newspool. As hon. members will see from that report, Sapa has a contract with Reuter to give Reuter an edited news report. Although it gives its full news reports to the other world news agencies, it gives Reuter an edited report, and that gives Reuter the opportunity to come into the market before the news is cold&#x2014;in any case, a few hours before the other news agencies&#x2019; reports arrive overseas. Because that newspool is derived only from the English sources, it means that Sapa is obliged to give Reuter news which has been collected by the English newspapers alone.</p>

<p>There is still another reason. The <i>Burger</i> and the <i>Volksblad</i> and the <i>Transvaler</i> and the <i>Vaderland</i> are Afrikaans newspapers, and a large number of Sapa&#x2019;s officials, over the period investigated by us, were unilingual. The editor-in-chief was unilingual. He could not judge of what entered his office; he had to leave it to his staff, many of whom were unilingual. That news is given to Reuter, and that is the news which is sent overseas. Is it not justifiable if that forms part of the terms of reference to investigate that and to report fully on it? But I can imagine that the newspapers do not like this report. I can also quite understand that they would rather pigeonhole it. I hope the Minister will be prepared to publish this first part of the report so that we can see who the persons are in control of every one of these newspapers. We should know when we quarrel with the <i>Sunday Times,</i> we must not revile Stanley Uys. He is only a &#x201C;pen-pusher&#x201D;. The man who should be blamed is Edmunds, Chairman of S.A. Associated Newspapers. When we refuse Delius permission to sit on the Press gallery, it is not he who should be put on the carpet, nor is it Mr. Victor Norton, editor of the <i>Cape Times,</i> who should appear before the Senate to receive a rebuke, but it is Mr. Clive Corder, chairman of Cape Times Ltd. It is he who is responsible for that product. It is the owners of the newspapers, and we ought to publicize that.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to start with a few questions put to me by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), and firstly I want to point out, for the sake of clarity, that under the sub-head &#x201C;Population Register&#x201D; it must be understood very clearly that it is not only the Population Register that is involved there. The Population Registrar also has under his charge the following: The compilation and the maintenance of the population register, racial classification, the manufacture and issuing of identity cards, the sub-division Births, Marriages and Deaths which undertakes the following duties: the maintenance of a central register of all births, marriages and deaths; the issuing of birth, marriage and death certificates; the appointment of marriage officers and, fourthly, the handling of cases where the Minister&#x2019;s approval of child marriages is applied for.</p>

<p>I want to reply to the few questions which have been put to me. The senior Bantu Affairs Commissioner was seconded to this Department during 1961-2 only. He is no longer with my Department and for that reason no provision is being made for his salary.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) referred to the great difficulty experienced in regard to the sending out of the various forms. I want to tell him that I quite agree with him that many of the forms are sent out, particularly by the Division of Census and Statistics, often without taking into consideration how much work is entailed and how impossible it is to collect the information. As Minister of Labour I also had the experience that it was sometimes unreasonable. But when I took over this Department I felt that <span class="col_5077-5078" refersTo="page_1165"/>the Division of Census and Statistics should perhaps be completely re-organized. I have now appointed a Committee which will sit for the first time one of these days, consisting of Dr. J. H. Steyn, the economic adviser to the Prime Minister and the former Secretary for Finance, as Chairman, Mr. D. J. C. Steyn, the Chairman of the Public Service Commission, Mr. I. T. Meyer, the Secretary for the Treasury, and the Secretary for the Interior, Mr. G. du Preez. My instructions to them are the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With a view to the increasing importance of economic statistics for the formulation of policy, it has been decided to appoint a Committee to investigate and report on the organizational changes which may be made to the Bureau for Census and Statistics further to increase its efficient functioning. The Government desires attention to be given, <i>inter alia,</i> to the following aspects: (a) Whether the Bureau should continue to exist as a division of a Department, and, if so, under what Department it should resort; (b) whether it should be changed into an independent department, and if so, under which Minister it should resort; and (c) whether the economic statistical services should be decentralized or not and, if so, to which Department these duties should be entrusted.</block>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. member for Pinetown fully that economic statistics are of the utmost importance to us in this country, and it canno be tolerated that there should be unnecessary delay in the furnishing of economic statistics. It is such a delicate matter that when the investigation has been made, the results should be published as soon as possible thereafter. I think that this is the right start, viz. an investigation by a committee of eminent officials. On it we have given representation to the Public Service Commission, the Treasury and the Department of the Interior, and we have appointed an economist of great repute. I did not want to appoint a commission of inquiry, but rather an inter-departmental committee which can make the necessary investigations this year still. The Statistics Board feel as I do, that there should be reform and improvement in regard to this matter. I want to thank the hon. member for what he said here, and just tell him that we are devoting attention to it.</p>

<p>In connection with the question when we can expect more details in connection with the census that was held in 1960, I can assure the hon. member that there is an enormous amount of work to be done in that connection; that the details are being worked out and that as they become available they are sent out and published. It is done as soon as possible. I am sorry that it is impossible for me at this stage to mention a definite date as to when we can expect to have more details.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Pretoria (Rissik) (Mr. de Kock) that I regret that he has so sharply criticized, not an interim report, but a partial report, and particularly for this reason: The hon. member made this allegation: &#x201C;It is a voluminous report which we would have admired were it not for the fact that it took such a long time to publish it.&#x201D; In other words, I infer from the hon. member&#x2019;s criticism that he would have admired the report had it not cost R250,000 and had it not taken so long before it was published. The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) has said a few words in regard to that matter. The hon. member for Pretoria (Rissik) would have been correct if the Government had asked for an interim report, but the Government asked whether the report could not be delivered partially or in instalments, and just because the report is being delivered in instalments I now already want to issue the warning that if the second instalment comes&#x2014;and it has not yet been completed&#x2014;I do not think the Government would be doing justice to this report if it were already to take decisions based on the various instalments. My recommendation to the Government was, in fact, not to concern itself for the present with this first instalment, because we were still to receive the other instalment. I have been informed by the Chairman of the Press Commission that the second portion, if I remember correctly&#x2014;because he did not give it to me in writing&#x2014;would comprise about 1,000 pages, which have already been completely reviewed by them, and that they are now making it ready for the printers, so that the copies can be printed and made available to us. We expect that there will be another two instalments, and that the one instalment will become available towards the end of this year and the other during the course of next year. I just want to say that the fact that one instalment has now been delivered to us does not mean that they have again to start working on the next instalment right from the beginning. But I cannot guarantee when the next report will be delivered, and actually, as the responsible Minister to whom the Press Commission was handed over only in January, I feel that I can carry on discussions with the Press Commission further when Parliament is not in session. The Chairman only came to see me once in regard to certain problems he had. The Opposition is of course quite entitled to discuss the costs of the Press Commission. In so far as the cost for this year is concerned, provision is made in the Estimates for R37,000. That will be the total ocst in this financial year. This amount does not appear under my Vote, because the Estimates had already been printed when responsibility for the Press Commission was transferred to me. I think we should not calculate the cost in thirds and say that one-third cost R250,000 that two-thirds will therefore cost R500,000 and three-thirds R750,000. I think that would be the wrong sum to make. The work has practically been completed.</p>

<p>In so far as the number of members is concerned, the Government was faced with the <span class="col_5079-5080" refersTo="page_1166"/>position that the work gradually progressed so far that it would be quite wrong again to appoint the same number of members to fill the places of those who died or fell away. That would be quite wrong, because then the new members would again have to study <i>ab initio</i> the whole <i>modus operandi</i> and everything that has been done so far. That would cause further delay instead of helping. It is for that reason that the number of members has now, to our own great disappointment, been reduced to four. All of them can no longer work as hard as one would like them to, and there are also other difficulties connected with the matter. I can state to-day that the few members working on it do not work the ordinary hours. They are working much more overtime than is really good for their health. I want to express the hope that hon. members will be satisfied with these explanations. The Commission has been appointed, and it would be quite wrong at this stage, when the kettle is almost on the boil, when the steam is already emerging, to kick over that kettle because we are in too much of a hurry and cannot wait to make our coffee. If we do that, we will have nothing at all. I want to agree with the hon. member for Rissik that it is a very interesting report, even though it contains certain findings which we expected them to arrive at. But it is just as well that the whole of the Press should know what the position is. I must tell hon. members that we have had inquiries from libraries all over the world, and particularly from university students, in connection with this report. We should not at this stage anticipate what we think the findings of the Commission will be. Nor do we have the right to say that, judging by the method adopted in issuing the first portion, the same method will be followed throughout, and therefore I want to ask hon. members to be cautious. We should be glad that we are rather getting these reports in instalments, because it seems to me that the completed report will be a very lengthy and voluminous one.</p>

<p>I do not propose following the lines taken by the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) in his speech in relation to the Press Commission save to say that it seems to me both undesirable and improper for a person who is a member of the Press Commission, prior to its report having been made, to attack, in a public speech in this House, certain of the organs and facts into which he is presently inquiring. Surely that sort of thing could wait until the Commission has made its report, and surely we can expect commissioners, in public commissions of this kind, to refrain from making comments of that nature until the findings of the Commission are made public. It is certainly not the way to inspire confidence in the findings which that body may eventually make.</p>

<p>The point on which I rise to speak at the present time is one which is small in compass but is of considerable importance, and that is the conduct of returning officers at polling booths at the time of general elections. I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to one instance which I have in mind which illustrates the point I want to make and that is that it is essential that these returning officers take charge of their polling booths and that they exercise control and authority there. The example which I have in mind took place in my constituency during the recent general election, where the Commissioner-General to the Zulu ethnic unit was allowed by the returning officer concerned at Nongoma to escort voters unchallenged right into the polling booth itself. I refer to a certain Mr. Nel who is the Commissioner-General in question. Whichever way one looks at it, that gentleman had no right, save to record his own vote, to be in that polling booth.</p>

<p>If he was not an authorized party political representative he had no right to be there, and if he was an authorized party political representative, then there was something equally undesirable and improper perpetrated, because he, as a public official had no right to be appointed to such a party political office. Sir, no doubt he is an important personage. At Nongoma particularly he is a very important personage, but I would like the Minister to impress upon his officials that no matter how important a Commissioner-General may be at Nongoma, the returning officer concerned is far more important in dealing with matters pertaining to the running of the polling booth of which he is in charge. This, as I have said, is a small point but an important one because it affects the whole conduct of elections, and the importance of the thing is that elections should be properly conducted at the local level.</p>

<p>The information came too late for an objection to be taken in time. But the matter does not end there, because we are living in a time when there is a multitude of important official personages in our society; we are having more and more important officials created and those posts are filled virtually entirely from the ranks of the governing party. In those circumstances it seems to me vital for the continuance of our electoral system that persons in charge of polling booths be instructed to ignore the official status of these people and that the regulations in regard to the conduct of polling booths be adhered to strictly. I would ask the hon. the Minister to investigate that particular case and to give this House the assurance that he will issue instructions to see that not only does it not occur again in regard to this particular official, but that it won&#x2019;t occur in respect of any official, no matter how important he may be in his own sphere.</p>

But why mention this specific example, Mr. Chairman, when his office-bearers at the polling booth did not raise this matter with the returning officer? How is the returning officer to know that a particular person is not an official of one of the political parties?</p>

<p>I do not know how big the place is to which the hon. member referred; I do not know whether it is a very big place, but I take it that in certain small places there will be returning officers, perhaps ordinary clerks, who do not know all the commissioners-general. The returning officer in this case may have been an official who was sent from a place like Durban which is far away. I have no objection therefore to the general trend of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, but I think it is wrong on his part to mention this particular person here without first having raised the matter with the returning officer to see whether he could not get satisfaction from him.</p>

<p>I should like to break a lance here for my colleagues who, geographically speaking, represent large constituencies. I am in this position that I have one of the smallest constituencies as far as area is concerned, although it has a large number of voters. Mr. Chairman, in terms of the Constitution delimitations take place on the system that an average quota is obtained by dividing by 150 the number of registered voters in the Republic, and thereafter the Delimitation Commission may use its discretion to unload sparsely populated constituencies by 15 per cent or to load densely populated constituencies by 15 per cent. In 1910 the Cape Province, under this procedure of delimitation, retained 51 out of the 121 constituencies while the Transvaal retained 36 out of the 121. In 1952 the Cape Province retained 52 out of 150 and the Transvaal 68 out of 150; in other words while the number of constituencies in the Cape Province remained the same, although the total number of seats had increased from 121 to 150, the number of constituencies in the Transvaal practically doubled, that is to say, from 36 to 68. I think the reason is that while there was reasonable economic development in all the provinces, there was an immense revolution in the Rand areas, and the fact of the matter is that judging by present trends, the Cape Province will have to relinquish three more constituencies to the Transvaal if a new delimitation is to take place to-morrow. These three constituencies will disappear from the Cape platteland. Moreover&#x2026;</p>

<p>I have almost finished outlining the background and I hope, Sir, that you will give me a little latitude. Apart from these three constituencies which the Cape platteland will have to relinquish to the Transvaal, the position is that with the tremendous urban development in the Cape Province itself, in all probability two additional platteland constituencies in the Cape Province will go to the urban areas; in other words, at the next delimitation the rural areas of the Cape Province will probably lose four seats. The position to-day is that the Cape Province already has a few rural constituencies which are unbearably big.</p>

<p>It is becoming clearer day by day that in the field of international sport we are going to find ourselves in one difficulty after another, and the outcome of that is undoubtedly going to be that we are going to be pushed out of every form of international sport. If such a thing were necessary because the whole life of this country depended upon it, then one would willingly endure it. But I believe that if there is one aspect of Government policy which is unnecessary, it is its interference in sport in this country. I have said here on previous occasions that our main difficulty to-day, in the sphere of human relations, is to be found in the fact that the Government interferes too much in the private lives <span class="col_5083-5084" refersTo="page_1168"/>of our citizens.

<p>I do not know whether this is generally realized, but outside the political sphere the Government is interfering more with the private lives of the citizens of South Africa than even the Kremlin does in Russia. [Interjections.] It would seem that there are some hon. members who dispute that, but we are the only country in the world where the authorities decide in which bus a person should ride; in which taxi he may ride; where he is to sit in a bus; which entrance to a public building he is to use; in which part of the city he is to live; with whom he may mix socially; what work he may do, etc. I could mention more than 100 of these don&#x2019;ts and may-nots, but then I would have to deviate too far from the point that I want to make here. I repeat, however, that even under the Kremlin there is not as much governmental interference, outside the sphere of party politics, as we find in this country in the private lives of our citizens.</p>

<p>The very latest step is the Government&#x2019;s interference in the sports life of the people. It decides whether a champion may take part in a championship or not; it decides who may take part in a motor-racing event; it decides whether a person may play on a particular course, even if the club concerned is prepared to allow him to do so; it wants the right to decide how certain teams are to be constituted. And then the Government is not even logical always. Read the statement made by the hon. the Minister of the Interior in connection with South Africa&#x2019;s participation in international sport: If we are to be allowed to send two teams to the Olympic Games, one for Whites and one for non-Whites, then it means that a White South African team would compete abroad with a non-White South African team in a way which is not permitted in this country itself. Apart from that, and unlikely as it is that the Olympic Games would permit such a departure, namely, to allow two South African teams to take part there, separated on lines of colour, I can think of no more unfavourable advertisement for South Africa than the fact that Whites and non-Whites from South Africa are allowed to run against each other in separate teams but not with each other in the same team. I feel that we have reached a far-reaching position in the life of this country; there are few things which have brought so much discredit upon our country as the dictates of this Government in the field of sport&#x2014;and that is still happening every day. There is only one way out of the impending difficulties for us, and that is for the Government to restore the freedom of association. In other words, it must confine itself to matters which normally fall under the Government of a country, and for the rest it should have sufficient faith in the public to believe that they will regulate their social life according to the needs and the desires and the customs of the community. I want to ask the hon. the Minister pertinently whether he has no faith in the people and in the White public opinion of South Africa? Has he no faith in the firmness of the traditions and habits and customs of our people? Does he really believe that if he does not intervene by means of laws and dictates that our people will stop maintaining the tradition of separation in sport? Mr. Chairman, separation in the field of sport is supported in broad outline by the vast majority of South Africans, and they have no desire to depart from it. There need not be the slightest fear that if the Government stops interfering, the White South African will depart from what is a deep-seated tradition. But the quickest way to bring that traditional way into disfavour, is the way in which the Government is setting about things at the moment. The activities of associations such as Churches and sports bodies can safely be left to the forces of tradition and of individual preference and conduct. My plea, for the sake of South Africa, is that the Government should keep out of social activities such as sports; that it should not drag its policies into the field of sport and that it should leave it to the common sense of bodies such as the South African Olympic and National Games Association which, after all, have always taken tradition into account, to make such arrangements as public opinion permits, arrangements which will no longer earn for South Africa the ridicule and scorn of the world. I am not the only person who adopts that attitude. There are people on the Government side who fully agree with me. Let me quote, for example, what the editor the <i>Burger</i> wrote in the issue of 3 February 1962. I quote the report verbatim (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For example, I consider it wrong in more than one respect that every time Papwa wants to take part in a championship tournament, the Government has to make the final decision. That is so because of the Group Areas Act which, as far as I am concerned, might as well be changed on this point. In my opinion a Government should not be drawn into details of this kind. The time will come when people who want to evade the responsibility of thinking for themselves will want to know from the Government with whom they should shake hands and with whom they may have tea. And the strength that will become lost to the nation in such a process is to be found in fact in those great reserves of tradition and practical common sense with regard to race relations amongst ordinary people of all races. That is what we need above all for the solution of the countless and various problems of social race relations from day to day. In this sphere I suppose <span class="col_5085-5086" refersTo="page_1169"/>a Government can and must give guidance on broad lines, but not answers to the particular questions of every sports club and city council.</block>

<p>I fully subscribe to this attitude adopted by the <i>Burger,</i> and my plea is that the Government should not interfere in the affairs of associations; that it should have greater faith in public opinion, and that it should restore the freedom of association, the freedom of people to regulate their affairs according to their traditions.</p>

I want to show how incorrect his speech was, what a false impression it must create and how far it is from the truth. Naturally it would have been much better if we could have continued on our traditional lines without having to pass certain legislation. But why is the Government obliged to pass legislation, and why was the previous Government obliged to pass legislation? Because there is a bunch of liberals and agitators in our country who are intent on breaking down the traditional colour bar, and the hon. member is beginning to associate himself with them. He comes along with the statement that this is the only Government in the world which tells people on which buses they have to travel. Is he not ashamed of himself for saying such a thing? He belonged to the old National Party which told people in which trains they had to travel and in which trains they were not allowed to travel. He belonged to the old United Party, the Coalition Party, which told the Bantu in which trains they were allowed to travel and the Whites in which trains they were allowed to travel. Was the position here also worse in those days than it is in Russia? He belonged to the National Party which told people on which buses they had to ride and on which buses they were not allowed to travel. Was the position also worse in those days than in Russia?

<p>Does the hon. member not realize that it was possible in those days because the Liberals had not yet launched this strenuous campaign of theirs? There was no such thing in those days as this tremendous agitation for the wiping out of all colour bars; there was no such thing as this tidal wave of propaganda that is sweeping through the world. Formerly, like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, we accepted this as perfectly normal. It was just as normal to have this separation as it is normal to wake up in the morning. It was perfectly normal to say that a Bantu may not travel in this train and the White may may not travel in that train. We regarded it as perfectly normal.

Is the hon. member not ashamed of himself? He knows that was always done until this tidal wave swept over the world, until Mr. Macmillan made his speech here in the coffee room. It was regarded as normal until we had these deliberate attempts on the part of very influential people. Attempts are being made to-day at UNO to destroy this colour bar in every sphere. And the only way&#x2014;it is very unfortunate that should be so&#x2014;to obviate it, is to pass laws. We would naturally have preferred not to have passed laws against mixed marriages; we would naturally have preferred not to have passed the Immorality Act if it was not necessary. Naturally the hon. the Minister would have preferred to remain silent about mixed sports if the old traditions had continued to be observed. But those elements refused to allow things to take their traditional course, and the Government is forced to-day to go further than previous governments did. But the pattern remains precisely the same. And if one refuses to defend this pattern, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does, then one cannot maintain the dividing line. But if the hon. member says that the position here is worse than in the Kremlin when the Government seeks to uphold this dividing line, then he must declare himself openly in favour of the breaking down of the colour bar. You cannot go and plead in the rural areas or even in Bezuidenhout for the continuance of the traditional dividing lines and then say, when the Government seeks to prevent people from breaking down the colour bar, that is worse than what Khrushchev is doing. You cannot do so, not if you are honest. But let the hon. member have the courage to stand up and propagate what he has just indicated; then I shall have respect for him, as he ought to have. Let him stand up, please, and tell us which dividing lines he is willing to break down. Is he willing to allow large-scale mixed sport? Because as surely as the sun is going to rise to-morrow morning, if the Minister exercises no control and says, &#x201C;Do as you please,&#x201D; there are going to be mixed meetings every week and within a year from to-day we are going to have mixed rugby matches.

<p>Speaking for myself, I do not need any Nationalist Member of Parliament or legislation to tell me how I should conduct myself in this country. Having said that I will get on with my own case. The Minister, in reply to questions of mine in respect of the removal of the language test in the Public Service gave the following replies: On 20 February I asked whether the language tests for promotion in the Public Service have been abolished and, if so, for what reasons. This was part of the reply: No, the standard language tests for promotion in the Public Service have not been abolished. In terms of the powers vested in it&#x2026; the Public Service Commission has, however, decided that officers and contract employees who come into consideration for promotion to posts of which the maximum notches of the salary scales (a) in the case of the professional division, do not exceed R3,120 per annum; (b) in the case of the Technical Division, do not exceed R2,640 per annum; (c) in the case of the Clerical Division, do not exceed R2,160 per annum and (d) in the case of the General A Division, do not exceed R2,160 per annum be exempted from taking the language tests. The promotion of all officers and contract employees to posts of which the maxima of the salary scales are higher than those indicated above, shall in the future still be subject to the successful completion of the tests.</p>

<p>On 23 February I asked: What is (a) the number and (b) the percentage of public servants who are not exempted from passing languages tests for promotion.</p>

I wish to ask the hon. member this: When he talks the way he does in connection with sport, what is he really doing? Does the hon. member not realize that he is pleading for the opening of fronts? If we open the sport front, does he not realize that is one of the fronts through which the Liberals, the enemies of our country, want to negotiate a break-through? The hon. member has been in politics long enough to know that what I am saying is the truth.</p>

<p>The hon. member cannot be as stupid as that. It was only the other day that I warned the hon. the Leader of the Opposition against that hon. member and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has to-day seen how correct I was when I warned him the other day. I want to warn every hon. member opposite against that member. He will embarrass every one of them very greatly, as he has embarrassed the official Opposition to-day. The hon. member has pleaded to-day that we should throw our sportsfields open&#x2014;for whom? Not to those who are worried about it that they cannot take part in sport together with the Whites. No, Mr. Chairman, those people who plead that we should throw our sportsfields open are concerned about one thing only and that is whether they can bring that about, because once they have broken through one front, they will, as surely as day follows night, tackle another front. That is the reason why we do not want to open these fronts, as the enemies of South Africa want us to do. That is my reply, pure and simple, to the member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite this question. I notice that hon. member and his Leader are preparing themselves, are making preparations, to join the United Party. They want to join that party. I want to ask hon. members opposite whether they approve of the attitude which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has adopted to-day, whether they support him in his plea? Those hon. members will have the opportunity of getting up and telling us whether they support the hon. member in his attitude. The views which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout holds these days are that he wants to break down everything. What does he want to break down? He wants to break down our traditional policy, apartheid in sport; it is traditional in South Africa to take part in sport separately. That is what the hon. member wants to break down. The hon. member wants to break down the stability which we have in South Africa and to which separate sport has contributed, and thus disturb the good relations between the various racial groups. Mr. Chairman, I can well imagine what will happen in this country to-morrow or the day after once we throw the sport front open and the enemies of South Africa break through. Every sport gathering will be a blood bath. Does the hon. member not know what we are doing? With the application and the maintenance of our policy of separate development and with the arrangements we are making, we are maintaining a great national structure in a stable position. That is what we are doing. I do not know whether the hon. member knows this but when you court you often do very strange things. You sometimes break your promise and you sometimes forget your past. The hon. member is courting: he is flirting with a party and I want to warn that party against that hon. member. Your future with that member will be as you, have seen it to-day.</p>

Does the hon. member not realize what we are doing? Does the solution lie in breaking down everything that has been built up in the past; in undermining the basis of our stability?

<p>I do not propose following the outbursts of the previous speaker. A few minutes ago the hon. the Minister replied to observations which I had made in regard to the statistical services and indicated that he was appointing a special committee to go into this matter. I hope that when the Minister does appoint this committee he will include in its terms of reference the question of getting expert advice on the collation and centralization of statistics. At the present moment the Minister&#x2019;s Department uses Hollerith calculators. The Minister knows that the modern trend is towards electronic computers. A tremendous amount of information can be stored electrically by means of electronic computers; far more than can be stored by old-fashioned methods. When information is available it is possible to micro-film that information and it can be stored in a much smaller compass than is the practice to-day. I hope the committee will not recommend decentralization. I submit that decentralization will be the wrong policy to pursue.</p>

<p>That is one of their terms of reference.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I realize that is one of their terms of reference but I am giving the warning now because information made available has many uses. If information is decentralized then information which is centred in one department may be required by another department. If information is decentralized over the various State departments, the cost of introducing computer collation will be almost prohibitive; it will be very unlikely that it will be introduced in the near future. As the Minister rightly said statistics must be fresh; statistics must come out promptly. For that reason, Mr. Chairman, it is advisable that the most expeditious way of not only collecting the statistics but of collating and presenting them should be introduced in the Minister&#x2019;s Department. I do hope that the Minister will give this committee power to call in expert advice to deal with this question of collation by computers. I realize that this is a job for a specialist department and all the members of the committee may not necessarily have that experience of computers. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should give those officials power to call expert evidence, because I am quite sure that expert evidence will convince the committee of the necessity to centralize the statistics. The amount of information which must be tabulated and collated on a modern computer will make the information readily available in the shortest possible space of time and will overcome many of the defects which obtain under the present system and about which the members of commerce and industry and agriculture are complaining. It will assist in economic planning; it will assist in future planning if the vital statistics of this country are readily available. I hope the Minister when doing the investigation, will include in the powers of this committee the power to call expert evidence on computers so that when a decision is taken it will be taken in the light of the best modern knowledge available on this subject.</p>

<p>I do not want to reply to the language that has been used on the other side against me personally. Unfortunately it is a characteristic of hon. members on the other side that they do not confine themselves to the case that has been put up; they steer away from it and then they come forward with one false accusation after another of a personal nature. In point of fact the attack which the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) and the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) made upon me were directed against the <i>Burger.</i> My plea, and I adhere to it, was that the Minister and his Government, in matters affecting people&#x2019;s social life, for example, in sports and church bodies, should have a little more faith in the traditional customs of South Africa. I was not pleading for anything to be broken down; I was talking about the way <span class="col_5093-5094" refersTo="page_1173"/>in which things are being handled in this country. I believe in the greater power of tradition and custom and that it is wrong for the State to interfere in detail in the private lives of citizens. After all, how did we manage for 300 years?</p>

<p>I should like to do so, Mr. Chairman, but some very bitter things have been said here and I have been challenged to state my attitude again. My attitude still is that I have sufficient faith in the traditional customs of the White man in South Africa. Sports associations would not lightly venture to go against the traditions of the vast majority of the White race. That is why it is not a question here of breaking down anything; it is a question of the methods applied by the Government and I adhere to what I said previously. Just as little as I would like to see the Government interfere with the way in which our churches regulate their affairs, so too I am opposed to the Government&#x2019;s continual interference with sports arrangements. Bodies of this kind have always functioned in the past in accordance with the dictates of public opinion. As a matter of fact, the Government&#x2019;s boast is that White public opinion is so strongly in favour of a colour bar that it is returned to power time and again. If that is so, then surely there is substance in my argument that the traditional way of regulating things is the best and, moreover, will do less harm to South Africa&#x2019;s name than the present interference in all matters by the Government. It is not the Government&#x2019;s duty to decide whether a particular person may take part in a championship! Would the world come to an end, would our traditional way of life collapse and would the White man go under because Papwa takes part in the championship? Such lack of confidence in our traditional way of life is incredible. It is because of the faith that I have in our traditional way of life and its power in regulating things and regulating relations that I repeat my attack and again urge the Government to interfere less in the ordinary life of the citizen.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to a few of the further matters raised. I do not see the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) here now, but I just want to tell him this: If what he says is true, and I accept that it is, then it is a serious matter and I will give the undertaking that my Department will investigate the matter. The provisions of the Act must be implemented, and it is quite correct that this should not happen, if the facts given to us by the hon. member are correct. I will have the matter investigated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) was frequently called to order by the Chairman, and I do not want to reply to him and thereby land in the same position. I just want to tell the hon. member that we have the Electoral Act and the various provisions in regard to how delimitations are to be made. If the hon. member considers that more is necessary, apart from these four principles according to which constituencies must be delimitated, he must make his representations to me and I will consider them. But as he has put the case here, I cannot say yes or no to him.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has to-night considered it desirable and useful to mention in this Committee Stage a matter such as the question of participation in sport. I should like to join other hon. members in expressing my disapproval of it, and also for other reasons. I think the hon. member has encouraged precisely the very thing he does not want me to do, because he has now by his speech tried to drag into politics the whole question of sport and participation in sport. I believe the other hon. members of the Opposition will act more wisely than he has done, and that they will not make themselves guilty of the same conduct of which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has made himself guilty, by actually attempting to drag this matter into politics. And I say that with due regard to my responsibility in this connection. There has always been the best co-operation between the sports bodies in South Africa and any previous Government, and not only this one, and the mutual belief that what is done is in the best interests of South Africa, and that the action taken interprets public opinion, for which the hon. member now suddenly pleads so hard.</p>

<p>Now what has happened precisely? I would certainly have taken the opportunity, if I thought that this was a political matter in regard to which the Government&#x2019;s standpoint had to be defended, to make a statement in this House. But I deliberately did not do so. Why did I make that statement? My predecessor, the present Minister of Finance, made a statement in 1956. There was never any reaction to that, and nobody ever doubted that what he did was done with honest intentions. The only reason why I repeated that statement and expanded on it was because there was some uncertainty, on the part of certain bodies, as to what the standpoint of the Government was. Where did that measure of uncertainty come from? I do not want to say that it was done with ulterior motives, but people started inviting other nations left and right to come and participate in sport in South Africa. We had the difficulty that these people did not know precisely where they stood, or some of them pretended not to know where they stood. Then there are others, the ultra-liberals referred to by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), whose object definitely is the ruining of the traditional method of handling sport in South Africa, and who deliberately set out to create problems instead of <span class="col_5095-5096" refersTo="page_1174"/>trying to create a good spirit. I want to say, Sir, that the great commotion that took place here to-day is that hon. member has actually become a tool, not even in the hands of the Opposition, it seems to me, to try to drag something into this debate which is not at home in this debate.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Nowhere; it should be left in the same hands of the federated sports bodies, of the national sports bodies, which will handle and control their own affairs much better than the hon. member for Bezuidenhout could ever do. All he is doing is to spoil their case. Let me tell the hon. member that there is the closest contact with these responsible sports bodies, sports organizations and federations. They continually write to the Government asking what they should do in a particular case or what advice we can give in some other case. There is not a single piece of legislation which determines these relations. But it is based on mutual understanding, and we find it both in the files of the previous Government and of this Government, and the hon. member now wants to throw a spanner into the works to spoil these relations. Sir, let me tell the hon. member this: I am fully confident that in so far as the development of sport in South Africa is concerned, and with reference to this statement which I issued in March, there will still be the same good relations which have always existed. We can furnish proof that it is not necessary to begin making concessions to pressure from abroad in this sphere. Because it must simply be expected that we will not allow it. But the Government has been very liberal in its attitude and it simply sets out from the standpoint that in so far as public opinion and tradition in regard to sport in South Africa are concerned, we expect that when tourists visit our country they will accept and respect our way of doing things; and when we send teams overseas, they must also know that we do it in our way, but when we are in their country we respect their approach to sport. But we will not allow any body inside or outside South Africa to dictate to us what we should do in this country. Because we have just one basic standpoint, to which we will adhere, and that is that in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s participation in sport, that is based on our traditional standpoint. I want to ask the hon. member to consider for a moment what can happen here in regard to mixed sport. He mentioned Papwa as an example, but has the hon. member considered the consequences if a mixed team should come to South Africa at this moment? But that is not what is concerned here. The hon. member should not allow that impression to be created abroad. It was very clearly said in this statement that we adopt neither a superior nor an inferior attitude in regard to sport. On the contrary, we have already stated that it is the duty of those who know more, namely the Whites, to assist the non-Whites, to whichever group they may belong, to practise sport in the same spirit and on the same level of efficiency as the Whites. We will therefore assist them; we are their guardians.</p>

<p>I can only repeat that what the hon. member tried to do here this afternoon, and that unsavoury comparison he made between the Kremlin and South Africa is objectionable to us. I can only say that he hon. member has used words here which do not redound to his credit, which can do our country no good, and which cannot serve the interests of the matter he advocated here. He can only cause confusion. Therefore I can only express my gratitude for the fact that the official Opposition did not try to make use of this in an attempt to derive political gain. I fully appreciate that, even though they may differ from me as to the way in which I handled the matter. But this is not a political matter. The hon. member has lost more than he realizes. In any case, he has revealed to the whole world where he stands.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the half-hour? I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that in discussing a Vote of this nature, where thousands of our fellow-citizens have made a career or serving the public and the country, he will join with me when I express the thought that our country would like to see the most efficient, contented and the most well-paid Public Service that it is possible for any country to have. I make that observation because I want to refer to certain statements that the Minister made last year when addressing the Conference of Public Service Associations in October. I do not want the Minister to say tonight that I am quoting him out of context. I am quoting what is relevant to what I want to put before the Minister, and I have here the report of the Minister&#x2019;s statement to this conference as reported in the <i>Star</i> of Wednesday 25 October. The Minister discussed the position of the place that the Public Service should hold in the country, and he had these observations to make. He said that in Germany public servants were regarded as conceited, money-wasting bureaucrats, with a tendency to misuse their power. The Minister made that statement when referring to the place of the public servant in the monarchical form of government, particularly referring to the place of our public servants in the past while South Africa was still a monarchy. Then he went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do we in the first place want to serve the public, to render public services, to be the employees while the public is the employer, and to be taken to task by the public? Or are we State officials who render State service?</block>

<p><span class="col_5097-5098" refersTo="page_1175"/>The Minister drew a parallel between the position in France and in Germany and said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As public officials we will have to decide which of the two courses we are going to follow, the French or the German.</block>

<p>He said, further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State concept must be our inspiration. In the Public Service should be found the bearers of this concept.</block>

<p>The Sapa report ends there, and I take it that because this report has never been contradicted the Minister will accept what I have quoted here as being correct. Now I want to ask the Minister what he meant when he said this? What concept was he attempting to preach to the public servants of our country when he said that they would not be servants of the people or the public whom they serve, but they should be servants of the State? In my view, and in that of this side of the House, it expresses a very dangerous concept of the functions and the position of the Public Service. I think one may say that in such observations there are very dangerous under-currents. It creates the impression that it is the Minister&#x2019;s view that the public servant is independent of Parliament and merely a tool of the Government in power; that he is a tool to be used by the Government in power and that he owes no responsibility to Parliament. It implies adapting the administrative machine of the country to the wishes of those who hold power. I say that is a totalitarian concept, which has applied in totalitarian countries, that the official is the servant of the State and not of the people whom he serves. I think, therefore, that in discussing this Public Service Commission Vote it is necessary that we should have a clear statement from the Minister of the Government&#x2019;s policy in this regard, and of what in fact the Minister meant when he made these statements and advocated such thoughts to the public servants.</p>

<p>It is necessary to ask this because the Chairman of the Public Service Commission also addressed the Conference of Public Service Associations at that time, and he addressed them before the Minister did, and he had views which appear to me to be at variance with those of the Minister, because he said this, as reported in the Press. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that public servants were themselves largely to blame for the public&#x2019;s &#x201C;sneering&#x201D; attitude towards them. Many of them ran down the service in public but did nothing about their shortcomings or those of their slower colleagues. Nobody worth his salt wanted to work for an organization that did not enjoy public esteem, and that was one of the main reasons why the Public Service did not attract the best types. He believed that a &#x201C;positive public opinion&#x201D; was essential for the building up of a dynamic and effective public service, and that public opinion could only be won by exertion and dedication on the part of public servants themselves.</block>

<p>That statement clearly implies that it is the function of the public servant to dedicate himself to the interests of the public whom he serves, quite contrary to the Minister&#x2019;s concept that it is the job of the public servant to dedicate himself to the behests of the State. I ask the Minister because I think it is important that we have a clear statement of policy in this regard, because I see that in a further interview with the Press, when the Chairman of the Public Service Commission was asked to comment on the Minister&#x2019;s statement, he was very chary of making any direct comment, but he did say quite clearly that he considered it was the function of the public servant to serve the public of the country.</p>

<p>I want to take the Minister a stage further. At an earlier meeting, also in October last year, the Minister had a meeting with the heads of the various departments, which also included the heads of the Provincial Administration departments, if I remember correctly, and he told them that what was considered necessary at the present time was an overhaul of the present merit system of promotion in order that a diligent official could have every chance of winning his reward for hard work, and he posed the question to the heads of these departments whether the Public Service is not perhaps losing its best men, not because the salary is insufficient, but because these men were frustrated by red tape? The Minister was obviously addressing the heads of departments on the question of shortage of staff and the difficulties being experienced in the Public Service in this regard, and he was dealing with the question of wastage. I want to ask the Minister this. It is interesting to note that in nearly every report over the past few years reference has been made by the Public Service Commissioners to the shortage of staff and the difficulty of obtaining suitable personnel. I do not want to enumerate these difficulties, but it is clearly shown in the 1960 report of the P.S.C. that the authorized establishment had increased from 1953, at which time it stood at 119,300, to 148,500 as at 1 December 1960. In other words, there has been an increase in the authorized establishment of some 26,000 odd posts. Whilst the establishment has increased, the latest report of the P.S.C. reveals that the number of posts on the establishment not filled by permanent incumbents presently total some 16,800, and if you analyse the figures in this report further you find that resignations from the Public Service over the same period total no less than 54,301, and that is&#x2014;let me emphasize&#x2014;not in all the divisions of the Public Service, but only in the clerical, professional and technical grades and the general aid division. When you examine these shortages in the light of these figures, I think we should say to the Minister that the position can hardly be described as satisfactory. I have quoted these figures for <span class="col_5099-5100" refersTo="page_1176"/>this purpose, because the Minister is on record as having said that his ultimate aim, in order to get an efficient service, was to get a smaller and more efficient Public Service. With the 26,000 increased posts and the 54,000 resignations, I think it is pertinent to ask the Minister how he hopes to achieve this? He has told the country that the drain of man-power from the Public Service must be stopped, but at the same time the Minister tells the Public Service officials to work harder without expecting any immediate material gain. The plain fact of the matter is that until the rates of pay or the rewards of public service are of such a nature for men of ability in our flourishing economy that they have the inducement to spend a lifetime in the Public Service, this unsatisfactory position will remain. Therefore it is no wonder that we get reports such as this House saw recently of a magistrate, a respected citizen, a man who exercised authority over his fellow-citizens, had to resign in order to get better employment as an ordinary clerk in some commercial concern.</p>

<p>Then there are one or two other points on which I think the Minister should give the House and the country some information. The 1959 report of the P.S.C. refers to the steps taken for corrective treatment for officers with occupational adjustment problems, and the latest report available, that for 1960, indicates that this new step taken to adjust these maladjusted officers was first taken only in the Pretoria area, but that it was hoped to extend the scheme to the other major centres. Is it necessary that such investigation should take place? Is it necessary to conduct these investigations, because the figure quoted of 254 cases in Pretoria alone, of officers needing corrective treatment, is a high figure. Are no steps taken when men are employed in the service to sort them out for the jobs, to give them aptitude tests, to see that the posts in which they are placed are suitable to their temperament, their ability, their education and their other qualifications? I think the Minister should indicate whether steps of that nature are being taken before people are employed in the Public Service.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of language tests to which I would like to refer. The two latest reports available of the P.S.C. reveal that no fewer than 10,000 officers were tested, and only 5,600 were successful. But what is disturbing to note is that the largest percentage who failed these tests comprised those who failed in English. Can the Minister give us any further information, because it is now rumoured that because of the difficulty of getting applicants, these language tests will be suspended for some time.</p>

<p>Another point on which the Minister should indicate the Government&#x2019;s policy is this. At the last meeting of the Public Service Joint Advisory Council certain recommendations were made and one of them, which I understand has been the subject of discussions over quite a long period, was for the introduction of a compulsory medical benefit scheme. I understand that as the result of the discussions that took place in the Advisory Council, where all the staff associations are represented, it was stated by the P.S. Commissioners that a committee had been appointed to investigate the matter further. I ask the Minister whether he can make any statement, and whether it is intended that a comprehensive, compulsory medical benefit scheme will be introduced for the benefit of all public servants.</p>

<p>Then I come to what has been considered for a long time as a ticklish question as far as public servants are concerned, and that is the question of a five-day week. I think it is generally accepted that in commerce and industry to-day the principle of a five-day week operates, but it does not operate in businesses or in commerce or industry where it would be to the detriment of the public as a whole. At this last meeting of the staff associations, representations were made by the Council to the P.S.C. along these lines, and I quote from the report of the P.S.C., as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Council recommends that where it is practicable the concession of a five-day working week should be favourably considered.</block>

<p>It also made a second recommendation in this regard and stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In those cases where it is not practicable, an alternate Saturday should be allowed free, provided that the hours of attendance are not decreased and that essential services are maintained.</block>

<p>In other words, the staff associations are fully aware of the responsibilities of public servants to the general public, and there is no suggestion of a general closing down of Government offices on Saturdays to the inconvenience of the public as a whole. But the contention of the staff associations is that if other businesses, even including local authorities, can operate on reduced staffs on Saturday mornings to attend to the requirements of the public, so that the public will not be inconvenienced, why should the same position not apply in the Public Service? It is interesting to note that the decision of the P.S.C. in this regard was one of outright rejection. I would like to ask the Minister whether the time has not arrived, if he is concerned to build up a stronger, smaller but more effective Public Service, when he should consider all these aspects which deal with the conditions of the man who is prepared to devote his whole life to the Public Service, to serve his fellow-citizens and his country. As long as the public servants of the country feel that they occupy a position of lower merit, which is not recognized on an equal basis, especially as far as the higher ranks of the service are concerned, which are equivalent in privilege and status to those who hold high positions <span class="col_5101-5102" refersTo="page_1177"/>in commerce, so long will we not have an efficient Public Service, and for so long will the Public Service continue to draw only people of moderate merit, and not the best. I think the Minister will agree with me that it should be Government policy to draw the best men for the Public Service, because they are the men who carry the burdens of the country and not the politicians who come in one year and go out the next year. I could draw attention to many more such points, but time does not permit of it, but I hope the Minister can give a clear statement of Government policy in regard to these matters.</p>

<p>Then there is one final point I wish to raise, and I would be failing in my duty to my own constituents if I did not mention it, and which is one I have continued to do as long as I have been in this House, and that is the position of the women in the Public Service. I am not going to deal with the matter at length. I want to be consistent in the plea I have put up here year after year, that a woman should be treated on the same basis as a man, on merit, and should be paid the same salary for doing the same work. The time has, in my opinion, come when all avenues in the Public Service should be opened up to women, and to get equal pay for equal work. There is no defined policy as far as the Government is concerned. In some Departments it is the practice to shunt women into dead-end jobs where they do not have the opportunity of doing equal work. There are other Departments where women do the same work as men, but draw lower salaries than the men. Then there are other cases where the women have young, inexperienced men as their subordinates, but who earn higher salaries than these women just because they are men. The plain fact of the matter is that a man who can hold down a job will not object to competition from women, but the man who dislikes the thought of a woman being on the same level with him is one who dislikes competition in any case. I would suggest to the Minister that the general run of men in the Public Service are prepared to meet the competition from women and the extent to which they support these women&#x2019;s associations in regard to these representations that have been made for many years, and even by the official journal of the Public Service for over 30 years&#x2014;I think that shows that the time has come that the Minister should give a clear statement of policy in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to elaborate on the subject introduced by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) that women should get equal pay for equal work, I want to remind the hon. the Minister that the Advisory Council for the Public Service have year after year asked that consideration be given to this. I want to say to the Minister that this is a movement which is afoot right through the whole civilized world, and the feeling is there that where women are doing the same kind of work and are doing a job equal to that of a man, they should get the same salary as men. It is a recognized fact that men and women receive the same training. They go to co-educational establishments where they receive exactly the same training. They have to pass the same examinations, and it is only after entrance into the Service that the differentiation is made and women are paid less when they are doing the same job as the men. Perhaps the Minister will tell me that this will have tremendous repercussions. Perhaps he will say that the economy of the country cannot afford it, but when an examination of this matter was made by a Royal Commission in Britain, the finding was that the repercussions would be negligible, and it was found that when this was applied in Britain the economy of the country could easily stand the strain. Therefore I hope the Minister will not say that to me. I do not say that it should be applied outright in one year. Perhaps it could be made applicable over a number of years, and so stagger the effects on the economy of the country, although it was made applicable in one year in Britain. I want to draw attention here to the fact that a UN resolution which was passed by a number of civilized countries was put into operation in those countries, and therefore I say the Minister should be able to do it in this country. I have here several resolutions from the UN Economic and Social Council and I find that in their resolution of 7 March 1962 they say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Alliance believes in equal pay for equal work and its corollary, equal work for equal pay, and considers that the earlier age of retirement for women alone undermines the principle of equal pay and makes the practice of it unjust. By compulsory retirement at an earlier age than men, employers are deprived of the women&#x2019;s services, the women are deprived of their earnings, and receive benefits at a lower rate than men, though for a longer period. Further, women who are approaching retirement age are inevitably passed over when the higher and better-paid posts become vacant, as their term of usefulness will be less than that of their men competitors.</block>

<p>I find in another resolution, also of the UN Economic Council that they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Member societies of I.A.W. from industrialized countries report slow progress towards the implementation of I.L.O. Convention No. 100 concerning equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value owing largely to lack of job appraisals and unequal age of retirement. In the industrialized countries of Western Europe, the principle of equal pay is in the process of being realized by the progressive narrowing of the gap between men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s wages.</block>

<p><span class="col_5103-5104" refersTo="page_1178"/>And so in resolution after resolution I find the same thing. I find that another resolution urges member federations to continue their efforts to press Governments to eliminate discriminatory laws and practices and create acceptance on the part of the public and employers to give married women full opportunities for employment on the same terms as unmarried women, and they go on to say that the pay must also be equal where the woman does the same work as the man. I want to stress that point. I do not ask for increased pay for women where they do not do exactly the same work as the man. I have referred to the legislation passed in Britain on this point. Another resolution passed at UN reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The International Council of Women welcomes the documentation furnished by the International Labour Office describing activities which I.C.W. representatives in Geneva continue to follow, related to the employment of women. We have in previous statements urged the view of the members in support of the principle of equal pay for equal work.</block>

<p>That theme runs right through all these resolutions at UN where both the Western and the Asian nations are represented.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when business was suspended I was saying that the trend in the modern world was that more and more women had to work because of our new economy in an industrial world. It is a &#x201C;must&#x201D; these days for women to work because of the rising cost of living. There are many women in our own public service and I think the hon. the Minister will admit that he has found them an essential and stable labour force. They are a stable element in our life. I have had some difficulty in trying to get the correct figures as they are not shown in the Commissioner&#x2019;s report. But I think I am right in saying that some 42 per cent of our public servants are women. There are certain posts in the Public Service where the salary is attached to the post and not to the individual who occupies the post. The women who are in such posts&#x2014;although there are not many of them&#x2014;have given yeoman service. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me when I say that where that has been the case those women have performed as good a job of work as any man could have done and that they have well deserved the salary which was attached to such posts. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to take a lead in this matter. There are many sections in our Public Service where women out-number the men. I think for instance, of telephone operators. Most of the telephone operators are women. I think of the position here in the Houses of Parliament. We have very efficient female telephone operators in this building; we also have a couple of men who operate the telephones. I find that the men draw bigger salaries than these very capable and able women telephone operators who give us wonderful service day after day. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to take the lead in this matter. Because, Sir, if the Minister obeyed the requests which have been made to him from his own Public Service Commission association, then surely the teaching profession, local government and the nursing profession will follow him and industry as such will also follow. I want to stress that there is no discrimination before a woman enters the Public Service. She has to undergo exactly the same training; she has to attend a co-educational establishment; she has to pass the same examination. It is only after entrance into the Service that they are paid according to sex even if they are doing the same work. That seems to be extremely unfair, Sir. I think the men in South Africa will admit that it is extremely unfair. The South African man is a fair individual. Where I am saying this, I realize that I am speaking in a man&#x2019;s world. I repeat that the South African man is a fair individual and that he realizes that where the job is the same the salary should be the same.</p>

<p>As I have said we find that more and more women have to work in this modern world of ours. Previously it was only the unmarried women who had to work but to-day the married women also have to work to assist their husbands. I think that the equality between the sexes which allows a woman to achieve a full professional and civil life, does not detract from family life but adds to it in multiplying the sphere of interest shared by the parties to a marriage. Educated and trained women are surely better fitted to train and advise their children. Surely that fits her better to be a proper mate for a well brought up and well-balanced husband. I make this appeal to the hon. the Minister to take this step. I find that the Act in England which provided for equal pay to men and women is a very simple Act. As a matter of fact it has only two clauses. It has only one operative clause which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any contract of service which provides for a rate of pay for a female employee less than the rate of pay under a corresponding contract of service for a male employee for work of equal value shall be void in that respect only, notwithstanding any agreement or consent to the contrary between the said female employee and her employer.</block>

<p>Nothing could be more simple, Mr. Chairman. I have previously indicated what the trend is in modem life and in the Western world. I have indicated how many of the Western nations have adopted this principle. I have <span class="col_5105-5106" refersTo="page_1179"/>also told this Committee that England has adopted this principle. This Bill was passed in 1954 in England. Canada followed in 1956 and many other countries have followed. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to hearken this appeal which has been made to him by the women of South Africa. Where I speak to-day, I am speaking in a House where there is equal pay for equal work, so I am not pleading my own cause. I am pleading the cause of hundreds of thousands of women outside this House. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that if he really wants to become a popular Minister he should hearken this plea which has come from his own Public Service Association. I want to tell him that if he wants to be in good company and if he tells us to-night that he will introduce legislation to this effect, he will find himself in the company of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy has just said that he wants the United States of America and private industry to provide equal pay and employment opportunity to women. Mr. Kennedy thinks that the same recognition should be given to women to-day to take part in public life as that given to them as mothers and housewives. Surely this is an opportunity of a life-time for the hon. the Minister. I can hardly imagine his refusing the appeal I have made to him. He will be so popular and he will be in such good company that I do not think he realizes how popular he will be.</p>

<p>I do not wish to cross swords with the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). I find that in her plea to the hon. the Minister she has made several important mistakes. In the first place, Sir, let me put it to her as a woman member of this House, as a mother, and ask her whether she does not agree with me that many of the evils which we have in South Africa to-day are tied up with the fact that our womenfolk, our mothers, are not in the homes to look after the children. Whether we wish to admit it or not, Sir, the fact remains that something has gone wrong in South Africa. That is so. It is not a pleasant admission to make. If we think of the products which our schools and universities turned out in the past, we have every reason to be proud of our fellow South Africans. What has happened in the meantime?</p>

<p>I would not say that. I want to be fair to the hon. member for Drakensberg. I really think she can make a great contribution to this House on behalf of the womenfolk of South Africa and I admire her for it. The point I wish to stress is this: We in South Africa must unfortunately admit that our young folk are definitely going back. They are not coming forward. The youth of olden days did not behave the way present-day youth behave. The fact remains that we would like to see a change in the position but how can we change it when the woman&#x2019;s influence is absent in the home? We must admit to-night that our divorce rate is the second highest in the world to-day. Only Denmark exceeds our figures. Why? Is it not due to the fact that our women are not in the homes: that is where they should be. They are out in business doing men&#x2019;s work. I am not for one moment saying, Sir, that they are not making their contributions. But the fact remains that, as we of the old school look at it, the woman&#x2019;s place is in her home. But she is not there to-day. The child is left to the tender mercies of a nanny, and often a Black nanny. That Black nanny has to rear that child of six, seven or eight years of age. What is the result, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not see any reason for mirth. This is a very serious matter. The fact remains&#x2014;and we cannot get away from it&#x2014;that if that Black nanny rears that child she certainly leaves a certain impression on that child&#x2019;s mind. Is that desirable in this country? Is that the type of child we want to see taking over the reins of government in the future? I certainly do not think so. Let me say this to the hon. member as regards the question of the salaries which are paid to women in this country: South Africa is a country which pays homage to its womenfolk. We place them on a pedestal whether they deserve it or not&#x2014;often they do not. The hon. member for Drakensberg will admit it, Sir, that they often do not deserve to be placed on the pedestal where we place them. However, the fact still remains that this country honours its womenfolk. This is a country with a unique history as far as its womenfolk are concerned. In the past the womenfolk of this country have borne the brunt of the struggle. I predict that if we wish to become the nation which we wish to become in the future, the South African women will have to play their part, not in the business world but in the home. I cannot stress this point strongly enough.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg spoke about our parliamentary staff. She mentioned the women telephone operators in this House and all over South Africa. We are proud of the fact that a young country like South Africa can produce women who are capable of doing that work. But the fact remains that your night services are done by men. [Laughter.] The hon. member comes here and pleads with the hon. the Minister to treat the women in our Public Service more <span class="col_5107-5108" refersTo="page_1180"/>generously. May I suggest to the hon. member that the Minister and this Government have given all the recognition necessary to the womenfolk of this country. Women are recognized in so many walks of life as the equal of the men that we do not know what more we can do. But I have my doubts whether they can hold their own in comparison with men. In all the senior posts it is necessary for the Public Service to employ men to put the final touch to the different services.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) was certainly very interesting. I am very glad to hear that his party is so definitely and firmly set against the principle of the rate for the job as far as the women in the Public Service are concerned. He did not admit as he should have admitted, that if it were not for this Government the family&#x2019;s fight for a living would have been easier; the fight for our children&#x2019;s future would have been easier and perhaps our womenfolk would have been able to model their lives on the lines suggested by the hon. member. As far as I am concerned, I am completely and utterly on the side of my colleague, the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk).</p>

<p>When I raised the question of the language tests earlier in this debate, I was told to raise it under this particular Vote. The Minister, in reply to questions of mine on the removal of the language tests in the Public Service, gave the following reply on Tuesday 20 February 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Ross asked the Minister of the Interior: Whether language tests for promotion in the Public Service have been abolished, and, if so, for what reasons. In terms of the powers vested in it by Section 11 of the Public Service Act, 1957, the Public Service Commission has, however, decided that officers and employees who come into consideration for promotion to posts of which the maximum notches of the salary scales (a) in the case of the Professional Division, do not exceed R3,120 per annum; (b) in the case of the Technical Division, do not exceed R2,640 per annum; (c) in the case of the Clerical Division, do not exceed R2,160 per annum and (d) in the case of the General A division do not exceed R2,160 per annum be exempted from taking the language tests. The promotion of all officers and contract employees to posts of which the maxima of the salary scales are higher than those indicated above, shall in the future still be subject to the successful completion of the tests.</block>

<p>I followed that up with a further question on 23 February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Ross asked the Minister of the Interior: What is (a) the number and (b) the percentage of public servants who are not exempted from passing language tests for promotion. Reply: As indicated in a reply to a previous question put by the hon. member, promotions which may be effected without the candidates having to pass in the language tests are limited to the most junior grades.</block>

<p>I repeat that, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the most junior grades. For further advancement the rules as regards language testing come into operation for all officers. As the exemptions operate only during a certain stage of an officer&#x2019;s career the distinctions implied in the question do not exist.</block>

<p>In reply to a question by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) in regard to the staff position the Minister replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are shortages in certain sections of the Public Service mainly in the entry grades but compared with other large employers this is not an exception. During the last few years there has been a substantial improvement in the staff position as a result of various measures taken by the Government and at the present time the Public Service is reasonably able to discharge its functions.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on page XV of the Estimates you have a schedule of the salary scales in the &#x201C;addendum reflecting scales of salary which are common to all Departments and which are not shown in the Votes&#x201D;. The only Public Servants with a higher salary figure than R3,120 mentioned by me, are the Secretary, Postmaster-General and corresponding officials. That is the first batch. Then Deputy Secretary and corresponding officials; Under secretaries and corresponding officials; Administrative Control officer, Principal Accountant, Principal Cost Accountant. And then the lowest grades: Principal Administrative Officer, Senior Accountant and Senior Cost Accountant. Those are the only positions in the Public Service which are apparently regarded as not being the most junior grades. The people on the R3,120 scale are the Senior Administrative officers, Accountants, Grade I. Cost Accountants, Grade I and O. &amp; M. Officers, Grade I. Their maximum salary is R3,120. They are apparently regarded as being the lowest grade in the Public Service. Mr. Chairman if ever there was a misleading reply this is it. How many senior posts are there? There are five classes of posts above this lowest grade of R3,120. Of course, we all know what the practice has been in the past. To be bilingual was to be able to speak Afrikaans. [Interjections.] I as an English-speaking person know. I regard this as the final declaration that English as a language is unnecessary in the Public Service. In the past we know too that these language tests were to keep the senior English-speaking <span class="col_5109-5110" refersTo="page_1181"/>Public Servants down and as an excuse for promoting Broederbonders over them. It seems to me as an English-speaking person that this process is now being completed. The Government is of course reaping its fruits in another direction too. For years thousands of children speaking Afrikaans only have been produced by the schools and universities and have been absorbed into the Public Service. If it had not been for this Government they would have been good South Africans. But they have been indoctrinated with a hatred for the English and a contempt for the English language. Mr. Chairman, I say that any English-speaking person who joins the Public Service is a fool. [Interjections.] I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister for the abolition of these tests. To tell me that these are the most junior grades is just fantasy. The extraordinary part of it is that we are continually told that we must stand together in unity. This is not the way to create unity, Sir. If we are in trouble, as they keep on telling us we are, I suggest to this Minister that this sort of practice, that this sort of act, is the most ill-considered act from his point of view that could be committed. I only have to mention what happened recently. A certain gentleman in Durban assured us that there is only going to be one language here in future, Afrikaans. [Interjections.] I would like to take a bet on with you, old man. Recently the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) in this House tried to point out to us that the English-speaking people comprised only 9 per cent of the population of South Africa and that unless we fell in behind the Prime Minister we would meet the same fate as his people. Perhaps we have other ideas, Mr. Chairman; perhaps we will find a method of coming to terms with fate, which will take little cognisance of Nationalist Afrikanerdom as at present being run. At any rate, Mr. Chairman, let me assure the hon. the Minister that we English-speaking people have no intention of losing our language. I would like all English-speaking people to re-read Keppel Jones&#x2019; book.</p>

<p>I wanted to wait a little before replying, but after this last speech I just want to express my deep disappointment that in this era in which we are living there are still people who call themselves South Africans and who can use the language which was used by the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross). I do not want to make myself guilty of making the same type of speech as the one made by that hon. member, but I want to express my deep disappointment, and I should like to have the assurance, at least from one of the hon. members opposite, that they do not agree with it. I feel that the people of South Africa at this period have had more than enough of artificial divisions between races, and particularly between the two language groups in this country, such as the hon. member for Benoni has been shouting about here like a Rip van Winkel. I just want to give him the assurance that in so far as the Public Service and the language tests in the Public Service are concerned, and in regard to the attempt to achieve bilingualism in the Public Service, there is not a word of truth in the doubts he expressed. I can assure him that it is a difficult task for the Public Service Commission and for everybody concerned with the matter to maintain a proper standard of bilingualism in the Public Service. I must say frankly that strenuous attempts are being made, not to teach English-speaking people Afrikaans, but to teach Afrikaans-speaking people English. There is really an honest attempt to promote bilingualism as far as possible. I want to appeal to this side of the House not to belittle themselves by replying to the allegations made by the hon. member for Benoni. I do not think we should do so. I do not think it is worth while devoting attention to it. We are here to serve a cause, We are not here, like the hon. member, to talk a lot of nonsense and in that way to try to drive in a wedge between Afrikaans and Englishspeaking people. Let us derive political advantage wherever we can, but in Heaven&#x2019;s name let us abstain from making such irresponsible accusations as those made against us by the hon. member for Benoni.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Turffontein apologized to me for not being able to be present to-night because he has another urgent appointment. I accept that. I will reply to him in absentia. He has again quoted a speech of mine from a newspaper. He said it was a Sapa report. I daresay that is so. He just took a small extract from that speech, which I made before the Association of Public Servants. The hon. member, <i>inter alia,</i> directed these words to me: &#x201C;What did you mean by the following words: They should not be servants of the public but servants of the State?&#x201D; Then he himself came to the conclusion that I was propagating a totalitarian state, a Nazi state. He asked me for a clear statement in regard to my policy. I told the hon. member that if he was really so interested I could have given him a copy of my speech. I had a copy with me. What I did at that meeting is this: I told the public servants that on 31 May 1961, we had changed our constitutional Head of State; we changed from a monarchical to a republican form of government. I then sketched what the actual position of the public servants under the monarchical form of government was, viz. allegiance to the Crown, to Her Majesty. I gave a long exposition with which I do not want to weary the House. I pointed out, <i>inter alia,</i> that we were now faced with a new choice. We had always been public servants, and we would now have to decide whether we wanted to remain public servants or whether we wanted to become State officials. Then I made this point, and I should like to read it to you verbatim, Sir. I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We now find ourselves in the camp of the <span class="col_5111-5112" refersTo="page_1182"/>Republican states. As in almost all republican countries, the people are suspicious of the State official. Almost instinctively the political leaders are suspected. The public sets out from the standpoint that the officials are conceited, money-wasting bureaucrats who are always inclined to abuse their power. In Germany the picture is quire different. Here the official has a unique status and prestige. He is in fact the expert. The German still believes in experts. To him the official is the expert in the task of government, rather than the politician, and public opinion regards him with a respect which it grants to nobody else.</block>

<p>Just before that I referred to the State official in France, but that is not so important that I need quote it. I then continued to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As State officials we must decide in which of the two directions we want to go, the French or the German. Do we, in the first place, want to serve the public, render public services and be the servants of the public and be treated by the public as is the case in France, or are we State officials who render services to the State?</block>

<p>Because I referred to the expertness of the German, the accusation was immediately made in some newspapers that I now favoured a Nazi State. I continued to say the following in my speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Have we not now clearly enough got our heimat, our Republic? That is why the Prime Minister, on the evening the banquet was held in Pretoria on 31 May 1961, when he proposed the toast to the State President, said: We give you not only the State President, but together with him the State itself, the Republic of South Africa, not a person to be deified as an individual apart from the country, but a State President, forming part of our country and nation, our heimat and Republic.</block>

<block name="quote">If we therefore do not want to be public servants, but State officials rendering service to the State and handling State property, and maintaining law and order in the name of the State with the State President at our head, then we should not seek to be identified with a fellow human being, as in the United Kingdom, or to serve the public as they do in France, but according to our attained ideal of national endeavour, our newly-born State, the Republic of South Africa. That is what we should strive for with devotion and love. The concept of the State should be our inspiration. In the Public Service one should find the bearers of that ideal. South Africa should become a <i>persona</i> to us, in the sense that word is used in international law. We want to see it take an eminent position in the galaxy of nations.</block>

<p>Those are the lines on which I spoke and if any hon. members are interested I can make this speech available to them. I think it was a very good speech, not because I made it, but I think it was good to see our public servants in this actual light, as being experts who are the co-rulers of our country. I continued to say in this speech that any Minister is dependent on the sound advice and the co-operation of his senior officials and therefore it was absolutely necessary for these people to become State officials, and not simply sit around in an office waiting to serve and help the public. Of course they must serve the public, but to make this gross accusation that there was a Nazi idea behind it. does not reflect favourably on the speech and does not redound to the honour of the public servants themselves. The public servant in South Africa simply has not got that mentality, and why he should allow himself to be led by a Minister who expresses these few ideas is something I cannot understand at all. I am very sorry that half the speech was quoted again and that the whole background of it was not given, and I hope that we will now understand clearly that the only object was to make patriotism the yardstick. One knows what trust-worthiness the civil servant in Great Britain shows, everything in the name of the King or the Queen. It is a well-known fact, and I also mentioned it in my speech, that the police officers in Britain do not go about armed in order to maintain law and order. They maintain law and order in the name of Her Majesty. All that has been built up during the course of the years, and I said that we are republicans and do not idolize any person, neither the State President nor anybody else, but we regard patriotism as the highest motive. That is what should inspire every State official. If I am told that I acted wrongly, then my reply is that I think we should investigate the person who says that, because the fault lies with him.</p>

<p>The hon. member also objected to the statement I am lleged to have made in a speech to the heads of Departments. I am supposed to have said that we lose many members of the staff because public servants feel frustrated. I want to repeat that I warned the Public Service that if they carried on in that way then such a feeling would arise. I said that we must get out of the groove of considering only seniority and promotions being made only on the basis of seniority and that if there was a man with a high intelligence quotient, who showed initiative and the courage to tackle something by himself, then we should not keep that person down, but we should promote him as soon as possible, and that seniority should not be the only yardstick for promotion, and under the merit system which is now applied in the Public Service such a person should be promoted more quickly. There are many things which count as merits. Therefore I repeat that they become frustrated if they have to stay in the same grade for years.</p>

<p><span class="col_5113-5114" refersTo="page_1183"/>The hon. member also felt unhappy about the &#x201C;corrective training He said that in Pretoria alone there were 255 cases, and why do we not apply aptitude tests to these people? Now I want to tell the hon. member that only .3 per cent of officials need that corrective training, and they are not beginners. The people who need this new training are people who have been in the service for a long time; they are alcoholics, and people who have got into debt and people who have had domestic trouble. It is for those people that this is done. It is not intended for the ordinary people who have made mistakes right in the beginning.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) also advocated a joint advisory council and a comprehensive medical scheme. Such a scheme has been investigated already. The Government has investigated, but up to this point the matter has not yet reached finality, but we hope in the near future to reach finality. In regard to the five-day week, the Government has always kept this matter in mind but has not found the time ripe to effect such a change. There are pros and cons, there can be a lot said in favour of it but on the other hand there are weighty disadvantages. [CONTINUED IN AFRIKAANS.]</p>

<p>*I now come to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), who associated herself with the hon. member for Turffontein in regard to equal treatment for women in the Public Service. I just want to tell the hon. member for Drakensberg that equality between male and female public servants has come about in the Public Service to a much greater extent than ever before, and to a much greater extent than she intimated here. I think it would be as well for this Committee to note what has already taken place. For example, there has always been a difference between the pensionable age of a man and a woman, and since 1955 the pensionable age has been the same. In the one category they can also retire at 63 and in the other at 65, just like the men. Where men and women candidates have the same qualifications, commencing salaries are paid which are either equal or as close together as the two relevant salary scales permit. An example of this is the commencing scale of R780 p.a. which is applicable to both matriculated male clerks and female clerks provided the qualifications are the same. I have here a few comparative scales which may perhaps be interesting. I have here the scale of the clerical and administrative divisions. A male clerk is paid on the scale R780 &#x00D7; 60&#x2014;900, which goes up, with increases of R100, to R1,800. A female clerk in the General &#x201C;B&#x201D; Division of the Public Service receives R660 &#x00D7; 60&#x2014;1,320, and a Special Grade female clerk receives R960 &#x00D7; 60&#x2014;1,440-1,520. The required initial qualifications for women&#x2014;and that is where the difference comes in&#x2014;are lower than those for men. The compass of the work of the female posts is also smaller than that of the men. The hon. member advocates equal pay for equal work, and here is an evaluation of the work: The man&#x2019;s requirements are higher and the compass of the woman&#x2019;s work is lower. Where the initial qualification for the woman happens to be the same as that for the man, precisely the same initial salary is paid. Therefore I think we are under a misapprehension in this respect, and the only difference lies in the fact that sometimes a man is expected to have the matriculation qualification, whereas a woman is perhaps expected to have only Std. 8. If the qualifications are the same, they receive absolutely the same salary. Now take a senior clerk. A male senior clerk receives R1,300 &#x00D7; 100&#x2014;1,800, and then again by R120 up to R2,160. A senior female clerk receives R1,260 &#x00D7; 60&#x2014;1,440, and then by increases of R80 to R2,160, precisely the same as in the case of a man, except that she starts with R40 less. But her final salary is the same. Here the compass of work of the male posts and the female posts are reasonably comparable, but the increments of the man are larger than those of the woman because of socio-economic considerations. The type of man who is in the Public Service at that stage is of marriageable age, and the woman who is in the Public Service at that stage probably never intends getting married. Therefore if the hon. member for Drakensberg wants to regard that as &#x201C;madness&#x201D;, then there is method in our madness as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Now I come to the technical division, and here it is absolutely the same. An assistant technical officer, if he is a man, receives R1,300 going up to R2,160, whereas the woman starts at R1,260 and also goes up to R2,160. The initial qualifications are the same and the responsibilities of the man and the woman are regarded as being equal.</p>

<p>But now I come to the higher posts, and here the important point is that the male technical officer receives R2,160 &#x00D7; 120&#x2014;2,640, and the woman receives precisely the same. There is equality in every respect. From this it appears quite clearly that there are sufficient opportunities for the women and a reasonable opportunity to advance if they want to follow a career in the Public Service.</p>

<p>What about the lower grades?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I have mentioned them and said that the initial qualifications for women in the lower grades are lower than those for men. Where the qualifications are equal, the woman receives the same salary. The compass of the work is also smaller.</p>

<p>I really think this misapprehension should now be cleared up. The woman&#x2019;s chances of following a career, as I have set out, are restricted by a few things which the hon. member did not mention. This is particularly the case in respect of women who marry, as the result of the present legal provisions <span class="col_5115-5116" refersTo="page_1184"/>and the policy followed. That is a matter which has often been debated and in regard to which no clarity exists yet. But I want to tell the hon. member further that there are certain posts in the Public Service which are difficult posts, far away from civilization, which the girls do not want to accept, and which one cannot expect them to take. How would a woman fare if, for example, she had to supervise a group of Bantu? How would she like to serve in an untamed malarial area, perhaps in the Forestry Department? They are usually in the more protected posts in the cities and large towns, where there is every opportunity for them, and consequently certain work which is much more difficult has to be done by men.</p>

<p>I could expand on this for a long time still, but I am convinced that this so-called inequality is grossly exaggerated, and that hon. members try to prove a case which really does not exist. I want to ask the hon. member not to come along with Kennedy and people like that, people in highly developed countries, and not to ask us to follow the same road. But we have made much progress. Just compare the position 15 years ago with the position occupied by the woman in the Public Service to-day. There is actually very little difference, and what differences there are are based on logical grounds and for very sound reasons, and they are not merely arbitrary.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I think before we pass this Vote, on behalf of this side of the House I would like to say a word of appreciation so far as the Civil Service is concerned. The position surely is this that throughout the year in the course of our ordinary official duties, we continually come into contact with our civil servants, day after day, week after week, and that brings one to an understanding of the work they are doing, particularly at a time like this when party politics are playing a very important part in our daily lives, and when one sees the cut and thrust as seen here in Parliament day after day, in public meetings and elsewhere, one realizes precisely the responsibility which is so often laid on the shoulders of civil servants to try and steer a middle course between Scylla and Charybdis of the various political parties which are continually threatening their safety, and the work which they have to carry out in an entirely unbiassed manner, as far as possible. So may I say that from this side of the House I would like to express our appreciation of what they have done and the manner in which diplomatically and without giving way to the pressure from one side or the other so far as it is humanly possible they have played their part. I am sorely tempted to say that their task is rendered very much more difficult owing to many of the Ministers whom they serve. I am going to resist the temptation to say that. I leave it at an expression of appreciation of the services they render.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>It is my privilege now on behalf of the civil servants, who cannot speak for themselves here, to thank the hon. member for South Coast for his appreciative words, apart from the last sentence which of course is ruled out of order. I think civil servants are only too pleased to serve under the present Government because we are very appreciative of their good services. I can state here unequivocally that our civil servants have a very difficult task to fulfil and they do it with honour and my experience over the years has been a very pleasant one, and I work with them in harmony whether they are Afrikaans-speaking or English-speaking. I have found them to be very loyal and true and they give their best.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to make two suggestions to the hon. the Minister and they both concern the use of language in the Civil Service. We are all anxious to maintain a high standard of what we call &#x201C;bilingualism&#x201D;. We are anxious that every civil servant should reach as high a standard as possible in the use of the second language. Now I make the suggestion to the hon. the Minister that we should have in every department of the Civil Service one man who is an expert in the use of Afrikaans, and one who is an expert in the use of English. When statements are made to the public, when any statement is issued to the public, perhaps to the whole world, that expert should revise such statement in the department concerned. One cannot expect that every person will reach a high standard of bilingualism, especially in the use of the second language. It is asking too much. Therefore I suggest that there should be such an expert in every department of the Civil Service. There has been much criticism in recent years of the deterioration in the standard of English. There was criticism the other day even in respect of the S.A.B.C. where special care is taken to maintain a high standard in both languages; we have always to be on the <i>qui vive</i> to make sure that there is no deterioration in the standard of our languages. Deterioration is inevitable in a bilingual country unless we are careful. That is my first suggestion. We have information departments; we have numerous information officers. What I think would be more useful than so many information officers would be language experts in the Civil Service to whom a member of a department can go and say: &#x201C;Look over this before I send it out; it is a statement I am making to the Press; or it is a special letter that I am writing. Will you just go over it and make sure that it is up to standard?&#x201D; We must do something of that kind.</p>

<p>My other point is in regard to language tests in the Civil Service. I think it is most unfair to say of a public servant when he is a candidate for a higher post in the service: Yes, he has the seniority, he has the experience, he has the background, but we are <span class="col_5117-5118" refersTo="page_1185"/>not quite sure about the standard he has reached in the languages. We shall have to give him a language test. I think that is unfair. I think what we should do in the Civil Service is this: We should have a series of language tests, say five, perhaps seven; the seventh, the highest test in a language would be in respect of the type of man I described as the expert in the department. You would not expect the civil servants in general to reach that standard. But to every person in the Civil Service you would say: For this post we require the third standard in bilingualism; for another post you would require the fourth standard. For a junior post you would require the first standard which would toe, I suppose, lower language in matriculation. That would be probably Stage I. When we come to the university degree, the man who takes a university degree in both languages, we would regard him probably as of the sixth or perhaps the seventh standard. And the civil servant should be able to take those tests at any time during his service in the department. At the age of 25, if he has the knowledge of languages, he should have passed sufficient language tests to be able to occupy the highest posts in the service. After that what would be required would be experience and knowledge of the working of the service. But you would not say to a man of 45 who is a candidate for one of the plums of the service: We are now going to give you a language test. That I think is unfair. I raised this matter some years ago with the hon. the Minister of Lands when he was Minister of Railways, and the defence the hon. the Minister put up was this: He said that a man might reach a very high standard when he was in the intermediate class at the university, or perhaps his final year, but later on he might have become rusty. I do not think that should apply. I feel that when the man has qualified once, at any period of his life, in the service, he should be regarded for the rest of the time as qualified to occupy a post requiring that grade of bilingualism. It seems to me to be fair. That test would toe applied in the teaching profession. If a man has a university degree, for example in mathematics or science, he would not be required to write examinations in mathematics and science at various periods of his service. Having passed the examinations for a science or a maths degree as a student, he will then be qualified for life. That will remove much of the irritation we have in the service to-day. Many of these men are very disappointed. They feel frustrated in their careers when they are told that at the age of 50 when they are eligible for a new post through seniority and excellent service, they have to pass a language test. I make that appeal to the hon. the Minister. Such a system would remove much of the grievances referred to by the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross). People are very disappointed to-day. They are not anxious to go into the service, because they feel the future is uncertain. I wish to remove that uncertainty and I make those suggestions to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>After the unfortunate speech to which we had to listen a little earlier this evening, one is grateful for the last two speeches from the Opposition benches. Even though we may not agree 100 per cent perhaps with the practicability of the proposals of the hon. member who has just sat down, we do appreciate the spirit in which he spoke. His aim is to obtain the greatest possible degree of bilingualism in the Public Service. I appreciate the spirit in which he spoke. But may I just say this to him: It is clear to every person who enters the Public Service&#x2014;he knows it in advance&#x2014;that in order to be able to make headway in the Public Service he must make himself bilingual to such an extent that he can get promotion. And if he is a sensible person, as we believe all people are who enter the Public Service, in spite of what the hon. member for Benoni said, namely that English-speaking people who enter the Public Service are fools (which I do not believe), he will make himself more and more proficient in the other language as time goes on. I do not believe that in order to be bilingual one has to be equally good in both languages. If an official is able to attend to the public properly in the other language, he complies with what is expected of him by his employer, the State. I go so far as to say that if more representatives of constituencies would only follow that sensible course, we would have fewer unpleasant speeches of the type that we had here this evening. I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) said and pay a tribute to the officials of our State, and I want to pay a tribute in particular to the English-speaking members of our Public Service. I personally know quite a number of English-speaking officials in high executive positions in the Public Service, people who reached the top because they had the will to do so. They did not allow themselves to be stopped by the fact that their home language was the one official language and not the other. I have the greatest respect for those people and I do not believe that they are fools. They are officials of whom we are proud, and they are bilingual to-day. If we want to encourage our young people to enter the Public Service, then the representatives of constituencies here must not make the type of speech that was made here this evening; we should point out to them that as in all other spheres of life, success can also be achieved in the Public Service by means of hard work and a genuine attempt to learn both languages.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself really to another matter. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give his attention to the question of Public Service bursaries. We are very grateful for what has been done by means of Public Service bursaries to give our young men the opportunity to receive training. I believe that <span class="col_5119-5120" refersTo="page_1186"/>the best inheritance that parents can leave their children is to give them as much education as possible. At the same time I believe that what the State is doing to train its young people is the best investment that any State can make in respect of its human material. By means of Public Service bursaries young people are trained to enter the Public Service later on. We frequently find, particularly in the scientific fields, that a young man only discovers after having completed the first year at university that he has more aptitude for and is also more interested in research in some field or other, in which the State will not be able to make use of his services. Although he may be expected perhaps to follow a teacher&#x2019;s course and to take up teaching after the completion of his B grade, he may soon discover that he is more interested in research. He may turn out to be a brilliant student who could be worth a great deal to the country as such, not necessarily the Public Service. But the stumbling block is that he is studying with the aid of a Public Service bursary, and he has the greatest difficulty then in securing his release so as to be able to do post-graduate study. And then he has to pay a very high rate of interest on that bursary loan. The other possibilty is that such a person may complete the course and stay on in the Public Service. But what becomes of him afterwards? He may remain in the Public Service for a few years perhaps and discharge his obligations towards the State, but he may be an outstanding individual: he is enticed away from the Public Service by industry later on and then he leaves the Public Service with rather bad feelings towards the Public Service. I would urge therefore that if in the course of their studies it appears that bursary-holders have more aptitude in a different direction perhaps, they should not be released entirely from their obligations but that an opportunity should be created for them, perhaps by granting further assistance to them at a reasonable rate of interest, to enter a different field. I believe that such a person, even if he does not necessarily enter the service of the State, can nevertheless be a very great asset to the State.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to follow to some extent on the line taken by the hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit). There is one aspect of the State service that does worry me and it applies especially to the type of person whom we consider at the moment is the brain that we are losing. I want to give the hon. the Minister a particular example of what I mean. In Durban we had a man who was considered to be one of the world&#x2019;s specialists in forensic medicine. This man was employed by the Department of Justice and was accepted I think not only as a leading man in this country, but probably as a world authority. He had reached the stage where he had had so much experience in this country that he felt the time had come for him to make a contribution towards the knowledge of people for the future as well and he applied to the Department for permission to do research work with a view to making a contribution towards knowledge for the future. What happened? This man who had gone overseas, to Britain with a view to furthering his knowledge had been lectured by a man who had conducted some 300 post mortems I understand, and it was found, that whilst his teacher had performed some 300 post mortems, this man had done over 3,600. That man has been refused permission to go and do further studies and research with a view to making some contribution towards the future. But what happened then? The Australian Government has given him what he asked of our Government. They have given him four years at the university with full keep for himself and his family plus a salary, on one condition only and that is that having completed that, he will work for the Australian Government for three years. In other words, the Australian Government has been prepared to give that man four years, have been prepared to finance him for four years to do research in order to make a contribution to world knowledge, on the undertaking that he works for them for three years after he has completed his research work. In other words, they are backing him to the hilt. We were not prepared to do that in this country, and that man has been lost to us. This is I think an example of many men, outstanding men, who have been lost to us here through the refusal of the Government through the Public Service Commission or whatever department, to give these men, these outstanding men and scholars, the brains that South Africa needs, the opportunity to do further research work. This man is lost to us, and the hon. the Minister knows, as well as I do, that we have lost too many of this type of man over the last few years. As a matter of fact, we have lost far too many&#x2014;men whom we cannot afford to lose. I quote this as an example&#x2014;an example of a man who was a brilliant scientist and who became lost to us as a result of a straight refusal to allow him to make a contribution&#x2014;which he felt he should make&#x2014;towards the future of knowledge in South Africa and in the world. He was lost because he was refused the right to come temporarily out of the realm of ordinary work into the realm of research. This is the type of case to which the hon. the Minister and his Department should pay particular attention.</p>

He was not a student; his education was completed, and he had reached the point where he wanted to contribute something, where &#x2013; he wanted to plough something back. But he was not allowed to do that. The refusal came not from the Department of Education, Arts and <span class="col_5121-5122" refersTo="page_1187"/>Science, but from the Public Service Commission whose Vote is under discussion at the moment. In any event, I am thankful for having been allowed to bring this case to the notice of the hon. the Minister. It is now for the Minister and his Department to deal with the matter as they deem fit.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the plea which has been made by the hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. smit), and I want to plead more specifically for a more accommodating attitude towards officials who have received their training with the assistance of a Public Service bursary, but who then find it necessary to leave the Public Service before they have served the specified period. South Africa needs trained people in all spheres of our national life, within and outside the Public Service. One cannot get away from the fact that the State also has an obligation in making available trained men. We find that the Public Service Commission lends money to students for training, subject, however, to the condition that when they have completed their training, they have to work for a certain number of years in the Public Service or in some Government institution. The period depends on the size of the loan. What happens in some cases is that these people, before they have served this specified period in the Public Service, receive an offer from a private employer, an offer which is so attractive that they feel obliged to leave the Public Service. In such a case the person concerned is expected to repay the amount of the loan together with 10 per cent interest on it. This is such an inflexible rule that even where a person has served three years and eight months of the requisite period of, say, four years, he is nevertheless required to repay the full sum together with the interest. It so happens also that institutions such as the Western Cape Training College, for example, and similar institutions are not regarded as approved Government institutions where such an official may serve the specified period, in spite of the fact that these institutions are entirely financed by the State. The result is that persons who studied with the aid of Public Service bursaries cannot accept posts in these institutions without having to repay the bursaries. I believe that in this way the door is being shut to deserving and talented young people, who are hit very hard by this arrangement. I want to know whether it is necessary to hit them so hard. In this connection I would plead for a more accommodating attitude therefore.</p>

<p>I should like to enlighten the hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit) and the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) with regard to the matters that they raised here. The hon. member for Parow has created the impression that it is a cruel thing to fall into the hands of the State when one has studied with the assistance of a Public Service bursary. Surely that is not so. Persons are granted bursaries, the size of which depends on the duration of the course of study. When it is borne in mind that these bursaries are granted on the specific condition that if a student is not able to comply with the conditions laid down, that is to say, if he is compelled to break his contract, he has to repay the loan together with interest at the rate of 10 per cent, then it is not a case of being hard as alledged by the hon. member. I want to make use of this opportunity to say that since 1956, when this study bursary scheme was instituted, 1,354 bursaries have been granted, 402 in connection with the teaching profession and 952 in connection with technical posts in the Public Service. In addition to these 1,354 bursaries, a further 390 bursaries have been granted out of funds made available by the various marketing boards. The Government has decided to peg its contribution in this connection to R300,000 in the future. It is true that many complaints are received in connection with the question of repayment, the matter rasied by the hon. member for Parow. In certain cases these complaints are justified. It was necessary, however, to lay down stringent requirements to ensure that people to whom bursaries are granted do not lightly break their contract. After all, it is a very attractive proposition to get the money from the State if one wants to study. But what happens is that fantastic salaries are offered by employers outside the Public Service to people who have received such bursaries, even before they have completed their studies, and it is not fair either just to leave your benefactor in the lurch and to clear out. We cannot allow that. There are other cases, however, where the persons concerned had no intention of breaking their contract and actually spent some time in the Public Service. They are then offered posts in a field in which the State also has an interest&#x2014;for example, in semi-Government institutions such as universities, etc. This whole problem which is created by Public Service bursaries is at present being examined by the Public Service Commission and myself. As a matter of fact, I told the chairman of the Public Service Commission only this morning to submit concrete proposals to me as to how we can reasonably assist people who do not deliberately misuse the opportunities offered to them by the State. The State will have to keep pace with the requirements of other bodies such as Iscor, Sasol, the C.S.I.R., etc., which also provide bursaries. I think in this connection the State is still being too conservative, or let me put it this way that perhaps we can go on being conservative but less strict. The hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) mentioned another type of case, that is to say, the case of a person who is not allowed to do another type of work It is not possible for me to formulate a general policy on the basis of one individual case, and I would invite the hon. member therefore to come and discuss this case with me. It is only in that way that we can become <span class="col_5123-5124" refersTo="page_1188"/>wiser. With regard to the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), I want to say to him that every statement that is issued by a Department is checked by the Translation Bureau. In spite of that certain mistakes may still occur because it is difficult sometimes to regulate everything. I feel nevertheless that there are fewer mistakes than successes. I hope the hon. member will realize that the employment of a person whose sole fuction will be translation would not be justified in every Department. In connection with the question of language tests, I want to say to him that we have already done what he desires. There are six grades of language tests, from Grade 1 to Grade 6. Various grades are prescribed for the different posts. No difficulty is experienced in this connection. There is some difficulty in the case of officials who entered the Service before language tests were instituted. In their case the Government&#x2019;s policy is not to subject such officials to these tests. I also want to give the assurance that we are not out on a witch-hunt as far as the passing of language tests is concerned.</p>

<p>I should like to refer briefly to the work of the Government Printer. Occasionaly one notices that certain printing work is given out by the Government Printer to private firms. For instance, there are periodicals which are issued by the Government with an inscription on the back cover to the effect that they were printed on behalf of the Government Printer by some other printing company. The issue of &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; which has reached me to-day, has, for instance, the inscription &#x201C;Printed for the Government Printer, Pretoria, by Caxton Ltd&#x201D;. Further examples of periodicals printed in this manner are &#x201C;Commando&#x201D;, &#x201C;Farming in South Africa&#x201D;, etc. I should like to know whether wherever it becomes necessary for the Government Printer to have publications printed by private printing companies, the work is given out on tender.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to avail myself of the half-hour privilege. I trust that the calmer atmosphere which now prevails, in contrast with that of a little while ago, will enable me to state and to deal with my case as objectively as possible.</p>

<p>It has become the custom, when a new Minister of Education assumes office, to question him with regard to his policy or other matters falling under his control. I do not propose, however, to do so this evening, for the following reasons: In the first place the present Minister of Education stated his policy in broad outline recently in the course of a speech at Potchefstroom, and we were able to infer from that speech what his policy is going to be in broad outline with reference to education in this country. In the second place, a further opportunity will present itself to the hon. the Minister to explain his policy when the Select Committee, which is at present deliberating on the possibility of instituting an Education Advisory Council, submits its report. In the third place I think it will be very difficult for the present Minister to give an adequate reply in the light of the statements already made by his numerous predecessors. I say that advisedly, because this country will not be able to derive any benefit from a portfolio dealing with such an important and weighty matter as education when we find that education has fallen under no fewer than eight different Ministers within a period of 12 years. As in the case of the present Minister, a few of his predecessors were also professional men, in other words, men with a knowledge of education. The most serious defect, however, is not the fact that some of his predecessors were not educationists, but the fact that within such a short space of time there were so many Ministers in charge of this portfolio. Moreover, the position is that out of these 12 years, this portfolio was occupied for five years by one Minister, which means that 7 different Ministers were in charge of education during the remaining 8 years. That is an unsound state of affairs; even the hon. the Minister will agree with me that is so. I say that irrespective of which party is in power. It is not my intention to talk politics here. In any event, we are pleased that the present incumbent of this portfolio is an educationist, and I want to express the hope that he will at all times and in all circumstances act as an educationist and that no further change will be made in this portfolio until such time as this side of the House takes over the reins of Government in the near future!</p>

<p>In any event, what causes me concern is the fact that an important matter such as education is not regarded as being of sufficient importance to be placed under the control of one Minister. In the present case we find that the hon. the Minister has two portfolios, namely Interior and Education, in other words, two portfolios which are equally important. Humanly speaking I think it is impossible in these circumstances to do justice to both posts. I feel therefore that the time has come for the hon. the Minister to recommend to the hon. the Prime Minister that one of these posts should be given to another Minister.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the hon. the Minister will agree with me in any event that continual changes in this portfolio cannot redound to <span class="col_5125-5126" refersTo="page_1189"/>the benefit of education generally. Indeed the chaos and concern existing at present in respect of certain aspects of education, must be attributed to the fact that all Governments since 1910 have regarded this portfolio, which not only deals with the education of our young people but also with the nation that they will constitute in the future, as one of minor importance. Another unfortunate aspect has always been the attitude that this, that or the other will be done for education provided the funds are available. As the result of this, and sometimes also because of suspicion, sectionalism and pettiness, our universities, for example, suffer because of lack of funds with the result that they cannot appoint the necessary staff or establish the necessary laboratories. A further consequence of this is that the level of education that we aim at cannot be achieved; that sufficient attention cannot be given to students; that the necessary research cannot be undertaken; that the very essential leaders for the future in the cultural, social, economic and other spheres, cannot be prepared for their task.</p>

<p>As far as primary and secondary education is concerned, there is uncertainty with regard to its control. Provincial departments have inadequate funds at their disposal; in primary and secondary education there is divided control and overlapping and half a dozen or even more examination standards. The result is neglect and uncertainty, particularly in the case of the mental deviates. I should like to deal with that subject for a few moments this evening.</p>

<p>Some of these unfortunate children, particularly those with an I.Q. of less than 60, have been left since their birth, because of the uncertainty with regard to their educability or otherwise, to the mercy of their parents, or to the mercy of dedicated men and women. So as not to exceed the time at my disposal, I want to confine myself exclusively now, not to the physically deviate children, although there are many of them, but to the mental deviates. Here we find an unforgiveable state of confusion as the result of divided control. Deviate children with an I.Q. of 60 to 79 fall under the provincial administrations; those with an I.Q. from 80 to 89 fall under the Department of Education, Arts and Science, or are subsidized by this Department. This unhealthy state of affairs, this tug-of-war between the State and the provinces, leads to neglect, overlapping and confusion, and we who sit here as members of Parliament bear the responsibility for it and nobody else. The time has come for us to rectify this matter so that we can hold up our heads again.</p>

<p>The most unfortunate group of mental deviates is the group with an I.Q. below 60&#x2014;the so-called uneducable&#x2014;because that is how we regard them, and we do so on the basis of intelligence tests which we know leave much to be desired and for which there is no scientific basis as yet. On the basis of these tests we say to these unfortunate children that they are uneducable. This unfortunate group, as the hon. the Minister knows, is sub-divided into three groups, that is to say, those with an I.Q. of between 60 and 40; those with an I.Q. of 40 to 25 and those with an I.Q. below 25. These children are left to the love and care of their parents or to the mercy of charity or to the mercy of dedicated men and women. Whatever medical practitioners or whatever psychologists may say, there are very few of these children with an I.Q. below 60 who, through routine education, cannot be educated to do some useful work. But they need special attention for that; they need special devotion; they need specialists to educate them so that they can be guided in a direction in which it will be possible for them to become useful members of the closed or sheltered community in which they are going to find themselves later on. I want to quote one example here. Fourteen days ago a child with an I.Q. of 47 became lost here in Cape Town. He disappeared from his mother and walked down the street. Later on he realized that he had lost his way and began to cry. He crossed the street&#x2014;I questioned him about it later on&#x2014;and walked into a garage which he thought was the garage where his father usually had his motor-car repaired or serviced. He told the people at the garage that he was lost. He furnished his name as well as his residential address. After the garage workers had brought him to the street in which he lived, he led them to his house. Can anyone say that this type of child is not educable&#x2014;Of course he is educable! But he needs special treatment and he must be taught in an environment where he will be able to associate with his equals, that is to say, where he can feel at home and where he can be in a sheltered environment. By the way, it is to this type of child that the Rudolf Steiner Schools, which are viewed with great suspicion in certain circles, devote so much love and attention. I also raised this matter last year and pleaded that attention be given to it. I was pleased therefore to learn from the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare that he had paid a visit to one of these schools, that is to say, the school at Hermanus, and that what he had seen there had impressed him. But what is the attitude of the State towards this group of children who are mental deviates.</p>

<p>As far as I can ascertain only 3 per cent of this year&#x2019;s Budget is being devoted to all education except Bantu education. That compares rather poorly with the percentage which has been allocated to some other Votes. But I do not want to make any comparisons. Only R865,000, that is to say, .104 per cent of the Budget is being devoted to the education of the schools mentioned under J, that is to say, for assistance to State-aided special vocational schools. In other words, this meagre amount has been set aside for physical and mental deviates with an I.Q. above 60. Only R10,000 or &#x00A3;5,000 has been set aside for those with an I.Q. below 60, of whom there <span class="col_5127-5128" refersTo="page_1190"/>are not hundreds but thousands, and there are 19 private institutions which are being run for these children. There are hundreds of them who are never admitted to an institution, and yet only R10,000 or .001 per cent of the Budget, or .04 per cent of the amount to be voted for education, has been set aside for them! I repeat that .04 per cent of the amount to be voted for education, or .001 per cent of the Budget, has been set aside for this purpose. As a privileged individual I must admit that I am ashamed of it. I do not blame anybody. I blame myself as much as I blame anyone of my privileged colleagues for this scandalous state of affairs.</p>

<p>But I want to make an urgent appeal once again, firstly, that a survey be made of all children with an I.Q. of less than 60; secondly, that either the State or the provincial councils should assume full control and carry the full responsibility for the instruction of all deviate children. I am not going to say which Department should do it. To me it does not matter with whom the control rests. I know to whom I would give the control if I were the Minister, but I do not mind who has the control as long as it is in the hands of someone and as long as there is not divided control; thirdly, that scientific research should be undertaken into the educability or otherwise of the low-grade deviates, in other words, those with an I.Q. of less than 60, and that there should be a further revision and improvement of the intelligence tests; fourthly, that the necessary support should be given to those institutions which are performing miracles at present with this type of child, the so-called Mongolian. Mr. Chairman, I have no personal interest in this matter. I have no children or relatives in any of these schools, but it is our duty to do something for these people and for these institutions, which devote their energies to the education of the lower class of deviates particularly so as to enable them to assist these unfortunate children. I refer particularly to the Rudolf Steiner school at Hermanus, at Lakeside in Port Elizabeth, and Gresset in Johannesburg, where these children are being trained on the same basis on which children are being trained in England. Rhodesia has the same type of school, and do you know, Sir, what the contribution is there? R60,000 per annum, in comparison with R10,000 here. Let us see what happens in England and how much importance they attach there to this type of child. Contributions are made there from four quarters to assist deviate children, there are four sources of income for them and the average contribution per annum per child amounts to &#x00A3;485. In the first place the Department of Health makes a contribution; secondly, the local educational body pays the full fee of every child whom they advise to go there and of whom they cannot take care themselves; thirdly, the Department of Labour, for example, pays the wages of those who are placed in sheltered employment once they have been through the school, and fourthly, the State contributes to meet the cost of the apparatus that is used in connection with the training of this type of child. That is how much importance the authorities in England attach to this matter.</p>

<p>Here I should like to refer to a certain report. I have referred to research in connection with this matter. In England a survey was made by a Royal Commission which sat for three years to investigate this question of children with an I.Q. of less than 60. The Commission reported in 1957. I want to quote their main recommendations just briefly, because I cannot state the case better than they themselves did. Amongst other things they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Firstly, there should be a general reorientation away from institutional care in its present form and towards community care. This would result in an expansion of services including: (a) Provision of adequate training facilities either in centres or at home for severely sub-normal children who are unable to benefit from education at school; (b) provision of any necessary further training after leaving school for young people who, on account of their mental condition, cannot be catered for under other general vocational training services; (c) provision of occupational or training centres, sheltered workshops and social centres for adults, severely sub-normal or psychopathic patients or patients with residual disability after mental illness who cannot be catered for under the general rehabilitation services for disabled persons. While local authorities should have considerable freedom to decide the range of training to be provided within the school system&#x2026; the procedures and terminology used should be revised.</block>

<p>That is what I would advise for this country too&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Children should not be reported as &#x201C;incapable of receiving education at school&#x201D;, but should be &#x201C;recommended for training&#x201D; in a training centre or in hospital for so long as the appropriate authority in consultation consider it desirable. Thirdly, new administrative arrangements are needed for the diagnosis and periodical re-assessment of severely sub-normal and psychopathic patients and for consultation between local authority and hospital staff on the choice of the form of care most suited for individual patients.</block>

<p>I feel very strongly that this type of unfortunate child with an I.Q. of less than 60 should fall under the Department of Education and not under the Department of Health. This whole broad mass of children with an I. Q. of less than 60 ought to be the responsibility of the Department of Education, except of course, those with an I.Q. of less than 25, because we admit that they are not educable. <span class="col_5129-5130" refersTo="page_1191"/>I feel that this is not a health problem in the first instance but an educational problem, a psychological problem, and it is our duty, with the co-operation of medical practitioners, of the hospitals and of the psychiatrists, to see to it that children of this kind receive instruction in a sheltered atmosphere, where they can be alone and happy together but where they can also learn to do useful work in the circle in which they find themselves and where they can keep each other busy in their own way and live together happily&#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#mostert">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>I have sat here listening attentively and asked myself the following question: Why does the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) plead for those children? Only one thing can make such a child happy and that is to achieve something. Every person who feels aggrieved, who finds himself in an unfavourable position, can only overcome that feling of loneliness and abandonment, that feeling of injustice, if he achieves something; a wonderful plea has been made here to-night for those children, of whom there are many, children who cannot achieve anything because they are not guided and assisted to do so. Traditionally society is merciless. People jeer at a family if a member of that family is mentally defective or retarded or deformed. They will not uplift him; they jeer at him. I also want to plead for a section of our youth to-night, Sir, in the ten minutes which I have at my disposal. But before doing so, I wish to express my appreciation to the hon. member for Hillbrow for the calm and exemplary way in which he has dealt with these educational matters. I have recently often been in contact with him where we have dealt with educational matters of the utmost importance, and I have found his approach to be a very good one, and I have found him desirous of assisting me with my problems. The House does not know about that; this Committee does not know about it, but we hope that the day will soon arrive when a new dawn will break for education. We really cannot continue as we have been doing. After any upheaval in the history of a country, such as a war, every big country usually tackles the question of education first and it reorganizes its system of education. That happened in Germany after the last war and Germany has a tremendous advantage over other countries in the economic field and every other field because she tackled the question of education immediately. England underwent a reform in 1902, as well as in 1919, and in 1944&#x2014;hostilities had not as yet ceased&#x2014;that very important Butler Act was passed, a historical occurrence of the utmost importance to England. During her most critical years, when they groped about in the dark in the political sphere. France was quick to put her educational household in order. We need not even mention what was done in Russia and Red China. Let me say at once that we anti-communists are always inclined only to revile those countries without knowing what is happening there in the field of education, but we can use them as an example. America, however, did not do so and when the first sputnik was launched the Americans said &#x201C;I told you so. Didn&#x2019;t I tell you so?&#x201D;, but it was too late. Only then did they fall over each other to smarten up their educational system. To-day they are conducting one investigation after another as to how to smarten up their educational system, but it is difficult to do so to-day. We have waited 14 years and during those 14 years we have not adapted our system of education or reformed it to any extent worth mentioning. I do not want to go into the reasons. Many of the reasons were due to circumstances, but I do feel that something should be done to tackle the whole approach to education. I am even more enthusiastic to-day because the hon. the Minister feels the same way about the matter and because he is so anxious to bring about the necessary reform.</p>

<p>When I talk about an approach there is something I want to mention. You read in practically every newspaper, Sir, that the challenge is there and that we must accept the challenge; a new era is approaching and it challenges us. Technology is a challenge to us and we must accept it. That, however, is a totally wrong approach. We must not wait for the challenge to be issued and then adopt a defensive attitude. We must challenge. The youth must adopt a challenging attitude. The youth must throw down the glove to those problems. You must not wait for the problem to arise and then say you accept the challenge. Psychologically that approach is totally wrong. There is another approach. Hon. members are pleading in this House for more technologists and more technological training, for scientific training; we must keep ahead, but what about the soul of the nation? What about its language and its religion and those things that are sacred to it? Must those be ignored? In 1950 and again in 1958 I pleaded and asked that a balance should be struck between the arts and the sciences, between the deeper psychological things and technology, and the public seems to have gone mad over technology. There must be a reaction to the increasing spirit of materialism in the world, and we will only get that reaction when full value is again attached in our schools and in our universities to the nobler things. One does not only consist of a body and a pair of hands, Sir. You have a mind, but you have more than a mind; you have emotions and a spirit. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me when I plead to-night for more expert spiritual hygiene in our educational system, not merely a little bit of psychology psychopathology. The days of those esteemed men like Jung and Freud are past. You can practically expect something new in the field of education every morning you open your eyes. Take the intelligence quotient. It has been proved in the <span class="col_5131-5132" refersTo="page_1192"/>Transvaal by figures that the Afrikaner is less intelligent that the Englishman. [Interjections.] That has been the result of faithful adherence to formulae. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not devote much time to discussing what the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) has given us in his inspiring address. I should like to come a little nearer to the Vote. I think my first duty this evening is to congratulate the Department of Education, Arts and Science on having produced its annual report in time for it to be discussed under this Vote. This Department is exemplary in the production of its annual report. Some departments produce annual reports two or three years after the end of the calendar year. Here we have a report for the calendar year 1961 in our hands a week or two before the Vote comes up for discussion. I think that is a matter for congratulation, and the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) suggests that they should be put in charge of the Press Commission forthwith. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>I should like to refer to one or two items in the report and also in the Estimates, but before I do so I should like to mention a most unfortunate period through which the Department passed last year when there seemed to be leakages in examinations. There is reference to this in the report, though very briefly, but I think this is an opportunity for the Minister to tell the House and the country what has happened, because only in that way can we restore confidence. Secrecy in the conduct of examinations is very important and I should like the Minister to make a statement when he speaks in this debate.</p>

<p>Now I should like to refer to one or two items in the report. I refer to page 25, to the Nautical Training Advisory Board. That is an important board, and this is the report.</p>

<p>No meeting of the Board was held during the current year. Now we come to page 27 and find that a committee of inquiry into nautical training is sitting. I think that is a very important committee of inquiry. It is going to discuss the present system of nautical training in Cape Town and in the &#x201C;General Botha&#x201D;, and the need to train skippers and mates for the fishing industry, in the smaller craft. I think this is very important. But why has the Board not met during the year?</p>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister whether provision is being made for training Coloured seamen? South Africa is a country which depends on its small ships&#x2014;its little ships, as they say in the British Navy. The hon. the Minister of Defence has now come in at an opportune moment, because in future he will have to look for trained seamen to man his Naval ships. It is from the fishing fleet that we get the seamen for our little ships.</p>

<p>My second point is this. There is another committee, the National Theatre Organization. It is referred to on page 23, and again on page 28. In this case as well a committee of in quiry into the N.T.O. has been appointed by the Minister. At the request of the N.T.O. a committee has been appointed, with the following terms of reference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To investigate the functions of the National Theatre Organization and in the light of its findings to submit such recommendations as are considered to be effective.</block>

<p>Now it seems that all is not well with the N.T.O. It is heavily financed by the Government. Last year, and again this year, the subsidy was R60,000. That is a very big subsidy. I should like to know whether this N.T.O. has realized the expectations with which it was founded. We have all read what that great actor, the late Andre Huguenet, had to say about the development of the Afrikaans theatre. My impression is that the English theatre in South Africa is flourishing and it is not subsidized. I do not think one can do a great deal by subsidizing a National Theatre Organization; something more is required. But there was life in the Afrikaans theatre 20 or 30 years ago. Subsidizing has not assisted in giving us the results we looked forward to. Now, next to the N.T.O., on the same page, is an item &#x201C;Performing Artistes, R100,000&#x201D;. I am not sure what this item, &#x201C;Performing Artistes&#x201D;, is. I should like to ask the Minister whether provision is made for assisting by a subsidy the Eoan Group of Coloured people in Cape Town. I do not know whether the Minister subsidizes that group, but I do not think the Minister can afford not to subsidize it, because it is a source of very great pride to South Africa. [Interjection.] I should like to know what and who are being subsidized under this item, and I again mention the Eoan Group. Those of us who saw &#x201C;La Traviata&#x201D; and the other productions recently realize that this is something of which South Africa can be very proud. I hope the Minister is doing something to assist those people, because they are dependent on guarantees here in Cape Town. They are doing most valuable work amongst the Coloured people, and I hope we are not going to hear the objection we heard some few years ago that they could not be subsidized because they played to mixed audiences of Coloureds and Whites. Because Coloureds and Whites sit together in the audience looking at Coloured performers, is no reason why the group should not be subsidized, but that was the argument raised here some years ago. I hope we have grown beyond that now.</p>

<p>The next item I wish to refer to is Community Theatres, R48,000. Now, these are very heavy subsidies for art and for the interest in the development of art in South Africa. I hope they are yielding the results we expect from them. The next item to which I wish to refer is audio-visual education, on page 112, Item &#x201C;A&#x201D;. That is part of the Department of Education. Television in education is used to a great extent in education in Europe, but that is not what we are discussing <span class="col_5133-5134" refersTo="page_1193"/>at the moment. I should like the Minister to tell us something about how audio-visual education is being conducted and subsidized in South Africa, what apparatus is being used, and how that apparatus is obtained. I am covering the ground as rapidly as I can, because there are many important speakers on this side who wish to come into this debate.</p>

<p>The next item I should like some enlightenment on is Item &#x201C;K&#x201D; on page 118, Miscellaneous Grants-in-Aid, Africa Institute. Here is an item subsidized last year, and again this year, by R26,000. Now we have received publications by the Africa Institute and I should like to know why this organization is privileged to receive this very large grant. Does the Minister subsidize the Institute of Race Relations? [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>There is just a short time left before we have to adjourn, but there are two sub-heads to which I should like to refer under this Vote. The one is F, &#x201C;Archives&#x201D;, and here I want to urge that if and when there are valuable archives which are privately owned and which the owners would only be prepared to relinquish upon payment of compensation, sympathetic consideration should be given by the Government to the provision of the necessary funds for that purpose. Unless that is done we run the risk that important facets of our history may become lost to posterity. But apart from that, the time is overdue for steps to be taken to ensure that documents which belong in the Archives, find their way to the Archives and not to other places. Here I am thinking, for example, of the valuable archives of Hoogenhout, of Eerste Taalbeweging (First Language Movement) fame, which was recently obtained by the Library Services of the Cape Provincial Administration. It is by no means clear to me on what grounds such a step can be justified, since the library service in question has no archives or reference function to fulfil. Why should this Library Service have funds for such a purpose while the S.A. State Library in Cape Town or in Pretoria has no funds for that purpose? I should like the Minister to reply to these questions. There is another matter that I am going to bring to his notice in the course of this debate under sub-head L, &#x201C;Libraries&#x201D;. But here I am pleading for better co-ordination between the Central Government and the Provincial Administrations as far as the purchase of documents of this kind is concerned, and later on I shall produce evidence to show what happened and how unsound the present position is.</p>

<p>At 10.25 p.m. the Chairman stated that, in accordance with Standing Order No. 26 (1), he would report progress and ask leave to sit again.</p>
