<p>Yes.</p>

<p>(a) and (c) The purpose of the circular is evident from the contents of the circular, which reads as follows:</p>

<p>Department of Education, Arts and Science,</p>

<p>Private Bag 122,</p>

<p>Ref. No. B.5/9 Pretoria.</p>

<p>7 May 1962.</p>

<p><i>Confidential.</i></p>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

<p><i>Invitation to Overseas Sportsmen and Sports Teams.</i></p>

<p>Several cases recently occurred where invitations were extended to overseas sportsmen and sports teams to participate in sporting events in South Africa, without previous consultation with the Government. This Department, as the Department responsible for physical education in South Africa, wishes to impress on your Association and its affiliated bodies the necessity of consulting the Department of the Interior before extending such invitations.</p>

<p>In the first place, visitors from most countries must obtain visas from the Department of the Interior before they may enter the Republic. Each case is decided on its merits, and if prospective hosts will, before extending an invitation or giving publicity to a possible invitation, ensure that the persons concerned will be admitted to South Africa, they will obviate embarrassment both for the Government and for themselves. They may thus also save their prospective guests disappointment and perhaps the expense of preparing for a visit which has to be cancelled later.</p>

<p>For these reasons the Department appeals to all national sports associations and their affiliated bodies to co-operate with the Government in this important matter and to consult the Department of the Interior before entering into negotiations which may eventually lead to an invitation to overseas sportsmen or sports teams to visit the Republic.</p>

<p>Your faithfully,</p>

<p>(Sgd.) P. Grobbelaar.</p>

<p>(for) Secretary for Education, Arts and Science.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<p>Whether he has received any communication from the International Civil Aviation Organization in regard to the establishment of a regional office in Africa; and, if so, what was the reply of the Government.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#eaton">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<p>Yes. The approach from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) made it clear that the emergence of many newly independent states in Africa and ICAO&#x2019;s wish to assist these states to a greater extent than is possible under existing arrangements made the establishment of an ICAO regional office desirable.</p>

<p>ICAO also indicated that the office should be so sited that it is close geographically to the states to be assisted and for this reason and for reasons of convenience and efficiency ICAO has come to the tentative conclusion that only Accra (Ghana), Dakar (Senegal) and Lagos (Nigeria) merit further consideration. The matter is still being studied by ICAO.</p>

<p>The Government of South Africa has indicated its agreement with the principle that the geographic position of the office must be the first consideration but has expressed no preference as to the exact location.</p>

<heading>NATIONALITY, VISA REQUIREMENTS AND CONTROL OF PERSONS ENTERING AND/OR LEAVING THE REPUBLIC</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like, with leave, to make a statement in regard to the negotiations which have taken place between the South African Government and the United Kingdom Government, which read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my statement to the House on 26 February in connection with the negotiations proceeding between the South African and United Kingdom Governments for the purpose of regulating the future relations between our two countries, I mentioned, <i>inter alia</i>, that some matters affecting these relations would require amending legislation during the present Session of Parliament and that full details would be given when such legislation was introduced.</block>

<block name="quote">Certain Bills have already been presented to the House, namely, in connection with extradition; the control of radio activities; and to provide for securing the evidence of persons in the Republic by Courts of Law in and outside the Republic. The remaining matters requiring amending legislation during the present Session will be dealt with in an Omnibus Bill which will be introduced towards the end of this month.</block>

<block name="quote">There are however certain matters which, while they will be provided for in the Omnibus Bill, are of such a nature that, in view of the fact that the standstill arrangement between the Republic and the United Kingdom will soon expire, it is necessary to inform the House of the Government&#x2019;s intentions in regard to such matters without further delay. I refer specifically to matters such as nationality, visa requirements, and the control of persons entering and&#x002F;or leaving the Republic.</block>

<block name="quote">As regards these the Government&#x2019;s intentions may be summarized in certain basic rules, which it is proposed should operate <span class="col_5921-5922" refersTo="page_0207"/>in future in respect of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. I would add that, because of traditional relationships, these rules also form the basis of the arrangements which the South African Government contemplates in respect of citizens of certain other Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Republic of Ireland is also included in the contemplated arrangements. Until such time as our negotiations with these countries have been brought to finality, it is the intention to treat their citizens on the same basis as citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies.</block>

<block name="quote">In my previous statement I said that, as from 31 May 1962, all persons who are not South African citizens will have the status of aliens. It is therefore proposed that the citizens of these countries will henceforth acquire South African citizenship by naturalization instead of by registration. The residential qualification in respect of all aliens will, however, be reduced from six years (as at present in the case of naturalization) to five years (as at present in the case of registration).</block>

<block name="quote">The South African Government regards loyalty as basic to the concept of South African citizenship. It will require from all its citizens a single undivided loyalty to the Republic. Consequently, nationals of other countries acquiring South African citizenship by naturalization will, as from 31 May 1962, be required to take an oath of allegiance which, <i>inter alia</i>, will provide for renunciation of allegiance to any other country or external authority.</block>

<block name="quote">Furthermore, South African citizens who, as the result of the laws of another country, are regarded also by that country as its nationals, will, as from 31 May 1963, be liable to be deprived of their South African citizenship if by any voluntary act on their part they avail themselves of the benefits deriving from their second nationality in a manner which is inconsistent with their undivided loyalty to the Republic or which is in conflict with its laws.</block>

<block name="quote">In terms of the present provisions of the South African Citizenship Act, certain citizens who acquired South African citizenship during their minority other than by birth or descent, may, on reaching majority, renounce their South African citizenship. There is however no provision in the Act which permits a person who has dual nationality and who is also a South African citizen by birth, descent, registration or naturalization, voluntarily to renounce his or her South African citizenship. In future undivided loyalty to the Republic will be expected from all South African citizens, and any person who feels that he or she is unable to comply with this requirement will be given an opportunity voluntarily to renounce his or her South African citizenship. At the same time, since the Government cannot be instrumental in making any person stateless, South African citizens who wish to renounce their South African citizenship will be required to submit proof of their citizenship of another country.</block>

<block name="quote">British subjects in the service of the Republic will not be disqualified from such service by reason of their British nationality, i.e. by reason of their now legally becoming aliens. If South African citizenship should henceforth be a requisite for further employment, or for the carrying on of any profession or occupation, they will be given the opportunity until 31 December 1965 to acquire South African citizenship. This concession will, of course, be subject to the principle of reciprocity.</block>

<block name="quote">The existing visa regulations applicable to the citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies, and the other countries mentioned earlier, will remain unchanged. This will, however, not apply to the High Commission Territories, in respect of which a different arrangement is contemplated, the details of which are still being worked out.</block>

<block name="quote">In my statement to the House of 26 February, I mentioned that the Government would be prepared to make available in South Africa opportunities for employment of the inhabitants of the three High Commission Territories, subject, however, to the employment needs of the Republic&#x2019;s own citizens. I then foreshadowed the introduction of some form of influx control and&#x002F;or employment control. This is still the position, and at this stage I can say no more than that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to take the necessary measures for controlling or regulating the movement of persons, in both directions, between the Republic and the High Commission Territories.</block>

<block name="quote">As regards the admission to the Republic for temporary visits of citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the Republic of Ireland, the existing position (in so far as it relates to visa arrangements and admission without Aliens Temporary Permits) will remain undisturbed. With this in mind, the Government intends amending the Aliens Act in order to empower the Minister of the Interior to grant (and, if necessary, subsequently to withdraw) exemption from the Aliens Temporary Permit requirement to certain individuals or groups of persons who are in the Republic on 31 May 1962, or who, after that date, enter the country.</block>

<block name="quote">All aliens who wish to come to South Africa for permanent residence will, with effect from 31 May 1962, have to comply with the prescribed immigrants&#x2019; selection procedure. This procedure has been considerably simplified, and can now, to a large extent, take place beyond the Republic&#x2019;s borders.</block>

<block name="quote">As far as the control of aliens is concerned the position will be as follows:</block>

<block name="quote">As from 1 January 1963 temporary visitors <span class="col_5923-5924" refersTo="page_0208"/>from the United Kingdom and colonies, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the Republic of Ireland will have to register as aliens; so also temporary visitors already in the Republic, with this proviso, however, that the term &#x201C;temporary visitor&#x201D; will not include any person who comes to South Africa on a <i>bona fide</i> visit of six months or less.</block>

<block name="quote">As from 1 January 1963, persons entering the Republic for permanent residence will have to register as aliens on arrival.</block>

<block name="quote">Persons who are already in the Republic as permanent residents or who enter the Republic before 1 January 1963 for permanent residence and also those who, before 1 January 1963, come as temporary visitors and are thereafter granted permanent residence, will be required to report before that date to a passport office or to any other such office as may be decided upon and the fact that they are permanent residents in the country will then be noted in their passports. If they are no longer in possession of passports, certificates to that effect will be issued to them.</block>

<block name="quote">All persons who have entered or who enter the Republic for permanent residence before 1 January 1963, and who are able to comply with the necessary residential qualification, will have to apply for naturalization as South African citizens before 1 January 1966. Failure to do so will have as effect that as from 1 January 1966 they will be obliged to register as aliens.</block>

<block name="quote">Persons who enter the Republic for permanent residence before 1 January 1963, and who are not able to comply with the residential qualification for naturalization on 1 January 1966, will be exempted from aliens registration until such time as they have acquired the necessary residential qualification.</block>

<block name="quote">All aliens who register as aliens will be exempted from the requirements to notify changes of address.</block>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill amends various Railway Acts. The matters dealt with are not contentious and should receive the support of the House. I have tabled a very comprehensive memorandum which not only explains the different clauses but which also give the reasons for the introduction of this Bill, and I trust that hon. members have studied the memorandum. I will consequently make my remarks very short.</p>

<p>Clause 1 is designed to facilitate administrative work. Clauses 2 and 3 benefit certain servants who will receive gratuities or annuities upon retirement. Clause 4 deals with a line of railway to which Parliament agreed in 1956; it is a line of railway between Avoiding Line Junction, Cape Town, and Nyanga. This railway line will still be provided but a portion between the avoiding line junction, Cape Town, and Woltemade will be integrated with existing lines of railways, and the construction may take place without the authority and a special Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with definitions. Clause 6 (a) is consequential. Paragraph (b) has been inserted because the original provision served no practical purpose. Clause 7 is designed to protect the Administration&#x2019;s interest and to remedy certain weaknesses in the present provisions. Clause 8 empowers the Administration to supply Bantu servants with intoxicating liquor while a resident in hostels and compounds. Clause 9 protects the Administration as well as the public. Clause 10 is to bring the Act into line with South Africa&#x2019;s new status while protecting Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland citizens who are already in the service.</p>

<p>Clause 11 deals with leave standing to the credit of certain female servants at the date of retirement. This provision is to the advantage of those female servants. Clause 12 merely provides that the Act shall apply to the territory of South West Africa and Clause 13 is the short title of the Act. Those are the provisions of the Bill; they are not contentious and I hope that they will receive the support of the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>When, in the House of Lords on 8 May, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport moved the second reading of a Transport Bill, he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Lords, after that little piece of excitement it is my task to move that this Bill standing on the Order Paper in my name &#x2026; be read a second time.</block>

<p>That &#x201C;little piece of excitement&#x201D; in the House of Lords, to which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport referred, was the South Africa Bill which was being introduced there. It is rather a strange coincidence that, in this Bill which the Minister of Transport has put before us now, we find the first attempt by our Government to regularize, on a reciprocal basis, the special facilities being given to newly made &#x201C;foreigners&#x201D; who had once been privileged Commonwealth and British citizens in South Africa. In the Republic they now become foreigners under Clause 10 of this Bill. It is rather strange that, in our House also, the Bill to allow them to retain, until 1966, the privileges of South African citizens should have followed the statement just made by the Minister of External Affairs&#x2014;also a &#x201C;little piece of excitement&#x201D; of a similar nature. May I say, before I examine the other clauses of this Railway and Harbours Acts Amendment Bill that, although it is no fault of the Minister&#x2019;s, who does seek to extend to certain foreign Railway servants, in legislative form, the reciprocal arrangements which have been arrived at by negotiation between the two Governments, this is rather an unsatisfactory method of dealing with this problem. I feel that the more correct procedure would have been to wait until the situation in all its various facets could have been dealt with in one Bill and not sprung upon us by ministerial statement and in a piecemeal and sectionalized form as in this Railway Bill. I know that the Minister is not to blame for this. This Bill is at least regularizing for three and a half years the position of Railway servants and bringing their status up to date with British legislation. But I do feel that we should register a protest at this slip-shod method of dealing with the important reciprocal nationality and citizenship arrangements. I note another thing, Sir. Apparently only to-day did the South Africa Bill, in its final form, pass through the British Houses of Parliament. Only this morning did we learn the exact time limit to citizenship privileges to be enjoyed by South Africans who are in the service of the British Government and semi-Government service. It is only really to-day that we knew finally that the terminal date for mutual concessions would not be extended to the end of 1966 instead of 1965. This Bill was printed some days ago and I wonder how the Minister knew that the British Bill was not going to extend the period by one more year. There were extensive debates in the Commons and the Lords asking for an extension to the end of 1966. The Minister must have possessed some prescient faculty to know in exactly what form the British Bill would actually be passed. If an amendment had been accepted in the House of Lords the &#x201C;reciprocal&#x201D; arrangements which he makes in this Bill would not have coincided with those of Britain. &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from><span class="col_5927-5928" refersTo="page_0210"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I think it was a shot in the dark. May I say that I am sorry that the extra year of grace was not granted in England. If it had I would have moved that it be granted here too.</p>

<p>Let me take this Bill clause by clause. As the Minister says, because of this very full explanatory memorandum, it will not be necessary to deal with each clause in detail. May I say that this explanatory memorandum is better than any of those previously issued. It explains amendments meticulously. Members are left knowledgeably informed about the meaning of every single amendment. Clause 1 deals with a delegation of financial authority. I have always been one who has objected to any form of delegation, if there is no sufficient parliamentary safeguard. In this case, however, I believe the clause to contain a justified delegation of financial authority by the Minister to the General Manager. All the necessary financial checks and balances which Parliament needs are present. It seems to me a very necessary administrative change in keeping with the changing condition of our economy. As we all know, and as the explanatory memorandum says, the increased cost of materials and the decreasing value of money make it realistic that the expenditure which can be authorized by the General Manager, without reference to the Minister, for new works or improvements, should be doubled. It will in future be R10,000 instead of the unrealistic figure, fixed as far back as 1918, of R5,000 (or then &#x00A3;2,500). I concur also in the case of excesses of more than 10 per cent on approved amounts, that the Minister&#x2019;s authority need not be sought unless the additional amount required for a particular work exceeds R20,000. That is a necessary change and will assist the Administration.</p>

<p>Clause 2 merely regularizes pension matters in relation to casual labourers and those who are getting gratuities. As far as Clause 4 is concerned, we have no quarrel with the amendment. We know the complexities that arise when new lines of &#x201C;guaranteed&#x201D; railway have to pass over the ordinary regular service lines for part of their distance. In this case the building of the line to Nyanga was a complicated performance, and I guess that is one of the reasons why the Minister took such a long time to arrive at a correct formula as to what the Treasury should pay to the Transport Department for this guaranteed line to the Native location.</p>

<p>Clause 5 relates to definitions, and we have no comment to make on it. Clause 6 of the Bill is also a necessary clause. I believe it has been the common practice for every master of every ship on entering Table Bay to be handed a copy of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management Consolidation Act of 1957, which, I am sure, they could not understand. Even if they did understand it they would not have the time to read it. They have agents here who are perfectly well aware of the regulations. The distribution of copies of this Act is wasteful, and I am glad it is going to be done away with now. Clause 7 of the Bill also seems to be necessary. It will ensure that in fact proper rates are charged for the appropriate commodities consigned to the railways and that no wrong advantage is taken of an intimate knowledge of the rating system to avoid the consequences of what is described as a &#x201C;misdescription of the nature of the goods&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Clause 8 of the Bill merely relates to &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D; beer, Bantu beer, or whatever the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) cares to call it. It merely gives the Railways the same rights and privileges which, I believe, the mines and the municipalities have. The beer will be bought, I take it, from the municipality if that local authority can supply it; otherwise the Railways take the right to brew the beer themselves. The net profits derived from the sale of liquor to Bantu servants goes into a fund for the benefit of the Bantu employees. Clause 9 of the Bill deals with claims. I think it is necessary that no evasion of responsibility in connection with the lodgment of claims should be possible. It makes the lodgment of a late claim dependent upon the court being satisfied both (a) that the claimant has not been dilatory and (b) that the Railway Administration will not be prejudiced.

Clause 10 deals with the situation regarding reciprocal legislation passed by the British Parliament. I need say no more than I have said in my opening remarks in that regard. As far as Clause 11 is concerned, we agree to it, of course, because it does regularize the position and prevents inequalities taking place in relation to the pensions of female employees of the Railways. I am sure that this side of the House, although some other hon. members may have something to say, will agree to the second reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill deal with certain superannuation matters, and in order to have the position on record I would like to quote what is said in the explanatory memorandum because of the considerable correspondence which I have received and still receive in connection with this particular aspect of the workings of the Railways. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of consolidating the balance of the cost-of-living allowance with basic salaries and wages, the pension benefits payable from the superannuation funds to European servants in the lower grades were increased on an average by approximately 30 per cent.</block>

<p>In order to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, therefore, it is necessary to provide for a corresponding increase in the amount of the gratuity or annuity payable to certain servants of the Administration in terms of the Railways and Harbours Pensions Amendment Act, 1941, and it is with this end in view that the amendments to Section 3 and 4 of this Act are being made.</p>

<p><span class="col_5929-5930" refersTo="page_0211"/>I do not think we have any grouse at the Minister for having introduced these amendments; I think that it is very necessary indeed. But perhaps the hon. the Minister should take this opportunity of informing the House as to whether any further legislation is going to be introduced this Session to provide for retrospective benefits to servants who wish to pay arrear contributions so as to obtain the full benefit of consolidation before retirement. This is a very important issue; it affects a great number of railway servants who are about to retire, and judging by the correspondence which I am receiving it is quite clear that the Minister must be receiving many requests also from his railway servants. I thought I would take this opportunity of asking the Minister whether he would be so good as to give the House whatever information he has in regard to the possibility of introducing further legislation this Session to give effect to the requests that are coming from so many railway servants.</p>

<p>I merely want to ask the Minister a short question in relation to the sale of Bantu beer. Clause 8 (5) deals with the net profits to be paid into the Benevolent Fund. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The net profits derived by the Administration from the sale of intoxicating liquor &#x2026; shall be applied to the purposes of those funds in such manner as in the opinion of the Administration will best serve the interests of its non-European servants.</block>

As the Bill reads, &#x201C;non-European servants&#x201D; may be Coloureds, Asiatics or any other group of non-Whites. I shall be glad if the Minister will assure the House that the profits will only be spent on the Bantu employees, and also if he will tell us why the Bill reads &#x201C;non-European servants&#x201D; and not &#x201C;Bantu servants&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I appreciate the support of hon. members for this Bill. In reply to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana I can only say to my regret that no legislation will be introduced this Session; the matter will be left in abeyance, probably until next session. The hon. member knows that I have given an indication that there is a possibility that wage improvements may be granted before the end of the year; it all depends on what the conditions are and if nothing unforeseen happens. It was felt that that matter should be finalized before this particular aspect of the pension question is dealt with.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) I can only say that we have deliberately inserted &#x201C;non-European servants&#x201D;, but the net profits derived from the sale of Bantu beer will mainly be applied to Bantu servants; that also applies to the profits derived from the sale of other intoxicating liquor. But if it does happen that other non-European servants are also accommodated in the hostels and if the Administration also supplies them with intoxicating liquor, then of course they must also receive some benefit out of the profits made on the sale of that liquor.</p></speech>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the half-hour? Sir, the economic development of the country as a whole is undoubtedly a collective Cabinet responsibility, but I think, as the hon. the Minister himself has repeatedly pointed out in the past, if we are to look to a rapid economic growth in the future with rising standards of living, the prime factor that will bring that about is industrialization in South Africa. I think the Minister has made that point himself. Hitherto we have been fortunate in having had a rapid expansion of mining in the past, but mining expansion, after all, is to a large extent a fortuitous thing. For permanent prosperity and rising standards of living one must look to a steady and rapid expansion of manufacturing industry, because that in the final instance will ensure that we progress as a community. I must say that in the past whenever we on this side have questioned whether our economy is growing <span class="col_5931-5932" refersTo="page_0212"/>fast enough to create sufficient jobs for our rapidly increasing population, whether our economy is growing fast enough to raise standards of living gradually, the Minister and in particular his Deputy have been apt to quote a whole lot of statistics which to a large extent are irrelevant to this particular question, but they do seem to succeed in confusing and bewildering their own supporters and satisfying them that we are one of the countries with the most rapid rate of growth in the world. So for the purpose of this debate I would like to define what I at least mean by &#x201C;economic development&#x201D; and I would like the hon. the Minister to confine himself in his reply to what I am going to assert is not taking place in this country. In the first place, I think we must all agree that if a country develops rapidly, economically, it must be in a position to create sufficient jobs for all the young people who come into the labour market every year. Such a country must be able to absorb the growing labour force, in other words, and unless one is to have static society, there must be ever-increasing standards of living. I think that is as fair a test of the economic growth as one can get. It is no use if a man comes and asks you for a job, to tell him that the generation of electricity has doubled in the past ten years, or that the production of pig-iron has gone up by 50 or 60 per cent, which is rather the way the hon. Minister is apt to argue on this question of economic growth. Economic activity after all is not an end in itself, but is there to provide your growing population with ever-increasing standards of living. Now is the hon. the Minister satisfied that our economy is creating sufficient jobs, sufficient opportunities for our over-growing labour force, and is he satisfied that our standards of living are rising steadily, although slowly? I would suggest that on all the available evidence this has certainly not taken place during the past four or five years. Take the question of employment first. Our population growth is roughly at the rate of about 2 per cent a year. One must therefore assume that one&#x2019;s labour force will also increase at that rate. Therefore your economy should at least increase the number of jobs that are available every year by at least 2 per cent. Now how does this compare with what has in fact happened as far as one has statistics available on the question of employment? If one looks at the latest <i>Monthly Bulletin of Statistics</i> for April 1962, one finds a summary of employment of mining, manufacturing. construction, transport, communication and public service, and one finds an index there and if one takes those back for five years to 1956-7, one finds that in that year the index stood at 111.9, and it rose gradually until the end of 1959-60 when it stood at 113.5, and at the end of December of last year, which is the most recent figure I have, it increased to 113.8. So you see, Mr. Chairman, that over a period of four or five years when the labour force must have increased by at least 8 per cent or 10 per cent, the number of new jobs has only increased by 2 per cent in these industries, not even quite 2 per cent. What is more alarming, Mr. Chairman, if one looks at where the jobs have been created, is to find that whereas the total numbers of people in employment in these specific industries have increased from 1,636,000 to 1,664,000, that is an increase of 28,000, if one analyses the increase, one finds that no less than 58,000 of the increase is attributable to mining. In other words, had it not been for mining, there would actually to-day have been fewer job opportunities in this country than four or five years ago. It is particularly alarming if one looks at the manufacturing industry in particular, which the hon. the Minister himself has pointed out we must look to in future as our main generator of welfare and income&#x2014;if one looks at the manufacturing industry in particular, one finds that employment in the manufacturing industry reached 690,000 in 1956-7; it increased fairly rapidly up to that stage, then we find that it increased to 698,000 in 1957-8, and ever since there has been a gradual decrease, a decrease to 691,000 and to 686,000 according to the latest figures for December. I don&#x2019;t even want to talk about the construction industry where there has been a far bigger drop in employment. Of course the hon. the Minister will quite rightly say that this does not cover our whole economic activity and that two very important industries are excluded, commerce and agriculture. But it is highly unlikely for other reasons that I will give later that there has been a rapid increase in employment in these two industries. After all, the whole economy develops together and it is most unlikely, particularly in agriculture, when one sees the state of agriculture during the last four or five years, that they could have generated sufficient extra jobs at improved standards of living. And commerce after all only reflects what happens in other parts of the economy. So I say that there cannot be the slightest doubt that at the rate a which we have been growing economically in the last four or five years, vast unemployment must be building up. And the amazing thing is that although our unemployment figures reflect a small increase, they do not reflect nearly the increase which must in fact have been taking place. We know of course that as far as the largest numbers of workers are concerned, the Natives as far as their unemployment problem is concerned, it is quite an easy one for the Government. If you have Native unemployment in a big area, you simply Bantustan them, and then unemployment figures don&#x2019;t look too bad. But there must also be a lot of hidden unemployment amongst your Europeans, Coloureds and Indians that our figures of unemployment do not indicate, and of course it is obvious why. Only a percentage of the people who are unemployed take any interest in registering as unemployed.

Let me come to the second point now. I would like the Minister to at least tell us whether he is satisfied first of all that we are generating enough jobs for our rapidly growing population on the facts that I have given him here. But let us come to the second point. The hon. the Minister might argue: Well, even if we have not been growing as rapidly in the <span class="col_5933-5934" refersTo="page_0213"/>past as we should have as far as creating jobs is concerned, nevertheless the standard of living of the people in employment at least has risen steadily. Mr. Speaker, I would like to analyse that. Unfortunately statistics as to whether the standard of living is increasing steadily in this country are not very reliable. One generally points to the improvement in the real income <i>per capita</i> in this country, but of course that measures a much wider spectrum than just the welfare of the people. If one for instance in a particular year has a lot of uneconomic investment, which in no way improves the standard of living, that nevertheless might be reflected if one simply goes on an average figure of the <i>per capita</i> real income, and it might indicate that there has been an improvement in the standards of living. However, I suggest a much simpler test. Surely the Minister will agree that in South Africa our vast masses, particularly the non-European people, are still inadequately fed; their nutrition is hopelessly inadequate, and we know the disease rate we have amongst certain sections of the non-European population in consequence. One must therefore assume that we are certainly not such a rich society that if there is an improvement in the real income of the people, people will not buy more food. In a poor society like ours, if people&#x2019;s wealth increases, the first thing is that they will buy more food and your consumption <i>per capita</i> must go up. Well, in this respect I would like to refer the hon. the Minister to a new publication which I welcome for the additional economic information that it gives. Agrekon. Vol. 1, No. 1, January 1962, a Department of Agriculture publication where the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing writes on the difficult markets and surpluses, and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Domestic consumption had shown a steady <i>per caput</i> increase since the beginning of the First World War for most agricultural commodities, till round about 1952-3. This, combined with a population growth of a little over 2 per cent per annum, had provided a steadily expanding market on the doorstep of South African agriculture. But since 1952-3 the <i>per caput</i> domestic consumption became relatively stationary for most farm products and in some cases even declined slightly. With a rate of production which continued to expand at considerably more than 2 per cent per annum, increasing quantities of farm products had to be exported.</block>

<p>Here on the evidence of the Secretary for Economics and Marketing, it is quite clear that four years after the Nationalist Government came into power, they managed to stabilize the consumption of foodstuffs. That is really what they have done. Since that period, judging by what the Secretary for Economics and Marketing writes, the per head consumption of foodstuffs has not increased in this country. No wonder his poor colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, is finding himself in such a mess to-day, for this very reason that the purchasing power is apparently not rising, or rising very slowly amongst the masses, and in consequence your consumption of food is not increasing, whereas your production of food has increased considerably as a result of improved farming methods. That of course in the long run affects the activities of the Minister&#x2019;s Department very considerably, too, because it is one of the factors that is slowing down the demand for industrial products in South Africa. If any further proof is required of the fact that the standards of living of the mass of the people are not increasing rapidly it is found in the index of retail sales published by the Reserve Bank in its quarterly bulletin. If we look at the index of retail sales, the volume of retail sales, on page 27, we find that whereas the index in 1957 stood at 112, in 1961 it stood at 115. In other words, the value of retail sales increased by 3 per cent over that period of five years. But if we look at the rise in retail prices, we find that over that same period retail prices increased by no less than 9 per cent. So one can only conclude that the actual volume of retail sales as reflected by this publication indicates also that the retail demand, one of the most important factors in stimulating the economy, has been stationary or falling according to the statistics I have mentioned, instead of rising rapidly. I would therefore like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can still be so complacent about the economic growth of the Republic. Because, as I say, the end purpose of all economic activities is to create jobs for your population at ever-increasing standards of living. That does not seem to be taking place. I would suggest that the hon. the Minister should tell the House what definite policies he has to correct this very unsatisfactory situation that we find ourselves in of a tremendous slowing down in the growth of economic development and the fact that the welfare standards do not seem to be rising, at least not very rapidly.</p>

<p>Let me readily admit that the Minister&#x2019;s hands are severely tied by the policies of his Prime Minister and his other colleagues. Just to give a few examples, it would assist him to get industrialization moving rapidly again if he could prevail on the Minister of Labour to discard and annul the Job Reservation Act. Surely the hon. the Minister who is a trained economist himself should be able to persuade his Cabinet and his colleague, the Minister of Labour, that from a purely economic point of view this is one of the most stupid bits of legislation that has ever been put on the Statute Book. He should be able to tell them that this thing was tried 200 or 300 years ago when there was also this na&#x00EF;ve belief that you can protect one section of the population against the other by introducing rigidities and by stopping people from changing their occupation to another occupation unless you belonged to a certain group. That was discarded more than <span class="col_5935-5936" refersTo="page_0214"/>100 years ago in the European countries. They realized the complete fallacy of this. They realized that whilst that might be all right for a static society where you have not got rapid changes, the moment you apply it to a dynamic society like the capitalistic system we have here in South Africa, job reservation makes just no sense at all. The hon. the Minister must realize that and I would like to hear what his opinions are on this particular aspect. Just to give one other example: If the Minister could do something to stop his colleague, the Minister of Justice, from sabotaging the return in business confidence which we are experiencing at the moment in South Africa, with his so-called Sabotage Bill, it would also assist him considerably. If this Sabotage Bill does anything, it sabotages returning business confidence more than anything else.</p>

<p>I admit that to sort order out of the conflicting policies of his colleagues would be a Herculean job for this Minister. I must say yesterday I heard one of the most astounding statements in this House when the Minister of Indian Affairs explained that one of the merits of his Department was that it was protecting the Indian community against the activities of other departments, in particular the Departments regulating the Group Areas Act. That shows into what a chaotic state the illogical and senseless policies of this Government are leading to that you have to appoint Ministers to protect people against the policies of other Ministers. I suppose this Minister will shortly have to do something to protect the Indian community against the Minister of Indian Affairs! Despite these handicaps inherent in the policy of the Government, South Africa has such a tremendous gross potential, industrially, that even with a very bad Government as we have at the moment, one can still grow industrially. Because after all it is the industrial community mainly that creates growth, and in this connection I was very interested to read that the hon. the Minister at the Federated Chambers of Industries dinner in December, last year, referred to a five-year plan. He pointed out quite correctly that he did not intend central planning on the communistic style, but the hon. the Minister no doubt had in mind the new fashion in even capitalistic countries like France and Italy, and even in Britain to some extent, for the Government to follow certain policies and to indicate certain targets of economic growth and then to try and get the co-operation of commerce and industry to achieve those targets. Apparently, that policy has been very successful in France and Italy, so much so, that I see that just recently the National Economic Development Council of the United Kingdom has also suggested a somewhat similar plan. I trust the hon. the Minister will give us more information on this, although I must again hasten to warn him that due to the lamentable state in which we find our economic statistics in this country, it is going to be an awfully hard job for the Minister to do this type of planning for technical reasons which he must be well aware of. If the Government is going to embark on this type of planning and encouragement, one needs fairly detailed and extensive and reliable economic statistics. I also trust that the hon. the Minister will not just tell us again about Sasol and Iscor and Escom, because as he clearly indicated in his speech, the expansion of those industries was intended as part of a wider expansion, and there is no doubt that if you cannot get private industrialization moving again, and you are simply concentrating on public utilities like that, that will not assist you in increasing the tempo of economic growth very rapidly in South Africa.</p>

<p>That gentleman is of course a great authority on nonsense. I would not like to enter into an argument with him, but even he should realize that it does not help to keep on generating electricity if there is no demand for it. The hon. the Minister will also no doubt tell the House, far more specifically than he has in the past, what plans he has for safeguarding South Africa&#x2019;s export market. We know that vast changes are taking place overseas. The very fact that a country like the United Kingdom, the largest import country of agricultural commodities in the world, and one of the largest importers in the world, will change their tariff policy drastically if she enters the Common Market, must affect the whole world trade and it could particularly affect South African exports in view of the fact that we have imperial preferences on a large scale. Other speakers will go into this question in more detail. And of course it is not only a question of the United Kingdom market. Linked with this problem is also the Rhodesian market, a very important market for our industrial products, and that might also be vitally affected by the United Kingdom entering the Common Market. Of course the problems of adaptation have been made far more difficult by our withdrawal from the Commonwealth. Maybe the hon. the Minister can enlighten the House on this, but as far as one can judge there seems to be very little liaison between this Government and the United Kingdom Government on what quid pro quo South Africa would get if certain imperial preferences are to be abandoned or reduced, either in the Common Market as a whole, or in respect of the United Kingdom. If I am mistaken and the Minister is in close touch with the United Kingdom Government, I hope he will tell us to what extent the United Kingdom Government has undertaken to safeguard our position there. If one reads the Chamber of Industries&#x2019; report on the visit of their economist to Brussels, one also gets the impression again that this Government is lagging so far behind in its duties that just as in the case of wages for industry, industry is bound in the end to take the lead itself and <span class="col_5937-5938" refersTo="page_0215"/>to go over there and do the investigation which basically should have been done by the Government. If one reads this report&#x2014;unless the Minister rejects this report completely&#x2014;it would seem that South Africa has been one of the least active of the Commonwealth countries in safeguarding its position and taking steps to see that England&#x2019;s entry into the Common Market will not affect our exports very adversely. We know the sorry story of the economist. It has taken more than a year to find an economist to send over there. Of course the Minister will tell us that the South African Minister in Brussels is a qualified economist. But he is also a full-time ambassador, and it is a full-time job&#x2014;all the other countries seem to regard it as a full-time job, anyway. But this question will also be dealt with more fully by other speakers on this side.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what his intentions are in regard to import control. In view of the tremendous increase in our foreign exchange reserves, will the Minister make a statement as to what the Government&#x2019;s policy is and whether he has any relaxation in mind? The hon. the Minister must be aware that with the build-up of our foreign exchange, an inflationary situation can rise if he does not take steps. And in any event, I think there is no greater reflection on the damaging effect which this Government&#x2019;s policies have on the economic life of South Africa than that South Africa, the world&#x2019;s largest gold exporter, a country which has trebled its gold output since this Government came into power, is still one of the few countries in the Western world that has to have this severe type of import control. Surely we have an interest as a gold producer in free international trade and dismantling all control on trade. I would like to end by saying that in view of our strong position in exports in the Western world, because of the type of our exports and because we are such a large gold producer, we should not have this rigid control. We have this amazing situation that 17 years after the war, we still have to have this extensive degree of import control. The Minister must realize that that cannot be a good thing after the war we still have to have this extenprise as he continually tells us he does, he must realize that import control over a long period like this can only distort the price structure, can only increase the cost structure in this country. If he wants to protect industry here, it should be done by way of tariff protection. That is the sensible way to protect industry. In any event is the Minister not likely to fall foul of GATT with his rapidly improving reserve situation if he does not relax import control fairly considerably in the near future?</p>

<p>I think we shall be given the best reply possible to the speech by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) at the next annual meeting of the Netherlands Bank. We have now listened to the shadow Minister of Economic Affairs of the United Party. As such he has to be pessimistic. But I think we shall get the best reply from the chairman of the Netherlands Bank when he addresses his next annual meeting because the hon. member for Jeppes is the chairman of the Netherlands Bank. The hon. member for Jeppes is an economist of repute and I cannot imagine that he can believe what he has said. He is surely not such a Rip van Winkle. He has to be something of a prophet of doom in the political role which he plays but as an economist he can surely not believe anything he has said. The main theme of his attack on the Government has been the question: Is our economic development such that we are creating sufficient job opportunities? Mr. Chairman, we have now gone through a period of consolidation in recent years, but even during this period of consolidation we have had sufficient job opportunities. If there was not sufficient employment, we should surely have had a considerable number of unemployed persons. But the unemployment rate is somewhere between 2 and 2&#x00BD; per cent which in all countries of the world is regarded as full employment. We do not have a pool of workers in South Africa such as is found in England and America and even in Western Germany. Mr. Chairman, our problem even under consolidation has not been one of a shortage of job opportunities but actually a shortage of workers, and the only small increase in unemployment, namely, amongst the building workers, has been due to the fact that the building industry has suffered a slight decline but even this position is already improving. I just want to reply to one point which is not actually relevant but which the hon. member for Jeppes has made and which cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged, namely, that the legislation the Minister of Justice has introduced will shock this returning confidence. What nonsense! According to that argument of the hon. member sabotage will restore confidence. What absolute nonsense. The hon. member is not such a Rip van Winkle that he does not know that within a year one of our main problems in the economic sphere is going to be that we shall not have sufficient labour. Within a year. I want to congratulate most sincerely the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, his Department and his Deputy Minister on the new economic climate which prevails here in South Africa. There is new confidence in South Africa. The manufacturers are engaged on their expansion plans. The retail trade has improved. The Stellenbosch Research Institute reports that during the past quarter there was an almost sensational improvement in the whole economic climate, in the retail trade, in the wholesale trade, in manufacturing industry. Our industrialists are now putting their development plans into order and implementing those plans. Everywhere we see optimism and everywhere we see activity. Just look at the Stock Exchange. The Stock Exchange for the past week has not been what it has been over the past two years.</p>

<p>But that is nonsense. A rising tendency has already been making itself evident for some considerable time and this is not merely the result of the hope which exists that there will be an increase in the gold price because the main increase on the Stock Exchange has been in respect of industrial shares. There is not the slightest doubt that there is new confidence amongst the public. To what is it attributable? To what is the new economic climate, this new confidence, this new buoyancy in the economic sphere attributable? In the first place it is attributable to the confidence which this Minister and the Prime Minister have infused into the business life of South Africa. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the trade missions which he sent overseas. This was the turning point and it assisted in improving the climate and as a result of all the steps taken thereafter, we have as economically sound a climate as we could wish.</p>

<p>The second reason for this optimistic economic climate is the vision which the Government had in announcing the Orange River scheme. I do not think that anything has had as stimulative an effect as this announcement of the Orange River scheme. This shows the Government has confidence in the future of this country and this confidence has infected the private sector as well and has also assisted in restoring confidence in the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<p>I then come to the third reason for the improved economic climate, namely the confidence which the utility companies are showing in the future of South Africa. The hon. member for Jeppes knows after all what Iscor is doing; he knows about their tremendous development plans. At Vanderbijlpark alone they are now engaged on development plans involving &#x00A3;56,000,000&#x2014;R112,000,000&#x2014;for the next year. They are already engaged on those plans. In this regard I want to mention one thing specially, namely, that not one single penny of that money has been borrowed. Every penny has come out of profits. We have the tremendous development plans of Iscor for the next ten years. We have the tremendous development plans of Amcor, as a result of the large orders for pig-iron which they have obtained from Japan. They are going to extend their blast furnaces at Newcastle. Does the hon. member for Jeppes want to say that he knows nothing about that? They will start making deliveries within the next two years and for them to do so an additional train will have to travel every day throughout the year between Newcastle and Durban so that they can export what they are going to produce at the new blast furnaces at Newcastle. Does the hon. member not realize what this will mean? He surely knows of Foscor&#x2019;s development plans. He knows of the development plans of the motor industry; he knows of the development plans of Sasol; he knows about all these things.</p>

<p>How many &#x201C;jobs&#x201D; will this development not create? The hon. member surely knows that the time for consolidation is past; it is already months past and development is already taking place. This confidence which the utility companies are showing in the confidence of South Africa has so stimulated our economy that it could have no other effect but to penetrate to the private sector as well. And these development plans on the part of the utility companies alone will create our greatest shortage of manpower and labour resources in the next year or two&#x2014;I think the hon. the Minister will have to prepare himself for this. There is already a tremendous shortage of scientists. I think the Minister must prepare himself for the fact that this will be one of his main headaches within a year or two. And then we have prophets of doom like the hon. member for Jeppes and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth South (Mr. Plewman) who sits next to him&#x2014;but he will always look as unhappy as he does now. This confidence which the Government has initiated has penetrated to the utility companies and thereafter to the private companies. I want to congratulate private companies like Anglo American and African Explosives to-day on the initiative which they have shown in their development plans. The plans of African Explosives alone must create hundreds of job opportunities at Modderfontein. Then there is Union Steel Corporation, a semi-private undertaking with its development plans. There is the Massey-Ferguson organization which is now seeing whether it cannot manufacture tractors in South Africa and anyone who can read the signs of the times will know that within a few years we shall have our own tractors under the guidance of these people. Millions and millions of pounds are being invested in the development of this country. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, our main problem will not be a shortage of jobs, as the hon. member for Jeppes says, our main problem will be exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>This new economic climate in South Africa is one of the most wonderful things which has happened over the past ten years and for anyone who can observe it, it is clear that we are on the threshold of the greatest economic development we have ever seen. Nothing can prevent it, except an outside catastrophe or something of that nature. Hon. members opposite can now stop trying to sabotage it. The impression which they can create is not even a drop in the ocean. They cannot sabotage it and nothing can stop it.</p>

<p>I now want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister, while we are engaged on new economic development, to consider whether the time has not come for the establishment of a new Sasol. It is now quite clear that notwithstanding all the prophesies of doom which come from hon. members opposite, that Sasol has been an outstanding economic and financial success. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging <span class="col_5941-5942" refersTo="page_0217"/>(Mr. B. Coetzee) pointed out that there was a shortage of skilled workers. I certainly agree with that, but that shortage has been occasioned completely by the Government&#x2019;s immigration policy. I would say that this country has again been sacrificed on the altar of their ideology. He said everything in the garden was lovely; there was no unemployment anywhere. He does not seem to know anything about the building industry. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, our motto should be &#x201C;export or die&#x201D;. In this connection, Mr. Chairman, I want to refer to a statement made by the hon. the Minister to the Export Trade Convention this week, in which he is reported to have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa should not look to the still under-developed countries for markets &#x2026;</block>

<p>That, of course, means the countries to our north. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The industrially advanced countries represent the markets to which we should devote particular attention in our efforts to expand our foreign sales.</block>

<p>These are surprising statements, Mr. Chairman. Industry in this country has always, or at least till very recently, until the Prime Minister succeeded in his efforts to get us out of the Commonwealth, known that South Africa&#x2019;s future lay in being the workshop of Africa. The availability of raw material, our geography and cheap labour were the main factors which were to help. Now the Minister says we must forget these under-developed countries, they are not for us; the industrially advanced countries represent the markets to which we should devote particular attention! This means that in the Minister&#x2019;s opinion the emerging African states to the north of us are virtually closed to us. This we know. We also know, Sir, that this is due to the Government&#x2019;s policy and the Government&#x2019;s policy alone. And we know that we will have a tremendous job to put it right when we take over in the not so distant future. Mr. Chairman, that statement of the Minister&#x2019;s was reported on the 15th of this month; on the 16th of this month the hon. the Minister of Information is reported to have shown a documentary picture of 300 Coloured people entitled &#x201C;Workshop of the Continent&#x201D;. On the 16th, too, in the <i>Cape Argus</i>, Mr. W. A. Horrocks, the country&#x2019;s senior trade envoy, is reported to have told the Export Trade Convention that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The European Common Market might not give South Africa a bigger outlet for manufactured goods, though it would possibly enable the country to sell more primary products and foodstuffs. He told the Convention that South Africa&#x2019;s exporters faced cutthroat competition in the world to-day and said further &#x201C;We must be prepared to encounter even greater and keener competition in manufactured foods in other parts of the world as well&#x201D;.</block>

<p>So what do we have, Mr. Chairman? The Minister of Economic Affairs says we must ignore Africa; the Minister of Information says we are the workshop of the Continent; the Minister of Economic Affairs says we must devote particular attention to the markets in the industrially advanced countries. The country&#x2019;s senior envoy warns us against these countries, except probably for the sale of primary products and foodstuffs. Can you beat that, Mr. Chairman? And now to make confusion worse confounded the Prime Minister enters the field and tells the Convention not to worry about our trade difficulties with the African states &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have on this particular occasion been quoting from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. Our trade difficulties with the African states will pass according to the Prime Minister. He says they will pass and we must in the meantime concentrate on the markets in the more advanced countries. Truly, Mr. Chairman, the fortunes of the exporters have been thrown in the gutter; there is no other word for it. This Minister must admit that the policy of &#x201C;leave it to Hendrik&#x201D; is getting us nowhere.</p>

<p>Before putting certain questions to the Minister I want to draw his attention to the urgency of this matter of finding new markets to replace those so cavalierly thrown away by the Prime Minister. The Minister knows that governments can break down markets as this Government has done and he knows that they cannot rebuild them. He has admitted this on many occasions. His trade missions have also admitted this. The only people who can help the exporters are the exporters themselves by hard work. That was what the Trade Missions said and that was what the Minister said. Now comes the question of urgency, Sir. Our country&#x2019;s gold production which is the backbone of the whole country will come to a peak in 1970 or 1971, we are told. Thereafter it will dwindle unless a miracle happens again. We are all hoping for an increase in the price of gold but it has not come about and it does not look as if it is any closer than it was five years ago. While we have this life-saving industry we should be putting in every effort of the country to establish those industries which have to take the place of the gold-mining industry later. All the time we have left is between now and 1970, thereafter our gold production will dwindle.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions: Who is right about our being the workshop of Africa&#x2014;he or the Minister of Information? Who is right in saying that the African markets to our north are closed to us or not&#x2014;he or the Prime Minister? I want to ask him another question: Is it correct to state that only manufactured goods which contain a large proportion of our own raw materials and are manufactured by a large proportion of our own cheap Native labour, have any chance at all of selling overseas? If so, does <span class="col_5943-5944" refersTo="page_0218"/>this not affect his policy in regard to White industries, i.e. those with a very large proportion of White workers as opposed to Native workers? Because that sort of product comes in the main from the White areas, the White areas where the White skilled workers work. Then I want to ask him a further question: Which is the best place for our exporters to battle in for sales: Africa, Asia (both closed to us), Europe, South America, North America or where? He must let us and the people outside know. Then I want to ask a further question: Has he statistics relating to those particular South African manufacturers who have already lost markets in Africa and on the European Common Market owing to the internal tariffs being reduced between the member countries of those organizations? If he has not got that information. Sir, I say that he and his Deputy are failing in their duty. Has he statistics of those exports, product by product, which will be affected by the Common Market? And has he advised the producers of those particular products? Is he in contact with the United Kingdom or elsewhere in connection with our wine, fruit, our wattle products, our sugar, our maize products, etc.? I hope the Minister will not give us the same misleading reply which the Deputy Minister give us in connection with sugar earlier in this Session. Will the hon. the Minister, too, also tell us why it has been left to the last few days for an announcement to be made by the hon. the Prime Minister, and not by him, that an economist is to be appointed to Brussels? That should have been dealt with by him, not by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the Minister once more does he think that this policy of &#x201C;leaving it to Hendrik&#x201D; gets us anywhere except into trouble?</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it must be very difficult for hon. members of the Opposition to debate and to criticize the Government on this Vote, because they are now discussing circumstances which differ so greatly from what they prophesied 11 months ago would be the position. You will remember, Mr. Chairman, that in June last year, when we had a financial debate here, it was precisely the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) who told the House that we were so weakening our foreign exchange position that we would have to devalue. It is the hon. member who said that we would be obliged to devalue and the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) was the one who shouted: &#x201C;Hear, hear.&#x201D; His whole party said in this House that we would devalue. Now they are depicting a picture which refutes completely their own prophesies. They have come here to-day at a time when our foreign exchange position is stronger than it has been for years. The circumstances are such that the hon. member for Jeppes has told the Minister: What are you going to do with all this foreign exchange? You should allow more goods to be imported and to use the money. That is the position which we have reached. And now these hon. members have had to swallow every word they said 11 months ago, just as for the rest of the year they will have to swallow for all they are worth everything they say here to-day. They cannot put forward any criticism of the Government which they will not have to swallow later.</p>

<p>Take the hon. member who has just spoken. He has actually told us that we had African markets at our disposal but the Prime Minister took us out of the Commonwealth and now we no longer have those markets. Just imagine a worse lot of nonsense than such a submission. I now want to ask the hon. member to name me one single African market which we had and which we have lost thought leaving the Commonwealth.</p></speech>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who is a comrade in arms of the Ghanians, as it often seems to me, should know that the boycott announcement by Ghana and other Central African countries was made long before we left the Commonwealth. The hon. member should also know that now that we are out of the Commonwealth, Ghana has come crawling to ask that we should please supply certain goods which they require. Ghana say that &#x201C;boycott&#x201D; means that they can still buy what they need from us. The boycott should only be one-sided and not on both sides. The hon. member should please check his facts before he talks such nonsense in this Committee.</p>

<p>He has said one thing, namely that we shall have to establish new industries to replace the gold mines. But, Mr. Chairman, whenever I have advocated that in this House, and have said that we should transfer to Loan Account a considerable amount annually from the large sums which we receive from the gold mines, precisely in order to develop such industries, hon. members opposite have opposed me. There has been systematic opposition from the United Party&#x2014;such a step must not be taken.</p>

<p>But I now want to turn to the main United Party speaker, the hon. member for Jeppes. He has made one or two submissions which I feel we cannot allow to pass unchallenged. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) has already answered him reasonably fully. However, he did not answer all the points. I now want to tell the hon. member for Jeppes this. I have already told him this, namely that he is a good economist, so good even that the Government could use him to advantage on the Board of Trade and Industries. He then entered politics and in political life he has landed in a party which is following the wrong economic policy, which is following the wrong policy in practically every sphere. Now he has to rise year after year and hold himself out as an expert who can see terrible mistakes in this Government&#x2019;s policy. Does the House know what he has done? He has not regarded these matters on a scientific basis as one would expect of an economist. No, he has approached these matters from a petty party political point of view, and then he makes nonsensical submissions <span class="col_5945-5946" refersTo="page_0219"/>such as those he made here this morning. We get these bank reports which he makes, and to which the hon. member for Vereeniging has referred. The other day I told him that he should watch out what he says in the House because I shall quote his own bank reports to him. Unfortunately I have not brought them with me. I am sorry, but I am still going to bring them before to-night. If he continues with this sort of talk, then I shall throw his own words in his face. Mr. Chairman, I really do not think that this hon. member is so foolish that he believes what he stated this morning in this Committee.</p></speech>

<p>One has to be a little personal with a person who violates his own calling, his own subject in which he claims to be an expert, to such an extent that he throws overboard all its basic principles in order to find a cheap argument. The hon. member has said here: Look, there is no development in the private sector, and you must please not tell us about the development of Iscor, Foscor, Escom and Amcor and those undertakings, because these are things for which the State is responsible and which it is initiating because the private sector is not developing. Why is he so afraid of this development? Development to the tune of thousands of millions of rand has been announced by the utility companies. Why is he afraid that we shall mention this? No, he has tried to build up an argument in order to bring the Committee under the impression that nothing is being done to develop our economy, whilst everything possible is being done and with very great success.</p>

<p>I just want to take another argument of the hon. member. He has said that there has not been an increase in the real income of the public, because if there had been such an increase, there would have been an increased consumption of food. Have we ever heard a more unscientific submission than this, and this from a man who claims to be an economist? I ask: How on earth can a person who claims to be an economist submit such a nonsensical argument?</p></speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall answer him. I am answering him. The actual position is that if a man has a larger income&#x2014;and statistics show us that during the 14 years we have been in power, the real income has risen by approximately 30 per cent. He cannot deny that, no matter what he says. One of the characteristics of a rising standard of living, as reflected by these figures, is that a larger percentage of income is devoted to things other than foodstuffs and not to foodstuffs as such. The public buy things with a utility value, other than food. That is the first characteristic one encounters. They buy radios, motor-cars, they go to bioscope, which they perhaps did not do before. I wish members would go to the non-White bioscopes in Pretoria and Johannesburg, to see how the Natives are queueing to get into the bioscopes. We see this day after day, and 10 to 15 years ago we did not see it. Go to the races and hon. members will see the same thing&#x2014;how they gamble with their money there. But, Mr. Chairman, that is not all. A second main characteristic of a rising real income is that the careful man saves more. What do we find in this regard? In 1948 savings in South Africa totalled approximately &#x00A3;100,000,000&#x2014;R200,000,000. This figure has risen to such an extent that to-day it is approximately R1,100,000,000 per annum. Expressed in percentages this is the highest in the whole world&#x2014;between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the net national income is being saved to-day. And who is saving this money? It is not so much the rich and important man. The rich man saves in his way the amounts which he wants to set aside. But ask your building societies and your savings banks; ask the deposit-receiving institutions! You know, Mr. Chairman, that the number of savings accounts has increased tenfold during the 14 years we have been in power. I do not know how many times the amounts involved have doubled during the few years we have been in power. Here we have a concrete indication of the rising standard of living in South Africa, and no matter what the hon. member may say, he cannot argue that fact away. Then the hon. member went on to say that the job reservation legislation had harmed our industrial development. [Time limit.]</p></speech>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that the last two speakers on the Government side have completely failed to refute the statements made by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje). They have also completely failed to refute the unemployment figures. It is all very well to tell us about queues of Bantu standing outside bioscopes waiting to go in. They do not take into account the long queues of Bantu at the unemployment bureaux all over the country. Go to East London and look at the queues there and see the large numbers who are turned away because there is no employment. These are indisputable facts. Another point which they have failed to take into account is the statement made by the hon. the Minister at recent conferences, to the effect that it is necessary to develop his five-year plan and to develop our export industry in order to find employment for the growing numbers of unemployed. Those are points which the last two speakers on the Government side have overlooked altogether.</p>

<p>I would like to say that I am very pleased indeed that the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs has announced this five-year plan and especially that he is linking it up with the idea of export industries. I have no doubt that he has studied the whole position thoroughly but I want to draw his attention to one or two points. In order to derive the <span class="col_5947-5948" refersTo="page_0220"/>maximum results from these export industries it seems to me that he and the whole country and all industrialists interested in this matter, will have to develop an entirely new broad outlook with a far-sighted concept, taking into account all the industrial potentialities of the country, if this plan is to have the maximum desired effect. If South Africa is to maintain its position, its industrial, scientific and commercial leadership in Africa, we will have to take an entirely new outlook of the whole industrial situation in South Africa. Our present industrial complex is built up on the production of gold and cheap labour to extract that gold. But as previous speakers on this side have frequently mentioned that gold will eventually peter out. We will then have to take that inevitability into account and look for other avenues of employment. A vast amount of capital has been invested in the areas surrounding the gold mines. Capital has been sunk into housing and township schemes. All these factors will have to be taken into account. We will have to provide industries to take the place of the gold mines in those areas. I maintain that when we come to consider export industries we will have to take a new look at the whole position. This R6,000 mentioned by the Minister of Finance is the only apparent financial provision made for the development of export industries, and it seems to me to be quite inadequate. I mention that only in passing. I would like the Minister of Economic Affairs to give us more details about what his five-year plan means and what he has in mind in regard to the development of the export industries. Up to the present his statement seems to be very nebulous and just covers vague ideas. The country expects him to be more specific. To get the maximum result from the export industries I think we must also take into account the fact that the big industrial countries of the world all have their export industries based on seaports, whereas our present development of industries is far inland. If we have to compete with other countries of the world we will find it very difficult to pay railage to the coast and then shipping rates, when the railage for 700 miles from Johannesburg to East London costs more than the freight for 7,000 miles by sea. Therefore I feel that we will have to take into account various factors when it comes to the matter of export industries. We will have to consider what the requirements are for suitable new areas in which to develop those export industries. I feel we will have to develop a new industrial complex based on seaports, and we will have to look for areas which provide abundant water and unencumbered land in the proximity of seaports. We will have to take into account, whether we like it or not, the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to border industries, and find areas which are in close contact with the densely populated Bantu areas. I submit that in the corridor area between the Transkei and the Ciskei, the area immediately inland from East London, we have all those requirements <i>par excellence</i>. That area has been held back in the past to a large extent, due to its distance from the main inland markets, but I submit that if we are considering export industries, that disability falls away, and it will be difficult to find an area which gives more scope for our developing export industries. We will have to compete with countries overseas. The European industrial countries are reaching the limits of their labour supplies. In America the wages are very high. Australia and New Zealand have to import all their labour. In much of Africa and Southern Asia there are plentiful labour supplies, but the climate is not healthy, whereas at East London we have all the necessary facilities for developing industries, particularly for manufacturing the raw materials into the finished articles, instead of now exporting them to other countries and those articles coming back in the finished form. In a coastal area like East London, which has not been over-developed, there is plenty of unencumbered land and all the other facilities necessary for the establishment of export industries, and I submit to the Minister that in the development of this and in his five-year plan lies the great new idea which South Africa needs.</p>

<p>In this connection I should also like to suggest to the Minister that he should give further consideration to the idea which has already been expressed in this House, of a free port, for which East London is ideally suitable.</p></speech>

<speech by="#luttig">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LUTTIG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not reply to him. I want to come back to certain remarks made by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), the Opposition&#x2019;s shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, particularly the remarks he made about the Common Market. He has said that this is going to create tremendous problems for us, particularly as a result of the fact that we are no longer a member of the Commonwealth and that practically insuperable problems await us in the future if the United Kingdom becomes a member of the Common Market. Now, as a good politician, the hon. member has immediately grasped this uncertainty in order to conjure up as many fears as he possibly can. He has done so because we are faced with a very difficult problem in the sense that there is a tremendous degree of uncertainty as to the exact conditions on which the United Kingdom will become a member of the Common Market. But the very first point the hon. member has made by saying that we shall be penalized because we are no longer a member of the Commonwealth is refuted by the facts because as far back as November last year the six member countries of the Common Market stated clearly that Australia, Canada and New Zealand would not be permitted to become members simultaneously with the application made by the United Kingdom. It was stated that other Commonwealth <span class="col_5949-5950" refersTo="page_0221"/>countries whose exports were not so large and who could compete with the six original member countries of the Common Market would be permitted. Consequently, I simply cannot see how this position will harm us because we are no longer a member of the Commonwealth. That was his first argument.</p>

<p>I now come to the second argument, namely that unlike New Zealand and Australia we are in the exceptionally favourable position that 80 per cent of our exports consist of raw materials or of goods which are of essential importance to Britain and the other six members of the Common Market. We are therefore in this regard in a very favourable position as well. There is the further aspect that we occupy a unique position as regards our gold, which represents 40 per cent of our exports and which we can sell in the free world at a fixed price. Fourthly, the exports of our wool which represents 11 per cent of our exports, are also of cardinal importance because this is one of the essential raw materials for the six countries of the Common Market. The same applies to other minerals which represent 13 per cent of our exports. We are therefore in a very favourable position as regards these matters. I want to concede at once that our wine and fruit exporters may be faced with difficulties as a result of this agreement and I do not want to lose sight of this fact, but on the other hand I also believe that, just as in the past, we can show sufficient enterprise to develop markets elsewhere in the world if we are harmed in that regard. The hon. member has therefore made use of this uncertain situation to arouse further fears which will certainly not have a stimulating effect on the sound economic climate about which he has had so much to say. Here we are faced with a tardiness to invest. One of the main features which we saw in the last budget was in fact an emphasis of this aspect. But on the other hand this policy of the Opposition of conjuring up bogies and arousing fears and saying that everything will collapse the moment the United Kingdom enters the Common Market will not stimulate our economy, and these arguments are also devoid of all truth, as I have shown. Allow me to quote briefly what an authority has said in this regard. Here I have the well-known <i>Finance and Trade Review</i> of Volkskas. and in the December issue appears a particularly interesting speech made by Mr. Bryan, the Chief British Trade Commissioner in South Africa, towards the end of last year. One of the important aspects which he emphasizes is precisely that while England is not yet a member of the Common Market, her exports to Western Europe have increased considerably. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It came into being in 1958 (the Common Market) and until 1960, while our total exports increased by 29 per cent, our exports to Western Europe rose by 62 per cent.</block>

<p>He says that if this is the position in the case of England there is no reason why the same should not apply to South Africa as well. The conclusion of his whole speech was the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our joining the Common Market will not close the British market to South African goods, and although you will in future be ever more interested in your manufacturers, it is no part of our policy to close our doors to goods that compete with our own products. We believe that our strength, our prosperity and our power to compete will be increased by joining the E.E.C. and we shall continue to offer a good market for South African goods. We know, too that South Africa will continue to be a good market for British goods of all kinds, because our experience has shown us that we cannot have efficient and competitive industries if they do not have to face competition. If the markets are there, it will be up to each of us to make the best of the opportunities they offer.</block>

<p>I think that this opinion of Mr. Bryan, who is certainly an authority in this field, is a conclusive reply to the fears which the hon. member for Jeppes has tried to create and the sombre picture he has tried to depict regarding the United Kingdom&#x2019;s possible membership of the Common Market. As I have said, in the times in which we live, seeing that we realize that we are faced with a great problem in providing sufficient employment and the necessity for maintaining the tempo of our economic development at such a rate that we can provide job opportunities to future generations, and seeing that this is one of the main problems submitted to the House in the Budget, the hon. member is certainly not justified, as a good economist, in allowing his political convictions to blind him to such an extent that he loses sight completely of these other facts. I do not want to say that if the United Kingdom joins the Common Market it will not create problems for us. As regards our wine, fruit and other agricultural products, grave problems may be created. But in the main the fact remains that the submission which the Opposition always make, namely that because we have left the Commonwealth, we shall be penalized as a result of the fact that England has joined the Common Market, is devoid of all truth. The contrary is true, namely that we are in a more favourable position as regards our essential exports of gold, wool and basic minerals than New Zealand, Australia or even Canada, and secondly, it must be remembered that it is not a <i>sine quo non</i> that because England has joined the Common Market it will automatically follow that Australia, New Zealand and Canada will have to join it also. That is not the position at all and it surprises me to hear from the hon. member for Jeppes, who is the shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, that it will automatically follow that the other Commonwealth countries will become members of the Common Market together with the United Kingdom.

<from><span class="col_5951-5952" refersTo="page_0222"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that I have the opportunity of following the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig), because it is speeches like the one he has made this morning that has created so much fear on the question of the Common Market. He has told us that Canada, Australia and New Zealand will be in exactly the same trouble as we are, because they will not be admitted to membership of the Common Market. But he forgot to tell us two things, firstly that in the negotiations taking place between the United Kingdom and the Common Market the U.K. is representing those countries; and, secondly, that from the latest information that has appeared in the Press it seems that if the U.K. enters the Common Market the other members of the Commonwealth will have at least until 1970 to adjust their position in relation to the Common Market. He has also told us, correctly, that we are in a fairly strong position, because so much of our exports comprise gold, agricultural products, and basic raw materials like base minerals. It is true that a number of these items are what are called the sensitive items, and that we will have a certain latitude in regard to these items. But there are two factors we have to take into consideration. The first is that on the agricultural side the members of the Common Market themselves are constantly pushing for lower tariffs on agricultural products, and that policies are being developed to enable this to take place. The other fact is that it is no good we in this country saying: Do not let us worry, because we can export our gold and our base minerals and our agricultural products, when the whole drive at the moment is in respect of the export of manufactured products. Where do we stand in regard to manufactured products? The speech made by the hon. member for Mayfair merely reflects what was said by Ministers of this Government, and that is why we are so perturbed about the position. It is over 12 months ago that this matter of the Common Market was first raised by commerce and industry, and raised in this House. What have we had in the meantime? The hon. the Prime Minister tells us that he is not obsessed with the idea of the Common Market, but that we are. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs tells us that he has had discussions with the E.E.C. and that his Department has made studies and that reports have been drawn up, and that the Republic was represented at various conferences. We also know that the question of the E.E.C. was dealt with by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Committee. But there seems to me a sort of <i>laisser-faire</i> attitude in regard to this matter; it is not really important, we will deal with it in our own time, and South Africa really will not be affected. Now I do not want to mention this question of the economist again. I only hope I am invited to see him off when he sails to represent the Republic of South Africa. We have heard about it for so long that I would be very happy to have the opportunity of seeing him off when he goes to represent us. Sir, what are the basic facts? In the E.E.C. you have one of the great trading blocs in the world, which is forging ahead with terrific rapidity. In four years, it is said in an article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the gross national product of the community has increased by 15 per cent, compared with 10.4 per cent in E.F.T.A. and 8.2 per cent in the United States. Agricultural output is the fastest growing in the Western world. Industrial production is up 24.6 per cent against Britain&#x2019;s 14 per cent and 8.24 per cent in the U.S. &#x2026; indeed, by all yardsticks, the E.E.C. is the fastest growing area in the world.</block>

<p>The other factor I mentioned, and which I think one must stress, is the link between the E.E.C. and Africa. It seems to be something which we disregard. What is the position in relation to Africa? Through the old ties of the member-states of the E.E.C., particularly France with her old dependancies, which are now independent states, you have a very realistic and very important tie between Africa and the Common Market. In the Cape Argus of 10 April it was reported that the Senegalese ambassador to the E.E.C.&#x2014;and it may be of interest to hon. members to know that the Senegalese have an ambassador to the E.E.C.&#x2014;speaking for all the African states, had requested R1,214,000,000 in aid spread over the next five years. Sir, we know that economic help always has a tail attached to it, and if the E.E.C. is going to put these millions of rand into Africa, it will not be a free gift, but it will be tied up with trade and we have to be aware of it. I do not want to stress again the question of the U.K., except to say that from the latest reports it does appear that the entry of the U.K. into the E.E.C. can be fairly soon. I hope the Minister will know more about that than we do and that he will tell us to-day what the position is in that regard. We do not seem to view this matter with very great seriousness, but the U.S.A. does. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962. which was introduced in Congress by the President, is designed to bring about increased trade by making it easier for goods purchased abroad to enter the U.S. markets. The President said that easier entry into the United States markets of these goods would mean easier entry by United States producers into overseas markets, and the report I have here reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The President pointed out that his trade proposals were made in the face of the emerging European Common Market, the knowledge of a necessity to increase U.S. exports and the fact that nearly 50 new nations of Asia and Africa are seeking new markets. He also noted that he wanted to help keen U.S. markets open for Latin-American products and to beat down barriers to those products in other parts of the world.</block>

<p>That is the situation we are faced with, and what are we doing about it? I hone the Minister will tell us to-day, because the facts at <span class="col_5953-5954" refersTo="page_0223"/>our disposal indicate that we have little contact with the E.E.C., and that the statistical information we require is not available. Here I want to say how pleased I am that the Department has sent out a questionnaire which will give us some basic information in regard to these vital statistics, and I hope that as the result of it we will be in a better position to deal with this matter. Organized industry has said for some considerable time that the report produced by their economist whom they sent over to Europe at their expense is the only comprehensive document that is available on the situation in Brussels, and I understand that they have gone so far as to say to the Minister that if he cannot find an economist they might be able to make one available to the Government. I see from the remarks of Mr. Steyn at the convention in Johannesburg that the Government is apparently not very keen on having private individuals being dispersed among Government officials, but we would like to hear from the Minister, if an economist has not yet been appointed, what his attitude is towards this offer made by organized industry.</p>

<p>I would like to ask one or two questions. What representations have been made to the Government by exporting firms who fear that they will lose their export markets? Secondly, does the Minister believe it is possible for us to become an associate member of the E.E.C. or not, and if not, what steps can be taken under G.A.T.T. to protect our interests?

<p>I believe only in South Africa. I am not a pessimist. I am not sitting on an ash-heap, and that is the reason why the United Party is in the position in which it is. I believe in loyalty to my nation. If one takes only the development of industries during the time this Government has been in power, it proves my whole case. Whereas the turnover during the United Party r&#x00E9;gime was about &#x00A3;500,000,000, it is to-day more than &#x00A3;2,000,000,000. That is the reply to the allegations of a group of people who are absolute pessimists and who are trying to break down everything that has been built up in S.A., just for the sake of making a little political capital, which they are not making anyhow because the public knows them too well already. Some hon. members here spoke about agriculture. I do not want to reply to that, but I just want to tell them that there was a time when our people were so hungry that they had to stand in queues as the result of the agricultural policy of the United Party. But I want to pass on to something else.</p>

<p>I want to discuss this splendid ideal we have, the Orange River scheme. [Laughter.] That just shows the intelligence of hon. members opposite. That scheme will be built with two objects in view. The one is the decentralization of industry, and I want to speak about the role industry will play in our development. We have the Tennessee Valley in America, and it is power which made a success of that scheme, and that is what I want to discuss. I just want to tell the Minister that I believe that there will be great industrial development as the result of the Orange River scheme. The Tennessee Valley scheme was built in three areas which were the poorest and the dryest areas in America, but as the result of the general development which took place there those are to-day the most prosperous areas in America. In view of the fact that the Tennessee Valley and the Orange River have much the same location, I feel that we should discuss the industrial development there. In the upper parts of that valley power is generated for industrial development. That is in the first 300 miles of the Tennessee Valley where one finds all those large power-stations which led to the decentralization of industry, and there we to-day have the greatest development in America and the decentralization of industries. From Knoxville downwards, the top part of the Tennessee Valley, one finds one factory after another. As the result of the cheap power available there&#x2014;and water power is the cheapest power available&#x2014;one finds that there was so much development in those areas that the other states in America were even jealous of it. They point out that those areas have the cheapest power and that they are therefore more privileged than the other states. Even the atomic power which was developed there was done by means of the cheap power available there. Then one also finds the large phosphate factories which were war-time factories but which were converted after the war into phosphate factories which enabled agriculture to produce cheaply. It is essential that the agricultural development in this country should go hand in hand with the development of the Orange River scheme. Just as in America, we should try to bring the fertilizer factories nearer to the agricultural areas in order to keep down railage as much as possible. The industrial development in those areas will also promote agricultural development. Sir, I had the honour of spending seven days in the Tennessee Valley with the authorities there, and I wish my hon. friends who have never been there could see what development has taken place there. We can have the same development in this country, but we shall have to establish a body to co-ordinate all the various activities. Such a body must consist of representatives of agriculture and industry and other interested parties. We cannot expect this co-ordination to be left to the departments only; a body will have to be established consisting of representatives of all the people who in future will derive benefit from the Orange River scheme, viz industries, labour, agriculture, etc. The planning will take years, and seeing that it is such a great project I want to ask that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs should already start planning at this stage, together with the other Departments. The first results of the development of this scheme will only be derived after six years, but the complete planning must be done before then. I want to point out that as the result of the development of this scheme there <span class="col_5955-5956" refersTo="page_0224"/>will also be great industrial development in the Eastern Province, where more than ten power stations will be built, where one already has national roads and railways. I feel that we should all be grateful for having this great project, and although there are people who to-day talk about the Orange River scheme in a derogatory manner, we must admit that it is one of the most ambitious schemes ever tackled in South Africa. It reminds me of the days when diamonds were discovered in South Africa and when later gold was also discovered. The discovery of diamonds and gold created a new future for South Africa, but I say that this Orange River scheme is of as great potential importance to our future as the discovery of gold was. I believe that we must have gold for the development of the country, but we need this scheme just as much. They must help each other; the one complements the other, and therefore I want to say that we should already start making plans for the future.</p></speech>

<p>I should have liked to follow up what the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has just said about the Orange River scheme, but I think a better opportunity to discuss this matter will be when we have plans before us instead of promises.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is a very natural remark because I was just going to indicate that having listened to some of the members opposite&#x2014;and I will exclude some but certainly not the first two who entered this debate&#x2014;it seems quite clear that they have changed this motto to read, &#x201C;By gebrek aan argumente word mens persoonlik&#x201D;. My colleague, the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), has pointed out that as the world&#x2019;s largest gold producer South Africa is more dependent than almost any other country on international trade, and yet our external trade contacts are possibly at a lower ebb to-day than they have ever been before. Moreover, the Government&#x2019;s stranglehold on private enterprise by means of arbitrary control and authoritarian restrictions is greater now than ever before.</p>

<p>The export section of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department which was created a short while ago and showed much promise, now seems to have faded into insignificance. The Director of Export Promotion resigned at the end of 1961, and as far as I am aware that position is still vacant. If an appointment has been made, I hope the hon. the Minister will let us know and tell us when it was made. If the post is still vacant I hope he will tell us what he intends doing about it. According to Press information the Export Advisory Committee has apparently not met since August 1961, and I hope the hon. the Minister will give us some information in that regard as well. There has also been a failure on the part of the Minister to follow up the special Trade Commission&#x2019;s recommendations in regard to strengthening the permanent Trade Commission staff overseas, and again I ask the hon. the Minister to tell us precisely what has happened there. Again, one would like him to give us plans and not promises. It is no wonder therefore that the hopes of the business community are now being directed at the establishment of an Export Corporation to provide specialist export services in the commercial capitals of the world. All I can say is that that seems to me to be a substitute because of the Government&#x2019;s failure in regard to the promotion of export trade. It is at the present moment the most promising outcome of the Export Trade Convention which is sitting at present. Sir, to hold export trade conventions is all very well, but not sufficient. At this very time when the centre of gravity of world affairs is shifting from the glories of empires to the growth of nations and when the door is being opened in Africa to more freedom for more people, an inevitable result of which is that the masses are to-day counting for more than they ever did before, this Government, for purely ideological reasons, is prepared to close the door to markets which are virtually on our doorstep and to ignore this growing economic demand in new Africa. I emphasize this because of the paradox of the Government&#x2019;s approach to this rising of self-assertion of the masses, which is taking place here and elsewhere in Africa. The paradox of the situation is entirely one of the Government&#x2019;s own making through its own policy, and it is this; Although the Prime Minister and his Government have declared their intention and their willingness to give not only <i>de facto</i> but also <i>de jure</i> recognition to this growth of political consciousness and this right of self-determination to the African peoples in the Transkei, yet on the other hand the Government declines or neglects to give any sort of official commercial recognition to the emergent Black States on the rest of the African Continent. In no single State in this new Africa, south of the Sahara, has South Africa got an official representative. In the whole of new Africa it has neither diplomatic nor consular nor trade representation. Such trade representation as there is, is still restricted to those countries where it existed when this Government got into power, or before this Government got into power. Meanwhile practically every other nation is expanding its economic interests and its trade associations in this new market. The hon. the Minister is reported as having said at the Export Trade Convention that South Africa should look to the established markets rather than to the newly developing markets. I hope he will take this opportunity of expanding on that aspect of the matter because it seems to me short sighted and certainly not in the trade interests of South Africa. You see, Sir, I myself have taken the trouble to see what is happening in that regard in some of these new States, particularly those on the west <span class="col_5957-5958" refersTo="page_0225"/>coast of Africa. I described the situation which I saw there two years ago in these words I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What the absence of trade representation indicated is that South Africa is sadly lagging behind other countries of the world in making trade contacts in these parts of Africa. There is in the first place a complete lack of appreciation in Government circles of what the economic and business opportunities of this new Africa are; and, secondly, there is an absence of any official effort to create a climate of goodwill in order to promote an export trade to what is one of South Africa&#x2019;s most natural markets. Thus far, not only have the racial ideologies of the present Government of South Africa clouded their vision in regard to what is happening in the rest of Africa, but their racial policies have become a complete barrier to the forging of suitable political and commercial links with the newly emerging African States.</block>

<p>Sir, the position has not improved in the two years; it has only become worse. To emphasize what the position is I ended my discription of the position by adapting, as I had seen the position, the views and the language used some years before by Gen. Smuts. This is how I adapted his views&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For better or for worse a new Africa has emerged and the White races in South Africa must face this new situation which they have helped to create. Africa has become one of the major economic projects of the Twentieth Century, and the repercussions thereof on the trade of the world may be very far-reaching yet.</block>

<p>The President of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange expressed the same sentiments recently much more crisply. He said in effect that it was incongruous for South Africa to seek markets in the East and to ignore those on our very doorstep. Sir, I endorse that and I endorse it completely. It is no answer to the Government&#x2019;s failure to face changing circumstances in the rest of Africa for hon. members opposite to talk, as they did again to-day, of these new States being unfriendly and to ask &#x201C;Who started trade boycotts?&#x201D; or for the hon. the Minister of Finance to say somewhat gloatingly, after he had quoted certain statistics in the Budget debate, &#x201C;So much for boycotts&#x201D;. Sir, that is not the way in which trade and commerce on an international scale are conducted. Rebuffs in international trade must be expected from time to time. Small men might talk in the way they do to-day and have done previously from the benches opposite, but one expects something better and bigger from the Government.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. FOUCH&#x00C9; (Jnr.)</person>:</from>

<p>What I have to say here will not detain the House long. Actually, it does not fit in with the course the debate took this morning, but I have a matter that I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister. We have heard a lot recently about the coming great developments in regard to the building of dams in the Orange River. I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether his Department has already investigated, or whether he is busy investigating, the possibility of generating hydro-electric power at those dams which are to be built in the Orange River, and whether the Minister&#x2019;s Department has, perhaps, negotiated with Escom to generate this power if it cannot be done by the State itself. Then I should like to know what the possibilities are of linking up the hydro-electric power generated there with the power already generated by Escom in order to have a network of power lines which will supply the Southern Free State and also the Northern Cape with the same power which is now being used in other places situated nearer to Escom itself. I should like to know whether it is possible in this way also to supply the Southern Free State and the Northern Cape with cheaper electric power.</p>

<p>Secondly, I just want to bring another matter to the notice of the hon. the Minister, namely this: We often hear complaints that articles manufactured in this country are not up to standard. Some of my voters have brought it to my notice that certain plough shares, <i>inter alia</i>, are not of the same quality as others. I know that if these people make use of the Bureau of Standards they will be protected against this sort of thing, by buying articles which bear the mark of the Bureau of Standards. I just want to ask the Minister whether it is possible in some way of other to compel all articles manufactured and sold to the public to bear the mark of the Bureau of Standards, so that the wrong impression will not be created that locally manufactured articles are necessarily of an inferior quality. I just want to have the Minister&#x2019;s opinion in regard to these two matters.</p></speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When business was interrupted at the lunch hour, I had referred to the fact that the Government&#x2019;s vision about what was happening in Africa had been completely clouded by its political policy, and I had commented on the Government&#x2019;s failure or neglect to give any sort of official of commercial recognition to the emerging States of Africa. I pointed out that it was no answer to the Government&#x2019;s failure to criticize what had happened in the past. I also pointed out that rebuffs in international trade were something that must be expected from time to time, and that the Government must take the long view in regard to matters of that kind. You see, Sir, the &#x201C;Boston Tea Party&#x201D; made history, but it certainly never stopped trade. In the same way the Government must take the long view in regard to this matter. It must not be influenced by the truculent and uncompromising views which are expressed from that side of the House at times. I hope the hon. <span class="col_5959-5960" refersTo="page_0226"/>the Minister will take steps and will inform the House that he intends taking steps to ensure that South Africa has trade representation in the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>I commented on the question of export trade. But to stimulate export trade alone is not sufficient. As I indicated during the budget debate, little or nothing is being done at present to stimulate the local markets. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree that the most effective way of doing that is to boost domestic buying power, for only if you have an expanding local market can you expect to produce efficiently enough to compete in an export market. I think that has been the experience in all other exporting countries in the world. One of the most obvious ways of expanding buying power is to raise the level of wages of the workers, particularly the African workers in our case. I hope that the Minister will not try to avoid this issue by trying to pass the buck to someone else&#x2014;possibly his neighbour, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Sir, this is an economic issue, it is not a racial issue at all, and it is an economic common place that anything which restricts the earning power of the African workers will also restrict their buying power. As I say, it is an economic issue, and the former chairman of the Board of Trade expressed the view that that was a method, a very suitable method, of stimulating the local markets. The Federated Chamber of Industries, and in particular the Midlands Chamber of Industries, have stressed this and have asked the Government to give a lead in regard to this very necessary stimulant for the local market. If the hon. the Minister will read this morning&#x2019;s issue of the <i>Cape Times</i> he will find that a similar plea is made by the Chamber of Commerce. Sir, there is this need for stimulating the local market. I submit that this is a suitable matter for investigation by the Board of Trade, and I hope that the Minister will give some assurance that something of that nature will be done.</p>

<p>There are just two other aspects that I would like to raise with the hon. the Minister. The first is what the Government&#x2019;s policy is in so far as the motor industry is concerned in regard to the increase in the local content of motor vehicles. Although the proposed establishment of the Synthetic Rubber Industry at Sasol is still only in the planning stage, and has not yet reached anything further than the blue-print, the Government&#x2019;s own outlook in regard to this matter has advanced considerably. In reply to a recent question asked by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Mr. Dodds), the Minister gave a clear statement setting out the Government&#x2019;s policy. But the motor industry has taken the matter much further: they are still being left in doubt as to what the Government&#x2019;s policy is in regard to this question of local content&#x2014;how and on what basis it is going to be calculated. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give us some further details in this regard. Then, finally, there is this question of the cuts in tariffs arising from negotiations which have taken place between the United Kingdom and the European Common Market. In reply to a question which the hon. member for Jeppes asked some time ago, the Minister naturally took a cautious view of the matter, and said that it was something that has still to be considered and dealt with. I hope that he will now be able to give the House far more information at this stage, because it is clear from the local Press that the position is not a static one, and that negotiations are proceeding still further in other directions as well between the United Kingdom and members of the Common Market.</p></speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The criticism voiced by hon. members opposite has concerned mainly four subjects. In the first place it concerned our economic growth, which was doubted by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje). The second matter concerned the European Common Market and the question was asked what the attitude of the South African Government was to that organization; the third point of criticism was in respect of import control, and fourthly they discussed exports in general, and particularly our expors to the African states.</p>

<p>I want to deal with these four matters separately, and although one could speak at length on each of these subjects, I shall do my best to deal with them as briefly as possible. In the first place, in regard to our economic expansion, I must say that I really feel sorry every time the hon. member for Jeppes has to get up here and cast doubt on the economic development of our country in a debate like this. On such occasions the hon. member is really a tragic figure. There must be a conflict in his mind, between the economist on the one hand and the politician on the other. As an economist the hon. member must surely know what the actual position is. As a businessman serving on the boards of various companies which, as far as I know, are making progress, he must surely know what conditions are in South Africa. He must surely know of the growth we have in South Africa at the moment. As an economist he must know the economic figures and principles and methods of calculation, but as a politician he certainly has to paint a dark picture, and then economic facts and principles and yardsticks are simply thrown overboard, and the hon. member tells us that we must ignore the ordinary yardsticks of economic growth. He actually pleaded with me not to talk in this House again about capital investment and all the other things we always take as the yardsticks in regard to the economic picture. He says he knows we will do it, but I must please not do it. Because the hon. member knows that if we apply the normal barometers of economic growth, the yardsticks, which are used right throughout the world, we completely dispose of his standpoint. I, and also other members, in debates in recent years, have pointed to the great growth which has taken place in South Africa in regard to the national income, savings, investment and capital formation, in regard to consumers&#x2019; expenditure and industrial <span class="col_5961-5962" refersTo="page_0227"/>development, both in volume and in variety, and in respect of agriculture, mining, the infrastructure, exports&#x2014;we used numerous yardsticks in the past and proved that there was growth in every sphere in South Africa, and even now during these most difficult times. But now the hon. member for Jeppes says, &#x201C;Do not mention those things&#x201D; He now wants to apply two new yardsticks to determine economic growth, the one being employment and the other consumption.</p></speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Are those not yardsticks?</p></speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. Let us take each of them separately. I do not deny that employment is a yardstick for assessing economic growth. I do not doubt that one should use the statistics in regard to employment as one of the yardsticks. But if one does so, one must make sure that one&#x2019;s statistics are complete. The hon. member himself referred to the &#x201C;lamentable state&#x201D; of our statistics, but then he uses those statistics as a yardstick to prove that there is no growth in South Africa. He does not make full use of the statistics because he uses only industries and construction as yardsticks for the economic growth of South Africa. Sir, the employment in construction and in factories is not the only yardstick for the economic growth of a country. There are mining, agriculture, the fishing industry, forestry, commerce, the professions, the services rendered, the Provincial Administrations, the Public Service and numerous other activities which the hon. member conveniently leaves out of the picture. Surely the hon. member knows that in the economic growth of any nation there comes a time when industry does not employ people at such an ever-increasing rate, particularly as the result of mechanization, and that employment is mainly spread over the tertiary industries. Why does the hon. member keep quiet about that? Why does he concentrate only on that one point, employment in industry and in the construction business, and why does he keep quiet about all the other forms of employment, particularly in the tertiary activities?</p></speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>The figures are not available.</p></speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member also neglected to mention that in these comparative figures mentioned by his State corporations and State construction works, as well as the statistics in regard to factories, were not included. Employment is not the only yardstick. Apart from the fact that employment in South Africa is at a comparatively high level, we must take into account that a certain amount of unemployment is caused by mechanization. We have proved that there is growth in all these spheres, but to the extent that we mechanize more there will be a greater measure of unemployment. The hon. member shakes his head, but it is true.</p></speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Does that happen to the member countries of the Common Market in Europe?</p></speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>We can initiate a long debate on that point. Those countries are great producers of capital goods. There some of the unemployment resulting from mechanization is absorbed by the industries manufacturing capital goods, which is not the case here.</p>

<p>Another point raised by the hon. member and certain other hon. members, which is also of great interest, is that they plead for higher wages, particularly for the Bantu. Do those hon. members not know that much of the unemployment, particularly amongst the Bantu to-day, is due to the higher wages paid by certain industries? There are many factories&#x2014;I know them and hon. members know them&#x2014;which paid a certain amount, say R5,000 a month, in Bantu wages, and they increased their Bantu wages by, say 10 per cent. But they did not increase the sum of R5,000 by 10 per cent. They are still paying the same total amount in wages, but they employ fewer Bantu. That is also my reply to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), that this question of increased Bantu wages is not a matter on which one can just give a reply and say that we must increase wages because we want greater purchasing power in the country. It is a very complicated matter and unless it is handled very cautiously it will cause greater unemployment in the country. I also want to point out to the hon. member for Jeppes that employment is not the only yardstick, also for another reason. We have in South Africa today a tremendous influx of Natives from outside. It is estimated that there are 1.3 million foreign workers here. That is not the normal population growth which has to be absorbed by industry, but it is abnormal in the sense that tens of thousands of Bantu are continuously crossing our borders, which of course must have its effect on employment in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member also used the other yardstick of consumption. He keeps quiet about the fact that the real <i>per capita</i> income increased by 30 per cent during the r&#x00E9;gime of this party. He keeps quiet about the fact that between the years 1950 and 1961 the money spent on consumer goods increased in South Africa from R1,686,000,000 to R3,531,000,000, more than double. The expenditure on consumer goods was more than doubled in 11 years. The consumption of food is not a yardstick. I do not know whether I understood the hon. member correctly, but he mentioned the example here of food surpluses. I hope he did not mean it that way. He regarded the food surpluses in South Africa as proof of our economic deterioration. If that is what he meant, I want to tell him that if food surpluses are proof of economic deterioration, then America is certainly the most backward country in the world to-day, and China the country which is most highly developed economically. Food consumption is not always a yardstick. We have data showing that the Bantu, as his wages <span class="col_5963-5964" refersTo="page_0228"/>increase, does not necessarily buy more food, but that he uses his money to buy clothes and furniture, radios and other articles. On the contrary, we find that they use a large proportion of their income to-day to buy motor-cars, with the result that the Bantu in South Africa to-day own 100,000 motor-cars, which is proportionately more than the Russians do. The hon. member referred to the retail trade which has not increased, or at least not to the extent that he considered necessary. But that is not a yardstick either. The retail trade is only a partial yardstick because the public do not always spend their income in the retail trade, but save some of it, or use it for services instead of buying articles in the retail trade. As prosperity increases, a larger percentage of our income is used for services. The hon. member selected his own two yardsticks, and I think you will agree with me, Sir, that the yardsticks he selected are very doubtful ones.</p>

<p>No, the fact is simply this, to put it briefly: South Africa to-day stands on the threshold of new economic growth. South Africa stands poised to-day to climb to new heights in the economic sphere. That is the conclusion arrived at by businessmen and economists and by visitors from various parts of the world. We find proof of that in our increased national production, in our gold production, and in the optimistic spirit amongst our people; we find it in the gross savings and capital formation in the country, in our increased reserves, in the increase of liquidity, in the confidence the world has in us, in the new spirit of optimism one notices every day when coming into contact with businessmen in South Africa. If only the hon. member had read the <i>Sunday Times</i> of a few weeks ago, he would have found that it had practically a whole page about the new economic undertakings in South Africa. And what was contained in that page in the <i>Sunday Times</i> about new economic undertakings, impressive as it was, can be doubled and supplemented. In that regard I want to mention a few other things also. We often hear people talk about us being isolated in the economic sphere. I do not want to go into the whole matter, but in regard to isolation and the drying up of foreign capital, let me just repeat the figures I mentioned in a previous debate, that my Department, the import section, last year received 201 applications from people asking for permits for the importation of raw materials and capital goods for new industries and the expansion of industries, involving a total capital of R27,000,000, and 40 per cent of that capital was foreign capital. In the first quarter of this year there were 51 similar applications, and 60 per cent of the capital involved in the establishment of new industries consisted of foreign capital. That proves to me that the foreigner, perhaps even more than the local entrepreneur, and perhaps more than the hon. member for Jeppes, sees great possibilities in South Africa, and that they are developing the future of the country.</p>

<p>Another matter referred to here was the European Economic Community, and you will allow me, Sir, to pause to deal with this matter because it is of the greatest importance to South Africa. I want to give hon. members opposite the assurance that the European Common Market is regarded by the Government and by myself as a very important thing. I want to assure them that it is regarded as perhaps the most important individual development in Europe in recent times, and as one which will definitely have its effect on Europe and on the Western world. And it is not only since last year, as the hon. member suggested, but right from the time this development first started that our Government and our Department, in co-operation with other Departments, started devoting the closest attention to the E.E.C. and making a study of its principles and of its potentialities and its possible effect on South Africa. And although those matters were not always published, hon. members can take it from me that my Department made use of every possible opportunity to become <i>aufait</i> with the developments in regard to the E.E.C.</p>

<p>This European Common Market is developing very fast now. Its object is to bring about greater trade by abolishing gradually over a period, all tariffs between those countries, and applying a common tariff <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> other countries. But the E.E.C. is much more than merely a trade bloc. The E.E.C. is also an economic unit which seeks to forge links in various other economic spheres between the present six member countries and those which may still join them, in order to make it a complete economic unit. But it is more than an economic unit. Its object is also to have a political unit, in order to strengthen Europe. That is the reason why in the beginning neutral countries, like Switzerland, Austria and Sweden hesitated to associate themselves with the E. E. C. In spite of the doubts which some people have, the E.E.C. has recently made fairly fast progress. The internal tariffs were abolished faster than was originally expected, and on 1 July the reduction on industrial goods will already be 50 per cent. Even in the sphere of agriculture, which provided difficulties, a start has been made with the abolition of tariffs <i>inter se</i>, and an outside tariff has already been drawn up which will be the arithmetical average of all the separate tariffs of the six states.</p>

<p>Now the question is how the E.E.C. will affect South Africa. To put it briefly, we must accept that the E.E.C. will affect us, because the tariffs between these six countries will be abolished and goods will be able to move freely over their borders, whilst South Africa will be faced with a tariff wall in those countries, and there are certain of our products which will definitely be affected. I cannot go into all these matters to-day. I can, however, say that approximately 70 per cent of our exports to the Common Market countries will hardly be affected at all, because there will be either no tariffs or only a very low tariff against us, or because they are products which are not produced at all, or only to a very limited extent, in those countries. But what will be affected <span class="col_5965-5966" refersTo="page_0229"/>are certain of our products like fruit, jams, fish, eggs, mealies, fish meal, wines, etc. But we are also affected by the fact, as was mentioned by one of the hon. members opposite, that the African states will become associated with the Common Market, and when these African states which were dependancies of the countries which are now associated in the Common Market eventually have free access to the Common Market, it means that whilst they have free access we will be faced with a tariff wall. It will affect our competitive position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> those African states.</p>

<p>But now the great question facing us to-day is the possibility of Britain joining the Common Market. We know that in the beginning Britain was hesitant, for three weeks. In the first place, because of the <i>supra</i>-national character of the Common Market, Britain was not prepared to abandon its sovereignty. In the second place there was a great difference between the agricultural policy of Britain and the possible agricultural policy of the Common Market countries. In the third place, and this is important, there were the Commonwealth preferences which Britain had with the Commonwealth countries, and which was contrary to the principles of the E.E.C. Now we can take it that if Britain joins it will probably be accompanied by the abandonment of the Commonwealth preferences and the Ottawa preferences. Because it concerns not only the Commonwealth preferences, but also the preferences we enjoy, no longer as a Commonwealth country, but the preferences based on the Ottawa agreements of 1932. Britain has intimated that it will try to negotiate special conditions for the Commonwealth countries. The British Prime Minister stated that he would not join it on such terms as would do &#x201C;grave injury&#x201D; to the Commonwealth countries. A few days ago a report was published about what Mr. Sandys said, when he remarked that if Britain had to choose between the Commonwealth and the E.E.C. it would choose the Commonwealth. From that we must infer, reading between the lines, that some means will be evolved to reconcile Commonwealth preferences with membership of the E.E.C. Now, how will it affect us if Britain joins and the Commonwealth preferences and the Ottawa Agreement have to be terminated? I cannot go into details, but I just want to say that we sold to Britain in 1961 approximately 32.9 per cent of our exports, and of this 32.9 per cent of our total exports to Britain, 44 per cent is subject to tariff preferences. If we are to lose these preferences in Britain, it will mean that the Common Market countries, which in many respects were our competitors, will have free access to Britain, that the tariff wall against them will be broken down, and that the comparatively free access we enjoyed will be complicated by a tariff wall. We will be faced with difficulties from two sides. There will be free access for our opponents and tariffs imposed against us. Certain of our products will be affected to an appreciable extent, like wine, fruit, canned fruit, vegetables, sugar, eggs and dairy products, hard-board, apple extract, ferromanganese and certain chemical products, etc. I have stated the position as briefly as possible, perhaps as unfavourably as possible, as to how South Africa will be affected if we lose our tariff preferences in Britain. But perhaps the position will not be so unfavourable.</p>

<p>There are certain factors that may operate in our favour. In the first place, it may be that the external tariffs of the Common Market countries will eventually be much lower than they are now, and that it will still be possible for us to sell in the Common Market, in spite of the tariffs. I believe that if our producers and manufacturers continue producing quality goods, they will be able to sell their products in other countries in spite of those tariff walls, and that we should not frighten our manufacturers and producers by telling them that it will be impossible to get into those countries because of the tariff walls which will be built around Britain and the Common Market countries. It is possible, particularly if Britain joins, that the tariff wall of the E.E.C. will be lower than it is now. The possibility also exists that South Africa may use the preferences it now enjoys in Britain on the basis of the Ottawa agreements elsewhere in another way to our advantage. There is the possibility that the seasonal differences between South Africa and Europe particularly in regard to fruit and vegetables, may operate to our benefit. There is the possibility that if the preferences are abolished there will be a reasonably long transitional period to enable us to adapt ourselves. There is also the possibility that Britain may succeed in obtaining certain concessions when it joins the Common Market for the Commonwealth countries and for a country like South Africa which entered into an agreement with Britain at Ottawa. The possibility exists that with a stronger Britain and a stronger Europe in the economic sphere, we may obtain a much larger market, even with tariffs against us, then we would have had without tariffs if Britain is weak economically.</p></speech>

<p>A weak Britain?</p></speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Without criticizing, it is a fact that Britain has in recent years been struggling with its balance of payments and to maintain the standard of living of its people. That is one of the reasons why Britain wants to join the Common Market. We must ask ourselves whether it will not be better for us to trade with a stronger Britain and a stronger Europe than if they are not as economically strong as they should be.</p>

<p>Now, what of the future, and what should we do? Questions were asked, <i>inter alia</i>, by the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) as to how South Africa can link up with the E.E.C. My reply briefly is that South Africa cannot join the E.E.C. We cannot become a <span class="col_5967-5968" refersTo="page_0230"/>member for the simple reason that we are not a European state. The second thing possible is association with the E.E.C., like the position of the African states to-day. In terms of the Rome Treaty the association of states outside Europe with the Common Market is possible in principle. But as we see the matter, it is not the policy of the E.E.C. to allow states outside Europe to be associated, except those states which are or were dependancies of the present members of the E.E.C., and that they are not in the least desirous of allowing other states to be associated with them. Then the question in our mind is also, even if we can associate, whether it will be desirable for us to accept the discipline of the E.E.C., which would mean that we would gradually have to reduce the protection of our industry and gradually freely allow the products of a strong and economically experienced and developed Europe to enter our country, and whether we can afford to do so. At the moment neither of these two courses seem possible to us. Therefore it is necessary to seek other ways of safeguarding our trade and our exports to the Common Market, whether Britain joins it or not, but even more so if Britain joins. I believe that there are possibilities for establishing some sort of relationship between South Africa and the E.E.C. which will to a certain extent compensate South Africa for what it will lose if Britain should join. Hon. members will understand it if I do not want to go into the details of this now, because it may perhaps be the basis for negotiations. I also believe that such negotiations for compensating South Africa in some way or other for what it loses, if it does lose its preferences in Britain, can and should be carried out within the framework and in the spirit of G.A.T.T. My interpretation of the spirit and the principles of this agreement is that it allows customs unions in various countries when third parties do not suffer as the result of it. My interpretation of the principles of G.A.T.T. is that if we and the Commonwealth countries lose a lot if Britain joins the Common Market, we will be entitled to some form of compensation in terms of G.A.T.T., and that it will have to be given to us. It must be realized that South Africa also plays its part in world trade, that it will make its contribution to world trade, and that it cannot be allowed that South Africa through the loss of, say, 20 per cent of its market should be put into a worse position as a partner in international trade.</p>

<p>I therefore want to say that I am going overseas myself within three weeks in order to initiate the negotiations. In the meantime much information has already been obtained. I have already done that. We have had close and continuous contacts through our ambassador in Brussels and our other ambassadors and by means of our trade commissioners who serve as listening posts for us, and in numerous other ways at congresses and by means of G.A.T.T. We were in close contact with the E.E.C. countries and we tried to obtain information in every possible way, so that it could not be said that we merely allowed things to develop. Within the framework of G.A.T.T. our delegations fought every year for the interests of South Africa, in so far as the Common Market is concerned. We are fairly <i>aufait</i>. But because the point has now been reached actually to take action, it has become necessary for me to go overseas and to discuss matters with the six member countries of the Common Market, and put our problems to them, and to see what the best is we can do for South Africa.</p>

<p>There has been reference to the appointment of an economist. I just want to say that in spite of what was said by hon. members opposite, an economist has already been found. I shall send the hon. member for Jeppes an invitation one of these days to go and see him off at the airport. It is hoped that he will be able to start working at the beginning of July. Due to the fact that certain formalities have to be observed, as in the case of all appointments abroad, I am sorry I cannot announce his name to-day. I hope to be able to do it within a few days. If I do so, I think hon. members will agree with me that we have succeeded in obtaining one of the outstanding persons in our country, a man who not only knows economics but also knows the Public Service of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to discuss import control briefly. During the course of last year I was compelled to impose import control, and hon. members know what the circumstances were. We know that import control, and currency control which accompanied it, were responsible for our foreign reserves climbing to record heights during the past year. If there is one thing which instilled confidence in the mind of the financier and the industrialist overseas in the strength of our economy, it is the increase in our foreign reserves to this record level in a period of less than a year. If there is one thing which strengthened the confidence of the world in our economy, it is the fact that in the past year, which was one of the most difficult years South Africa has ever experienced in the economic sphere, due to boycotts, due to uncertainties, due to leaving the Commonwealth and bad propaganda made against us, our currency reserves increased to this extent. As the result of the increase in our reserves, pressure is continually being exerted on me, as the hon. member for Jeppes has also seen fit to do, either to abolish or appreciably to relax import control. I do not know whether the hon. member for Jeppes spoke on behalf of commerce or on behalf of industry or on behalf of the economy of the country. I do not know what the hon. member would tell the industrialists of this country if he makes this suggestion. He spoke about industrial development, and I wonder what the industrialists would have told him if he had gone to them with this plea that he made here to-day.</p></speech>

<p>Is the object of import control then to protect industry?</p></speech>

<from><span class="col_5969-5970" refersTo="page_0231"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I promise the hon. member that I will come to that question. The easy way of evading a question is to ask a counter question! Sir, I believe that in spite of the welcome increase in our foreign reserves, South Africa cannot yet afford to uplift import control, or even to relax it to any appreciable extent. We live in uncertain times, in which it is necessary rather to be cautious. Instead of perhaps relaxing import control and later again finding it necessary to increase it, we should be cautious, because if we do that it can result in instability in our economy, which is undesirable. I think we must spare commerce and industry that uncertainty. We must bear in mind that South Africa is a country with a great tendency to import. But we must also bear in mind that we expect to have appreciable industrial expansion starting within the next six months, and with that industrial expansion and economic activity we can expect to have greater imports of capital goods and consumer goods and raw materials. It may then be that our reserves are not enough. Whilst R369,000,000 at the present moment seems satisfactory, we must realize that we are living in difficult times. There are boycotts against us; there is the problem of the E.E.C., and I will feel safe only if our reserves increase to an appreciate level. On the other hand, there are again those who believe that we should never relax import control; in other words, there are those who allege or expect us to use import control as protection for our industries, together with the import tariff. I want to tell those persons that the application of import control is subject to certain international obligations, viz. that import control may not be used to protect industries, but may only be used as a means of restoring the balance of payments position and that it should be abolished as and when the reserves improve. South Africa, which has faithfully fulfilled its obligation in this respect, does not intend to allow itself to be tempted to exceed the limits. It is, however, obvious that import control itself happens to protect industries; it so happens that it protects industries in this country, and it is obvious that any relaxation of import control must be applied in such a way that it will not seriously disrupt the industrial structure in the country unnecessarily. It is obvious that a Government always has to retain the right to determine to what extent the imports of certain classes of goods should be limited, in order to use to the best advantage the foreign exchange at its disposal, and not to waste it on unnecessary goods and goods which can be manufactured here. In other words, it is not our idea to use import control as protection for industry per se. The customs tariffs are the obvious way of doing that. The task of the Government in this respect is to maintain the balance between these two extreme points of view, and I can assure hon. member that it is not always such an easy task to keep that balance.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Benoni (Mr. Ross) and Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) expressed certain doubts in regard to our trade with the African states. The hon. member for Benoni has possibly misinterpreted a speech I made in Johannesburg a few days ago. In spite of that misinterpretation, I just want to tell him that it is my standpoint that we are deceiving ourselves if we believe that our essential market lies in the undeveloped states of Africa. South Africa is still the workshop of Africa, in the sense that industrially we are the highest developed country in Africa, and will remain so for an appreciable time, or for ever. But to believe that the African states should be our most important market, and that we should concentrate our exports particularly on them, is a fallacy which can only be to the detriment of our economy. In the first place we know that the purchasing power of the inhabitants of the African states is comparatively low. In the second place we know that they are mostly saddled with balance of payments problems. In the third place we know that where they receive political capital from outside, the first industries they will develop will be those we have here also; they will have the same type of industries and they will be at pains to manufacture their own goods and to protect their industries, and to keep our goods out. In the fourth place, most of the African states receive loans from elsewhere, and it is usually a condition of those loans that if that money or portion of it is to be used for purchases, those purchases must be made in the country of the lender. If we hope to develop large markets there, we will not only have to go and buy there, but we will also have to lend money to those countries.</p>

<p>Nor am I so optimistic about the tremendous future development of those countries, and their tremendous future potential markets. They have not the technicians nor the capital. Hon. members surely know that there is such a thing in economics as the capital coefficient. Generally, one has to invest R8 to get R2&#x2019;s development. In other words, if in Africa one wants to make possible a development for the inhabitants of R2 per annum and there are 250,000,000 of them, and you want to raise their standard of living by R250,000,000, one must invest four times that amount&#x2014;one must invest R1,000,000,000 to increase the standard of living of the inhabitants of Africa by R1 per annum. Where is all that capital to come from? I am not so optimistic about the possibilities of that market in the future.</p>

<p>The fact remains, Mr. Chairman, that the greatest international expansion of trade takes place between highly industrialized countries. The most highly industrialized countries of the West to-day trade with each other, and that trade has expanded faster than their trade with the undeveloped countries. Therefore I say that we must devote most attention to <span class="col_5971-5972" refersTo="page_0232"/>trade, not in Africa, but with the highly developed countries which have the purchasing power, and whose purchasing power is steadily increasing. That is where our future lies. Let us have the courage to enter those markets and not to fear that our products will not sell there.</p>

<p>Both hon. members misunderstood me by averring that I am supposed to have said that we should relinguish that market. I never said anything of the kind. I did not say we must turn our backs on the African markets. I only said that we should not regard them as the only and most important markets. We will still continue developing those markets. I may just say that in spite of boycotts our trade with the African states last year still amounted to R148,000,000. Two years ago it was R166,000,000. In these two years it fell by R18,000,000, the greatest decrease being in respect of the Federation, not because the Federation boycotted us, but due to economic circumstances there. We therefore still have a tremendous amount of trade with the African states, but it is the task of the exporters to develop that market. It is not only the task of the Government to do that work. We do not intend appointing trade commissioners there now, as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) suggested. Does he think we must go and ask those states to receive our trade commissioners whilst they are boycotting us? Would a nation&#x2019;s honour allow it to do so? Do you think those countries would receive our trade commissioners?</p>

<p>Then hon. members aver that it is our fault that we are boycotted. The hon. member for Benoni and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) said that it was all due to the political policy of the Government. If it is all this Government&#x2019;s fault, why did India then boycott South Africa in 1946? The first boycott of South Africa happened under the United Party, when General Smuts was Prime Minister, and for political reasons. But what do hon. members opposite suggest should be done to stop those boycotts? The hon. member says it is our political policy which causes it, and if they are in power that will not be the position. What are those hon. members prepared to pay for those markets? What concessions are they prepared to make to get those markets? It is very easy to say now that it is due to the Government&#x2019;s policy. Let us accept that. But what will they do? Will hon. members opposite comply with the demands of those states, with those political demands which really amount to interference in South Africa&#x2019;s affairs, the dictation of policy to us, absolute equality, one man, one vote, and the end of the White man in South Africa? That is what they want, and that is the only thine which will satisfy them. Are those hon. members prepared to pay that price? Sir, what does it really amount to? That is the political problem of South Africa to-day; that is the economic problem of South Africa. South Africa&#x2019;s economic troubles do not lie in its economic policy and its economic thinking, but our economic problems are all based on international political troubles which have an effect on our economy, and I am sure that those hon. members are just as little able to solve those political problems as we are, unless they are also prepared to sacrifice the South African nation.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister, amongst other things, made one important statement this afternoon. There are various questions we still wish to ask him. I think we should deal shortly with his statement about the Common Market. He has told us that he himself is shortly leaving for Europe to look into the matter. He has told us that he has actually appointed an expert to go over there. This expert will leave in July. For the first time, Sir, he has told us fairly fully what the Government&#x2019;s attitude is in regard to the European Common Market. Well, we have been pressing for some years in this House for some such statement from the Government. So far they have simply told us that they were watching events as, indeed the hon. the Minister has said this afternoon. But they have not given us any indication of what we believe to be the case, namely, that this Common Market holds the most serious implications as far as the future of our economy and trade is concerned. We never got an admission from the hon. the Minister until this afternoon. That is why I say it is an important statement. Because although it is some years too late, or later than it should have been, at any rate it is a step forward to know that our Government has at last awakened to the seriousness of the problem which confronts it in the event of the United Kingdom joining the European Common Market and throwing its weight into its development, and if a tariff wall is built round the whole Market. The hon. the Minister has told us that whilst 70 per cent of our exports&#x2014;by that I take it that he means 70 per cent of our exports to the United Kingdom&#x2014;would not be effected by the Common Market arrangements, because they are either duty free or else subject to a very low duty, in other words, they are raw materials required by the industries either of Britain or members of the Common Market, he does agree that as to the other 30 per cent&#x2014;which mounts to a very considerable sum&#x2014;we may be in very serious difficulty. He did not agree with the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig) who earlier in the day tried to repeat the attitude which the Government has taken up until now, namely, that there was not very much to worry about. I can remember the hon. the Minister making speeches to the effect that we might even benefit by the creation of a European Common Market and that we might be better off with it than without it. I think the hon. member for Mayfair would have been wiser had he waited until his Minister bad spoken before he came into this debate. Because he also for the first time knows how his Government views this position. Knowing <span class="col_5973-5974" refersTo="page_0233"/>that I am sure he will be more careful what he says about it in the future.</p>

<p>Whilst it is satisfactory to have got the Government to the point of admitting there is a problem, one cannot say that the attitude of the Government through the hon. the Minister, is in the least satisfactory. Because while they claim to have been keeping a very close eye indeed on its possible effects on this country, they do not seem to have any clear idea as to what can be done to mitigate those possible effects. The hon. the Minister said that whilst there were possible damages to our economy to be faced, notably in the case of primary products or manufactured primary products, he hoped that that might be off-set by lower tariffs in the Common Market, that the tariff wall round the Common Market might be lowered, thus enabling our industrial products, such as canned goods, to get over that wall. Secondly, he hoped that as a result of the development of the Common Market Europe as a whole would be more prosperous, including the United Kingdom, and would therefore be a larger and a better market with a higher purchasing power than it is at present and that we would reap our share of the benefit of that increased prosperity. Then he said something which I did not understand and which I hope he will elaborate when he speaks next time. He said he thought that G.A.T.T. came into this question, and that under the G.A.T.T. agreements customs unions were allowed but that other countries were not allowed to suffer as the result of those customs&#x2019; unions. I do not quite understand that, because if customs&#x2019; unions are allowed it is quite clear that some countries are going to lose business as the result of it. But the Minister said he thought that if as the result of the Common Market arrangements between Britain and The Six the Ottawa Agreements and the other preferences were to go&#x2014;and I wish the Minister would not talk about the Ottawa Agreements as if they were entirely individual trade treaties, because they are not; they were trade treaties, but they were trade treaties between members of the Commonwealth. It is no good saying they had nothing to do with the Commonwealth, because they had. If we had not been a member of the Commonwealth when the Ottawa Agreements were arrived at, we would not have been involved in them at all. [Interjections.] I understood the Minister to express the view that it was as the result of the Common Market agreement with Britain that the Ottawa agreements might fall away, and also the other preferences, and that in some way or other we should be entitled to some form of compensation for the loss of them. That is the point I do not understand, because I do not know who will compensate us for the loss of that trade. It may be, of course, that the Minister means that he may be able to negotiate other trade treaties to take their place, because of course he has by no means a weak hand when it comes to negotiating trade treaties. But I would like him to explain it more clearly because we are all concerned, just as he is, as to what will be done, and so far the Minister has simply told us that he hopes, if these things do come to pass, that the disastrous consequences that may face some of our agricultural industries may be averted, and he has indicated in a vague way how he thinks they may be averted, although personally I must say I cannot see much ground for hope in what he has said so far.</p>

<p>In regard to import control, the Minister said that he does not think we are in a position to relax it, because we live in uncertain times when anything may happen. Of course we agree that under this Government anything may happen, and therefore the Government is both to relax import control, because anything may happen and our reserves may go to pot. Perhaps the Minister could give us some idea of what he would regard as a safe margin. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) spoke at random and really only repeated what the Minister said, and he made no point to which I could be expected to reply. I assume that the few questions he put to the Minister will be answered by the Minister. But I have actually risen to digress somewhat from the direction the debate has taken so far, in order to make a few remarks about another aspect of the Minister&#x2019;s vote, namely in regard to the position of our scientists. With reference to the urgent need for scientists and the realization in all responsible quarters that we have arrived at a stage in our development where increased importance is attached to scientific training and research, as well as with reference to what the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services said the other day when he announced increased scales as well as promotion on merit, I should like to ask the Minister whether he will give consideration to the position, and I should like to ask his views on the present salary scales and the possibilities for promotion of scientists in the C.S.I.R. as well as in all the other research bodies in his Department. I should like to make the submission that we have come to a stage where we have to realize that we have to put a premium on scientific training and research, both in basic sciences as well as in applied sciences. In the first place, we are confronted with developments in the industrial sphere which requires our scientists, particularly our engineers, physicists and chemists, to do research themselves in regard to our problems. We have also arrived at the planning of our own arms industry, and furthermore there is the planning in regard to nuclear physics, all of them things that are making great demands on our own scientists, Moreover, it is a fact too that with our industrial planning we are going to make great demands on our engineers and physicists in the future, and because that is so, we have a great backlog to make up, as in all the other Western countries, including America, where it is <span class="col_5975-5976" refersTo="page_0234"/>realized that they are very far behind and attempts are being made to train more scientists. When I say that we should put a premium on scientific training and research and knowledge, I am mindful of a few things in particular.</p>

<p>In the first place, I am thinking of the salary scales for scientists that ought to be increased so as to make science more attractive to more people. Secondly I think that we should put a premium on the standard of university education and that a person who is prepared to carry on to the highest training, that is to say, to go from the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. to a doctor&#x2019;s degree, should be encouraged, for we do have a large number of scientists that are of great value as it is but would be of much greater value for the country if they were to carry on to the highest level of training. Thirdly, I think we should compensate our professional and scientific officers according to merit because there is a tendency for us to compare scientific achievement with achievements in other walks of life. That is why I think that merit should be judged on a different basis, and that it should fall under the direction of a board which should be established together with professional officers of the C.S.I.R. We should also realize that the availability of equipment is as important as the availability of scientists themselves. It is as important to us to put a premium on the availability of equipment and apparatus as it was to think deeply and broadly on the future of our defence, and I do hope that in that regard we shall also think deeply and broadly. I think we should be prepared to hand over a greater portion of our national income, not only for the training of people, but also in order to provide the necessary apparatus. Fifthly, I should like to say that we should put a premium on the training of scientists by giving our students an opportunity to obtain training by making more bursaries available to them, and in order to prevent students, who study with the aid of other private institutions and then are obliged first to render service to such a firm, and in the process of rendering service lose either their desire or the opportunity for further study, being lost for higher training. This practice, which is really an erosion of manpower, should be stopped. I think that if we were to make available to such a student the facilities for independent study from the beginning to have better opportunities of being absorbed by either the C.S.I.R. or other research quarters, we shall not have this loss that we cannot afford.</p>

<p>In a report of the S.A. Institute for Physics which appeared recently, it is clear that last year we had a shortage of 66 physicists, and that in 1964 we shall have a shortage of 95, without having regard to the extra needs that will arise in the mean time. To this I may only add that for every three mathematicians doing research outside university level to-day, there are two vacancies. At the present time there is a shortage of 40 per cent in respect of mathematicians alone, outside the universities. I should like to say at once to hon. members opposite, that they should not infer from what I have said here, that we are sending scientists out of the country for further study, and that that is why we are losing scientists. I should like to point out that since 1958 we have not had a nett loss of physicists. We lost three and got three from outside, and there is not such a great loss on that account that a point can be made of it. I should also like to say that we should get a revaluation of our school training. At the present time there is a tendency in our provincial education for our education to become broader and wider and shallower. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I do not want to take the question of the Common Market any further at this stage. The Minister is going overseas to investigate the position, and I hope he will be back in time to report to this House before the end of the Session on the results of his visit, and I hope his visit will be successful. But at present he is just whistling in the dark. I hope that when he gets over there he will be able to see daylight and come back with a song in his heart to cheer us up a bit. In so far as import control is concerned, the Minister has said that he is afraid to uplift it. I would like to warn him that the longer he delays in raising it, the more difficult he will find it to do, because the pressure will continually increase on him not to uplift it. It will increase from his own officials who are adminstering import control and from those people who, whilst it may not be Government policy to use import control for protective purposes, undoubtedly use it for that purpose to start industries they might not otherwise have started. The longer you put off raising import control, the more difficult it becomes to do it, and I speak with some experience here. Personally, I would rather see import control lifted, even if some of its restrictions have to be imposed again 12 months later. I would rather see it relaxed, and then possibly tightened again, than to keep it tight indefinitely in case something might happen in future.</p>

<p>There are two points which have been referred to, one by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) in regard to Sasol. He asked whether the Minister did not think the time had come for a second Sasol. I agree with him that the time may very well come for a further exploitation of the vast quantities of low-grade coal we have in the Transvaal and the Free State, but personally I doubt whether the time has quite arrived yet. because I do not think Sasol has been tidied up sufficiently to serve as an economic mode. We have something like R100,000,000 invested in Sasol and quite clearly it is over-capitalized. [Interjections.] The point is that as a trading concern it is hopelessly over-capitalized. The difference between a sound capital structure and what has actually been invested has given us an asset in the way of experience. I agree with that, but any future Sasol is intended <span class="col_5977-5978" refersTo="page_0235"/>not only to produce oil and petrol, but as the basis for a very wide and extensive secondary industry based on the products produced from that factory, and therefore the costing of those raw materials at an economic price is of the utmost importance. To enable Sasol to do that it is quite clear that sooner or later the whole question of the capital structure of Sasol should be examined and that some capital should be written off, and we always said that would have to be done sooner or later. I think the time is coming when that might be considered, and that it should be done before the question of a second Sasol is considered.</p>

<p>There is one other point on which I should like information from the Minister. We asked the Minister of External Affairs what he was doing about a consular service, but we got no reply from him. There is only R1,000 on the Estimates this year for the establishment of such a service, from which it is quite clear that we will not have such a service in the foreseeable future. It is also impossible to establish such a service at a moment&#x2019;s notice. But what does the Minister contemplate in respect of the trade work which consulates are expected to do all over the world pending the appointment of an adequate number of consuls in different parts of the world? In the Minister&#x2019;s own journal there are two references to this matter, one dealing with the South American states and the documentation required by Latin-American countries, and it points out that 12 out of the 19 require documentation, and it gives details of what that documentation is. There was also another one giving details of what is required by the Philippines, where there is a most complicated process for the consul in certifying documents and collecting fees for any exports from here to the Philippines. I do not know exactly what kind of documentation we require for goods imported into this country from say Japan, Britain or Germany, but I presume some kind of documentation is required by the customs department, and perhaps the Minister could tell us exactly what is required and what steps he is taking to see that those services are available to our importers and to exporters from the other countries to this country pending the establishment of an adequate consular service, which will obviously be a slow business.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened to the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and I thought he would tell us about the economic policy of the United Party, so that the electorate may know whither we shall be going when one day they come into power, as they tell us all day. I am afraid the hon. member had the temerity to refer to matters relating to Sasol, while not being conversant with those matters. At the present time Sasol is producing 250,000 tons of products per annum, that is about 10 per cent of our local consumption of petrol, and during the past year it had a turnover of R17,917,000, and their profit after allowing for depreciation, was R2,594,678.</p>

<p>That gives us about between 4 and 5 per cent interest on the capital outlay. We know that possibly more capital went into Sasol than we should have liked, but experiments were conducted throughout the years. South Africa is the only country in the whole world that produces petrol from coal, and all those experimental and capital expenses nevertheless made Sasol a profitable undertaking. At the moment we have the position in South Africa that 360,000,000 gallons of petrol are imported, as well as 37,500,000 gallons of lubricating oil and 388,000,000 gallons of crude oil that is refined here and converted into petrol, lubricating oil etc. Sasol does not produce lubricating oil. Here I should like to urge the Minister very strongly that we should take active steps to have lubricating oil also produced in South Africa. I feel it is not good enough that we as the leading economic country in Africa do not produce lubricating oil from our own resources.</p>

<p>What is the world position to-day? We find that about half of all the energy consumed in the world is derived from shale oil and natural gas. Against that we find that in South Africa nine-tenths of the energy we use is derived from coal. We also know that the world&#x2019;s resources are limited, and likewise the sources of crude oil are limited, and we also know that two-thirds of these sources are situated in the Middle East. New sources are being discovered continually, but the latest sources that have been discovered will, according to calculations, be sufficient for the world&#x2019;s requirements for 25 years only. The Western world never knows when they may be cut off from those sources. Then we in South Africa may perhaps have to supply them with oil, for Africa already produces 2 per cent of the oil that has been discovered in the world. Here I do not wish only to malign Sasol as the hon. member for Constantia has done, but I should like to make a very strong plea that although it has been announced that Sasol proposes to double its output within seven years, the Minister should do so within the next year or two, if possible, and I should like to give my reasons. In order to double the output of Sasol, about R60,000,000 will be required. We know that certain work of consolidation still remains to be done to consolidate Sasol in order to let the present course of production continue smoothly, but it is no longer such a big task. While this consolidation is taking place, the first steps towards doubling the factory could already be taken. It is just the same as in the building industry. The foundation of your one house is laid, and while the walls are going up you can lay the foundation of the second house. If the production of Sasol could be doubled, it will be a very profitable undertaking. The interest you can earn on the capital outlay with this additional investment, will increase from 4&#x00BD; per cent to about 10 per cent, and I should like to know from the hon. member for Constantia whether 10 per cent interest on your investment is not sufficient? We shall thereby <span class="col_5979-5980" refersTo="page_0236"/>also encourage other industries. We know that the synthetic gas used for petrol is the raw material for the artificial rubber factory, and as an artificial rubber plant at a cost of R7,000,000 is going to be established, I am afraid that Sasol might not be able, with this capacity, to produce enough raw materials for the artificial rubber plant, and still be able to produce sufficient petrol for our use. Sasol already produces 10 per cent of our petrol, but I feel it should be at least 20 per cent and more later. That is all I wish to say in that regard.</p>

<p>Then I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha). During the recent Budget debate we saw that the Opposition devoted only four hours and seven minutes to the Education Vote, whereas they devoted nearly 16 hours to Bantu Affairs, and then they are the Party that talks about White leadership. I say they are committing a crime against the Europeans. Where were the Opposition speakers when they had to plead for White leaders under that Vote? But I should like to do so this afternoon. I should like to urge the Minister to use his influence so that we may train managerial leaders in South Africa. It is correct that we can say we have a shortage of industrial leaders and scientists, but he requires one man to give a lead in a great industry. You require one man to act as managing director of Sasol, and if we take steps to train leaders, even if enormous bursaries are to be created, and if we were to take the cream, say 20 of the best students and see to it that they receive the very best training, it will help a lot. Those are the people who have to see to it that raw materials, labour and capital are brought together and that production should continue, and that the products that are produced, are sold. If we had industrial leaders, we will not have so many undertakings and so many businesses that become insolvent and go under either. If we have the right man at the head of affairs, I should like to submit that he will see to it that he and all his various divisions have enough scientists, enough salesmen and enough buyers to establish his industry properly, and to develop it and make it a profitable industry. I hope the hon. the Minister will consider this matter very seriously.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say to the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) that I have done my best personally to produce leaders of the kind that he requires for South Africa, but they have not always turned out the way I wanted them to turn out. Some of them are sitting on that side of the House. But I have hope for the future.</p>

<p>Sir, I am very glad that the hon. member for Sunnyside has mentioned Sasol this afternoon. Why do we not know sufficient about Sasol? Because the whole government and control of Sasol and the financing of Sasol, which we have criticized consistently from the beginning, has been wrong. In Sasol we have invested approximately R100,000,000 over a period of about 10 years and we have not had any interest; it has not paid a dividend. What we are discussing is this, that all these utility corporations such as Sasol, Iscor and Foscor, should be accountable to this Parliament because this Parliament produces the finance to establish and conduct the affairs of these utility corporations. We have argued this for years; I have done it year in and year out. I have asked that they should be accountable to Parliament, and my suggestion was that there should be established a third Select Committee similar to the Select Committee on Public Accounts or the Select Committee on Railways, and that the Committee should examine the accounts of these companies. Sasol and the I.D.C. especially produce annual reports. The I.D.C., established and paid for by this Parliament, will not tell us how the money is invested; we do not know how the money is spent; they will not give a proper report; and we have asked consistently that that should be done. Sir, it is difficult to break new ground. One cannot repeat the old story over and over again, but I have found new allies, and I am going to quote from the palmy days of the Nationalist Party when they were in opposition. I am quoting from Hansard, Vol. 47, of the year 1944 when the Nationalist Party Opposition reached a higher peak of respectability than they have ever reached since. It was the year in which the present Minister of Finance said that a Cabinet Minister should be rather like a judge, that Cabinet Ministers should not be directors of companies. <i>O tempora O mores!</i> We see what is happening, with our new Press baron, the hon. the Prime Minister. Now, Sir, I am going to quote from my allies. The first is a minor critic, but he became a Cabinet Minister in due course. He was one of the brighter lights of the Nationalist Party. I am quoting from a speech by Mr. F. C. Erasmus, who after wards became a Cabinet Minister. This is what he said&#x2014;(col. 1290)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is most dangerous to place public money in the hands of particular individuals, and not to be able to demand a report on the investments made&#x2014;it is most unsatisfactory that the Minister is not called upon to supply information about the way the money is invested. The Minister can tell us that stocks and shares have been bought, but he cannot tell us the industries in which the money has been invested. If the Chairman of the Corporation is not prepared to tell us the industries in which the money has been invested we, as a Parliament&#x2014;the body which has provided the money&#x2014;remains in the dark. I resent that. We are told that the Industrial Development Corporation recently Tabled its report. It naturally does so every year and it did so this year too, but I want to say to the Minister that if he himself does not know what is going on inside the Corporation and has nothing but the report, he cannot know what this large amount has been spent on, and how the Corporation intends spending the <span class="col_5981-5982" refersTo="page_0237"/>money it has for these conditional commitments of R2,800,000. It is not fair and it is not just towards Parliament. To a large extent it is public money which this Corporation is spending, yet we are not supplied with a full report on the Corporation&#x2019;s investments and activities.</block>

<p>In those days it was &#x00A3;1,400,000; look at it today! Now I come to the greatest authority on Economic Affairs in the Nationalist Party at the time, Mr. Eric Louw, in the same debate, five columns later. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A certain matter was raised here by the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. F. C. Erasmus) and I just want to say a few words in this connection. The hon. member for Moorreesburg raised the question of the Industrial Development Corporation and pointed out certain dangers. I want to extend the scope of the discussions somewhat and at the same time point out the position in connection with Iscor, Escom and the newly established Fisheries Corporation. I want to point out that large sums of money of the country were invested in those corporations. I understand that in the case of Iscor it is in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;17,000,000 &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x00A3;17,000,000 for Iscor!&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and I want to ask whether the time has not arrived to find some means or other to enable Parliament to exercise better financial control. After all, Parliament votes the money, and I want to ask whether the time has not arrived when there should be a measure of Parliamentary control of these corporations, in this sense that we should know what is going on and what the position of the corporations is. At the moment the position is that the balance sheet is submitted&#x2014;I think also to the Government&#x2014;the Chairman&#x2019;s address to the shareholders or his annual report is submitted to the Government. We know what a chairman&#x2019;s report is and we also know what sometimes happens in connection with a balance sheet. I want to suggest that the Government, and more particularly the Minister who is responsible, should take into serious consideration the advisability of introducing better financial control so that Parliament will be able to know precisely what the position is in connection with those corporations or companies. At the moment there is no control, and even the Minister concerned is not able to demand information. I want to ask the Minister of Finance and also the Minister of Economic Development whether they will give their attention to this matter. I do not know whether it can be arranged through the medium of the Auditor-General. These companies have their own auditors, of course, but I should like to know whether it will not be possible to have a special department of the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Department, which could then also examine the accounts and affairs of those companies. It must be remembered that it is our money which is invested here, and the ordinary shareholder in the ordinary business would like to know what becomes of his money.</block>

<p>And so say all of us! Mr. Chairman, you know what the French say, <i>Plus ca change, plus c&#x2019;est la m&#x00EA;me chose</i>, (The more things change, the more they remain the same). They talk about &#x00A3;1,400,000 for the I.D.C. To-day it has its tentacles throughout industry in this country, and we do not know how the money is invested. We only hear what is happening when we hear of Amato and the money that has been lost in Amato. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat carried on here in a dramatic manner. It is quite a diversion for the House of Assembly, after such a lot of lifeless speeches as we have heard from members opposite, to see some dramatics. The hon. member always amuses me a lot; I am grateful to him for that, and that is all I am grateful to him for.</p>

<p>With reference to the European Common Market, and the charge made from the opposite side that our agricultural industry will suffer tremendous losses as a result of South Africa leaving the Commonwealth, I should like to quote what the Swiss Bank Corporation says in connection with the position of the Commonwealth in the European Common Market in respect of agriculture: They say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here lies the crux of the whole integration problem. By the Treaty of Rome, the ultimate aim of the Six is the formation of an all-European tariff-free market of about 300,000,000 consumers. This would require a &#x201C;common customs tariff, a common trade policy, a common policy in agriculture&#x201D;.</block>

<p>On that there could be no compromise.</p>

<p>Inside the Common Market itself, the rigid adherence to protectionists policies in agriculture is the greatest obstacle to the implementation of the Treaty of Rome. All Six still demand effectual measures safeguarding their markets against competition from cheap food grown overseas. There is no question of the admission duty-free to the Common Market of food grown anywhere outside&#x2014;for example, from the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>As far as agriculture is concerned, the Six ardently desire that Britain should accept the treaty of Rome as it stands because this would permit an expansion forthwith of the market for their surplus foodstuffs. But the Six would have no incentive to admit Great Britain unless the import of food from the Commonwealth were curtailed. If Britain joined the Six, the Commonwealth could not count on a continuation of free access of foodstuffs to Britain.</p>

<p>I withdraw. The hon. member makes one so fed-up. Hon. members opposite now and always come here without any grounds, without any arguments, only on suspicion and a lot of hollow cries, and try to sow the suspicion that we shall suffer loss as a result of our withdrawal from the Commonwealth, in the European Common Market that is to be established. I hope that these summaries of quite an impartial and expert organization will be a sufficient answer to them.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to another small matter. I should like to refer to the place our industrial development should assume, parallel with and in comparison with our entire agricultural industry, and I should like to begin by saying that according to the report of UNO, 30,000,000 people are dying from starvation annually. The vast majority of the peoples in the underdeveloped countries of the world are underfed, and the population increase exceeds the increase of production to a greater extent every year. In 1961 the world population was about 3,000,000,000, and according to the calculations of demographers the population of the world will be about 6,000,000,000 in the year 2,000, that is to say, in a little less than 40 years. It is estimated that we shall have to double our production of wheat to keep pace with the population pressure, and that our production of milk, eggs and meat will have to be trebled, this is extremely important for our whole future, and what is more important, is the question we have to ask ourselves: How is population apportioned between the agricultural and industrial sectors? Come we take three examples. In Russia 42 per cent of the entire population, the labour force of the population, employed in agriculture, according to last year&#x2019;s statistics, and with 42 per cent of them integrated in agriculture, Russia at the present time has to cope with serious agricultural and food problems. I notice in the newspaper just now that China, with her communistic system, is coping with colossal agricultural problems, with 42 per cent of her people integrated into agriculture. I could also mention East Germany; East Germany under communist control, which applies the same system, has equally great problems. Last year there even was a strike as a result of the shortages of food and the poor quality of the food products that were produced. Come we go to the other extreme; what is the position in the United States of America? America has 10 per cent of the population in the rural areas, and what is the position in America? There we have surpluses. There is not only sufficient food, but there are surpluses also, and this problem of surpluses is causing America a tremendous headache. In America we have the position that one farmer produces enough food for 24 people. What is the position in Britain? In Britain 4 per cent of the total labour force is integrated into agriculture, and what is the position there? In spite of that, Britain to-day is one of the greatest importers of foodstuffs in the world, although she has stepped up her agricultural production of foodstuffs by mechanization by about 70 per cent during the past decade. Mr. Speaker, it may perhaps be said that we should follow the system in America, that we should concentrate on industrial development and that we should leave the production of foodstuffs to a few big ones; that we should eliminate the small man, that we should eliminate the poorer farmer; that those who have the capital and the means of production available should produce the food. Will that give us the solution? Has it brought a solution to America? I do not think that it will solve our problem of surpluses, our problem of vulnerability, our problem of disproportion between industrial population and agricultural population. We shall have to be very careful. Overloading in our industrial sector brings us many problems, and I should like to mention some of them. In the first place it causes social problems; it causes great vulnerability. Industrial development of a country is very vulnerable if that industrial development is not supported by a stable agricultural population. But our industrial sector also is very sensitive, as we see on the stock market every day. But a disproportion and too much concentration in the industrial sector also produce great political instability and uncertainty as we see every day. We say that no sound economy and no stable economic structure can ever be built on a basis of disproportion between the agricultural sector and the industrial sector. The problems of the underdeveloped countries and those of the well developed countries in respect of our agriculture, are equally great at the present time. The underdeveloped countries are confonted with a shortage; the over-developed or well developed countries have to cope with a tremendous surplus; both have enormous problems. Here we have one of the problems that we in South Africa will have to face very clearly with a view to the future, and that is namely, in the same way as in agriculture the elimination of the small man may involve danger, in the same way as it contributes to greater vulnerability, so also the elimination of the small man in our commercial and business sector is dangerous; it contributes to greater instability and greater vulnerability.

<p>As we are discussing the question of overseas markets, I should like to approach it from another angle, and that is the establishment of more trade envoys in foreign countries, but not so much, as one of our members here has urged, envoys on the continent of Africa. Before I begin with that, I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, and tell him <span class="col_5985-5986" refersTo="page_0239"/>that we are very grateful that he, in dealing with overseas markets and with the economic conditions in the country, spoke so candidly that it is no longer necessary for us to quarrel over the floor of the House here as to whether or not we snail suffer loss if England joins the Euromarket. Like the rest of us, he appreciates that it involves dangers and problems for us. He did not say what the dangers are. The hon. the Minister here referred to percentages. He said that annually England takes about 30 to 32 per cent of our exports. I now wish to mention the figures, so that we may have a clear picture. Of the R950,000,000 of exports last year, England took R320,000,000, That is what 30 per cent means. But just to make a comparison, come we go a little further. Our next most important purchaser of our exports is the Federation of Rhodesia. They took 13.8 per cent of our exports, or R111,000,000. Do hon. members on both sides of the House realize that nearly 50 per cent of our total exports go to the United Kingdom and to the Federation of Rhodesia; and both countries hold problems for us in so far as there is not only a possibility, but the probability, that England is going to join the Euro market. What might happen is that the Federation may disintegrate or break up, and if Northern Rhodesia and the other State of the Federation are not disposed to love us more than the other African states, we may very well lose that market also. The hon. the Minister says that 70 per cent of our exports are not as much in jeopardy if England were to join the Euro market as the other 30 per cent. An economic survey of what the countries of the Euro market produce and of the potential of their production, as against what they may take from this country, amounts to a ratio of nearly 50-50, but I shall accept the Minister&#x2019;s figure that 30 per cent of our exports to the Euro market are in jeopardy and that we may have to seek new markets for it. What is 30 per cent of this market? It amounts to a sum of more than R100,000,000 worth of commodities for which we shall have to find other markets. Where? Japan took 3.4 per cent of our exports last year, which represents R51,000,000 worth of goods. The United States of America took 6.8 per cent, or R77,000,000 worth of goods. The hon. the Minister was very candid. He asked what we were going to do about the matter? Can we become a member of the Euro market? But of course we cannot become a member. The Minister also referred to the tariff protection the products of this country are enjoying, which they would otherwise not enjoy if South Africa becomes a member of the Common Market, because the elimination of all tariffs is one of the objects of the Common Market. That is not all; the subsidization of our agricultural products to the extent to which they are being subsidized at the present time is another thing that should worry us. We are not a European country; we cannot in the normal course of things join the Euro market. And then there is the question of an associated country. Here I really think the hon. the Minister indulged in a little bit of political contorting, of which he accused the hon. member for Jeppe (Dr. Cronje) when he said that we might be able to enjoy the same facilities that Canada, Australia and New Zealand are enjoying.</p>

<p>Yes, England does love us a lot. My submission is that we will possibly not be able to enjoy the facilities that other Commonwealth countries may enjoy. One of these days a Prime Minister&#x2019;s conference is to be held, a conference we shall not be able to attend because we are not a member of the Commonwealth. If we could have had a voice there, the Minister might have been able to tell us what will happen in the nead future, but we shall not be a conferring party. We are thankful for the economist the Minister wants to send over. We know that if he sends one, it will be a good one. If he could attend that conference and could exert pressure that we should get the same facilities&#x2014;and after all it will not be the same facilities as those members of Euro market will enjoy; it will be lesser facilities than those that may be granted to members of the Commonwealth. In view of the fact that we are faced with the problem of finding export markets for goods to the value of R100,000,000 to R150,000,000 and in view of the fact that our surpluses will become greater as our industries expand. I should like to urge the hon. the Minister for greater trade representation overseas. I have already done so on previous occasions, on the many occasions when I had returned and found in foreign countries that we had no trade commissioner or trade representative for instance in a country such as Brazil that wishes to buy wool from us. The hon. the Minister has referred to that on more than one occasion. I should like to begin in the Latin American countries. The Minister knows the position there as well as I do. Neither in Argentina, nor in Uruquay, nor in Brazil nor in Chile have we any trade representative, and the Minister and his Department know as well as I do that in Argentina and in Uruquay particularly there is a wonderful market for our fruit, our wines and canned products, especially canned fruit, and dried fruit.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to refer just very briefly to our very important and popular lobster industry, an industry which at present has an annual turnover of nearly R7,500,000. In the early years of the existence of this industry the main emphasis was placed on the canned product, but in recent years, as time has gone on, the emphasis has shifted more and more to frozen lobster tails. In 1940 the then Government placed on the Statute Book a short Act, the Rock Lobster Export Act of that year, which placed this whole industry under control and granted a certain measure of protection to the industry. Six years later, in 1946, the first export permit was granted under this Act, and since 1946 these export quotas have become the cornerstone of the whole of the lobster industry. It is a remarkable fact. Mr. Chairman, that in 15 successive years, as far as I have been able to ascertain, only four new quotas were granted to this industry. It was necessary to give complete protection to this industry as a whole, and I do not think that the policy that was followed was wrong. But in the course of the years a sort of middleman also entered this industry; I refer to those persons who started supplying the export quota-holders and who also invested money in the industry. They incurred expense in the interests of this industry, and I feel that they also have a strong claim to some sort of a quota. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible for us to think of a formula which will be more just to both the existing quota-holders and the so-called middleman. On the one hand I want to urge that the existing quota-holders should be given a greater measure of permanency as far as their quotas are concerned. The fact of the matter is that the quotas which are granted to those people, who have also made great investments in this industry, are only granted for a year. In other words, this industry runs a very great risk. I was wondering whether it was not possible to give the existing quota-holders greater continuity or permanency. What I have in mind is that perhaps quotas can be granted to the existing quota-holders for five or ten years. And then I wonder whether the existing quota-holders will not be prepared, if greater permanency is granted to the industry, to relinquish some portion of their existing quota so that a quota can also be granted to the so-called middleman? The fact of the matter is that both groups, those persons who supply the existing quota-holders as well as the existing quota-holders, have made big investments in this industry. In my constituency there are communities which have come into being mainly as the result of the development of this industry, and I think we have reached a stage now where we shall have to think of some formula with a view to bringing about greater permanency, greater continuity, as far as this industry is concerned.</p>

<p>There is just one further point that I want to touch upon. I notice that provision is made in the Estimates for a certain amount for the opening of the Berg River mouth. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that there is great rejoicing in that area over this work which is to be tackled in the future. But the experienced fishermen, if I may call them that, are wondering whether the question should not be considered at this stage of establishing a fishing harbour or some sort of shelter in that vicinity. When we look at the future of the whole of the fishing industry, the fact of the matter is that as far as we can see ahead, much bigger boats will be used in the future, and the experienced fishermen in the vicinity of the Berg River mouth have some doubt as to whether the development, the opening, of the Berg River mouth will make it possible for these big boats to be housed there. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it&#x2019;s not possible, before a start is made with the opening of this river mouth, to cause investigations to be instituted into the possibility of a shelter or a fishing harbour in the vicinity of the Berg River mouth.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down and other members on the other side of the House have spoken this afternoon on very many points concerning our economy, and I listened very carefully, but I have not yet heard one hon. member mentioning anything in regard to our present trade with Japan. Mr. Chairman, in gauging this trade with Japan, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has considered the full implications as to whether Japan has the full means to honour payments for all goods received. Japan, we know very well, is a crowded island with very few raw materials, and I am quoting from the current edition of the <i>New York Herald-Tribune</i> which says that Japan has 740 mines and that according to statistics most of these mines are on a small to medium scale, which is why Japan has to import much of her minerals. In order to earn the foreign exchange with which to pay for these much-needed imports, Japan has to export, and in order to export her pattern of export is much like that of other countries. Japan applying its skill to imported material, exports the finished product to other countries in the form of radios, transistors, electronic equipment and in a growing proportion cameras and instruments. Now Japan&#x2019;s main supply areas are in the first place North America, from where Japan gets some of its materials and a large percentage of its machinery and capital equipment, and in the second place, East Asia, which supplies food and raw material to Japan. But Japan&#x2019;s main export areas are East Asia and the U.S.A., and each takes one-third of its exports. Now on a small scale Japan does export, about 10 per cent, to Western Europe, and it is possible that with <span class="col_5989-5990" refersTo="page_0241"/>the development of the Common Market the percentage may possibly increase, and trade experts think to-day that the E.E.C. may increase its purchases of Japanese goods. But the point is that the current edition of this paper from which I am quoting says &#x201C;That Japan&#x2019;s foreign trade picture is not a healthy one It puts here the point that Japan has to import so much that it may face foreign exchange difficulties in the near future. This is a very important point which I would like the hon. the Minister to consider and to give us his answer on, because if the Japanese are placing very large orders in South Africa for much of our minerals and steel, then when it comes to payment, is the hon. the Minister quite sure that Japan will have sufficient foreign exchange to pay South Africa in cash, and not in goods? Or will Japan offer payment partly in goods and kind? Here I am thinking of the industries of South Africa themselves. What assurance have we that the Japanese will pay in cash?, and will not pay partly in cash and partly in goods. Because it is all very well for such industries as Iscor to sell steel at the cost of Japanese competition with South African industrial products, and there would then be the hazard that we might have difficulties with our own industries here in South Africa itself. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should give this House full details of the type of trade agreement that we do have with Japan and that he should tell us what guarantees he can give us that payments will be in cash and not in goods, or partly in goods. I note from the current March 1962 edition of the Economic News Letter that is issued with the &#x201C;S.A. Digest of Affairs&#x201D; that our trade with Japan is such that our exports to Japan are R51,200,000 and Japanese exports to South Africa amount to R35,250,000. This leaves a favourable balance to South Africa&#x2019;s credit. But have we the assurance that this trade balance will be paid for in cash? I would like the hon. the Minister to give us some information on that point, as to whether we are assured of a completely safe future in our present trade with Japan <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> our own industries?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will not expect me to reply to the particular questions which she has asked here, and I do not propose to reply to them.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday evening at the export convention the hon. the Prime Minister laid down eight propositions for the developing of a sound economy in South Africa. I want to take one of those propositions here this afternoon as a yardstick in connection with one of our industries, namely the fertilizer industry. He declared that South Africa&#x2019;s good name would be harmed by exporting products of a low quality. The immediate reply to this will be that we do not export fertilizers and that we will probably not export fertilizers in the foreseeable future either. But the point I want to make is that this proposition ought to apply not only in respect of export goods but also in respect of goods which are to be sold in the domestic market; this yeardstick should apply equally to our domestic market. Surely the fact that goods are not exported is no reason why the internal consumer should be sold inferior goods, and if a domestic industry enjoys protection because it is a domestic industry, it should not be at liberty to manufacture goods of an inferior quality.</p>

<p>I made the submission in the debate under the Agricultural Technical Services Vote that we were applying the wrong fertilizers to our arable land because those fertilizers have the effect of acidifying our arable land, 80 per cent of which is already sour. I pointed out that we were applying 1,000,000 tons of acidific fertilizer annually to our soil, namely superphosphate and mixtures which are being manufactured according to out-of-date methods. I pointed out that overseas the nitrophosphates and the complex fertilizers had captured the whole of the overseas market, particularly in America and Japan and in Western Europe. According to the report of the Committee which inquired into the fertilizer industry R110,000,000 has been invested in the fertilizer industry. This does not include Foscor&#x2019;s capital because Foscor is a developmental company. The greatest portion of this capital of R110,000,000 which has been invested in the fertilizer industry in South Africa has been invested in plant which is intended for the manufacture of superphosphate and various mixtures. I regard this investment as an investment in out-of-date plant measured by the overseas standards where nitrophosphates and carbonitric mixtures have completely captured the market. Even the much-vaunted Urea plant at Modderfontein which cost R20,000,000 is already out-of-date, in my opinion, because agronomists agree that direct application of urea has only a limited value in agriculture. It is clear therefore that 80 per cent of our investments in the fertilizer industry represent investments in out-of-date plant and out-of-date manufacturing methods. The fertilizer industry is in the hands of two big manufacturers, namely African Explosives and Fisons and there are 11 so-called &#x201C;dry mixers&#x201D;. According to this report 87 per cent of the fertilizer trade is in the hands of only three companies. Paragraph 259 of the report mentions that fact. It has always been my submission that there is a monopoly in the fertilizer industry. But this commission which has now brought its report has found a new fine-sounding name for it, namely &#x201C;oligopoly&#x201D;. The common name for it remains &#x201C;monopoly&#x201D;, however. Mr. Chairman, it would be a sad day for South Africa if the State had to go so far as to protect big monopolies under the pretext that it was protecting domestic industries. It seems to me from this report as though the Committee of inquiry into the fertilizer industry fell for the representations of the big companies that the fertilizer industry must be organized on a cartel system. They actually had the audacity to submit the proposal to the Committee that a cartel should be established to control the <span class="col_5991-5992" refersTo="page_0242"/>whole of the fertilizer industry in South Africa. It looks as though that argument impressed the Committee, because in paragraph 286 of the report the Committee says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is recommended that a committee consisting of representatives of Foscor and the two main existing users of its products be constituted to arrange the interim allocation of Foscor products</block>

<p>Secondly, the attitude is adopted in the report that rock-phosphate can be treated in no other way than by means of sulphuric acid for the manufacture of superphosphate; they do not take into account at all the newer developments of nitrophosphates and complex fertilizers. In this connection I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether there is really any truth in the allegation that the fertilizer industry is to be rationalized by monopolizing the raw materials of Foscor for a iso-called <i>consortium</i> of manufacturers at Phalaborwa and whether the raw materials of Sasol are similarly to be monopolized for a so-called <i>consortium</i> of manufacturers at Sasolburg. I want to issue a warning against any such step, because there are various objections to it. In the first place it will mean the exclusion of the new development with its new techniques and of new products which are to-day largely accepted overseas as the best fertilizer products. Furthermore, it will mean the retention of out-of-date plant with out-of-date techniques and that we shall be saddled with out-of-date products. Furthermore, from the point of view of the agronomist, it will mean the ever-increasing application of wrong kinds of fertilizer to our arable land. Thirdly, it will mean that South Africa&#x2019;s fertilizer products, if our requirements are to be met fully by the products which are being made to-day, will be of such an inferior quality that it will not be possible to export a single bag of it in the future, because there is no longer a demand overseas for superphosphates. The demand overseas is tor nitrophosphate and carbonitric mixtures for fertilizing purposes. If we carry on with the existing plant and the products which are being supplied at present, we shall never be able to export a single bag, because there will be no market for it abroad. Fourthly, the position with regard to these carbonitric mixtures and the other new types of fertilizer is that there is a great future for Sasol in this connection because Sasol is able to supply the raw material.

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I want first of all to thank the hon. the Minister for the information he has given us this afternoon on the European Common Market, and I now want to deal with another aspect of our economic life which concerns everybody in this country to-day. That is the speech made by the hon. the Minister, to which reference already had been made, at the banquet of the Chambers of Industries towards the end of last year. In that speech the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is my firm belief that we have reached a stage in our economic history where conditions are particularly favourable for the launching of a composite programme of action by the Government and secondary industries which will carry this country towards new heights of industrial activity and prosperity. However what is essential for the attainment of this objective is careful advance planning, and here I would particularly stress the necessity for all of us to set ourselves certain clearly defined individual objectives for the next ten years.</block>

<p>The hon. Minister went on to say that the Government itself was involved in this planning and that he had instructed the department to determine carefully the steps which should be taken by it in an effort to achieve these objectives.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we all agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. the Minister in the speech he made, but what we are concerned about is not the sentiments but the implementation. When one talks about a five-year plan, there are certain ingredients which are necessary before one can transfer speech into action. These ingredients I would suggest are firstly basic research into the actual operation of the economy and from such research to develop basic theories and principles; secondly, to forecast the effects of the application of these theories and principles under a given set of circumstances and to indicate desireable controls. and thirdly, the actual plan to implement the findings.</p>

<block name="quote">What perturbs us is where is the preliminary work to be done to give effect to this advance thinking. Commerce and industry will no doubt play their part, but I would suggest that it is only the Government, or should be the Government, that is in a position to deal with the basic research and to develop these theories and to ascertain what effects they will have on other facets of our economy, or what effect other facets of our economy will have on these theories. Because, Mr. Chairman, we are dealing with long-term planning, and in long-term planning there are so many matters that have to be considered which are controlled by the Government. There is the question of railway policy. It has already been said here to-day that it costs more to rail from Johannesburg to Durban than it costs to ship from Durban to England. There is the question of the Bantustans. There is the fiscal policy, there is import control, taxation, there are the statistical services, job reservation and a host of other items which apply directly to the question of forward planning, and it is only the Government that can give us a lead in this matter. Now we would like to know how far these plans of the Government have progressed and whether the Department of the hon. the Minister has the trained staff to produce the basic blueprints which will spark off this wonderful future that the hon. the Minister painted for us to-day. We would also like to know what liaison is taking place between the Government and industry and commerce, and in general with the private sector.</block>

<p><span class="col_5993-5994" refersTo="page_0243"/>Another matter that arises from this is the question of the missions that we sent overseas, because in a five-year plan&#x2014;and I accept what the hon. the Minister said that we don&#x2019;t consider such a five-year plan to be based on the communistic basis&#x2014;all these facets have to be brought together. That is why export conventions are being held. For we reach a stage where the concept of all these things is, as someone said this morning, &#x201C;export or die&#x201D;, or what the Americans now call &#x201C;trade or fade&#x201D;. It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that a start must be made by the Department of the hon. the Minister. If one reads the report of the trade missions that went overseas, one thing is abundantly clear&#x2014;that is the only thing I have time to deal with&#x2014;namely that our commercial service outside the Union is poor. The hon. Minister has dealt with the question in relation to the rest of Africa and I want to touch on it in relation to Europe. If you read the reports of those trade missions, you will find in practically every report, in respect of every country, that the recommendation is made that our trade representation must be stiffened. I just take a few at random. There is one on North and South America, page 14, paragraph (5)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition we consider it essential that an official be attached to the embassy in Buenos Aires for trade commercial work.</block>

<p>And then they say that the same applies to other South American countries. There is another reference on page 35 of the same report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While it is principally the function of private enterprise to find outlets for their products, it has become the accepted practice for governments to assist private enterprise by means of overseas trade officials. For this purpose we consider that official trade representation should be based not only on the volume of trade already done with a particular country, but on the potential market offered by that country.</block>

<p>And so on and so forth. We would like to hear from the hon. Minister what steps are being taken to implement the recommendations of these commissions in regard to our trade representation, and perhaps the hon. the Minister could enlarge on some other items such as shipping, trade agreements, and so on.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to move as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, having learnt with deep regret of the death to-day of Mr. Arthur Godfrey Barlow, desires to place on record its appreciation of the services rendered by him to his country particularly as a Member of Parliament for more than 22 years.</block>

<p>This House further resolves that its sincere sympathy be conveyed to the relatives of the deceased in their bereavement.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after this motion I wish to move that the House adjourn as a mark of respect for the passing of a person who for many long years was a member of this House. Although he is not a member of the House at the moment, he does deserve to be remembered by those of us who knew him, in this manner.</p>

<p>I should like to give a few particulars of his career, but it is quite beyond one&#x2019;s ability, in the few moments at our disposal to do justice to such a colourful career. The person to whom we are now paying tribute, has had a long life, a long life of service at many places and in many ways. He himself was a colourful personality. One can hardly do justice to such a course of life in a brief sketch of his career. The fact is that from 8 February 1921 to 30 April 1929, that is to say for a period of eight years, two months and 21 days, he was a member of this House of Assembly in the first instance. Subsequently again from 14 June 1943 to 10 March 1958, again 14 years, eight months and 27 days&#x2014;nearly 23 years altogether. For a period of four years, nine months and a few days he also was Deputy-Chairman of Committees, namely from 28 July 1924 to 30 April 1929. That indicates the duration of his parliamentary service.</p>

<p>But of course his public life started much earlier. After being a war correspondent in the war of 1899-1902, he became a member of the Volksraad of the First Parliament of the Orange River Colony. He served in that capacity from 1907 until 1909. In 1920 he was an M.P.C. there also. Furthermore he was in the course of his life concerned in many other undertakings, but he was nevertheless concerned particularly in politics, not only as a member of Parliament but also as a newspaper personality. He was a newspaper and parliamentary reporter, newspaper editor and even the proprietor of a newspaper, and later also a writer largely of reminiscences of a rich life.</p>

<p>He made two proposals for which he is known, <i>inter alia</i>, and about which he felt profoundly satisfied. That also connected his life-story with the history of South Africa. He proposed the motion which was adopted by Parliament in 1925, whereby His Majesty the King was requested not to award titles to <span class="col_5995-5996" refersTo="page_0244"/>South Africans any longer; and in 1957, more than 25 years later, he introduced the Flags Amendment Bill which provided for only one flag for South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the memory of Mr. Barlow will remain with us for a long time. He was a veteran of this Parliament. I think I am justified in saying that he was one of the grand old men of this Parliament. During a long career he always expressed his views forcibly, although very often also with great humour. He was the supporter and the opponent of most of us at one time or another. He was a law unto himself as all know. He had strong belief&#x2019;s and stood for them whether he hurt friend or foe. He did that because of the strength of his convictions and his desire to serve in his own way the South Africa he loved so well. Whatever one might say of him as an opponent or as a supporter, or of the ideals he stood for, there is one fact that no person can possibly deny and that is that this gentleman, this member of Parliament for so long, believed wholeheartedly in South Africa, and its future. To him this was not only his own country but a country for which all must sacrifice everything they have. His was a true love for South Africa until his death. Only a few days ago when I had the opportunity of speaking to him for a few minutes, I again gathered the impression how deeply, even at his ripe old age, he was interested in all that was happening, and how great his ideals for South Africa were also at this stage and how full of confidence he was in the future of our country. He was a man who loved South Africa deeply and who served her well.</p>

<block name="quote">We feel sincere sympathy for his family in their bereavement but believe that they can take courage from the fact that a life has been ended which will not easily be forgotten for its service to its country and its people.</block>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House would like to associate ourselves with the kindly words which have fallen from the lips of the Prime Minister concerning the late Mr. Arthur Barlow. I think the hon. the Prime Minister was correct when he said that one time or another Mr. Barlow had been the supporter and political opponent of most of us. I think there must be few political associations in South Africa with which he did not cross swords at one time or another in a very long and interesting career. I think we can say this, Sir, that he sometimes angered those with whom he had ceased to associate. But I do not think that he ever forfeited their friendship or their affection especially those who had learnt to know him.</p>

<p>I think that many of his characteristics endeared him very particularly to all who knew him. I refer particularly to his generosity, particularly his generosity to his opponents. I think I must be one of many younger members in this House who have been encouraged from time to time by Mr. Barlow, even when we did not see eye to eye on big questions of the day. I think that another of his characteristics was his concern at all times for the poor, the weak, the under-dog and the unfortunate. He always sponsored their cause with tremendous zeal and enthusiasm and sometimes with surprising results. There was a third characteristic I would like to mention and that was his very great respect for the institution of Parliament and the traditions of Parliament. At all times, Sir, he was jealous of the rights of the private member. I think all those who knew him will remember his taking odd points of order from time to time that no one has ever thought of, and once a year coming in and solemnly sitting here with his hat on his head in order to exercise the right of a private member to do just that to ensure that that privilege should not be lost.</p>

<p>I think that one can say that his concern for the weak was associated with his affection for children. Those of us who knew him knew of his great affection for his own grand-children. I think that affection was great enough to embrace all children, all young people. I think there must be many South African children who have found great pleasure in the delightful stories which he told and which have been committed to book form for posterity as in some way a reminder, a memory, of a man who had had a most colourful career in South Africa and stood for some of the best in our public life.</p>

<p>The time has come, Sir, when the <i>assertire voide</i>, when the sharp pen of Arthur Barlow is quiet. But, Sir, I think we will all remember him. He brought a colour and a stimulus into our lives. He saved many of us from smugness and from complacency by his knack of unearthing cant and pompousness. I think if there is one thing for which we will remember him it is his genuineness and determination to go down to the bone in respect of any matter with which he was concerned.</p>

<p>I think, Sir, that it is fitting that we should pay tribute to him, although he is no longer a member of this House, for what he has meant to the public life in South Africa over a very long period. I second.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>Although I did mention it at the second reading, I would like to reiterate my praise for the way in which the explanatory memorandum on the Railways and Harbours Acts Amendment Bill has been drawn up. There was a time when some of the explanatory memoranda issued by the Department of Railways were not as good as this one is. I remember the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) calling attention to the fact that White Papers seemed like the attractive young lady who inadvertently concealed more than she revealed. I am sure it will help in this debate to make the discussion of all these clauses, including Clause 1 of the Bill, more instructive and easier to follow by other members of this House opposite who perhaps have not even read the Bill.</p>

<p>I made it quite clear, Sir, in the second reading that Clause 1 of this Bill receives the approval of this side of the House. We feel that it is a necessary delegation of financial authority. We believe that it will help the Administration and aid it in its work. We think that greater financial responsibility can be given to the General Manager, safely, without any real danger that the financial authority of Parliament will be breached. We have a post-mortem safeguard in the Railways and Harbours Select Committee. Another safeguard is that the Controller and Auditor-General will see that the money is properly accounted for at the proper time. So we approve of Clause 1. Nevertheless I wondered why the hon. the Minister, in this case, did not consult the Select Committee. If he had been thoughtful, I think he might have referred this matter to our committee for consideration. I am sure they would have agreed to the proposition contained in the clause. He must know that we like to feel that we are carrying out our proper function, not as the bloodhounds but as the watchdogs, the financial watchdogs of Railway expenditure. He knows that only recently we objected to the fact that we had not been consulted when the Higher Replacement cost section of the Renewals Fund was altered &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Minister could give us a little more information in regard to this particular clause. It is a very simple provision and we accept it, that is, that the amount can be increased without further approval. The regulations under which the application of that authority falls are fairly widespread and according to the explanatory memorandum the extension is confined to work which has not been approved by Parliament&#x2014;it does not affect a railway line which has been approved by Parliament. But it does say that where the actual expenditure will exceed the authorized amount for any work&#x2014;by more than 10 per cent&#x2014;authority must be obtained first from the authority who originally authorized the carrying out of that work; in this case I assume it will be the Railway Board. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could explain at what stage that particular proviso will come into effect. Further down the explanatory memorandum says that in the case of excesses of more than 10 per cent on approved amounts, the Minister&#x2019;s authority must be sought if the additional amount required for a particular work exceeds R20,000. What I want to know from the Minister is at what stage this provision will come into effect. Will it be in the planning stage when the final specifications are planned and when it becomes evident that the work will exceed the original estimates or will it come into effect when the work is already in progress and certain unforeseen difficulties arise? At what stage will this proviso come into effect? Because it does make a material difference as to the safeguards. It is obvious that once a job has been started and it becomes clear that the amount will be more than originally estimated, the job must be finished no matter what the cost. Or will it come into effect when it is <span class="col_5999-6000" refersTo="page_0246"/>discovered in time, in the planning stage, that the amount will be in excess of the estimated amount so that the position can be rectified prior to the work being put in hand. It is a fairly complicated proviso and I wonder if the hon. the Minister could clarify the position a little in that respect.</p>

<p>It can happen in both cases, in reply to the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). The work might have been authorized and not commenced. When it is then found that the cost will be more than originally estimated approval will of course be required for the additional amount. For instance, if a work is submitted to the Minister costing, say, &#x00A3;20,000 it is found, before the work is commenced, due to unforeseen circumstances that it may exceed that amount, then the Minister&#x2019;s approval must be obtained. It can also happen in the case where the work has already been started. It may be found that due to the increase in labour costs the approved amount will be exceeded, then approval must also be obtained. It operates in both instances.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) I want to say this. The hon. member knows, of course, that any matter which is discussed in a Select Committee, is confined to the members of that Select Committee alone. It is only when that report is before Parliament that Parliament has the opportunity of discussing that report and that seldom if ever happens. Parliament has the right, of course, to discuss any amendment to the Act prior to the Act being amended. The hon. member referred to the higher replacement cost. That is right, that should have been before the Committee, before the Act was amended, or at least before the new method was adopted, because that was in conflict with a resolution taken by the Select Committee some years ago. There is no parallel between the two cases. But in regard to any financial procedure which is of considerable importance, I have no objection if I find it advisable to submit it to the Select Committee before it is discussed in Parliament.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 2,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>One or two points arise in connection with this clause which I should like to discuss with the Minister. I refer to sub-section (3), paragraphs (a) and (b) on page 5. It would appear, Sir, that the hon. the Minister has made use of a formula to enable him to pay a gratuity to those who are going to retire in the very near future, in fact during the next five or six years. I want to put an example to the Minister to make quite sure that the interpretation which I put upon this clause is the correct one. I might tell the Minister that I have had some correspondence about this clause and it does seem that there is some doubt as to the actual interpretation.</p>

<p>I will put this example to assist in clarifying what the legal position may be. I want to give the Minister an example of the gratuity which will be paid in terms of sub-section (3) (a) and (b) and sub-section (4) (i) and (ii). An employee who is due to retire on 16 March 1963, i.e. 16 March next year, will receive one-third of his total emoluments for the eight-year period ending on 16 March 1961 plus three-quarters of total emoluments for the period 16 March 1961 to 16 March 1963, a two-year period making up the 10 years. Whatever these two amounts add up to is then divided by 10. That is how I see this clause. If we take an employee whose total emoluments amount to R900 per year he will then receive one and one-third of the R900 multiplied by eight, which amounts to R9,600 plus three-quarters of the R900 multiplied by two, which will be R1,300, making a total of R10,900. This divided by 10 will give him a gratuity of R1,090. If the same employee were to receive one-tenth of his total emoluments over his last 10 years of service, he will only receive R900 as a gratuity. In other words, R1,090 less than he will receive in terms of the formula as set out in sub-section (3) of Clause 2. From this example, Mr. Chairman, it would appear that the formula set out in sub-section (3) of Clause 2 has been designed to compensate the employee who will retire within five years of the fixed date. It would also appear that the definition of &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; lends itself to some misunderstanding or disagreement. It would appear that the definition of &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; does not include cost-of-living allowances paid. I think the Minister should clarify this point because reference is made in many sub-sections of this clause to &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D;. And if &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; do not include cost-of-living allowances then this formula to which I have referred appears to make some sense, but if it does include cost-of-living allowances then it appears to be a very long way round to arrive at one-tenth of the total emoluments of an employee over a 10-year period. If the cost-of-living allowance is not included in &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D;, I think it is necessary that the Minister should indicate quite clearly what &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; consist of. For instance does &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; include overtime payment, bonus work payments, holiday allowance, etc.? As I see the position &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; mean the total earnings which will include overtime payments, bonus work payments, etc. But because of the discrepancy in the example which I have quoted, the formula does exclude cost-of-living allowances as part of &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D;. And I think it is well that we should query with the Minister exactly what &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; means in this particular clause. It is an important point because it can make a big difference to the person who is going to receive this gratuity if &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; includes overtime, bonus work payments and holiday allowances. The query I put to the Minister is tied up in the definition of what &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; really means</p>

<p>According to my information &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; mean basic wages only. It does not include overtime and Sunday times. But, of course, after consolidation &#x201C;total emoluments&#x201D; will mean basic wages into which cost-of-living allowances have been incorporated. I cannot at this stage go into the involved calculation which the hon. member has made as to what the amount auctally will be. But the fact remains that this is an improvement on the present position. This has been designed to bring it into line with the increased benefits that permanent and temporary servants will receive as a result of consolidation.

That would clarify the position considerably.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 3,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 3 amends Section 4 of the Railways and Harbours Pensions Act of 1941. The explanatory memorandum says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of consolidating the balance of the cost-of-living allowance with basic salaries and wages, the pension benefits payable from the superannuation funds to European servants in the lower grades were increased on an average by approximately 30 per cent.</block>

<p>In order to maintain the status quo, therefore, it is necessary to provide for a corresponding increase in the amount of the gratuity or annuity payable to certain servants of the Administration in terms of the Railways and Harbours Pensions Amendment Act, 1941, and it is with this end in view that the amendments to Sections 3 and 4 of this Act are being made.</p>

<p>Clause 3 has this effect that it deletes the words &#x201C;one-quarter&#x201D; and substitutes &#x201C;three-sixteenths&#x201D;. I say to the Minister that if the Act had not been amended by the substitution of the words &#x201C;three-sixteenths&#x201D; for &#x201C;one-quarter&#x201D;, then it would be true to say that in order to maintain the <i>status quo</i> it is necessary to provide for a corresponding increase. The effect of this amendment in Clause 3 will be to reduce the amount by one-sixteenth&#x2014;from one-quarter to three-sixteenths. Although the overall amount of three-sixteenths of the new total basic wage may be and will be more than one-quarter of the pre-consolidation figure, it does appear to me to be necessary to emphasize that the gratuity payable here is in fact correspondingly less that what it is to-day. In other words, one-quarter of the old wage prior to consolidation is more than three-sixteenths of that amount. We are now taking the consolidating figure and saying we are not going to pay one-quarter of that, but we are going to pay a lesser amount, namely three-sixteenths. I ask the Minister whether it is necessary, in view of the fact that all other factors have changed as well as the consolidation, to have this reduction of one-sixteenth in the gratuity payable, when we all know that consolidation has been brought about as a result of the ever-increasing cost of living. It will appear to me that it is reasonable to assume that the correct amount to be paid should be retained at one-quarter of the consolidated rate so that the gratuity will bear the same proportion to the basic wage as the old quarter did to the preconsolidated rate. I can see no reason why there should be a reduction from one-quarter to three-sixteenths just because of consolidation. Perhaps I can put this simple example to the Minister in this way that one-quarter of R800 would be R200. If the consolidated figure is increased, in respect of basic wage, from R800 to R1,000 then in terms of this amendment he will not receive R250 but he will receive R187.5. I cannot see why there has to be this change. I cannot see why there should be this drop of one-sixteenth. I think that the Minister has been generous in one respect and less than generous in the other when he changed it from one-quarter to three-sixteenths.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>In the previous clause the hon. member saw fit to make a calculation and he came to the conclusion that there was an improvement, but he refrained from making a calculation in this case. Three-sixteenths of the consolidated wage is more than one-quarter of the old basic wage, before cost-of-living allowances were consolidated. This is an improvement.</p>

<p>One-quarter is not better. Three-sixteenths of the consolidated wage is more than one-quarter of the old basic wage. So this is an improvement on the original position.</p>

<from><span class="col_6003-6004" refersTo="page_0248"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I am not denying that. Three-sixteenths of the consolidated rate is more than one-quarter of the pre-consolidated rate, but I say that the fact that we have consolidation is due to all sorts of factors, mainly factors for which the Minister is not responsible. For that reason I cannot see why there should be a drop in the fraction from one-quarter to three-sixteenths. If I were to take the example the Minister has quoted, it is true that three-sixteenths of the consolidated rate is more than one-quarter of the pre-consolidated rate. But then one-quarter of the consolidated rate will be even more&#x2014;it must be; it must be one-sixteenth more. I fail to see why that one-sixteenth should be removed. That is the only query which I am putting to the Minister. I am not saying that three-sixteenths of the consolidated rate is less than one-quarter of the pre-consolidated rate.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>The fact that there is this reduction from four-sixteenths to three-sixteenths appears to me to be an unwarranted reduction. I cannot see why it should be there in view of the fact that the one-quarter was based on basic wages and three-sixteenths will now be based on basic wages. That is what it boils down to. I cannot see why this reduction should take place, seeing that they both deal with basic wages and not with cost-of-living allowances.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 4,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Minister could just clarify the position a little bit. This particular clause gives authority for a change in both the length and the description of two sections of railway lines which were approved under the Railway Construction Act of 1956. It appears from the clause before us, taken in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum, that a portion of that railway line, which itself forms part of the railway line serving the big Native locations at Nyanga and Langa, is also for the distance between Cape Town and Woltemade, a portion of the main railway line to the north. Because of that fact this line which was formerly purely a Native line, will now form portion of the main line to the north for that particular distance and, as a result of that, it appears from the Bill that we are now going to take that piece of the two approved lines of that approval out, as it is now a dual purpose railway line. The explanatory memorandum says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The line of railway between the Avoiding Line Junction (Cape Town) and Nyanga, as approved by Act 43 of 1956, will be provided, but the portion between Avoiding Line Junction (Cape Town) and Woltemade will be so integrated with existing authorized lines of railway that, vide Section 2 (6) of Act 70, 1957, its construction should take place without the authority of a special Act of Parliament.</block>

<p>In other words, it will be correct to say that that particular piece of the line will now form a portion of the main line and can be used for other purposes than those it was originally intended for, namely a subsidized Native railway. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could tell us whether that is in fact the position. If that is the case, then it seems that on that section of the line between Cape Town and Woltemade we will have two different types of traffic, namely the subsidized Native traffic to Nyanga and the other Native townships and the ordinary traffic, either goods or traffic. It will also have two types of fares, the one being the subsidized Native fare and the other being the normal railway fare. It does seem that there is room for a little complication there and I wonder if the hon. the Minister could clarify that position. Because if that interpretation is correct, is it correct to also say that the costs connected with that particular stretch of railway line will be taken away from the cost of the Native railways and charged to your normal railway administration. If that is so will the Native railways have to bear a reasonable proportion of costs of maintenance and upkeep in respect of that particular section of the line or will that be borne by the normal passenger and goods services which use that particular section? Difficulty can be foreseen in the fact that there will be these two types of railways running along the same track, one subsidized and running at a loss covered by a subsidy from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the other an economic one paid for by the persons using the track. If my interpretation is correct in regard to that I wonder if the hon. the Minister could clarify that position a little bit and tell us how that position is to be met.</p>

We have over the years seen the construction of the line from Cape Town to Nayanga but there is also the other line from Kuils River and Bellville Junction to the Nyanga line.

<p>What actually happened in the case of the avoiding line from Woltemade was this: The building of that line was originally included in the Construction Act of 1956. But it was found that improvements would have to be effected to the existing line, the whole section would have had to be improved. Consequently that piece of line could not be regarded as a separate line and must be integrated with all improvements to be brought about to increase the efficiency of the Railways. That can be done without the necessity of having a Construction Act passed by Parliament. That is why that piece of line is now being taken out of the Construction Act because it is integrated with all the other improvements from the avoiding line up to Woltemade. It is part and parcel of increasing efficiency, improving lines and the building of a multiple number of lines and the doubling of lines. Because that can be done departmentally under a different head in the Brown Book, it was necessary to take that piece of a line out of the Construction Act of 1956.</p>

<p>I merely raised the White Paper to pin-point what it was that I wished to raise, Sir. The point I wish to raise here is the question of criminal liability. The White paper deals with civil liability, the penalties attaching to wrong statements as to quality, quantity, purpose and so on. The criminal liability which is provided for is not dealt with in the White Paper and I therefore wish to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has considered the enormity of the penalty which is visited upon people who make false statements. It might seem to be a fairly normal criminal offence to make a false statement wilfully. But on analysis it means just this that if you wilfully make a statement&#x2014;people who make a statement make it wilfully unless they are dreaming&#x2014;and that statement happens to be untrue, although you did not intend to mislead anybody, you are guilty of an offence for which you can be fined &#x00A3;50 or six months&#x2019; imprisonment or both. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should consider, before introducing this Bill in the Other Place, inserting the words &#x201C;knowing it to be false&#x201D; in Clause 8, so that it will then read &#x201C;wilfully makes a false statement knowing it to be false as to the nature, quality, weight, etc.&#x201D; I suggest this because there is some suggestion in the White Paper that this might amount to fraud. Of course, it can never amount to fraud because fraud is a wilful perversion of the truth made with the intent to deceive, resulting in prejudice. But here a perfectly innocent person who said that what he was consigning was screws, when in fact they turned out to be hooks with screws attached to them, wilfully makes that statement, and it so happens that the statement is false, which only means that it is not accurate, and that person then commits an offence for which he can be fined &#x00A3;50 or undergo six months&#x2019; imprisonment. I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<p>This is no new provision. It is identical with the provision in the main Act, except that a few words are added, and it is entirely within the discretion of the court what penalty to impose. If the court finds that it was not done deliberately, the accused will not be found guilty. But this worked quite satisfactorily in the past and we do not think there is any need to qualify it or to add any additional provision. The original Act reads that any person who wilfully makes a false statement is liable to a fine of &#x00A3;50 or, in default of payment, imprisonment not exceeding six months. The wording has been slightly changed, I agree, but the intent and the purpose is the same. It refers to a wilful false statement as to the nature, quantity, weight, measurements, etc., or the purpose for which the goods will be used. In other words, it is identical with the original provision, except that some words were added to it in the beginning.</p>

<p>This particular provision which has now been added, in regard to the purpose for which the goods are intended, applies to the case where someone deliberately misleads the Administration as to the purpose for which the goods are intended, because there may be a differential rate applicable to the same commodity if used for a certain purpose or for another purpose. In other words, it covers the case where the Administration is defrauded. A certain commodity might be transported at a lower rate if used for a certain purpose, but if used for another purpose it might be a higher rate, and the person makes a false statement saying that this commodity is going to be used for a particular purpose and then it is found after wards that it is used for a different purpose, and that would be deliberately defrauding the Administration, and that is why this provision is made.</p>

But I pointed out that these profits which are dealt with in sub-section (5) are the profits made from the sale of liquor in terms of sub-section (1), and sub-section (1) only allows the Administration to supply and sell intoxicating liquor to Bantu servants in any building or room forming part of the compound or hostel maintained by the Administration for the accommodation of its Bantu servants. So you can only sell to Bantu and not to other non-White groups, and sub-section (b) deals with the brewing of Bantu beer required for sale to Bantu servants, and not to any other servants. All these sub-sections in the clause deal with the sale to Bantu and I therefore think it is wrong for the profits on the sale of liquor in terms of this clause to be applied for the benefit of the other non-White groups. I ask the Minister to go into that question again, and if he agrees with my interpretation to amend this clause before it goes to the Other Place so as to ensure that only the Bantu will get the benefit of the profits of the sale of liquor, because in terms of this clause it can only be sold to Bantu.</p>

<p>I have gone into that matter. It is unnecessary to amend the Act, because the Benevolent Fund deals with all non-White servants, but a directive from the Minister can be given that those profits must only be applied for the benefit of the Bantu, and that is what I intend doing. In other words, the profit made from the sale of intoxicating liquor to the Bantu servants will only be used for the benefit of the Bantu, and that directive will be given.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This is the clause which provides for the limitation of actions against the Railways and the period of four months is laid down. If you do not bring your action four months after the cause of action arose, then you are debarred from doing so. But two exceptions were provided in the Act as it is now. If you can show that the Administration is in no way prejudiced by reason of the failure to lodge a claim within that time, or if you can show that having regard to special circumstances the claimant could not reasonably be expected to lodge such claim within that period, the court could grant an indulgence and allow the claim to <span class="col_6009-6010" refersTo="page_0251"/>be prosecuted. Now it is proposed to substitute the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; for &#x201C;and&#x201D;, so that before a person can get around this period of four months he now has to prove both these things. Now, the intention of the original Act was that it was considered to be reasonable that a man would be able to determine his claim within four months after the cause of action arose, but having regard to the fact that you cannot make a rule about causes of action, and when one would reasonably be in a position to prosecute such a claim, this let-out is provided in the Act. If this amendment is in fact passed it means that the dominating factor will now be the convenience of the Railway Administration. It then comes down to this, that if the court finds that in fact a person could not reasonably have brought his claim within four months, it indicates that that is precisely the sort of claim which the Legislature did not intend to fall within the limitation contained in the main provision. What it comes down to then is that you have the right of the individual on the one hand, which you could not have been expected to prosecute within four months, and you have the machinery of the Administration on the other hand. There are a number of cases which could arise. Take the case of a subsidence near a railway property, where railway property abuts on private property, and you have a subsidence on the railway property which causes damage to a building on the private property next door. That is the sort of thing that happens in our courts every day. Almost invariably it is impossible to determine whether a subsidence has occurred, or having discovered that it has occurred, it is almost impossible to discover for many months, usually more than four months, exactly what the extent of the damage is that has been caused. In those cases it means that if the Administration might be embarrassed or finds it a little more difficult to defend the claim made against it, the individual loses his rights. I want to ask the Minister to give very careful consideration to this clause, and I hope that when he introduces it in the Other Place, before doing so he will ask his legal advisers to look into this matter and perhaps to drop this clause, because it means in effect that the individual is now to be prejudiced because of the mere convenience of the Administration, and in cases where the individual could not reasonably be expected to know whether he has a cause of action to prosecute within the prescribed period.</p>

<p>The cases quoted by the hon. member can happen, but in practice it seldom happens that such a matter is taken to court. The Administration usually endeavours to satisfy its customers, and it pays out claims, and it very often gives the claimant the benefit of the doubt. But it does happen, of course, that a claim might be lodged in regard to something which was lost on the railways, after a period of a year or two, when the consignment notes had been destroyed and the servant responsible might have left the service, and then the Administration is in no position at all to defend that claim, although it might have a perfectly good defence. This is merely a safeguard for the Administration, but in practice claims are usually settled out of court. I don&#x2019;t think the hon. member can quote any case which was taken to court, because the Administration tries to satisfy its customers and we usually give the customer the benefit of the doubt, so in practice this will not be any hardship to any claimant at all, but it only covers the Administration in the isolated case where it might be prejudiced.</p>

<p>This clause deals with the employment of foreigners by the Railways. This clause terminates the preference formerly enjoyed by citizens of Commonwealth countries over other foreigners in regard to employment by the Railway Administration. We are told that this is a reciprocal arrangement introduced by virtue of the fact that similar legislation has been passed in other countries in regard to citizenship. I know that in Britain the Act passed a few days ago has fixed exactly the same terminal date as is fixed in this clause, namely the end of 1965. I wonder whether the Minister could tell us whether such corresponding or complementary legislation has actually been passed in all the other countries to which this clause refers.</p>

<p>This clause deals also with citizens of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the Republic of Ireland, and safeguards the employment conditions of servants of the Administration who come from those countries, and who prefer to go on working until January 1966. Presumably this is done because in Britain anyone who had dual citizenship, South African and British, is protected until the end of 1965 by which time they must make their choice. I wonder why the Minister finds it necessary to include all these countries under one umbrella just because the United Kingdom has passed legislation. Why, for instance, should the Republic of Ireland be included? Why should citizens of the Republic of Ireland not enjoy the same rights they have enjoyed hitherto? There has been no change, through our becoming a Republic, in the relationship between our country and Ireland, and I think that generosity should be shown by us in this regard. We do not know yet what countries like Australia and Canada will do in regard to our citizenship. They may well leave the situation as it stands. I hope the Minister will, if necessary, bring in another amendment to this Bill to put it on all fours with <span class="col_6011-6012" refersTo="page_0252"/>what other countries do. The terms of this clause also include a reference to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Surely we stand in a very special relationship to the citizens of Rhodesia. Is it necessary, if Rhodesians are in our Railway employ, to fix the same terminal date as was fixed by Britain in relation to South Africans in State employ in the United Kingdom? Surely there is an historical connection between Rhodesia and ourselves. The Rhodesian citizens might well be excluded. We need not consider them to be foreigners. After all, we may in future have very intimate connections with Rhodesia and with the Rhodesian Railways. Perhaps we will combine to build the Beit Bridge connection to the North. I think this clause was hastily thought out, perhaps through no fault of the Minister. Piecemeal legislation relating to mutual citizenship laws should not be passed. The Minister has probably just followed the advice of his law advisers, without considering whether Rhodesian citizens should not be treated differently. I wonder whether the Minister will consider these facts before the terminal date comes along. I do not want to cause inconvenience to people who are of value to the Railways and who in some cases, like the Rhodesians, have had lengthy connections with this country.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the Minister will also explain one other point. The clause deals with the various categories of Railway servants and the qualifying date is 1 January 1966. How will this legislation affect the officer or employee in the Railways who has had 20 years&#x2019; service and in the normal way of advancement would be due for promotion some time subsequent to 1966? He falls within the category of people mentioned here as being citizens of other states. But he is a permanent official of the Railways who is in every other way qualified for promotion. Will he now suffer a bar in his promotion when he arrives at that date, and have to mark time there, or will he be allowed to continue in the normal manner and to get promotion as he would have done if this situation had not arisen, as the result of the change in the Constitution?</p>

<p>It would of course be a barrier to promotion after 1966, but any servant in the employ of the Administration who is not a South African citizen will have ample opportunity between now and 1966 to become a South African citizen, and if he fails to become a South African citizen he must suffer the consequence.

<p>It includes Rhodesia, too. All these countries are treated on the same basis. The hon. member should really direct his arguments to the Government when the Citizenship Act is under discussion. I am merely bringing this Bill into line with the Citizenship Act which will be introduced. The Minister of External Affairs said only two days ago that it will be introduced, and this is merely to bring it into line with that, and the operative date is 1966. But any citizen of any of the Commonwealth countries, which includes the Republic of Ireland and the Federation of Rhodesia, has the opportunity before 1.966 of becoming a South African citizen. What I am doing now is to protect them for the next five or six years, or at least three and a half years. In other words, I am giving them the opportunity of continuing in the service of the Administration, and of becoming South African citizens. Of course, after that date we will still be in the position to employ people from other countries, even from the Commonwealth, on contract, as we have done in the past, without appointing them to temporary or permanent posts. We can employ them on contract, as we have frequently done with engineers, but if they want temporary or permanent employment they will have to become South African citizens before that date.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned, the hon. the Minister gave us a very broad outline of the economic position of the country as he saw it. One would like to feel that his prophecies are likely to come true, but one could not help feeling that whilst the hon. the Minister took the credit for his Government for the satisfactory state of affairs that existed, one&#x2019;s mind dwelt on the fortuitous events that have taken place since the Nationalist Party has been in power, and which have helped to bring the country to this satisfactory situation. It has been said that whenever South Africa is in trouble, some miracle seems to crop up to save us. If we think back to 1949 when, in contrast to the prosperous state the previous Government of that time had left the country in, it was the fortuitous circumstance of devaluation which saved this country from bankruptcy. After the devaluation of our currency had taken place, and the inflationary effects were being felt, we then had the fortuitous <span class="col_6013-6014" refersTo="page_0253"/>discovery of the Orange Free State goldfields and the development of the West Witwatersrand area, which trebled our gold production &#x2026; [Interjections.] After this event had taken place and the beneficial effects of that discovery were beginning to wear off, we had the discovery of uranium, and that all helped considerably. We then had the state of prosperity that was brought on by the closing of the Suez Canal and the Korean War, and that was followed by the discovery of gold in the Eastern Transvaal. I say that it is in spite of the Government&#x2014;and not because of the Government&#x2014;that we find ourselves in the situation that the Minister has described as far as the economic development of this country is concerned. But, Sir, if the Minister&#x2019;s summary is correct, why is it that he is unable at this stage to lift currency control; why is it that he is not able to alleviate the position as far as import control is concerned and thus bring about a more healthy state as far as the economy of this country is concerned? When the Minister refers to the globular sums which are tied up in capital savings in this country and also foreign reserves, I want to cross swords with him and say that the fact that there is so much capital tied up in private savings is not a healthy situation as far as the economy of the country is concerned. That money should not be tied up in savings, but should be distributed in the private sector in industry and in commerce and be used for further development and progress. That state of affairs, where all this huge capital is tied up in savings, is in my submission an unhealthy state of affairs. If the hon. the Minister felt so sure about the economic possibilities of this country, why did he not enlarge and expound still further on the &#x201C;five-year plan&#x201D; to which he made reference last year? Since he enunciated that policy of a five-year plan, we have heard nothing more about it at all. One had hoped that in his statement last week the Minister would have gone into great detail setting out this five-year plan, so that the public of this country could prepare themselves for further development and fit in their business plans and industrial development accordingly. I would like to ask the Minister if he has abandoned that five-year plan, or whether it is his intention to take it still further.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I believe the Minister did so in his statement to the Federated Chamber of Industries last year. As far as the economy of this country is concerned, the Minister also finds himself on very unsafe ground because of the uncertainty that exists in the minds of industrialists in view of the Government&#x2019;s policy with regard to the development of industries on the borders of the Native areas. I say that one of the reasons why there is this static condition in industry to-day, is this very uncertainty in the minds of industrialists. When the Minister referred to industrial development the other day. hon. members opposite made reference all along mainly to our public utility industrial undertakings, and the development and expansion that lie ahead as far as those industries are concerned; but there was very little reference to, and very little proof given to this House of industrial development by the private sector as such. I submit that there is great uncertainty in the minds of industrialists to-day in connection with the policy of the development of industries on the borders of the Native reserves. Let me say that this phantom scheme that has been envisaged, and into which industry is apparently expected to fit, in some sort of jigsaw scheme, is nothing but a pipe-dream that will never be realized. But in fostering and forcing this scheme at the expense of existing developed areas on the Witwatersrand and elsewhere, we are doing our economy considerable harm. I wish I was able to do what the hon. the Prime Minister seems to be able to do so easily, as far as the economy of this country is concerned, and that is to fragment it in whichever way he thinks it should be fragmented in order to fit into this policy of shifting the Bantu population to the Native reserves. This canker which he is now introducing into the South African economy is going to spread, and as it spreads it is likely to bring about the consumption of its host, that is to say, the South African economy as such. Just to take these industries to the borders of the reserves simply because the reserves are there, is a totally wrong conception as to how a country&#x2019;s economy should be developed: it just will not work, and in the end that project will have to be abandoned. But in the meantime the areas which should be industrially developed, namely the Witwatersrand and other areas, will find themselves in a most unhappy situation. Sir, one of the basic tenets on which this development of industries on the borders of the Native reserves is based, is to maintain a low wage structure in order to encourage industrialists to go along to those areas. When we realize that the Government is giving the assurance to industrialists who are prepared for go to those areas that there will be a maintenance of this wage differentiation&#x2014;possibly for all time&#x2014;otherwise why should industrialists take the risk of going to the borders of the reserves&#x2014;then we can rightly say that this is a criminal act on the part of the Government as far as the economy of this country is concerned. I think it would be just as well that the public should be made aware of the attractive incentives which are being offered to industrialists to go out to these areas, in competition with well-established areas. The following are the incentives which are being offered: the granting of assistance in providing basic services such as power, water and transport; providing houses for White workers; granting higher depreciation allowances for factory buildings and plant; adding to the capital depreciation costs, the expense of transferring the factory to a border area; compensating the entrepreneurs up to a maximum of 75 per cent of the difference between the cost of establishing his factory in a border <span class="col_6015-6016" refersTo="page_0254"/>area and its sale value in the open market; constructing and leasing factory buildings; the Government is prepared to construct and lease factory buildings in order to induce people to go out to these areas; making concessions to industrialists in railway tariffs&#x2014;and here we recently had the appointment of a railway commission with the specific instruction to see how it can reduce railway rates to fit in with industrial development on the borders of the Native reserves&#x2014;next, maintaining the principle of wage differentiation in border areas in so far as this is justified by factors such as the lower productivity of labour and the lower cost of living in these areas. Sir, if all these incentives are being offered simply for the purpose of giving effect to an ideological policy, we feel that similar facilities should be made available to those other areas where you have all the potentialities available, such as water, light, power, roads, housing and everything else. Sir, in the <i>Digest of South African Affairs</i> of April 1962 the Government issued a statement to the effect that there are applications for industries on the borders still under consideration involving a total investment of approximately R12,000,000 for the employment of not more than 900 Bantu. If you have to invest R12,000,000 to employ 900 Bantu&#x2014;and in terms of the report of the Tomlinson Commission it was stated that it would be necessary to employ 30,000 Bantu a year for 10 years, in order to make up for the natural growth of the Bantu population in the reserves&#x2014;then you will have to have a capital investment of approximately R400,000,000 a year in order to maintain this particular rate of advance. My question is whether the people of South Africa are prepared to invest approximately R400,000,000 a year in order to speculate on a scheme which, in my opinion, will not prove a success. If I am right in that connection, I would like to ask the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. Cruywagen) whether he can stand up in this House &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

I also want to plead for the Witwatersrand in the new set-up, but I just want to ask the hon. member please not to raise this matter again, because in the way he is carrying on he is doing the matter more harm than good. Mr. Chairman, you would say that if the United Party had been in power gold would not have been discovered in the Free State; uranium would not have been mined; there would not have been a war in Korea and the Suez Canal would not have been closed. All those things are simply due to the fact that the National Party Government is in power, and we have been saved by &#x201C;miracles&#x201D;, the one after the other. What a stupid argument!</p>

<p>I will quote it; I have not got it with me, because I entered the debate too soon after that hon. member, but I will show it to him. The hon. member should accept it, therefore, that organized industry is prepared to cooperate. We have the new position, therefore, that organized industry is prepared, as is the case in all modern industrial countries in the world, to cooperate in order to bring decentralization of industries about, as is also being done in America and Britain and in various other countries, for other reasons, but it is exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>I definitely wish to plead for the Rand, but I want to approach it from another angle. For many years the gold-mining industry and the agricultural industry have been the two corner stones of our economy. Last year those two jointly still contributed 27.6 per cent of the national income, but the contributions by the manufacturing industry have gradually increased more and more, and only last year this new branch of our economy already contributed 23.4 per cent of our total national income. As regards being a source of employment, the mines originally also played a very important role, and they were the biggest single employers in the Republic, but the situation has changed in such a way, according to the figures which are available to me, that last year, as compared with more or less the 411,000 employees in all the mines (all races included), there were almost 782,000 in the manufacturing industry. In that field as well, therefore, the mining industry has been ousted by the manufacturing industry. There has been tremendous development in the manufacturing industry. According to the latest industrial census, there are 13,532 industries at the moment with an annual wage bill of R571,720,000,000. We are aware of the tremendous development which is taking place to-day in the industrial field; we are aware of the fact that specific attempts are made, and that large sums of capital are invested in various directions in the industrial field; that the capital of State undertakings is getting stronger and that those undertakings are developing in new directions, and that existing institutions, existing utility companies, due to the investment of large amounts of fresh capital, are giving fresh stimulation to our industries as such. We are, moreover, aware of the fact that the textile industry, the iron and steel industry, the chemical industry, the motor and tractor industries, etc., will probably in future be the biggest contributors, and will continue to grow tremendously. We are also in favour of decentralization, because we know that there will otherwise be too great a concentration of Bantu in the urban areas and, secondly, that a shortage of electricity and water will probably develop in those areas. We also accept the policy of border area development <span class="col_6017-6018" refersTo="page_0255"/>and agree that that development is necessary if we want to solve our country&#x2019;s problems. We agree with all these things, but we realize at the same time that this development as such favours certain areas. The border area industrial development shows clearly that there will be great development in the vicinity of Pinetown, Hammersdale, New Germany, Mooi River, Estcourt, Ladysmith, Colenso, East London, Palaborwa and north of Pretoria. We are also aware of it that certain growing points in the White area will be stimulated by an injection of new capital, and that again will benefit places such as Pretoria, Vanderbijlpark and the third Iscor, wherever that may be sited. Sasol will be given a new injection in the way of increased capital from the State; Newcastle will grow as a result of the development of Amcor and the production of cast iron. But nowhere in this whole picture which we accept 100 per cent, where the State takes the initiative and acts as the stimulating force, does the Rand appear at all. I am not asking that the one area should be considered at the expense of the other, but we should observe the old saying that we should do the one thing, but not omit to do the other. Let there be industrial development on the borders of the Bantu areas, but do not let us neglect the Rand. Let me put it this way: I think it will reassure many people if the hon. the Minister were to make a statement to the effect that the State is desirous that certain industries, particularly those who employ a high percentage of non-Whites, should move to the border areas, not all industries as is sometimes incorrectly alleged; that industries employing a high percentage of White labour should continue to remain in the White areas and develop there. I want to plead for the Rand for this specific reason: For many years the Rand has been one of the main sources of income to the State in the shape of its gold mines, in the days of the Transvaal Republic the Rand with its gold mines had already solved the financial problems of the Republic. The goldmining industry remains one of the biggest taxpayers. I have certain figures here which I want to give to the House. During the past four years the normal gold-mining industry taxation, the licences and mynpachtis going to happen to industry in this area?</p>

<p>But there is another matter that I want to talk about this afternoon. I would like to make a plea for a section of our industry which is going through a very bad time. I refer to some 3,500 retail petrol re-sellers. These retail petrol re-sellers have noted with alarm the imposition of 1 cent per gallon customs and excise duty on petrol. The feature which causes the motor trade or the petrol re-seller concern is the fact that with each increase in the basic price, his so-called mark-up or margin of profit decreases. This is due to the fact that the petrol re-sellers&#x2019; margin of profit is pegged by the Price Controller at 3 cents per gallon. While I am prepared to accept that most hon. members in this House are fully aware of the contribution which the motor industry makes to the economy of the country, I believe that the following data bear repetition. In reply to a question which I put on the Order Paper on 4 May, I was informed that the customs duty on petrol for the year 1961-2 was R39,136,360, <span class="col_6019-6020" refersTo="page_0256"/>on diesel fuel R4,205,068, on all motor vehicles R3,328,949, on unassembled motorcars R1,906,485. Excise duty on motor-cars R15,079,613, on petrol R16,211,408, on diesel fuel R1,751,826, and on tyres and tubes R1,654,628. It will be seen therefore that the motor industry itself makes a very substantial contribution to the revenue of this country. In addition to that it is also a substantial employer of labour. At the moment it employs about 100,000 workers, and if the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy of stimulating the local manufacture of automotive parts succeeds&#x2014;and I have no hesitation in saying that we all hope that it will succeed&#x2014;the motor industry will in the future play an even more important part in the economy of this country. But we find that a large proportion of the employers in the motor industry are fighting a losing battle against over-trading, which has been so evident in the industry since 1951 when the system of marketing fuels was changed. They are also faced with rising overhead costs in the shape of labour costs, rents and power, and decreased earnings as the result of over-trading. The statistics released by the Director of Census and Statistics on 18 February 1960, reveal that during the year 1958-9 2,120 incorporated service stations, that is to say, stations operated by owner-employer, showed a loss of &#x00A3;366 per annum after an allowance of &#x00A3;1,000 per proprietor had been made for his services. We know that these small one-man service stations work something like 16 hours a day, and some of them operate for 24 hours a day, for a mere &#x00A3;634 per annum. I doubt whether there is any other sector of the economy in which private entrepreneurs have to operate under such conditions. There is a mistaken belief that these magnificant service stations that you see built all over the country constitute evidence of a flourishing trade. The vast majority of these stations are not owned by the trader but by the oil companies who erect them. I think this Committee is entitled to know that whereas other sectors of the economy have been permitted to adjust their prices in accordance with the rising cost structure so as to ensure for them a reasonable return on labour and capital, this facility has never been extended to the motor trade. I have some figures here which I would like to quote to the Committee. In 1938 bacon was sold at 10.1 cents per lb. and in May 1961 at 28.6 cents per lb.; butter was sold in 1938 at 13.9 cents per lb. and to-day it is sold at 31.6 cents per lb. One could go on quoting examples of essential commodities the prices of which the dealers have been allowed to increase, to meet the rising costs of labour and other charges. You will notice that most of these prices have risen by 100 per cent and in some cases by 300 per cent to 400 per cent. But during this same period the price of petrol at the principal coastal centres has gone up from 13.3 cents to 30 cents per gallon. The significant factor, however, is that customs and excise duties have been increased from 5 cents to 13.083 cents per gallon, and railage from the coastal centres to the Reef, for example, from 3.3 cents to 7.5 cents per gallon, whereas the mark-up of the petrol re-seller has only been increased from 2.5 cents to 3 cents, which has actually resulted in a percentage decrease of practically 100 per cent due to the increased basic price. In 1939 the retailer&#x2019;s mark-up was 17.6 per cent and to-day it is 8.8 per cent. I feel sure that members who have had experience of conducting businesses would not like to operate on such a precarious gross profit margin of 8.8 per cent. Sir, what is the cure? I say there is no immediate cure. I understand that the Government is going to Table some form of a rationalization scheme that has been brought about between the Government and the oil companies, but it will take about 10 years for the industry really to feel the effects of this scheme. In addition to that, the industry, in the platteland in particular, has the competition of the cooperative societies and of the general dealer &#x201C;points&#x201D; which we know as&#x201C;C.O.C. points&#x201D;. I would like to suggest that the Minister should give very serious consideration, if he is not prepared to allow an increase at this stage in the mark up, to releasing the retail price of petrol from control. Accept the fact that there is over-trading in this industry; let the industry by competition find its own level. We have had experience in the past when oil, tyres, etc., were released from price control, the trade did not go mad. The Minister has the power to reimpose control overnight. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I think we all accept the fact that the motor industry is an important industry, but the plea which the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) has just delivered amounts to this that in principle he is asking for an increase in the price of petrol or that the control of petrol should be abolished. I think as far as the abolition of the control of petrol is concerned, we cannot at this stage agree with the hon. member, because petrol is supplied by only a few companies; there are, therefore, strong monopolistic conditions which operate against the possibility of cooperation and I do not think it will be in the interests of the country as a whole to abolish the price control of petrol at this stage. I wish to point out, however, that during recent years the margin of profit in the case of petrol has been increased; that was done at the time of the conversion to decimalization and also before then. I think the profit of the retailer is 3c at the moment, and the big companies which supply the petrol also grant the retailer a certain amount per gallon. The margin of profit is, therefore, big enough. The loss which dealers suffer is apparently in connection with the other services which the garages give and I cannot see why the price of petrol should be increased to off-set the narrow margin of profit which is made in other directions. It is indeed true that there is overtrading and over-trading in the motor trade is one of the main factors which makes the <span class="col_6021-6022" refersTo="page_0257"/>general profits so low. That is precisely why there have been discussions between the motor traders&#x2019; associations and the petrol companies to ensure that the number of garages is limited and a certain amount of agreement has been arrived at with the big companies. The number of filling stations has decreased to some extent over the last year and we hope that tendency will grow. One of the accepted principles is that where a garage goes insolvent the petrol companies should not assist such a garage. You also have the position that when the motor trade complains they insist upon it that those garages which have gone insolvent should not be assisted, but when there are such insolvencies they use the same argument and say: &#x201C;Look at the number of insolvencies; look how we are struggling, you must increase the price of petrol.&#x201D; They want it both ways. I can assure the hon. member, however, that the whole question of the margin of profit on petrol is investigated by the Department from time to time, but so far not a strong enough case has been made out for an increase in the margin of profit on petrol.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) made a plea in connection with crayfish quotas. He pointed out that during recent years the global crayfish quotas have not been increased and that no new quotas have been granted over a number of years. That is quite correct. One of the important factors in this regard is that our crayfish beds have become depleted. There is irrefutable proof of that and that is why it is very difficult to grant new crayfish quotas. As a result of the decline in the supply of crayfish and because we have to protect this valuable source, further steps have even been taken to do so. To dive for crayfish has been prohibited as from April this year; for the first time August and September have been declared a closed season; that is the breeding period. We have also come to an agreement with the various companies that have their big crayfish quotas reduced. The basic amount of crayfish that could be exported per annum was 365,000 boxes of 10 lbs. each; that was reduced by 7&#x00BD; per cent in 1961 and by 10 per cent this year, and it would have continued like that until it reached 15 per cent in 1964. That was done for the very reason that our supply of crayfish had decreased, and viewed against this background, therefore, it has been extremely difficult to grant new crayfish quotas. On the other hand it was found over the years that tremendous pressure was exerted to have crayfish quotas granted to new applicants. There are approximately 50 different applicants. Viewed against this background and in view of those difficulties we have tried to see our way clear to grant a small quota to certain people who have been in the industry for years. With the view to the necessity to protect the industry and to reduce the over-all amount which is exported annually, that has been extremely difficult. The claims of those people who had a right to claim a quota were thoroughly investigated; we negotiated with SAFROC, or those who already had quotas, because it is extremely difficult, of course, to interfere with existing concerns, because they belong to the shareholders and you have to take the boats into account, and the fishermen who are concerned with the various existing quotas. However. I am pleased to be able to announce that we have found a preliminary basis after consultation with the interested bodies and we will now allocate a number of quotas. This has been referred for investigation to Viskor and after consultation with the Department of Sea Fisheries they will submit recommendations to the Department. They have already started those investigations and I trust that this extremely difficult matter will shortly be settled satisfactorily. You will indeed appreciate, Sir, that where the quotas have to be limited and where we have to protect the industry, it will not be possible to satisfy all applicants. I envisage that many will be disappointed, but we will do what we can within all possible limits to grant quotas to and to make certain provision for certain applicants who do not have a quota at the moment but who have already been in the crayfish industry for a long time.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the mouth of the Berg River. As a matter of fact we are investigating that; in other words, the clearing of the mouth of that river. That is being done by the University of Stellenbosch. Unfortunately the report is not yet available but as soon as it is we will be able to judge whether further steps should be taken. If it appears that the report is unfavourable it will certainly be necessary to investigate the vicinity with a view to alternative harbour facilities, which was indeed what the hon. member pleaded for.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;) spoke about generating electricity at the Orange River scheme. The entire Orange River scheme is only in its initial stages but Escom is already discussing the whole matter and is trying to determine the force of the water at various specific points in an attempt to ascertain how much electricity can be generated. As far as the southern Free State is concerned, the Electricity Control Board agreed in December 1961 that the Electricity Supply Company in the southern Free State which gets its power from the Bloemfontein Municipality, should continue to supply electricity to the towns of Reddersburg, Edenburg, Tromps-burg, Springfontein, Bethulie and Philippolis and hydro-electric power can very easily be incorporated into this system. We also have the areas from Aliwal as far as Hopetown and Port Elizabeth and East London, areas which are served separately by Escom, but it is even possible that electricity may be supplied to those areas from the Orange scheme. The hon. member for Smithfield may rest assured that as far as provision of electricity to that whole area is concerned, it will in due course be properly planned; we will try to make the supply from this hydro-electric scheme as widespread as possible.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) was speaking, the hon. the Minister looked up with great surprise and said: &#x201C;Where did I ever speak of a five-year plan for industries?&#x201D; Mr. Chair-main, last year the hon. the Minister spoke at a very good dinner of the Federated Chambers of Industries in Johannesburg, where I was present also, and here are the words he used&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, what is essential is careful advance planning and here I would particularly stress the necessity for all of us to set ourselves certain clearly defined individual objectives for the next five to ten years.</block>

<p>He then added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government itself is of course directly involved in exercising very substantial powers of direction and control.</block>

<p>Then he added this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection I may mention that I have given instructions to my own Department to establish clearly defined objectives which it proposes to pursue during the next five years.</block>

<p>He also asked that steps should be suggested in order to achieve those objectives. If that is not a five-year plan then I do not know what is. I have already heard of an economic czar in China or an economic czar in Moscow whose five-year plan failed, but this is the first time I have ever heard of an economic czar who had forgotten about his five-year plan. I admit it was a very fine dinner, but if I can remember the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words, he should do so too. Perhaps we should come to the conclusion that the hon. the Minister suffered from a loss of ghostwriter&#x2019;s memory.</p>

<p>I should like to come to another matter. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister in all earnestness what he contemplates doing in connection with the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Fertilizer Industry that was tabled this year, a committee he appointed last year. I wish to know what he is going to do about the disturbing state of affairs in the fertilizer industry, as well as in connection with the equally ominous recommendations made in this report. This is another Viljoen Commission Report, but it does not compare favourably with the previous one. This Committee found that there is a monopolistic or an oligopolistic state of affairs in the fertilizer industry in South Africa. Instead of making recommendations to combat and to change that monopolistic cartel state of affairs, this report now actually makes recommendations to strengthen that monopoly still further, which can only result in higher prices for the farmers as regards fertilizer, and that in comparison with modern developments overseas, a fertilizer of poorer quality shall be made available to the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<p>This Committee found that there is such a monopoly in fact. Let me read what paragraph 273 says. This is what this Committee found&#x2014;is not a recommendation, but a finding&#x2014;in connection with this monopolistic state of affairs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But there are also important disadvantages attached to this form of organization. Cartels generally aim at maintaining prices above a competitive level. The result of this form of organization is often to suspend the process of selection and to maintain the high cost units at the expense of the low cost ones. It also tends to have a soporific effect, to retard the introduction of novelties, new techniques, and new entrants into an industry.</block>

<p>In other words, this cartel may contribute to keeping new methods and new mixtures out of South Africa. That is a monopoly. There are, for instance, only two large companies in South Africa to-day who manufacture superphosphate, and only one large one that manufactures urea. There are only three altogether that handle 87 per cent of the mixtures. And that is not all. On this Committee there were representatives of the great monopolies, and they even came along with further demands. According to paragraph 270, they suggested that there should be a quota system among those few companies. In paragraph 270 this is said:</p>

<block name="quote">By agreement between the fertilizer companies, sales and production quotas would be established for the existing firms. These quotas would be based on the present volumes of sales and on the available and already projected plant capacities. An embargo would be placed on any expansion of plant capacity as long as the existing capacities of all companies have not been fully taken up.</block>

<p>That was a recommendation of organized industry. It is a clear indication of a monopolistic situation they desire where competition would be deliberately stifled, simply in order to keep prices high for the farmer and so as to get a stifling hold on production in South Africa.</p>

<p>No, I am not speaking as a farmer myself, but I can give the hon. member the assurance that on Saturday I was at two meetings in Western Transvaal, and I wish the hon. member could have heard what the farmers there said about the maize price. The position actually is much worse than that when I look at the recommendations of this Committee. Why did the Committee suppress certain things? Why did the Committee not mention the deliberate attempts that are being made to keep a newer and better and <span class="col_6025-6026" refersTo="page_0259"/>cheaper process, and a more effective process, for the manufacture of fertilizer out of the country, a process that has captured 50 to 60 per cent of some of the countries of Western Europe, and is being applied successfully there? Why are the farmers not told what the true position is in the industry? Here is a paragraph in the Report in which the true state of affairs comes to light, at page 6, where the Committee says:</p>

<block name="quote">There is still much leeway to be made up before we are in line with the more progressive countries. The plant food contained in our mixtures is still considerably lower than that in the more progressive countries.</block>

<p>What is the reason? R56,000,000 of big capital is invested in the production of certain of these fertilizers that are of an inferior quality at the present time. Sasol also produces a great quantity of ammonium sulphate, which to-day is the great source of nitrogen, and Sasol has to be protected under this. Many of those big companies have also asked that there should be a quota control of the product of Phalaborwa so that they can get some of it, and all the new processes can be eliminated. Mr. Chairman, the recommendations of that Committee are shocking indeed. Not only do they refuse, to say that that monopoly should be opposed, but they even come along and say that further restrictions on imports should be imposed, in paragraphs 310 and 311. In paragraph 311 they say for instance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now that synthetic nitrogen is being produced in this country, it may become necessary to extend protection to the industry against dumping.</block></speech>

<p>I shall tell you. The disadvantages of this system are these. The Committee now also demands further control over distribution. They even claim a sales syndicate in paragraph 306 of this report. The disadvantages of this oligopoly, as they call it, is that we are lagging behind the rest of the world and that we are thwarting good food production in our country. Under the existing system we are still importing 770,000 tons of basic materials. You would not have to import many of those basic materials if some of the new processes were allowed in South Africa. That simply means farmers have to pay a higher price for fertilizer. However, if a stop is put to this monopoly, there is a possibility of our saving large amounts of currency at present being used for the importation of those basic products. It is possible also that a better product may be produced, in other words, that cheaper and better fertilizer will be made available, more concentrated fertilizer on which less freight will have to be paid. These are all matters to which the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs should devote his attention. For the new products export markets could also be found in the rest of the world, whereas with the present product that cannot be done on that scale.</p>

<p>Let me suggest to the hon. the Minister what he could and should do. Firstly, he should reject the recommendations that would strengthen the oligopoly. Secondly, I wish to suggest to him to have an inquiry made under the Act on monopolies as soon as possible in regard to these allegations concerning a monopoly in the manufacture of fertilizer at the present time. And let him, moreover, give effect to what is asked in paragraph 168&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">New fertilizer materials, such as complex fertilizers and new formulations of high analysis mixtures to replace or to supplement the existing range may be introduced, subject to approval by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services.</block>

<p>I had the opportunity of studying the report of the C.S.I.R. and I think all praise is due to the Department and that it deserves the gratitude of this House for the good work it is doing. I, however, want to plead this afternoon for further investigation into the use of agricultural implements, for an investigation from which we will be able to learn more about agricultural implements and so make that knowledge available to the farmer in South Africa, in co-operation with the Department of Agricultural Technical Services.</p>

<p>When you travel through the Republic of South Africa and you go to the farms, Sir, you see millions of rands&#x2019; worth of agricultural implements lying about in a rusted condition, agricultural implements which have not become worn out in the service of agriculture, but implements which were injudiciously acquired by the farmers. They were acquired injudiciously as a result of the lack of guidance as far as the acquisition of agricultural implements is concerned. We are grateful for the services which are being rendered and for the work which the South African Bureau of Standards is doing to test the quality. But what we really require in South Africa is proper research into the effectiveness of implements, agricultural implements which are adaptable to the agricultural conditions prevailing in South Africa. When you study the report of the S.C.I.R., Sir, you will notice with gratitude that guidance is given to various provincial administrations and even to private organizations in respect of the granting of tenders for certain implements required for road construction or other purposes. I think that is very necessary because that has a direct bearing on production costs in South Africa. The guidance in respect of the acquisition of agricultural implements should not only be aimed at the effectiveness of those implements themselves, but should also be aimed at retaining the fertility of the soil. The implements which are acquired <span class="col_6027-6028" refersTo="page_0260"/>should be such that they do not destroy the fertility of the soil. I want to make a strong plea this afternoon that that should be done on the one hand and one the other hand that the Minister&#x2019;s Department should conduct further research in the interests of the agricultural industry and provide us with further guidance so that there will be less injudicious buying. Secondly, I wish to plead and say that if necessary we should, as far as our international trade agreements allow us, take drastic steps in this country in order to protect the farmers against the variety of tractors and agricultural implements which enter South Africa or which are manufactured locally; there are far too many makes. I want to plead for the standardization of agricultural implements and tractors. I think the time has arrived that we do not accede to the whims of every person who wants to buy a different make of tractor. Just think of the agencies in South Africa who have to stock spare parts for the great variety of tractors which are used in South Africa. Millions and millions of rands&#x2019; worth of spares are lying on the shelves, interest-free, useless. They have to be there just in case somebody who uses a certain make of tractor may require a spare part. But it may lie there for years and years. I want to plead for an investigation into the desirability and the possibility of making a national tractor in South Africa, a tractor which is adapted to the requirements of the South African farmer, a standardized tractor&#x2014;three types, a heavy, medium and light type. I plead for that because I believe it will be in the interests of the country and in the interests of the agricultural industry to standardize the tractive power which we use, the mechanical tractive power.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend to follow the hon. member who has just spoken, but I want to come back to the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder). One can&#x2019;t blame him for living in the Utopia of good things that the hon. the Minister has described to this Committee. The hon. member managed to find a figure of wages paid out by secondary industry about ten times bigger than the gross national income of South Africa. I don&#x2019;t know whether that is merely a reflection of the Minister&#x2019;s wonderful Utopia, or whether it is an indication of what happens when you get people interfering in fields which perhaps are not quite as close to them as they might be. Of course the hon. member did not only make a mistake there. He went on to talk of decentralization and border industries as though they were one and the same thing. Mr. Chairman, they are not at all one and the same thing, and the hon. member would know it if he were interested in economy instead of politics. The hon. member comes here and talks of industries, organized industry, supporting the idea of border industries, and I challenge him to produce to this House one single occasion on which organized industry has supported border industries. I am not talking about decentralization, which both sides of the House support, but I am speaking of border industries in terms of this Government&#x2019;s policy where it is not the economics which matter but where it is the political advantage or the political plan which is going to determine where those industries are to be sited.</p>

<p>However, I want to come back to two matters, and the first is in connection with the hotel industry in South Africa. I don&#x2019;t intend to repeat the plea which I made last year to the hon. the Minister; that stands on record and the position this year, a year later, is if anything even worse than it was a year ago. Many hotels are being forced to close or are struggling against increasing odds and finding it more and more difficult to survive. The hon. the Minister last year made a tentative offer of a full investigation into the industry. This year he said that he would not have time for that commission of investigation to be appointed. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot reconsider that, to work in with the steps which the industry itself is taking to try to put its own house in order. He will be aware that there was a conference only last week at which decisions were taken by the Federated Hotel Association, far-reaching decisions in regard to their own future. I would ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to reconsider his decision that he will not appoint a commission this year, or in the near future.</p>

<p>The other point to which I wish to refer is that of import control. The hon. the Minister said that it was not possible to relax import control, yet there have been various statements, one on 14 March, two months ago, which gave the impression that it was to-day a comparatively easy matter to get permits and to get import quotas. Now I would like to say that there are many people who are not finding it such an easy matter. I will admit that the long-established businesses, the bigger businesses, are able to meet their requirements fairly fully. But a tremendous hardship is being created, not necessarily in the end-result, but in the difficulty in obtaining finalization of applications. I want to pay a tribute to an overworked staff who are not able to handle the volume of work which passes through their hands. I think the Minister must agree with me that the staff which has had to handle the problems of import control over the last year or more have not been sufficient for the volume of work. It has created a tremendous physical strain and has led to delays in the handling of the work which they should have handled. Another matter is the position of the acting director. The acting director has been acting in that capacity now, under very, very difficult conditions, at a time when that department has been loaded as it has not been loaded for many years, and yet he remains in an acting position and is not appointed to the full post which he is holding down, and I believe holding down, successfully. A job which I believe he is holding down with success. I think not only does the staff deserve <span class="col_6029-6030" refersTo="page_0261"/>recognition for what they have done but the acting head of that Department deserves recognition for the task which he has performed. That recognition should be in the form of confirmation in the position which he holds. But those steps alone are not going to eliminate all the hardships, Sir, because there are delays of anything up to two or three months before finalization can be reached in regard to applications. During that period smaller and particularly growing businesses are suffering. It does not happen in the case of every application but many applications take longer than that period. The Minister says he wsants to help those businesses which are growing. In March he allowed a special additional permit for businesses which could show that they had increased their turnover. But it is the practical application of these policies to the persons who are going to be affected by them with which I am concerned. I have had people coming to me over and over again&#x2014;and I am sure the Minister is aware of those cases which I have brought to his attention myself&#x2014;cases where people have been in difficulty. For every one case which comes to the attention of the Minister there are dozens of other cases which do not reach the stage where they are brought to his personal attention or the personal attention of the director. In those cases, during the period of indecision, harm is done to the business. For instance at the Annual General Meeting of the Textile Wholesale Association last month here in Cape Town a very strong plea was made by the Chairman of that association for special consideration. He made very clear the tremendous hardship which was being suffered by specialist textile wholesalers. I have raised the matter with the Minister and with the Director and they have said it was not possible to make special arrangements for these people. The practical result is that profits are dropping and people are put out of work because there is a decline in business. For all the general, over-all, global figures, the fact that matters to the man who is out of work is the fact that he cannot get a job. It does not help to say how wonderful everything is in the garden if you are trying to persuade the man who is standing in an unemployment queue or to the man who is battling to keep his business alive, how rich the country is. More and more of the small businessmen are struggling to-day. We find more and more that the small businessman is struggling to make ends meet. The small shopkeeper is unable to meet his bills; as a result the wholesaler is in difficulty in relation to the manufacturer and so the vicious circle goes on. But the starting point is with the small businessman in South Africa. It is the small businessman and the man who is unemployed who is not going to be satisfied with global figures. The Minister must realize that that is the position. He must realize that whatever he may say in regard to the beautiful picture as a whole, there are these difficulties and these difficulties are not being met. So I hope, Mr. Chairman, that particularly in regard to this one point which I have raised that of import control <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the specialist and the smaller man, the Minister will be able to say that he is now in a position perhaps to take a different attitude towards this problem and so alleviate to some extent the hardship which the small businessmen are suffering.</p>

<p>I do not propose to follow the non-political economist or the new fertilizer expert of the United Party in their arguments.</p>

<p>I should like to bring another matter to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, and that is the supply of electricity to the Sundays River Valley. It has now been many years that this densely populated and highly developed valley has tried to obtain electricity from Escom, and when, about ten years ago, Escom completed its power station at Swartkops, the Sundays River Valley thought that they would be able to obtain power from Escom from its power station there. But, before an agreement could be concluded, this power station was sold to the Municipality of Port Elizabeth. All the negotiations came to naught, and they could not persuade the Municipality of Port Elizabeth to provide electricity economically for them in the Sundays River Valley.</p>

<p>Now the Department of Water Affairs has built a dam at Kouga. in the Gamtoos Valley, and it has been decided to build a hydroelectric power station there. Now I can tell you that the Gamtoos Valley is so close to the Sundays River Valley that at one stage there was a scheme to bring water from the one valley to the other. I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that it apparently is possible economically to bring electricity to the Sundays River Valley from the hydroelectric power station at Kouga.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made here to the power station to be erected when the Orange River scheme is constructed, and we are assuming that a power station will also be built in the vicinity of Port Elizabeth, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has stated here. But we should like to point out that such a power station surely cannot be built within the next seven, eight or even ten years, whereas electricity will be available from the Kouga power station within a year or two. Surely I need not draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the necessity of electricity for that particular valley. As I have said already, it is a highly developed valley; much power is consumed there, e.g. for pumping water and other purposes. Electrification for those parts will help them to develop still faster than the development during recent times, especially now in view of the adequate water supply for that area. I hope and trust the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to give us a favourable reply in connection with this matter, and that he will investigate the possibility of supplying power in the near future from the Kouga hydroelectric power station to the Sundays River Valley.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to support the hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) <span class="col_6031-6032" refersTo="page_0262"/>in his plea made here for further investigation in regard to the standardization of implements. I think it is the experience of all of us that not only do the spare parts of implements cost large sums of money, but even the spare parts of vehicles as well. We have already had the experience that certain implements or vehicles are purchased and used for a short while, and when later or even very soon we require spare parts for them, and we go to the agents, a search throughout the country is set afoot to obtain the necessary spares. After waiting a long time, you are then told that spares will have to be imported from America or Britain or some other country. I should like to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister very strongly. When a person is granted an import permit for vehicles or implements, he should not be permitted to import such implements or vehicles unless he has sufficient spares for those vehicles and implements available at suitable points in the country. As regards the standardization of implements and vehicles&#x2014;well, if it can be done, I shall be one of the greatest protagonists for it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>During the course of his reply to the criticism from all sides of the House, the hon. the Minister gave us the impression that as far as the European Common Market was concerned, he was very uncertain. The Minister gave us a very sketchy outline of what he anticipated the future would be. Reading his comments it is quite clear to us that the Minister is as uncertain as to the future as all the rest of us are. We know that the Minister is going overseas and no doubt after his negotiations overseas he will be in a better position to give us some more information next year. We hope that his visit overseas will be successful. It is very difficult for us, Sir, to follow the line of the Minister&#x2019;s argument. When we suggested the development of the markets to the north the hon. the Minister suggested that it was foolish to look to those markets because they in turn were industrializing. He suggested that Rhodesia and those countries who had recently obtained self-government would start their own industries. Surely, Mr. Chairman, if these countries to our north are starting their own industrial schemes to the extent that they will not require the products of our industries, how much less can we expect the products of our industries to be required by the countries of Europe? Surely the very argument which the Minister used with regard to the markets to our north, destroys his whole argument when he suggested that we might find markets in Europe. We may get a certain market in Europe for our primary products, but we are not concerned with our primary markets in this debate, Sir. We are concerned with secondary industry. Secondary industry is very concerned indeed. It does not see any immediate market in the countries of Europe in the Common Market. If on the other hand I am wrong. I hope the Minister will correct me during the course of his reply and tell us what markets he expects to get for our secondary industry in Europe. What I suggest to the Minister when he goes overseas is to give consideration to the advice given by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) when he suggested standardization for agricultural implements. The Minister should try to persuade overseas concerns to come to this country and bring their knowledge and experience here. The hon. member for Wolmaransstad suggested that there should be some research here. We can capitalize on the research which has been undertaken in Europe over many years. Instead of sending our pig-iron to Japan we can fabricate our pig-iron here and make the products which Japan is now making. One of the things which the Minister ought to do overseas will be to encourage people to bring their technical knowledge here. Instead of exporting our rayon pulp overseas we should manufacture it here and produce rayon. Some of the by-products of Sasol are being sent overseas for the development of nylon products. Instead of doing that we should be able to process those products locally. What we want here in this country is to manufacture our raw material and semi-processed raw materials. It is sad that our semi-processed materials are being sent out of this country overseas to be processed further. The Minister may have some success in the European Common Market as far as primary products are concerned but I do hope he will give us some further information in regard to secondary industries. I think he will have to give more attention when he gets overseas to asking overseas to concentrate on coming out here. They have the technical know how and we should give them some inducement. The Minister should talk to his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance and see whether some inducement can be held out to these people to come out here. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) correctly asks &#x201C;What about the Transkei?&#x201D; I wish the hon. the Minister would tell us who is the influencing factor in the establishment of these border industries? We know nothing about that. Is it his colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development? Has he got the final say? Or is it the Minister of Economic Affairs? Are those industries established on the basis of economics or is the guiding factor the desire of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister to keep a certain number of Bantu in that area? Is economics a consideration? Because if economics is not a consideration then the Minister of Economic Affairs has no say in the matter at all. We would like to know, Mr. Chairman, because so far there is very little evidence that it is on economic considerations and on economic considerations alone that those border industries are being established. The Minister suggested in the course of his reply that part of the unemployment was due to mechanization. Is the intention to establish border industries with no mechanization? Is mechanization regarded as an evil? Because if mechanization is causing unemployment, to expect to get markets overseas without mechanizing is sheer foolishness. We can say goodbye to those <span class="col_6033-6034" refersTo="page_0263"/>markets, because people only introduce mechanization to reduce costs. We want more clarity on this matter, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The Minister owes us an explanation in regard to quotas. The issuing of quotas for new makes of cars when the existing people are already on a quota basis cannot be justified. I do not want to mention names, Sir, but I know of certain types of motor-cars which were imported a few years ago which have no second-hand value to-day, although they are only two to three years old because the firms concerned cannot import the spares. The Minister owes the House an explanation in regard to the sugar industry. The other day the hon. the Minister was asked a question in the Other Place in regard to the issue of additional quotas and he indicated that new quotas had been given to new people in the sugar farming industry&#x2014;quotas were given in the Hluhluwe River storage area in respect of sugar. And this was done at a time when the whole of the industry had been cut by 25 per cent. How can the Minister justify the issue of quotas to new farmers in a new area when existing farmers have had their quotas cut by 25 per cent when in some cases the sugar cane is standing on the lands? How can new quotas be justified in those circumstances? I think the whole of this quota should be free from Ministerial intervention whatsoever. The sugar quotas should be left entirely to the Sugar Industry Central Board. That board has worked satisfactorily for many years and I think it is unfortunate that there have been occasions when that Board has had to appeal to the Minister. I think the Minister should only interfere as a last resort. I think it is unfortunate that in this case when the industry itself is under a quota that the Minister should have intervened. We have come to the end of the discussion on the Vote Economic Affairs. We expected to get some indication as to what the Minister&#x2019;s policy was going to be but instead of that we got a very sketchy report about his proposed trip to Europe. I accept that he can give us no more than that at this stage. Reference has been made to his five-year plan, the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) has already referred to that. We would like to know what the plans are for the future. The farming community is anxious to know what the Minister&#x2019;s plans are for the future development of the Electricity Supply Commission. We are very much behind with the development of rural electricity, very much behind indeed, Sir. We know nothing about the proposed future schemes for Sasol. As far as Sasol is concerned we raised the matter last year and suggested to the Minister that on the present basis Sasol was not a financial success and that we had to face the writing off of the capital.

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the time has arrived for me to reply to most of the matters which have been raised here. Hon. members will realize that this is not the time to deal in detail with all the matters which have been raised. I will try to reply as briefly and as fully as possible to some of the questions. As far as those are concerned which stand over and which I cannot reply to to-day, I undertake to reply in writing to those hon. members who have put those questions to me, after the record has been checked.</p>

<p>In the first place, Mr. Chairman, I want to reply to ceratin questions in regard to the European Common Market. The problem of South Africa&#x2019;s relation to the Common Market is perhaps the most important problem which has been raised during the discussions over the last few days. I want to refer in the first place to certain remarks which have been made by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) to the effect that it seems that we have no clear idea as to what has to be done to protect South Africa&#x2019;s economic interests against the possible harmful effects of the E.E.C. or of Britain&#x2019;s entry into the E.E.C. In this regard I want to state quite clearly that I must admit that we have no complete clarity on this point. We have no clearly defined idea as to what our policy should be. I do not think there is any country in the world which has a clearly defined idea as regards its policy towards the E.E.C. simply because of the fact that there are so many uncertainties, so many factors that we know nothing about, and so many intangibilities in the whole affair that it is impossible to come to any clear idea at this stage as regards future policy. The E.E.C. was established in Rome in 1958. The Treaty of Rome simply gives a broad outline of the policy and the details still have to be filled in. As far as the E.E.C. has progressed in filling in the details of its policy they have come under the close scrutiny of GATT. At all those conferences where the E.E.C. has been under discussion by GATT we have participated. South Africa has always sought to protect her own export interests against the possibility of the common export tariff of the E.E.C. developing in a direction which may be harmful to our export industry. There are intangibilities in regard to the whole common external tariff; there is uncertainty in regard to the agricultural policy; there is uncertainty in regard to Britain&#x2019;s joining the Common Market and the terms and conditions under which she will join it. There have been so many uncertain aspects in the whole Common Market that it has been totally impossible for any country to have come to a final defined policy. It is only now that we have reached a stage where certain things are gradually emerging that we can start talks in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s relation to the Common Market.</p>

<p>In regard to the matter of compensation which is also a matter raised by the hon. member for Constantia, I want to put it in a nutshell and say this: In regard to compensation for preference we might lose if Britain enters the Common Market such a loss of preferences will be to the benefit of other <span class="col_6035-6036" refersTo="page_0264"/>countries including Common Market countries. It is clear that if we lose our preferences on the British market other countries will gain by it. Similarly if Britain should lose her preferences in South Africa, which will automatically follow if we lose our preferences in Britain, other countries will benefit from it because there will be no discrimination between Britain and those countries; they will enter on the same terms and not on worse terms than Britain. Such a process of elimination of preferences will bring benefits to Common Market and other countries. This elimination of preferences is something for which we can demand compensation, inter alia, in the form of a lowering of tariffs in the E.E.C. We can also view this matter from another angle. There are all sorts of possible ways of obtaining compensation in the field of any future negotiations for amending or eliminating tariff concessions we have granted under GATT. At the moment we are bound under GATT to certain tariff structures, certain tariffs which we are not allowed to increase because they are bound. If we want to unbind these tariffs in order to protect or foster one industry or another, we have to go to GATT to try to unbind these tariffs and we have to give something in compensation for this unbinding. These sacrifices which we make now, if we have to make them, can also be used as compensation, as a payment, in order to obtain an unbinding of tariffs which are now bound under GATT. I think the hon. member for Constantia, as a former Minister of Economic Affairs, will no doubt understand that it is better that I do not disclose too much about these matters at this stage, because these are points which have to be negotiated when I go overseas. I think he will appreciate that.</p>

<p>In regard to the Commonwealth and the Ottawa Agreements I must say this that as we see the position Britain cannot negotiate tariff concessions for Commonwealth countries with the E.C.C. that would not also apply to South Africa. This would be a violation of the principle of non-discrimination of GATT. Any tariff concessions in favour of Commonwealth countries which flow from Britain negotiations with the Common Market must also benefit South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>Why?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Because all these preferences are based on the Ottawa agreements. Britain has certain commercial agreements with those countries. Britain has an Ottawa agreement with us. We all form under the same banner, to put it that way; we all have the same type of agreement. If you were to read the rules of GATT, Mr. Chairman, you will see that there is no reference to the Commonwealth. Then do not look at this matter from a political point of view. They regard it as a group of countries which have certain forms of trade amongst themselves.</p>

<p>A question has been put in regard to statistics relating to our exports. I think the hon. member for Pinetown raised that question, also the hon. member for Constantia. A preliminary study of our exports to Britain and the Commonwealth has been made but a more detailed study is a very comprehensive task and we are busy with that. We have invited the co-operation of commerce and industry and agriculture and all the export organizations, a request to which they have kindly acceded. Members of my Department and representatives of the various export organizations are busy at the moment with a detailed study of all the exports in order to see how we shall be individually affected. I hope to be in possession of all the details which we will require in regard to our negotiations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia has also asked me what I regarded as a sufficient limit for our foreign reserves, what figure should be accepted as the figure which would enable us to be satisfied that we could start breaking down that figure in the way of easing export control, for instance. I must say, Sir, that it is impossible to commit oneself to a definite figure. That figure of what the level of our reserves should be depends on so many circumstances, it specially depends on the economic conditions prevailing at the time. What that figure has to be depends entirely on the inflationary or deflationary tendencies in the economy at the moment; it depends on the export or import relations, on the balance of payments position at the moment; it depends on the volume and the trend of industrial activity at the moment; it depends on the fact whether there is in existence any financial controls or not; it depends on the state of the share market prices, both here and abroad. There are so many factors that have to be taken into consideration when you consider whether the level of your reserves is high enough that it is impossible for me to make any statement on it now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) also asked me about consular documentation and what we were going to do in future. I must say that we have no real problems in this regard. It is the importing country which determines what documentation is necessary. In South Africa we do not prescribe any particular documentation. It is only in the case of cotton and rayon piece goods that we require a certificate in regard to the price and the origin. Those certificates are usually obtained from commercial organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce. So in these cases we really do not need consuls. It is only in the case of Hong Kong where consular documentation is necessary, which the British Consulate is doing for us, and this arrangement suits both them and us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) has commented on the post of Director of Import-Export Promotion and asked what would happen in regard to the <span class="col_6037-6038" refersTo="page_0265"/>filling of that post. In filling that post we had to take into account various other staff changes which were under consideration. A recommendation has now been made and the new Director will assume duty within a short time, when his transfer from abroad can be finalized.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about our policy in regard to increasing the local content of motor vehicles. I can just briefly say that I enunciated the Government&#x2019;s policy several times, including last March at the Rand Show. Briefly stated, the policy is that we know that we have to build up our own South African motor industry, but we cannot start at the top by building a complete motor-car. We can only start at the bottom by manufacturing as many component parts as possible and getting the assemblers to use as large a percentage as possible of locally manufactured components. We can do that in several ways, in the first place through tariff protection of those industries which manufacture motor-cars from local components. Some time ago we could not apply the tariff protection necessary because most of these tariffs were bound by GATT, but we have secured release on this binding in the case of most of these tariffs, and we can now foster these industries by means of protecting them by means of duties. The second means is by import control, by giving additional import quotas to assemblers to the extent that they increase the local content of their product.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) is not here at the moment. He mentioned a number of figures in respect of trade with Britain. Unfortunately his figures were not correct and consequently his conclusions were not correct. I will not go into that. He raised the matter of the appointment of consular staff and trade representatives in various countries. We are in the process of expanding that personnel. He referred to South America and I wish to tell him that we are negotiating for the appointment of representatives to South America in Rio and Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) asked about trade with Japan, the export of materials in bulk and payment for these materials, and whether the Government has taken steps to ensure that payment will be made in foreign currency and not in goods which might constitute a source of undesirable competition for our own industries. I must say in the first place that there is no trade agreement with Japan, and the contract the hon. member is referring to is a private contract between a firm like Hancock and Japanese industry. In this case, too, payment will be made in foreign currency in terms of the contract, against individual deliveries under the contract. We have no trade agreement with Japan and consequently there is no balancing of exports and imports. Each individual item in the trade exchange between South Africa and Japan stands on its own legs and is settled in its own way. So the situation the hon. member envisages does not arise at all, and it is an exporter from South Africa who has to satisfy the authorities that he will bring in foreign exchange in settlement of the deal. The hon. member asked about the agreements between the U.S.A. and the Common Market countries, and to what extent South Africa will benefit from them. I can briefly state that these negotiations have been carried on for the last two years and are very involved, and deal with countries coming to Geneva under GATT and negotiating for release from certain bindings and the withdrawal or modification of certain tariff concessions. There were negotiations as a result of the common external tariff of the E.E.C. and there were negotiations, like the Dillin negotiations, about tariff decreases. We took part in the first two agreements. I need not go into them, but the last one was conducted between America and the E.E.C. and a number of other countries, and the effect of these negotiations was that they agreed to a reduction in duties to the extent of about 20 per cent on a long list of items. In a case of America, 678 items were covered, which represented about 795,000,000 dollars. The effect of South Africa is briefly this, that we also benefit from this 20 per cent reduction in tariffs. They were granted between the E.E.C. and other countries on the one hand and America on the other hand, reducing certain tariffs by 20 per cent, and we also benefit, because the things which fall under these tariffs and which we also export to these countries are also treated in this more liberal way, and we give nothing in compensation. Some of our exports to America and to the E.E.C. countries will therefore have easier entry into those countries.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Vereeniging and Sunnyside spoke about Sasol and asked when we were going to build a second Sasol. My reply to that is that one can naturally not refrain from thinking vaguely about a second Sasol, but it is not necessary for us to think along definite demarcated lines. I do not think the time is opportune for that. In the first place we must see to it that Sasol becomes more established in its present form and rounded off so that we will be in a position to reap the fullest benefit from the experience we have gained with Sasol. I also think it is necessary that we do not take an isolated view of Sasol but that we view the whole oil position in South Africa as one problem We are investigating the oil and fuel problem as a whole, because from a strategic point of view that is a problem which confronts South Africa, and in the light of those investigations we will decide about Sasol at a later stage.</p>

<p>I do not want to be too long. I just want to reply to the hon. member for Springs (Mr.Taurog), <span class="col_6039-6040" refersTo="page_0266"/>who spoke about all the fortuitous things that happened in South Africa. Sir, it is very strange that when anything favourable happens to South Africa, it is always fortuitous, but when anything unfavourable happens it is always the fault of the Government. It is true that we have had some strokes of luck in the past few years, but we have also had some strokes of very bad luck, and they are never taken into account. Talking economically, it was a stroke of very bad luck to South Africa that the price of gold has been fixed since 1934. Another piece of bad luck was that in respect of many of our major exports, the terms of trade are not in our favour. The hon. member seems to forget that. It is also an unfortunate fact that South Africa stands unique in regard to its political problems, and that most of our economic activities have been affected by this unique international political position, not of our own choice. The hon. member spoke about the private sector. I have no time to go into that. I can only talk about what the Government is doing in regard to industrial expansion. I told him what the Sunday Times said about it three weeks ago. I can quote to him dozens of new industries, comprising millions of rand for new expansion. The hon. member said this policy of border industries could not work and would not succeed. Well, he is a prophet. He might even be a good prophet. I do not know. Usually the United Party are not good prophets. They were not good prophets in regard to Iscor. They said Iscor would not succeed. Nor were they good prophets in regard to Foscor, or in regard to Sasol. Even last year they were not good prophets, when they said that South Africa was on the brink of ruin. In regard to the border industries, I think they will also be bad prophets.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the point raised by the hon. member, and also by the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder), and to say that we are giving due attention to the problem of the East Rand as well as the West Rand, where, on account of the closing of mines more industries should be attracted. We are giving due attention to this problem and we try to attract industries to those areas which are suitable for those areas, but the Government has no power to force any industry to go to any place. I take it that on the East Rand and on the West Rand where you have housing and power and water, they have enough attractions to draw industries to them, but we are doing our best as a Department to tell industries to go and see what those places are like and whether they will suit them.</p>

<p>Can the Minister indicate what his attitude would be if an industry were to ask for guidance from the Department and whether his Department, or he himself as the Minister, would influence that industry in any way to go to the borders of the reserves?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>When an industry comes to us for advice, we honestly give it. Where it is an industry which is suited to the border areas, we shall advise them to go there, but we cannot force them to do so. Where it is an industry which is clearly suited to the East or West Rand, or other parts of the country, we advise them to go there and to look for themselves and decide for themselves. I myself have advised many industries already to go and look at the East Rand, because they were mostly mechanical, engineering or chemical industries. I advised many of them to go the East Rand and the West Rand.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, I cannot carry on answering questions indefinitely.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) has spoken about agricultural implements and their standardization. I quite agree with him that we should be more realistic and that there should be a greater measure of standardization. If our agricultural implements and motor-cars are not standardized to a great extent, we will never start manufacturing those items locally. Agricultural implements really fall under one of the Departments of Agriculture and I believe that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is already attending to and investigating the standardization of agricultural implements and I can assure the hon. member that the C.S.I.R. and the Bureau of Standards which come under my Department will give them every assistance possible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>What does the Minister think about the account which should be rendered to Parliament in respect of the I.D.C. Foskor, Sasol and all the other corporations in which State money has been invested?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will forgive me if I do not reply to that because I am dealing with something else at the moment. As far as standardization is concerned, may I just say that the Board of Trade and Industry is at the moment investigating the possibility of manufacturing a tractor locally. I do not wish to anticipate their report. It may come out towards the end of the month and we will then study their recommendations and see whether it is possible to manufacture tractors in South Africa but we will never be able to manufacture them here if we do not standardize and concentrate on two or three tractors.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) spoke about research and scientists. We agree with him that the scientific manpower is to-day South Africa&#x2019;s most valuable and smallest asset and that if a country does not make progress in the scientific <span class="col_6041-6042" refersTo="page_0267"/>field, it will never make big progress in the economic field and that we should give much more attention to the training and the retention of our scientists, and that we should make the best possible use of them. Many of our scientists are to-day in positions where they do work which can be done equally well if not better by others. We will have to do everything in our power to strengthen our scientific manpower and to retain them. A special Cabinet committee is attending to that at the moment, it has been doing so for some time. It is studying all the aspects and it was recently responsible for the increase in the salaries of the scientists of the C.S.I.R. so as to keep them satisfied.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) raised a few matters in regard to the hotel industry. I just want to tell him briefly that we have not appointed a commission to investigate the hotel industry because we are awaiting for the implementation of the Liquor Amendment Act, which will make a difference. As soon as that Act is implemented, we will have new knowledge about the hotel industry and then we will consider appointing a commission of investigation.</p>

<p>In regard to import control and the staffing of the import control divisions, I think the hon. member will understand that we are also under-staffed; it is under-staffed in the same way that most of the divisions of our Department are under-staffed. We find it very difficult to carry out all our obligations through lack of trained staff, which is very hard to get these days. We have applied for more posts and hope to get more personnel, if only we can obtain the right people. But it is very difficult to attract them, especially if we lose some of our best people to commerce and industry.</p>

<p>*In reply to the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) in respect of the electrification of the Sundays River, I can only say that it has already been decided in principle that the Sundays River will be regarded as a new electricity supply undertaking and we are evolving plans at the moment to give effect to the wishes of the hon. member.</p>

<p>I wish to reply to the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) very briefly. Unfortunately I cannot go into all the points he raised, but I fully agree with him in regard to the establishment of industries which should be based on the further processing of our raw materials. That is the whole basis of our industrial development. For that reason the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced a new tax redemption last year in the case of mines where the product is further processed before being exported. For that reason, also, I recently appointed a committee under the Natural Resources Development Board which is investigating the whole problem, especially our base metals and minerals, to see to what extent they can be processed before being exported. But I must tell the hon. member that the exportation of these processed metals is not an easy task. Most countries have strong barriers against the importation of these processed metals, because they have a huge capacity of their own which is usually highly protected. But we are going into these matters, particularly in regard to certain strategic metal and minerals, and I fully agree with the hon. member that this is what we should do.</p>

<p>*Finally there is the five-year plan which was announced on the occasion of that good meal. I think the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) paid more attention to the good meal than to the five-year plan. I can only say that the hon. member&#x2019;s allegation that I addressed a meeting of the Federated Chambers of Industry is correct, but I at no time announced a five-year plan. By a five-year plan it is understood that a country works out a plan into its finest details, as they do in the communist countries, a plan which it wants to carry out within five years&#x2019; time, and it then forces that plan on to private industries. I have not done that. I told the industrialists that we should think of the three most important things to be developed, namely the textile industry, the metallurgical industry and the chemical industry as the three great pillars of the future, and I told them that I did not want them to sit and wait to see what the Government would do but that they as individuals and as organizations should find out where the defects were in our economy and that they should make preparations to remedy those defects, and that once they have made their preparations they could come to us and we would see to what extent we could co-operate.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I make no apology for raising with the hon. the Minister under this Vote certain aspects of this matter which have been discussed under other Votes but are of great importance. I do so because this is the Minister on whom the major responsibility rests, in respect of the East Rand, to ensure that adequate steps are taken and that Government policy will be directed towards ensuring the continued prosperity of that area. It is not generally realized what the enormous contribution of that area has been. Many of our biggest gold producers were there. The total gold production in that area compares well with that of any other area. It must not be overlooked that so far as the East Rand as a whole is concerned it is second only to Johannesburg as a European urban aggregation, and it approximately equal in population to the whole of Cape Town and the surrounding areas. Its continued prosperity, therefore, is of very great importance and in that regard a very great responsibility rests on this Minister. I want to put it to him that as Minister of Mines it is his duty, if he has not already done so, to investigate the facts. It is clear that in so far as the East Rand is concerned, with the gradual disappearance of the mines there will be an enormous surplus of electrical power.</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line?</p></speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The East Rand is the area which lies east of Johannesburg. I would say that the industrial development of the area closer to the Rand is much more advanced than on the Far East Rand, but it is quite clear that there will be immense surpluses of electric power in that area and a substantial surplus of housing, and a surplus of water which will be available for industrial development. I believe it is the duty particularly of the Minister of Mines to ensure that a realistic policy is adopted by the Government because for the future prosperity of the area&#x2014;and I talk more particularly of the Far East Rand, but I include the whole, because obviously if there is a lack of prosperity in one section of the East Rand, it must inevitably spread to the adjoining areas. Therefore I take the East Rand as a whole. In my own constituency one of the great gold producers, the Simmer and Jack mine, is to close in the very near future. Of the 19 mines now operating, 13 will close by 1970, and it is clear that this will affect the remaining mineworkers in the area. It will affect 60,000 mineworkers. Prosperity could be maintained quite easily, and I want to say to the hon. the Minister that the responsibility rests on him because I believe that he, with the hon. the Deputy Minister, can persuade the Government to adopt the right and a realistic policy in respect of this matter. It is perfectly clear that in respect of industrial land, the activities of another Department, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, have undoubtedly caused a delay in creating additional industrial areas, and I believe that they have done so on a basis which cannot be justified. That is not a matter for which this hon. Minister can answer, but it is a part of his responsibility as a member of the Cabinet to see that his efforts&#x2014;and I am sure that he will make the efforts to which he has referred&#x2014;are not hampered by those of some of his colleagues. The position is, of course, that there has already been a substantial closing down; I think I am right in saying that something like 35 per cent of the mineworkers in that area have lost their employment as mineworkers in recent years and it is true that they have been accommodated in, and have been of the utmost value to the mines, in the new areas. That is tremendously important. But what is also important to remember is that the persons who have contributed to the development not only of that area but also to the development of this country have been uprooted, and it is a tremendous sacrifice for a mineworker, especially if he is advanced in years, to have to leave one area and go elsewhere. I know of more than one case where mineworkers have been unable to maintain their homes on the East Rand, for example, when they have been moved away. Sir, this matter can be dealt with quite effectively and without in any way affecting the rest of the country, because quite clearly if one area is not prosperous it affects other areas. I say therefore that the maintenance of prosperity is of the utmost importance. Although the hon. the Minister has told us that in no circumstances are industries asked to go elsewhere, I believe that a policy has been followed of drawing industries away. I believe that the right thing to do is to use the enormous resources which are there in the case of electric power and water, which will become more and more freely available as time goes on, to ensure continued prosperity in that areas. In the end it will speed up the decentralization of industry, a policy with which all of us are in agreement; we want to see advancement all over the country, but clearly we are not going to get it if through the wrong policies followed by the Government we find that there is a recession in this area. The hon. the Minister knows the position of the Far East Rand towns particularly. Nigel has been helped tremendously already. The mines there are, of course, also running towards their end. Springs has made very great advance but needs further advancement. Then there is the case of Brakpan which also needs further advancement. It is quite clear that as far as Benoni and Boksburg are concerned, additional industrialization is necessary. Sir, it is going to be a serious blow to even a big city like Germiston suddenly to find that overnight there are going to be 600 fewer workers. Sir, it is only by following a realistic policy and by recognizing that the responsibility lies on the Government to plan correctly that the prosperity of that area can be maintained and even advanced.</p>

<from><span class="col_6045-6046" refersTo="page_0269"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to reply to what the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has just said; I do not have the time, but I think that is a matter which the Minister will deal with because it entails important matters of policy. Nor do I want to reply to the allegation which he has made regarding the share of the Department of Bantu Administration in the development of industries because then the Chairman will stop me.</p>

<p>I want to plead for three things to-day. We cannot say too much about matters affecting the mineworkers because there is a Bill on the Order Paper which provides for certain benefits which will be given to mineworkers. But I should like to discuss three matters particularly. In the first place I want to plead for, and to submit supporting arguments, the establishments of a separate Ministry of Mines; in the second place I want to urge the paying of increased attention to our Geological Survey Division; and in the third place I want to urge increased attention for our metallurgical laboratories and the work being done there.</p>

<p>Our Department of Mines is one of the oldest Government Departments in the Republic. It dates from the days of the South African Republic. Act No. 1 of 1871 provided for the control and management of areas where precious stones and metals had been discovered; and then we had Acts in 1882 and 1885. The development of the Government Department of Mines resulted in the passing of Act No. 35 of 1908 which was called the Precious and Base Metals Act which is still in force to-day. In 1910, on the establishment of Union, these various separate mining administrations were amalgamated and since 1933 we have had our present Department of Mines in the form we know it to-day. For the Republic with its great and important mineral wealth a well-organized and administratively well-equipped Department of Mines is an absolute necessity. I therefore want to plead to-day, without casting any reflection on any Minister who has dealt with the matter in the past, for the establishment of a separate Ministry of Mines. I want to prove the need for such a step with certain figures and I want to show how important our mineral production is. This is one of the most important factors which has contributed to the economic stability of our country, and it is still doing so to-day. I just want to mention what a tremendous contribution our mining industry and the exploitation of minerals have made to our national income. In 1910 the total value of our mineral production was R87.2 million; by 1960 it was R1,700,000,000, an increase of one thousand per cent. In 1904 277,000 workers were employed on the exploitation of minerals and by 1960 over 700,000. The State&#x2019;s income from mine leases and taxation as a result of our mineral development now totals approximately R80,000,000 annually. Our mineral resources are a disappearing asset. The prospecting for new mineral deposits is absolutely essential; the extraction and the utilization of our known resources and resources still to be discovered are absolutely essential. As far as is known we have mineral resources which can still produce R14,000,000,000 for us over the next 30 years; there are still many deposits waiting for exploitation. It is therefore of the utmost importance that as one of the most favoured countries in the world as far as mineral resources is concerned, we should discover, exploit and utilize these resources in the most comprehensive and productive way. It is essential that our mineral resources should be developed, exploited and utilized in accordance with the most modern geophysic, geochemical and metallurgical methods. The composition of the present Department of Mines and the tasks entrusted to the Department definitely justify a separate Ministry. As the Department is now constituted, it must deal with a vast variety of tasks, and it is a serious question whether our present Department is properly equipped to meet the problems entailed in future mining development, and in formulating from time to time a mining policy to ensure the optimum utilization of our mineral resources for the next 50 years at least. The world hunger for mineral metals is growing; their importance is increasing. I put this question pertinently and I repeat that I am not criticizing any Minister. Over the past seven years we have had about seven Ministers of Mines. How on earth can these people familiarize themselves with the position and how on earth can they deal with these matters while they are still charged with additional Departments which require their attention? I want to mention a few matters which fall under the present Department. There is the Geological Survey Division; there are the metallurgical laboratories; there is the Atomic Energy Board, the alluvial diggings, the Government Mining Engineer&#x2019;s office, the mining commissioners, the Mining Leases Board, the Pneumoconiosis Division, the Government training schools for mineworkers and the Registrar of Mining Leases and Rand Townships. These in themselves justify a separate Minister who can give his full attention to one of the basic pillars on which our country&#x2019;s economic rests. In saying this, I want to plead here for improved facilities for our Geological Survey Division. With a view to a long term mining policy, we must know what we have at our disposal; we must know what resources are available, and we simply do not have the people. Our Geological Survey Division does not have adequate facilities today, and I think that the officials are also paid somewhat too little. I therefore emphasize that we must give more attention to this matter. Other Departments who require geologists are also finding it difficult to obtain geologists from our Geological Survey Division because the necessary resources are simply not there. While I am pleading for improved facilities and for an expansion of our Geological Survey Division, I also want to plead for improved facilities and an extension of our <span class="col_6047-6048" refersTo="page_0270"/>Metallurgical Division. It is of the utmost importance that we should have greater knowledge and that we should use improved methods in respect of the exploitation and utilization of our minerals and methods because, in the light of what we know to-day, and what the experts tell us, we have available approximately R1,400,000,000 worth of minerals which we shall have to capitalize over the next 30 years. Seeing that we have so many boards, and every board we have fulfils an essential service&#x2014;I am not one of those who are always disparaging the boards we have; every board we have in this country is fulfilling an essential function because we have entered the period of the expert and the Minister and the Department must rely on the advice of the experts&#x2014;I say that seeing that our country already has so many boards, I want to urge to-day that our Department of Mines and our Minister of Mines should be assisted by a board of experts to advise them in respect of various problems. I want to mention a few of them, and then I want to conclude. I shall mention five. I am thinking of problems such as Government participation in and control over mining activities; I am thinking of problems relating to a policy of conservation and the encouragement of production; I am thinking of the problem of the local processing or purification of ores; I am thinking of the problem of the co-ordination of research which relates to mining and all its various branches and, finally, a policy which will have to be followed in respect of the mining development of our large Bantu and Coloured areas and our undeveloped areas such as Namaqualand.</p>

<p>It is not often that one can agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) but this evening I must agree wholeheartedly with the viewpoint expressed here by him. I want to go further and say to this Committee that it is high time we in this House spent a little more time on the Mines Vote generally instead of having it sandwiched in between other Votes and other proceedings in this House. The whole economy of this country depends on the mining industry, and when I see in this House how much time is given to other Votes and how little time is given to the Mines Vote, I am not surprised that we even have members on the Government benches putting forward the sort of pleas that we heard here from the hon. member for Ventersdorp.</p>

<p>I want to go further than the hon. member for Ventersdorp, and say a word or two about the welfare of the miner; I have done it in the past and I want to do it again. It is a pity, however, that year after year we have a different Minister occupying the Mines portfolio. In four years we have had three Ministers of Mines. I do not know if there is any continuity of policy between one Minister and another. If we are going to have a Minister of Mines I hope that it will not be a Minister who has to change his portfolio every time we have a new session of Parliament. I doubt very much whether the present Minister has had an opportunity of studying all the wants of the mineworkers. I understand that a Bill dealing with these things is going to be presented to this House shortly, but until that Bill is introduced I want to say to the Minis-for that the time has arrived when more attention should be paid to the wants of the mine-worker. When the mineworker becomes ill through second-stage pneumoconiosis I feel that that is the time for the mineworker to be taken out of the mine and given other work to do.</p>

<p>Sir, it is a pity that I cannot talk about pneumoconiosis, but I feel that the mineworker who is receiving a pension in some stage or other of pneumoconiosis, must receive the attention of the hon. the Minister now. I want to refer to one exceptional point. In the fourth stage of pneumoconiosis, the widow at the moment gets approximately half the pension given to the miner. We would like to see that corrected. When the miner reaches the fourth stage of pneumoconiosis, he is virtually on his death-bed. He cannot live on the pension that he receives, and I ask that for the time being, until the Act is amended, that the widow should be given the pension which the mineworker is receiving at the moment. I had a case recently&#x2014;I think it happened during this Session&#x2014;where I got a miner who was in the third stage re-examined and he was put into the fourth stage. Before he received his second cheque that miner was dead. He only lived a couple of weeks from the time he was reclassified and put in the fourth stage. For a considerable period he has only been receiving the benefits applicable to the third stage.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I will leave that point then. I want to say that just as it becomes important that the miner should be taken out of the dusty atmosphere after he reaches the first stage of phthisis, as applied to the non-White, so something should be done with the White worker who is allowed to proceed with his work after reaching a certain stage of illness. I do not want to try to avoid speaking about these matters here this evening because they <span class="col_6049-6050" refersTo="page_0271"/>are terribly important. I want this Committee to know that when a non-White worker reaches the first stage of pneumoconiosis, in other words, when he is shown to have pneumoconiosis, he is taken out of the dusty atmosphere and is no longer allowed to work there. The White worker, however, is allowed to continue to work during the first and second stages. He receives a warning but he is allowed to go on working in the third stage as well, and it is there that I ask the hon. the Minister to do something for these people, to teach them a second trade and while they are in the second stage of pneumoconiosis to make it obligatory for the mine industry to teach them a second trade, because when they leave the mines in the third stage there is nothing else to which they can put their hands. They are compelled to continue working on the mine because they have no other means of livelihood. It is in respect of those people who are suffering from this stage of phthisis that I say to the Minister that the time has come for us to introduce something new. This applies especially in all those areas also where the mines are going to close. The mineworker, who is going to be put out of employment, either because of illness or because of the closure of the mine, must have something else to do. What is there for him to-day? Nothing. He might get a job as a handyman at best. I know what is happening on the mines to-day. When the time comes for the miner to leave his work underground, the best that he can find is a job on the surface as the handyman. He is an unskilled worker; nobody wants him. Are we not going to do something for those people who, over the years, have done their very best for us? Our whole economy, as I have said, depends on these people and yet we are discarding them year after year. I hope, now that we have a new Minister, he will do something to see that these people are taught a trade of some sort while they are in the second stage of this illness so that they can leave the mine and make a living somewhere else.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to another most important point and that is the relationship between the services rendered by the Pneumoconiosis Board and the panel doctor. There is no link between the panel doctor and the Pneumoconiosis Board. The miner goes to the Pneumoconiosis Board where he is examined, but the panel doctor is not informed of the results of the examination. How then is the panel doctor to know what stage the miner is suffering from? The miner gets a note to tell him that he is in a certain stage but the actual trouble is not explained to the panel doctor. There is a difference between the degrees of information that is given by the Rand Mutual in accident cases to the doctor and the information given to the panel doctor by the Pneumoconiosis Board. If a man is involved in an accident while he is working he is taken to the Rand Mutual Hospital; the Rand Mutual Hospital give a detailed account of the accident to the panel doctor.

<p>There are a few important questions which I would like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister. When we discuss important matters falling under other Departments, the House or this Committee always have the benefit of the presence of the departmental chiefs concerned. Hitherto we have also always had the assistance of the Secretary for Mines when we have discussed the Mines Vote but the matters which we discuss here year after year are matters which are of such importance and often of such a technical nature that the Secretary for Mines who is the chief administrative officer, cannot help us. I should like to say a few words on the item &#x201C;Government Mining Engineer &#x2019;&#x2019; on page 190 of the Estimates. The Government Mining Engineer is certainly one of the most important officials in all departments in South Africa. Hon. members will see that he has a staff under him which also consists of very important officials. Year after year we raise matters in respect of which we cannot expect the Secretary for Mines to be of any assistance to the Committee or the Minister because they are mainly technical matters. I therefore want to ask the hon. the Minister very courteously, when we discuss this Vote, to give us the benefit of the presence of the Government Mining Engineer, just as we have had the benefit of the presence of the departmental chiefs when we discussed matters affecting the Police, Prisons, Defence, Water Affairs, Revenue, etc., so that when we discuss the implementation of health regulations as they affect underground work, and when we discuss safety measures, we shall at least have at our disposal the man who is the only person who can assist the Minister and this Committee. I want to ask very courteously and earnestly that in future, when the Mines Vote is discussed here, we shall have the benefit of the presence of the Government Mining Engineer. There are certain aspects of the mining industry which I have been emphasizing for years in respect of which I have not yet been able to get satisfaction.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question of dust readings which differ tremendously from mine to mine. The penalty, in other words the levy, which is placed on the various mines has a great deal to do with the question of dust readings. I have now been trying for many years to get a reply in respect of this matter which can satisfy me that there is a progressive improvement as regards the question of dust readings in underground conditions in our gold mines and other mines as well. Hitherto I have simply not been able to get the answer I want, the answer which I expect and which is the correct answer. Only an official such as the Government Mining Engineer can give us a satisfactory reply in respect of this matter. And when we have the Government Mining Engineer, we shall also be given replies to questions such as those raised here by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher). There is no other person who can <span class="col_6051-6052" refersTo="page_0272"/>answer him and who can help us in that field. I want to emphasize that the health of the people who work in this most important industry can never be over-emphasized in this House. You must remember, Mr. Chairman, that of the men who go to the Bureau for examination before they can work underground, only a meagre 35 per cent are approved, in other words, 35 per cent of the already selected men, the pride of South Africa, work in the mining industry. You will therefore agree with me when I say that the question of the application of the health and safety measures underground can never be over-emphasized, and it is for that reason that I am speaking along these lines.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which I want to raise and here I want to come a little closer to the hon. the Minister. There is a rumour that it will become essential, when mines are developed in the Bantu areas which will become independent in the future, to amend Act No. 25 of 1926 as regards the issuing of certificates of competency for underground workers which employment at the moment is reserved for Whites, Coloureds, Mauritius Creoles and a fourth group. There is one aspect which I want to emphasize and in respect of which I want to submit an earnest plea to the hon. the Minister. I do not think this can only be dealt with by means of regulations when the mining industry develops to that stage, in other words, when we reach the stage that we have mines in the Bantu areas. I am referring to the question of the issuing of blasting certificates. So that we shall not circumvent Act No. 25 of 1926 steps will have to be taken. Because otherwise we shall have the position that there may be mining industries in the Bantu areas and that employment will be given to Bantu which has always been performed underground by Whites, we can say since 1911. I want to warn very seriously that when the day comes that blasting certificates are issued, to which they will in fact be entitled, there must be a clear proviso which will prevent trained Bantu workers who obtain blasting certificates in those areas being allowed to compete with the White miners in the White areas as such. These are a few matters which are of vital importance because we must remember that the mining industry, as the Minister always emphasizes, is of the utmost importance to the economy of South Africa and we must consequently place the mining industry on such a level and the conditions of the mines on such a level that it remains an industry which is attractive to the White man from an employment point of view. We must not have the complaint to-morrow or the day after that the mining industry is not able to recruit enough mineworkers in our country and that we shall unfortunately have to resort to the use of the undesirable elements who came to South Africa a few years ago Only when we are very careful in respect of these matters and follow a policy of caution, can and will the mining industry remain at all times on such a footing that it will remain sufficiently attractive to at least a portion of our White workers in South Africa so that they will seek employment in it from time to time.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) has quite correctly pointed out the need for stabilizing and improving the position of the White worker in the mines, and I think that that is one of the most important aspects that deserves the consideration of the Government and of the country. When you go into the statistical position and see the decline in the number of learner-miners in the Government mining training schools, one becomes very concerned indeed, and one seeks to ascertain the reasons for this decline. At the moment the position of White workers to Bantu workers in the mines is roughly 1:7, but the mining schools are not getting sufficient learners who can come forward to take their place in mining as a career. In 1960, we find there were only 267 foreign learners who came into the Government mining training schools whereas in 1959 there were 800. I am not saying that it is a good thing that we should have a large complement of foreign mine-worker learners in those schools, but it is also necessary to see why this decline has in fact taken place. When you realize that in 1960, there was an increase of roughly 40,000 Bantu workers in the mines as against 1,061 White workers, you realize the serious disproportion in numbers. Unless something is done, both by the mining industry and by the Government as such, to make it more attractive for Europeans to go into the mining industry, we will not be able to meet the needs of the industry in future. I think one of the factors where the Government can assist in this direction is to implement the undertaking which was given by the then Minister of Mines, Mr. de Klerk, in 1960. when he said (Hansard, Col 7022, 9 May)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the Government representatives has been instructed to draft a Bill based on their findings overseas. I can only say that we are full of hope and expect to be able to launch this scheme soon and to introduce during next Session the draft Bill by which this pension scheme will become a <i>fait accompli</i>.</block>

<p>As far as we know nothing further has been done in regard to this undertaking that was given by the Minister that he would introduce a comprehensive pension scheme for miners which would make their security in the mines much more satisfactory as it is to-day. I would like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether he is going ahead with the undertaking that was given, because if he can do so I think it will cause a lot of satisfaction in the mining industry, and will be one of the means for attracting additional White miners to come to the mines. Sir, I want to say that the haphazard method that has been discussed here <span class="col_6053-6054" refersTo="page_0273"/>in the House of dealing with the affairs of the mining industry, is something that should be avoided in the future, and I would like to suggest&#x2014;possibly associating myself with the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling)&#x2014;that a joint advisory board for the mining industry should be established as soon as possible. Sir, when one realizes that over &#x00A3;7,000,000,000 worth of gold has already been extracted from our mines and it is estimated that over the next 30 years a further &#x00A3;7,000,000,000 of gold is likely to be extracted, I feel the quicker we get down to the establishment of a joint advisory board to relieve the Minister of the onerous task which is now placed on his shoulders in having to take on all the responsibility of the various mines in this country, is something that has to be considered immediately. We have to have better co-ordination and control in the mining industry than we have to-day.</p>

<p>Sir, we have had discussions here in regard to some of the problems that arise from declining mines and the effect it has on health, but the one thing that is absolutely necessary is for the Government to take immediate steps to see to it that the pollution of the air, which is taking place on the Witwatersrand as a result of the many slime dams in the area from which the dust is blown into the areas surrounding it, is counteracted. As a result of mines closing down, the dust is now blown off the mines in those areas. It is a serious question of health, and it is uncomfortable. It is something in respect of which the Government gave the assurance a couple of years ago that they would tackle, but up to now nothing tangible has been heard or done in that direction, and as further mines close down and no further water is pumped on to these slime dams, we can expect dust polluting the air to a great extent and causing a still greater danger to health.</p>

<p>I think the time has now arrived when one has to ask the hon. the Minister to make a definite and a clear statement as to his policy in regard to the marginal mines. Confusion has existed since 1957 as a result of statements by various Ministers, conflicting statements right throughout their approach to this matter. For instance in July 1958, the then Minister of Mines, Dr. van Rhijn said that a Round Table Conference had been appointed to investigate the matter, but (I now quote him) &#x201C;It is clear that there is nothing much than can be done to prolong the lives of marginal mines materially&#x201D;. Then again in July 1958, the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The day we are left with only holes in the ground, we will have substitutes, something to fall back on. I explained the other day that we were doing our best in regard to the East Rand to ensure that if in a few years time mines close down one after the other, there will be substitutes in the form of industries employing mostly White men.</block>

<p>Then there was a further assurance given by another Minister that he was considering recommending to the Governor-General that a commission should be appointed to investigate the whole matter. Then in 1960 again there was a statement by the then Minister of Mines, Mr. de Klerk&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;I think it is clear that the Government has always done its duty, but it is not the Government&#x2019;s duty, it is the duty of the people themselves.&#x201D;</block>

<p>With all this confusion and the feeling in the public&#x2019;s mind that this is one of the matters where the Government should take a lead and should give some direction, I think the time has come this year&#x2014;it is not too late, but certainly not too soon&#x2014;that the Minister must make a clear statement as to the Government&#x2019;s policy towards the marginal mines and what assistance they are going to give these mines in order to prolong their life and to give them some assistance in cutting down overhead expenses and reducing their costs.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that this Vote is to be disposed of before half-past six, and that is why I am rising to reply to a few questions that have been put. The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) asked a question, which has now been emphasized by the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog), namely, what the Government&#x2019;s policy is in respect of the problem of marginal mines, also particularly in regard to the areas in which these marginal mines are situated. The second aspect of this question of course is something that falls under the Minister for Economic Affairs, namely the establishment of industries there, and I should like to suggest to the hon. member that when the hon. the Minister for Economic Affairs appears before him again, he should ask him that question. As regards the mining aspect of the question, hon. members are aware that mines sometimes have to close down, and that no government in the world, not even the best government, such as this one, can do anything about it. Once the gold of a mine has been exhausted, you can do nothing about it. And there are certain mines on the Witwatersrand where the gold is being exhausted whether we like it or not, and even with an increased gold price, with all the best techniques in the world, with all the assistance you can give them, you just cannot go and create gold where there is gold no longer. That fact we have to realize once and for all. There are mines that you just cannot save with anything in the world. There are other mines with gold of a very low grade ore, but mines that can still eke out an existence, and which can carry on with that low grade ore and still make a profit, and those mines of course can be saved if there is an increase in the price of gold, for which we are hoping, or when the costs of production are reduced in one way or another. Now I do not wish to go into the entire matter of the closing down of marginal mines and the powers <span class="col_6055-6056" refersTo="page_0274"/>the State possesses in that regard, and the inquiries the State always institutes before a mine is permitted to close down. We know what the consequences of the closing of a mine are, and that is why we are very strict about it. They can&#x2019;t just go and close a mine. They have to give due notice, at least three months, and the Government has the right to institute an inquiry to see whether the closing down is justified. In some cases inquiries were instituted in the past, but on the whole it is not done because the Department already has at its disposal so much data through its study of the mines over the years that it knows exactly what the position of that mine is, and that it is not necessary to institute an inquiry. But in order to save the mines, a round table conference was held under one of my predecessors, to which the hon. member for Springs referred, to go into the factors that may be taken into consideration in order to give these mines some relief. It was found, as hon. members probably know, that savings could be effected on about six items, which together would amount to about 22.75c per ton. Those savings are railway freight charges, hospital charges, sewerage and sanitary fees, purchase charges, gold shipping costs, state training schools for mineworkers and pneumoconiosis levies. The maximum saving under those heads would amount to R22.7 and it would have to be as much to be of any significance to some mines, but not one of the authorities under whom these matters fall was willing to grant that exemption. The largest of these is pneumoconiosis levies which amount to 11.22c. That is the largest individual item of possible saving. Now I should like to say that I hope that with the legislation that will be submitted to you shortly, relief may be granted of considerable significance, particularly for the dying low grade marginal mines. It might be a factor of relief for them. We are also engaged on an investigation of the water problem. One of the great dangers is that when mines are closed down, they become filled with water, and the water is not a danger for those mines only, but it also seeps through into neighbouring mines and aggravates their water problem and increases cost of pumping out the water. That is also a matter we are already giving attention to, whether there is any method of giving assistance in this respect. I should like to give hon. members the assurance that we as a State regard these marginal mines as being very important. We perhaps consider them more important than the owners themselves regard them. The mine owners, particularly the shareholders, might be willing to close down a mine that has a fairly large demolition value so that they can get their money back, but to the State the existence of that mine is very important from the angle of that community that has been established round that mine and with a view to the employment of the people, and from the angle of the amount of currency the mines can earn for us. I assume that the Government will take every reasonable step it is capable of taking in order to prolong the life of the mines in the interests of the country. Reference has been made to subsidization. We are not prepared to resort to that, and I believe that the mining industry also is not prepared to consider any form of subsidization, for it will shed a bad light on our mines overseas as regards the acquisition of capital. We know that subsidization has never yet been seen in a favourable light by the world, and if the wealthier mines were to subsidize the poorer mines, it might also have the effect of making the richer mines less profitable, and that thereby you will be creating a larger quantity of unremunerative ore. I can assure you that we are giving the problem our constant attention, and will probably resort to the appointment of specific study groups to study the problem with all its ramifications.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) has raised three points. I certainly am glad that there is one person in the House to-day who sympathizes with me, or at least feels that I should be relieved of my Vote. He pleaded for a separate Minister of Mines. I do not wish to say anything about that. That is something he should discuss with the Prime Minister, and when he returns from the Prime Minister I should like to hear what he found out there. That is a matter in which I myself have no say. I can only say that mines is a Portfolio of tremendous importance. When we have regard to the tremendous significance of mining to South Africa, and to the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s production of minerals amounts to approximately &#x00A3;600,000,000 per annum; if we consider that since 1946 our gold has increased by 87.5 per cent, our copper by 93.5 per cent, our coal by 63.5 per cent, our diamonds by 112.5 per cent, then we appreciate the value of the mining industry to South Africa. It might be interesting just to auote some figures here to illustrate South Africa&#x2019;s relative share in the mining of the world. South Africa occupies .8 per cent of the world&#x2019;s surface, and contains 15 per cent of the world population, but its annual production of gold is 55 per cent of the world production, of platinum 48 per cent, of antimony 22.5 per cent, of uranium 19 per cent, of diamonds 18 per cent, of chromium 15 per cent, of manganese 7 per cent. That makes South Africa one of the most important mining countries in the whole world, and I think it gives us a greater appreciation of the importance of mining and of the work of this Department, and of the great proportion of the national income that falls under the control and direction of this Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ventersdorp further referred to the reinforcement of the division for geological surveys. The hon. member has raised a very good point there. Geological surveys play a very important role in our mining policy. This world is to an increasing extent dependent on minerals for its continued existence, by the developments in the technical sphere and the extent to which minerals are being used. South Africa will become more and more important to this world because of <span class="col_6057-6058" refersTo="page_0275"/>its wealth of minerals and our geological survey plays a very important part in the search for those minerals. We are faced with the fact that these minerals are wasting assets. The world consumes them at a tremendous rate. The world will still come to South Africa some day as one of the most important countries in the world as regards minerals, and it is necessary that we should conduct our searches and the subsequent utilization and extraction of our minerals in an absolutely planned economic manner. That is why our geological survey plays an extremely important role. We are having difficulty in getting the required number of geologists, the necessary practical men, and we do not have enough money for the extension either. Having asked the hon. member just now to go to the Prime Minister, I now also wish to ask him to go to the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The third point he raised is the State Metallurgical Laboratory and the extension of facilities there. We have had an increase in personnel there, and we are hoping to have a larger building soon. That laboratory also is of very great importance to our country. Its main concern is to institute inquiries in regard to the reclamation of our minerals. They have to investigate methods for the further refinement and processing of our minerals and how best to utilize our minerals. In this respect it plays a very important role. That is where mining and industry meet each other. We think of the role it played in respect of our uranium industry at the beginning. We think of the role it played in respect of copper and the fireproof ores we are getting in Eastern Transvaal, and the investigations it is making there, and the role it has played in connection with Foscor and the exploitation of our phosphates. It plays a tremendous role in the refinement of our minerals and the reclamation of our minerals, and in the utilization of our minerals.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) spoke about the safety of the mine-workers and he mentioned two very important points, but I am afraid I cannot discuss these points now. These matters can all be raised when we discuss the Pneumoconiosis Bill which I hope to introduce this week. So the hon. member will understand that I cannot discuss these points now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) spoke about the Government mining schools and the decline in the number of trainees I don&#x2019;t know where the hon. member got his figures from. The figures I have are rather different from his. According to the statistics that I have in regard to the average number of trainees in these mining schools show that in 1952, the number was 938, and last year there were 1,490, and for the last four or five years the numbers have remained more or less stable. There is not the decline that the hon. member indicates. The hon. member asked me about the insurance scheme. I just want to mention that we as a department were prepared to work out a civil insurance scheme for the mineworkers, but then the Mineworkers Union came along and they told us that they would negotiate with the Chamber of Mines and that we better leave well alone. So we passed the buck to them, and in the meantime they are negotiating and we are constantly watching the whole position.</p>

<p>As regards the pollution of air, the hon. member knows that my colleague, the Minister of Health, has appointed a committee to go into this whole question. The mines have submitted evidence to this committee, and the whole question is being studied now. The mines are doing a great deal to control air pollution</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the United Party and its Press has chosen to call this Bill which I now want to introduce the Sabotage Bill. I was not invited to the christening ceremony when the Bill was given this name, but it enjoys my wholehearted approval if hon. members opposite and their Press want to call the Bill by that name. With this name in mind, some people&#x2014;to whom I will come later&#x2014;thought fit to set afoot an agitation against this Bill outside. The emphasis having been laid on the sabotage aspect of this Bill, it is just as well that hon. members should bear in mind that the agitation being fomented in all kinds of ways is not against this or that particular provision of the Bill, but in fact against the sabotage aspect of it. One of the first telegrams I received in connection with this Bill read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I protest strongly against barbaric and most outrageous Bill. Deserves condemnation by all right-thinking people the world over. Not prepared to be intimidated by Nationalists.</block>

</speech>

<p>This telegram comes from &#x201C;Comrade&#x201D; Walter Sisulu, the former secretary-general of the A.N.C. If one studies the agitation made against this Bill, it becomes clear that the people who are opposed to the Bill in the first place&#x2014;and let me say this, that they have every reason to be opposed to it&#x2014;are the communists. A second group from whom I received protests in this regard is the Indian <span class="col_6059-6060" refersTo="page_0276"/>National Congress and its affiliated bodies. I also received protests from the Congress of Democrats, which has become the mouthpiece of the communist wing in South Africa. I also received protests from the Black Sash movement, which is trying to regain their lost prestige in this way. I also saw in the Press the protests of the Progressive Party, a party which is not only dangerous, as I have said on previous occasions, but also has conducted itself in a very irresponsible manner just lately. I also notice that the National Union&#x2014;or at least, the two remaining members of that Union&#x2014;are also opposed to that Bill. I further notice that the English Press in South Africa has attacked me and this Bill in the most unbridled language. In passing, I want to say this, that the English language Press has never yet conducted itself in such an unworthy and inciting manner as it has done just recently.</p>

<p>We waited to see what the attitude of the official Opposition would be. The first indication came from the very newest member of the United Party, viz. the hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie). I do not know whether, in regard to this matter, he has to set the tone or not. I also saw that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave an interview to a Sunday newspaper. The headline of the <i>Sunday Times</i> which immediately caught my eye in regard to this interview was, &#x201C;Graaff condems Sabotage&#x201D;, and I really hope that I read it correctly, and I was indeed grateful until, however, I saw the word &#x201C;Bill&#x201D; behind the word &#x201C;Sabotage&#x201D;. At this stage I still do not know what the attitude of the official Opposition is, and therefore, I will not voice any criticism in this regard until I have to reply to the debate. The question one has to ask oneself, particularly in reference to the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that it was unnecessary to introduce such a Bill in this House, is why it is in fact necessary to introduce this Bill. And when posing that question, one is of course compelled also to say what this Bill is not, particularly because so many interpretations of it have appeared in the Press and so many motives have been ascribed to me and to others in this regard. I therefore want to say right at the outset, and I do not want us to have any misunderstanding in this regard to-night, or at any time during the course of this debate, that this Bill is no panic measure. On the contrary. It is a coolly calculated and logical measure. It is true that it is a measure which I would prefer not to introduce, for many reasons which I will give later. It is, however, a measure which is necessary in the circumstances, and here I definitely do not want to be an alarmist, but simply want to put the facts before hon. members calmly, so that they themselves can judge as to the necessity or otherwise for introducing this measure. Having said that, I immediately want to reject with the contempt it deserves, all personal motives ascribed to me and others by an inimical Press.</p>

<p>What is the background of this measure? What is the position in South Africa to-night still from a security point of view? I want to say immediately that the country is quiet, calm and peaceful, in spite of the artificial agitation made outside. As I say, the country is calm and quiet. I heartily want to agree with Lord Malvern and others who said that South Africa is one of the most peaceful places in the whole of Africa. I should like to keep it so. Because the country is peaceful, and because I want to keep it that way, I am introducing this measure timeously. I believe it to be my duty to introduce this measure now, as I shall explain in a moment, If I am asked what the reasons are, in spite of the propaganda emanating from Press and pulpit and all other sources, why South Africa is to-day still quiet and peaceful, I can give many reasons. For the purposes of this Bill, however, I want to mention only two. The first is that the measures taken to raise the standard of living in past years by this Government, and the opportunity for employment created by this Government for all population groups, and particularly for the coloured population groups, are now beginning to bear fruit. In the second place, I am convinced that in the purely political sphere the advantages inherent in our policy of separate development for all population groups in this country are being realized. For that very reason the communists and their camp-followers have become so active just recently. They do not want to see this peace and quiet; they do not want to see this progress; they do not want to see peaceful co-existence in South Africa, and that is why just recently they have become so active. That appears very clearly from all the documents submitted to me from time to time in my official capacity, that they realize that their plans are going awry, and that they will have to take speedy action if they want to create the chaos and anarchy, which is their ultimate object, in South Africa.</p>

<p>Every hon. member, on whichever side of the House he might sit, knows that the communists have been organizing for years to take over South Africa if they can. South Africa has always been, for many reasons, the Naboth&#x2019;s vineyard on which they have cast covetous eyes. South Africa has always formed part of their world plan. The fact that at the moment there is a cold war in progress and not a shooting war in no way alters the fact that it is their object to get South Africa within their power, even if it is only because of its strategic position, apart from all the other considerations they have in mind. May I remind hon. members in passing that as far as the communists are concerned they have never made any essential distinction between a cold war and any other sort of war. As far as they are concerned, they have always been in a state of war with the Western world and with the democracies, of which South Africa is one.</p>

<p>What do I envisage in regard to this measure? The timeous steps taken by one <span class="col_6061-6062" refersTo="page_0277"/>of my predecessors in passing the 1950 Act, and the other steps taken by my predecessors, after that date, have been of enormous value to South Africa. I want to emphasize the fact that, in spite of the opposition of hon. members opposite, if those measures were not taken at the time by my predecessors South Africa would to-day have been a different place instead of the peaceful country we know it to be to-night. If it were not for the fact that the communist party was banned and that the A.N.C. and the P.A.C. were banned, South Africa would have looked very different today Hon. members are aware that when those organizations were banned many of their members fled abroad. Hon. members are also aware that these people, with the consent and encouragement of the African states, are organizing against South Africa on every front and at every level from abroad. For purposes of my argument to-night I need not go into this aspect more deeply. Hon. members can read such reports in the Press every day and therefore know what the position in this regard is. As I have said, many of them fled, and particularly the non-White section of the communist front which existed in South Africa. However, all of them did not flee, and particularly the majority of the White members of that organization remained here. I have no hesitation in saying, and I do not apologize for saying so again to-night&#x2014;I have already said it in public&#x2014;that in my opinion I believe the time has arrived, and in fact it has become high time, to devote more attention particularly to the White agitators in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, you will remember that when the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development last year discussed the difficulties and problems in the Transkei, and when he referred to the riots which happened there, he <i>inter alia</i> made the statement in this House that those riots and the murders committed in the Transkei were caused by White communists who incited the Bantu there. Hon. members opposite laughed heartily when he made that statement. After those riots certain court cases followed in the Transkei. People were charged with all kinds of crimes committed during that period of rioting. After the conclusion of the trial of one group who were charged with murder, the attorney for that group, a non-White with the name of Mr. Swartz, a well-known attorney in the Transkei, was placed in the witness-box by the advocate for the defence. He then gave evidence under oath in mitigation of the sentences of this group of people who were charged with murder. I want to read to the House an extract from that evidence, which in my opinion is very significant. He said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Certain persons, while regarded as the instigators of this trouble, took advantage of a grievance that the Bantu people felt because they have to pay increased taxes, in order to embarrass the Government and the Bantu Authorities system.</block>

<p>The advocate then asked him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From your information, was it quite common that they took advantage of this discontent in these territories?</block>

<p>And his reply was: &#x201C;So I understood.&#x201D; The Judge-President then asked

him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What were these agitators&#x2019; aspirations, political or communistic?</block>

<p>To which his reply unambiguously was: &#x201C;Communistic influence.&#x201D; The advocate then put the following question to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And has the hon. the Minister of Bantu Affairs stated that White communists have been behind the organization and that he even had the names?</block>

<p>To that he replied, &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. The next question was then put to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is that borne out by what you have been able to discover?</block> <p>To that his reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is borne out by what I discovered.</block>

<p>The Judge-President thereupon asked him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How does the objection to rehabilitation come in?</block>

<p>His reply was&#x2014;</p> <block name="quote">The Bantu Authorities system is in charge of all the local government in the territories and then these agitators would go to the people and say: &#x201C;Your taxes have been raised and the taxes have been raised by the Bantu Authorities, and the people who constitute the Bantu Authorities are the chiefs; so we must get rid of the Bantu Authorities and the chiefs. The Bantu Authorities have also accepted rehabilitation for betterment measures for those territories, and as a result of that the number of cattle you are able to possess is reduced.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This particular attorney then continued to say that an order was issued for people to be murdered. The Judge-President then asked him&#x2014;</p> <block name="quote">Does the order, if I may call it that, to destroy kraals and people who do not attend meetings, des that come from an instruction from head office?</block> <p>The &#x201C;head office&#x201D; to which he referred was the White communists. His reply to that question was: &#x201C;That is the instruction from head office.&#x201D; So I can go on clearly illustrating that in Pondoland we had a very striking example of what these White agitators and communists achieved. It cost the lives of <span class="col_6063-6064" refersTo="page_0278"/>many innocent people before that unrest came to an end.</p>

<p>I have been placed in the position where in the first place I am responsible for law and order in this country, to ensure that there is peaceful co-existence in South Africa, and to guard against anarchy, chaos and disruption. Because that is my task, hon. members can expect me to give an appreciation of the position, and to come forward with measures to combat that position. Hon. members opposite would be the first to reproach me if I closed the stable door after the horse had been stolen. That is why I am introducing this measure. I say that I am required to give an appreciation of the position. Now, what is this appreciation which I have made for myself and whioh I am sure every hon. member opposite has made for himself show?</p>

<p>The first fact staring us in the face is that the cold war throughout the world has been stepped up. Then why should it not also be stepped up in South Africa? The second fact is that the communist party in South Africa, which was paralysed, is getting its second breath; that its object is totally to destroy all that we stand for on this side of the House, as well as what hon. members opposite say they stand for; that it has come to the conclusion that it will have to use force to attain that object; and, finally, that in fact they have used force. All hon. members know that sabotage has taken place in South Africa. Hon. members also know from the Press reports which appeared at the time that these were not isolated instances of sabotage which took place, but that it was accurately calculated sabotage which was committed on the same day and at practically the same time in seven or eight different places. Therefore it was not isolated saboteurs who took action. It was accurately planned action by people who are in close association with one another and who are well organized. I make bold to say&#x2014;because that is how I see it&#x2014;that they came to the conclusion that they had, as it were, so conditioned the outside world by means of the propaganda they had made against us, that nobody would take any notice of it if they acted in that way in South Africa. They also anticipated that if they took such action they could still to some extent depend on the sympathy and protection of sections of the English Press, and the recent happenings show that they were correct in holding those views. I do not want to bore hon. members with all the reports, but it clearly appears from reports which I receive from time to time that not only have they decided to commit sabotage, but that they in fact have committed sabotage. One of those who fled abroad thought fit to say the following, according to a recent Press report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What happened in the North of Africa is now moving to the south. Algeria will look like a little social party compared with what can happen in South Africa.</block>

<p>I am referring here to a statement by Oliver Tambo. That is therefore what these people are planning. In passing, I also want to refer to an article which appeared in January, 1962, in a newspaper, <i>Voice of Africa,</i> published in Ghana, in which the following was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The African is prepared to pay for his freedom. The target date for the total liberation of every inch of the African Continent is December, 1963. No part of Africa, not even the off-shore islands, will remain under the influence of a colonial power after this date. We know the price is expensive, but the soul and the flesh of the modern African is willing. We can pay. Any African who thinks otherwise, is in the opposite camp. Surely he will be smashed with the enemy. To us the frantic moves by the die-hard colonialists like Verwoerd, Welensky and Salazar only show their awareness that there are forces in Africa powerful enough to reduce them to a mere pulp of quivering jelly.</block>

<p>That is what they say they are preparing themselves for. And in case hon. members, in spite of the manifestations of sabotage we have had, do not want to believe this, I want to refer to an article which appeared in the <i>New York Post.</i> In it reference is made to the &#x201C;Liberation Committee&#x201D;, which said that it had committed the sabotage in South Africa. The article then reads as follows&#x2014;</p> <block name="quote">Who is on this Committee about which nothing has been heard until now? Spokesmen for it and contacts with the organization say that it has branches throughout South Africa. The main contact has been set up in London. Africans and Whites belong to the underground. Its operations are non-violent where people are concerned; sabotage against specific parcels of property is the No. 1 goal.</block>

<p>This article concludes as follows, and I want to submit it to hon. members opposite for their consideration&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The whole movement is still deeply mysterious and for the present quite publicity-shy. Wherever it may turn and whatever its fate may be, the Committee is still worthy of some notice now. If you roll back so many years, you will find that the F.L.N. in Algeria got its start the same way, through sabotage. Nobody paid any attention, though.</block>

<p>It is for that reason that in the light of the information available to me, and in the light of the things which are said and written, and with due consideration to the organizations of which I am aware, I consider it my duty to take timeous action in regard to this matter. And when we say that we must take action, the question may be asked what should be done. Surely there is none of us who is so <span class="col_6065-6066" refersTo="page_0279"/>naive as to believe that there are no communists in our country. In spite of the fact that we have limited their activities and tried to render them harmless by means of legislation, the communists here are organized in cells at a high level, and it is the duty of every one of us to render them harmless, wherever and whenever we can do so. To me it follows like the day follows the night that it is our second task to deprive them of their propaganda means and opportunities wherever we can do so. Thirdly, we must deal with the saboteurs who are here in South Africa, whether they have already committed overt acts or whether they are still making preparations to that effect. Unless we are prepared to do so, we are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. Hon. members may suggest that I cannot or that I may not take steps against these people. Let me anticipate that by saying that my task would then be an impossible one and that I would no longer be able to continue to carry out my task. If we are in earnest, then we must take steps against those people, and if we are not in earnest but adopt the attitude which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition apparently adopts, namely that it is not necessary to take any steps in South Africa, then I say that as surely as the sun is going to rise to-morrow we will pay the price for it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago the underground A.N.C. sent out a circular letter in which, amongst other things, the following statements appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the material is now at hand from which we can recruit a great army to work in secret against our enemies. Definitely an enormous amount is needed and can be done if only sufficient numbers of people are willing to adopt an active policy of non-co-operation. Truly it is not sufficient merely to hinder the Nats in small things; we must form our boldest spirits into sabotage groups.</block>

<p>That is what they say. Indeed, that is what some of them are preparing themselves for. The fact that acts of sabotage have already been committed clearly shows to what extent these people have already made their preparations. And when I say this, hon. members on the other side may ask me whether this means that we are sitting on a powder keg in South Africa. My reply to that question is &#x201C;No&#x201D;. But what we do say&#x2014;and that is our only object here&#x2014;is that we are not going to allow powder to be thrown into the keg and then still allow that powder to be ignited. That is our only object with this Bill. Does that mean, as has already been suggested in newspaper articles, that we want to stifle criticism and that we want to destroy the rule of law in South Africa? This Bill has nothing to do with freedom of speech. Nothing at all. But since the charge has been made against me that that is my object, I want to declare emphatically that it is not my intention nor the Government&#x2019;s intention to restrict freedom of speech in any way. There was a time when freedom of speech was restricted, but that was in the days when hon. members opposite were in power. And if they do not want to believe me, let them ask my ex-colleague, General Moolman, the M.P. for East London (City). I want to say emphatically that this Bill has nothing to do with the freedom of speech, and I want to ask hon. members opposite in advance not to come along in this debate again with the argument about a police state. They have already created so many police states in South Africa that I have lost count of the number. I would also ask them to stop ascribing Nazi motives to me and others. They have done it so often in the past that nobody believes them any longer. I hope too that they are not going to come along with the Black Sash argument, and that is that the flame of freedom is being extinguished in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, when one thinks how many times this little flame of freedom has already been extinguished, one is amazed to hear the suggestion that it can be extinguished once again. What a flame it must be! I just want to say that it has been stated by the Black Sash that their opposition to this Bill is due to the fact &#x201C;that the Bill means the loss of liberties for all South Africans&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, not even the liberty of the members of the Progressive Party, or the liberty of their latest recruit, Mr. Centlivres, is in danger. I have received a letter, which I regard as one of the best reasons why we should introduce this Bill, from a very prominent person, who in his time played a leading role in the United Party, and I want to quote the following extract from his letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I notice that a strenuous attack was made upon you on Sunday in the English-language Press, but you are not going to allow that to deter you. Nobody is keen on departures from our tried rules of procedure and evidence, but they were formulated at a time when the circumstances were completely different from those prevailing today. They were designed to protect the ordinary law-abiding citizen against an autocratic ruler. To-day it is the State that has to be protected, and it has to be protected against subversive activities designed to break down the structure of the State. The <i>modus operandi</i> of those elements is that while they themselves do not abide by any legal rules then rely on the fact that the State is obliged to abide by rules or procedure and evidence which are ineffective against such activities and which they know how to circumvent with ease. These subversive activities must be fought in the interests of the safety of the State, and no honest thinker can blame you or the Government for taking the powers which are necessary for that purpose.</block>

<p>That is my reply in anticipation to hon. members who are going to accuse me of wishing to destroy the rule of law in South Africa. Perhaps <span class="col_6067-6068" refersTo="page_0280"/>it is not inappropriate to remind hon. members that the great American lawyer Wigmore asked on one occasion, &#x201C;Why the sudden concern for criminals?&#x201D; My question this evening is, &#x201C;Why this sudden concern for communists in South Africa?&#x201D; I want to repeat that this Bill is not being introduced with any of the motives which are being ascribed to me; this Bill is designed purely and simply to make the subversive elements and the communists harmless. But I want to say this. It must have been very pleasant for the communists to see how many sympathizers they have in South Africa nowadays. It must have been very pleasant indeed for them to know that they can rely, to be specific, on the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party. It must have been very gratifying for them to know now many friends they have in the editorial offices of the English-language Press in South Africa. But they also receive sympathy from hon. members opposite. I have noticed that certain attacks have been made on this Bill, but except for a casual remark here and there, not a single hon. member on the other side has condemned sabotage or attacked the communists. On the contrary, what has happened is that we have heard reproaches from them that this state of affairs has arisen because of the Government&#x2019;s action and that the Government is to blame for it. What one expected from responsible people in these times was that they would have taken a stand against the danger of sabotage that we have in our midst. I have said that the aim of this Bill is to make the communists harmless and, secondly, to deprive them of the opportunities and the means at their disposal to make propaganda, thirdly, to punish sabotage, and to punish it effectively. Indeed those are the principles which underlie this Bill.</p>

<p>What do we seek to do in this Bill, in conjunction with the provisions of the old Act, to make communists harmless in South Africa? I want to say at once that when steps are taken to meet such a danger there will always be people&#x2014;and this is perhaps the first thought that occurs to one&#x2014;who think that our aim is to throw these people in gaol or to put him in internment camps, if necessary. I do not propose to follow either of those two methods, and I submit this for the consideration of hon. members, that having regard to the circumstances we should cast our nets much wider in connection with this matter. I refer in the first place to Clause 8 (b) of the Bill which provides that the Minister may have a warning issued through a magistrate to a person who is guilty of communistic agitation and activities to cease such agitation. I shall make use of that course if this House accepts this measure. Hon. members may perhaps ask me, &#x201C;Why, if you say that you can do this, do you not make it obligatory?&#x201D; My reply to that is that circumstances may arise under which one would not like to take that course, and I shall deal with those circumstances in a moment. I certainly expect that many people will make themselves guilty of these activities&#x2014;because that is our experience&#x2014;under the delusion that nobody will be aware of the fact that they are doing so, and I want to express the hope that this warning will have the desired effect. But in case it does not have the desired effect&#x2014;and one must bear in mind the fact that there are some people on whom it will not have that effect&#x2014;this measure seeks to give me the power to prohibit communists from attending gatherings. That is no new principle in this Bill; it is a principle which has already been accepted by this House. In case he still perseveres with his agitation, Clause 8 (a) gives me the right to confine him to a certain area such as the Peninsula or the Witwatersrand or a magisterial district. If he ignore the restrictions placed on him&#x2014;and there are certain people who have had such restrictions imposed upon them but who still carry on with their agitation&#x2014;Clause 8 (a) gives me the right to place him under house arrest. Hon. members will recall that during the state of emergency that we had it was necessary, for the sake of the safety of the State, to place certain people under arrest and to imprison them temporarily; and if my predecessor had not taken those steps, many things could have happened and would have happened in South Africa. I should not like to follow that course unless I am forced to do so. If we had had such a measure at that time, many of those people would not have been locked up. In other words, under this Bill I want to act in such a way that the charge cannot be levelled against me that I am depriving the man of his means of livelihood and taking him away from his wife and children. On the contrary, I want to do them the favour of keeping him with them in the house so that he can look after them, as he ought to do, instead of getting up to mischief at night. At this stage I do not want to elaborate on this matter. According to Clause 8 (a) it will be easy for me to allow a person to go to his place of employment during the day to earn his livelihood in the usual way &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What happens if he is a traveller?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>In that case he should join the United Party; then he will be a traveller without any destination. [Laughter.] It will be possible for me, in terms of that clause, to prevent a person from leaving his home during certain hours and to prohibit him from receiving certain visitors or from paying visits. I want to say here unambiguously that in the case of certain communists whose activities do great harm to South Africa, I shall not hesitate for a single moment to apply this clause.</p>

<p>It is essential also, if we want to combat Commun&#x2019;sm, that we should always know their whereabouts. We have a provision to the effect that foreigners have to notify changes of address to the authorities, and if it is right and proper to call upon foreigners to do so, <span class="col_6069-6070" refersTo="page_0281"/>then it is certainly a very good thing and absolutely imperative that we should be able to require communists to inform us at all times of their new addresses or places of employment so that we can always know where they are to be found. Hon. members will find that provision is made for that in Clause 10. Because some of these people have in the past fled the country after they have stirred up trouble, Clause 9 provides that they may be required to report to police offices periodically. Are we asking too much in expecting the communist to report to the police station from time to time if he is ordered to do so? I put that question to hon. members opposite, because these are the principles underlying this Bill which is designed to make communists harmless. Is there anything unreasonable in connection with any of these measures which I have just mentioned? Is there anything unreasonable in them having regard to the danger that these people may be to us and the dangers to which they have in fact exposed us? I say that the charge cannot be made against me that these provisions are too drastic in view of the things which these people have told us they are going to do and in view of what they have in fact done in the past. Why this accusation then that we are wiping out freedom in South Africa, when in fact that is all that we propose to do to the communist in South Africa? Surely then it is a hollow argument to say that we want to extinguish the flame of freedom. Surely then it amounts to nothing but protection of the communists and of what they stand for to attack this Bill and to rave against it.</p>

<p>But in the second place one wants to deprive them of their opportunities and means of making propaganda. That is why this Bill makes it possible for me&#x2014;I refer to Clause 7 (b)&#x2014;to declare certain places closed to these people, to declare certain meeting places closed to them&#x2014;and I make no secret of it. As a matter of fact, I have already stated publicly that two of the places which I consider declaring closed places are the Parade in Cape Town and the steps outside the City Hall in Johannesburg. Why do these people hold meetings on the steps of the City Hall in Johannesburg? For no other reason than to cause a disturbance and to instigate fighting so that cameramen can photograph these little scenes and demonstrate to the world what a rotten place South Africa is. I want to make the accusation here that the only reason why meetings are held on the steps of the City Hall in Johannesburg, particularly during the lunch-hour and in the presence of the mob that is always there at that time of the day, is to blacken South Africa unnecessarily in the outside world and to bring about unnecessary friction here. No decent person or party or organization holds a meeting in that way. It only does so when it is actuated by other motives.</p>

<p>Then there are the Sunday gatherings on the Parade in Cape Town, where they use the strongest loudspeakers that one can get. People living in blocks of flats are continually complaining to me about the disturbances that take place on the Parade on Sundays. But that is not all; it has seldom if ever happened at these gatherings that people have not been incited in a reckless fashion. The Parade is a parking area where people leave their motor-cars; women and children move about on the Parade, and it has happened already that people have almost been killed as the result of the action of the speakers on those occasions. I think it is good and proper and fair that the communists should be deprived of that opportunity.</p>

<p>But if you want to deprive them of their propaganda opportunities, then it has also become necessary, as it has been found necessary in the past, to ban certain newspapers in South Africa. The old Act provides that the publication of newspapers may be forbidden, and hon. members will know that in terms of the provisions of that Act the publication of certain newspapers was in fact forbidden. They will recall that the <i>Guardian</i> was the mouthpiece and the propaganda organ of the communists, and they know that to this very day its editor is still an outspoken and active communist. Hon. members will remember that the <i>Guardian</i> was banned and that the moment it was banned it appeared under a different name. That name was abandoned and then it appeared under a different name again, and subsequently it appeared under the name <i>Advance</i>, and when the publishing of <i>Advance</i> was prohibited it appeared under the name <i>New Age</i>. Although the old Act laid down that we could prohibit the publication of a newspaper, we came up against the problem unfortunately&#x2014;and it is that loophole that I want to close&#x2014;that although all newspapers have to register under the 1934 Act and register their name, these newspapers registered under various names so that when their publication was forbidden under one name they simply appeared the following day under a different name. In the latest issue of <i>New Age</i> there is an article by Mr. Brian Bunting, who was expelled from this House because he was a communist. In that article he briefly sets out the history of the paper and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The banning of the <i>Guardian</i> did not put an end to the people&#x2019;s paper. The very week following the ban the new paper made its appearance on the streets, called the <i>Clarion,</i> and Sam Kahn, newly expelled from Parliament, sold a copy of the very first issue to the Minister of Justice outside the House of Assembly. Then the <i>Clarion</i> was forced for technical reasons to change its name, first to the <i>People&#x2019;s World</i> and then to <i>Advance,</i> and when this paper too, was banned by the Government under the Suppression of Communism Act in 1954, a new paper called <i>New Age</i> made its appearance on the streets the very week following the ban.</block>

<p><span class="col_6071-6072" refersTo="page_0282"/>I make no secret of the fact that one of the newspapers which ought to be forbidden is this paper, <i>New Age,</i> which is the propagaganda organ of the communist party. Before hon. members come along with the accusation that that is not so, let me refer to page 8 of that newspaper, where greetings are extended to this newspaper on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. Those greetings include greetings from, amongst others, &#x201C;Moses M. Kotane, former general secretary of the banned communist party of South Africa&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The advent of the <i>Guardian</i> in the South African political scene 25 years ago was an important historical event in the struggle of the working class and oppressed people of this country. The <i>Guardian</i> and its successor, <i>Advance,</i> were suppressed by the tyrants and exploiters of this country because these people&#x2019;s papers spoke and taught the truth. The glorious tradition and heritage of the <i>Guardian</i> is to-day being carried on by the gallant little fighter, <i>New Age.</i> In the absence of our organization &#x2026;</block>

<p>That refers to the communist party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which has been suppressed, and the people&#x2019;s leaders who are banned or banished by the Verwoerd Government, <i>New Age</i> has become our spokesman and the defender of our cause.</block>

<p>That is how this paper writes to proclaim itself as the communist mouthpiece of South Africa. The front page carries the congratulations of the friend of certain hon. members opposite, Albert Luthuli, on the 25th anniversary of this paper and sets out what it has meant to the people of South Africa. The reproach has been levelled at me that Luthuli is not a communist, despite all he has said and done, and then I have been blamed for the fact that he has been banished, and it is said that I am not taking action against communists. Hon. members will remember that on the death of Stalin it was Luthuli who described him as &#x201C;that great apostle of peace&#x201D;. When we take action against him, we are told that we are taking action against people who are not in fact communists.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that we are following the established legal principle that one can ban certain publications, we are also providing in Clause 5 that we shall in the first place clear the list of registered names, and in the second place that if the Minister and the Minister of the Interior have reason to believe that these newspapers will spread communistic propaganda, security to an amount not exceeding R20,000 can be required from the publishers of such a newspaper, which amount can be declared forfeited if that newspaper does in fact make itself guilty of communistic activities. Every person in South Africa is free to publish a newspaper, but he must know that in future this punishment will be the result if he makes himself guilty of spreading communistic propaganda.</p>

<p>But another principle which underlies this Bill, and in terms of which I shall be able to deprive communists of their means of propaganda, will be found in Clause 4 which empowers me to order that persons on whom restrictions have been placed must resign from certain organizations. I make no apology to anyone for not wishing to allow a communist to belong to any organization because if he belongs to that organization he is only doing so to misuse it for his own subversive objects, as they have in fact misused many organizations which they have joined in the past.</p>

<p>But it is also the position that when we have placed restriction on communists in the past under the existing legislation and we have rendered them harmless in this way, we nevertheless found that they still made statements to newspapers and that those statements were published or that their speeches were still made on their behalf at gatherings. That is why, in terms of Clause 4 (e), the future position will be that when a person is regarded as a communist and such restrictions are placed upon him, he will not have the right to make any statement of whatever nature, nor will anyone have the right to repeat or publish it in public. Here I do not make any apology either that communists will be limited in this way. To achieve this it is necessary, as Clause 6 also provides, that lists of communists can be published in the Government Gazette. Hitherto we have not published these names. It was perhaps a mistake that we did not do so because many of these people masquerade under this or that flag and no one knows that they are in fact communist agitators. But apart from this aspect of the matter, the reason why we shall now publish these names is that everyone will be considered to know who are listed communists and on whom restrictions have been placed, so that people can know not to publish, broadcast or print their speeches. But because we want to be reasonable, we realize that since the 1956 lists were drawn up, some people are no longer active and that some of them have come to different beliefs and are no longer active communists. However, the existing legislation does not provide for the removal of anyone&#x2019;s name from these lists. I know of several people of whom this is in fact true, namely that they are no longer indulging in communistic activities and in that case I am quite prepared, and this clause will allow me to do so, to remove their names from the list of communists.</p>

<p>But I also refer hon. members to the other principle which underlies this Bill, namely that under the existing legislation the State President has the right to ban certain organizations and provision is made for machinery which must first be put into operation before this can be done. This takes a long time and much time elapses before such an organization can be banned. A new principle which I is being introduced by this Bill&#x2014;and I ask I hon. members what is unfair about it&#x2014;is that <span class="col_6073-6074" refersTo="page_0283"/>if the State President is convinced (I am referring to Clause 2 of the Bill) that an organization has been established for the purpose of, or that an existing organization is carrying on the objects of an unlawful organization, he can ban that organization immediately. Hon. members must not tell me that in making this provision we are going too far. They can just look over our borders to see how practical such a measure is. There we have the position that the Rhodesian Government saw fit to ban a certain political party&#x2014;I think it was the Rhodesian People&#x2019;s Party&#x2014;and the very next day the same party, with the same leaders and the same offices, continued as the Zimbabwe People&#x2019;s Party. Must one then put all this machinery in operation <i>de novo</i> while we know that this is exactly the same organization which is merely carrying on under a different name? I therefore, do not apologize either for the fact that we are going to deprive them of their propaganda instruments in this way. I refer only in passing to Clause 16 which has been introduced to facilitate matters. Hon. members will remember that when we had a state of emergency in 1960, the state of emergency was actually here in Cape Town, but to combat it effectively and to apply the regulations effectively, it was even necessary to declare Stellenbosch, Paarl, Wellington and Worcester to be emergency areas. I do not want to have a repetition of that and Clause 16 therefore provides that if there is a state of emergency in one area, one can make certain regulations applicable in other districts where a state of emergency does not exist without causing disruption by declaring a state of emergency in such area. Once again I submit that this is a reasonable provision taking into account the experience which we have had in the past.</p>

<p>Clause 17 extends for another 12 months the validity of the 12 days provision which has been used in the past and which lapses in June of this year. Hon. members have seen, with the sabotage which has taken place and the arrests which were made, how necessary it has been to have that provision on the Statute Book and I therefore propose that this provision should be extended for another year.</p>

<p>Clause 18&#x2014;I only refer to it in passing&#x2014;deals with the onus resting on certain persons who go abroad without authority. The clause is self-evident and I need not discuss it in any further detail.</p>

<p>Then in conclusion I come to Clause 21, the sabotage clause, which has given this Bill its name amongst hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>I want to concede at once, and hon. members need not criticize me in this regard, that the clause is worded widely. I want to admit and concede this at once, but I say at the same time that if we want to take any effective action at all against these people, this clause must of necessity be worded so widely. I therefore do not apologize for the fact that this is so. It is a fact that sabotage has never been a substantive offence in South Africa. When sabotage has been committed in the past, and we have charged the person concerned with the damageing of property or something else, the public have asked: Why do you charge him with the damaging of property and not with sabotage? I think it is high time that we call a spade a spade also in the Statute Book of South Africa. For that reason Clause 21 provides that sabotage will be a substantive offence. I have now received complaints and these complaints have also appeared in newspapers, that this provision is worded too widely, that it will affect innocent persons, that it places the onus on the accused, that it is introducing a procedure into the courts which is foreign to our legal system, that it vests great responsibilities in our Attorneys-General, and that I do not have confidence in the judiciary of South Africa. Before answering these questions, I ask myself what the object of a saboteur is and how he operates? He is a person who wants to make impossible or to destroy the established Government, law and order either through nationwide action or through isolated actions. In other words, he wants to enforce his will and wishes by criminal means. His object is to create chaos and to paralyse the country. We have already had various threats from the communists that they will create chaos in South Africa, that they will paralyse the country. We now examine the Bill, Mr. Speaker, and we ask how the saboteur achieves this aim and what the clause lays down sabotage will be. If we examine the sub-sections of this clause one by one, then I make bold to say that there is not one which is unreasonable, if we see it against the background of the danger which we must combat. Firstly there is reference to the endangering of the health or safety of the public. Is there one single member opposite who will say that we should not take action against people who endanger the health and safety of the public? Secondly this clause lays down that it will be an offence to put essential services out of action. This is what the saboteur would like to do in order to facilitate the take-over which he envisages. Thirdly, this clause refers to the putting out of action of transport services. These are the three principles which are basic to this Bill, together with the fourth which relates to the damaging or destruction of property. These are the only four principles which hon. members will fold in this clause and which we want to make liable to the penalty for &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;, namely if they endanger the health and safety of the public, if they put essential services out of action, if they put transport services out of action and if they damage or destroy property. This the saboteur does either through nation-wide action or he does so by the use of arms or explosives. This is what hon. members will find in this clause about which such a tremendous fuss is being made, so much so that the heavens are almost falling down. I now put this question to hon. members, particularly to <span class="col_6075-6076" refersTo="page_0284"/>the lawyers opposite: What is unreasonable about making people who do this kind of thing liable to a penalty and a severe penalty? Now people, and even lawyers here in Cape Town, are saying that this Bill will harm innocent persons. Mr. Speaker, I ask: How can innocent persons be affected when the preamble to this clause makes it quite clear that any of these actions must be committed wrongfully and wilfully? After all an innocent person does not act wrongfully.</p>

<p>This brings me at once to the next point, namely that it is being said that by this Bill I have now transferred the onus onto the poor innocent communist or saboteur. If there is a court case in which a person is charged under this clause, it is obvious that the State must first prove that an act has been committed, falling in the class to which I have just referred and secondly the State must prove that the accused committed that act. Then that is not yet enough; then the State must further prove that this act which he has committed was wrongful; the State must further prove that he wilfully committed that act. How can the allegation now be levelled at me that I have transferred the onus to the accused and the poor communist is now being handed over to the mercy of this cruel Minister when he has not done anything wrong? That is a straw at which hon. members are grasping. What is true is that in sub-section (2) of this Bill I am, despite everything, giving the accused a chance&#x2014;and hon. members must tell me frankly whether they want sub-section (2) in the Bill or whether they do not want it&#x2014;to prove that despite the fact that the State has proved that he committed the act, that he committed it wilfully and that he committed it unlawfully&#x2014;although he has in fact committed that act, although it has been proved that he committed it wilfully and unlawfully&#x2014;the motive underlying his action was not to commit sabotage. Here it is laid down what he must do to convince the court that he did not in fact have such a motive. What is unreasonable about this? He and he alone knows what motive inspired him when he committed that act. Is it then unreasonable of me that I expect of him that when I have proved everything I must prove, that when I have proved that he has acted unlawfully and that he has acted wilfully, he must tell the court what was in his mind when he committed that act. I want to state with emphasis that despite the fact that we regard sabotage with the seriousness that we do, we still want to be fair towards an accused, even under those circumstances. Instead of hon. members accusing me of placing the onus on the accused which is not the position, of being harsh towards a poor accused who will appear in the witness box, an accused who may be quite innocent as they say, they should at least, as sympathizers with the communists, be grateful for the concession which we are making to them in Clause 21.</p>

<p>At the outset I conceded that this clause was worded widely. I want to make a second admission, namely that it is quite true that technically speaking certain minor acts can be technically regarded as sabotage. Precisely because that is the position and because I had to word this provision so widely to make it effective hon. members will understand that a safety valve had to be introduced into this measure. The safety valve which hon. members will find in this measure is that prosecution under this legislation can only take place in terms of a personal certificate by the Attorney-General; not his assistant, not an ordinary prosecutor, but the Attorney-General himself must order in writing that a prosecution should be instituted. Hon. members opposite have criticized me as though this is a terrible new principle which we are introducing into our legislation and a principle which is meaningless. The hon. member for Durban North says that is correct, but he was quite satisfied when that same principle was embodied for all those years in the British Official Secrets Act while it applied in South Africa. Because it was British&#x2014;and it has been embodied for many years in the British legislation&#x2014;it is good enough. And it appears in the Official Secrets Act which this Parliament passed in 1956. This principle is embodied in that legislation, namely the principle that the Attorney-General must decide whether a prosecution should be instituted. Because this legislation&#x2014;not only the South African Act but also the British Act&#x2014;is deliberately so widely worded that every official in effect make himself guilty of a contravention of that legislation, the safeguard has been incorporated whereby the Attorney-General alone must order a prosecution if there has been a deliberate contravention of this provision. Mr. Speaker, this is after all not a new principle which we are embodying in this Bill. Nor are we, as has been said, placing an unnecessary burden and an impossible burden on the shoulders of the Attorney-General. After all he has the whole file before him; he knows the background; he has the history of the whole matter before him. It is his duty and his responsibility to decide whether people should be prosecuted or not. It is his task and his responsibility to decide whether a man should be charged with murder or not. Why should we not trust him with the decision whether a man should be charged with sabotage or not?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with reference to this clause I have been accused of not trusting the courts and it is said that this is why I have embodied a minimum sentence of five years in this clause. Allow me to say at once that unlike hon. members when they were in power, I trust all the judges on the bench in South Africa. When hon. members were faced with a similar situation, they did not trust all the judges. They did not even trust Judge Fagan at that time, because they laid down that there should be a special court and they allocated a special judge to hear these cases. They did not want those cases to be heard by any judge because they did not trust all of them. As far as I am concerned, <span class="col_6077-6078" refersTo="page_0285"/>Mr. Speaker, I trust all the judges; I am not allocating one judge. Because we have an independent and free judiciary which has always come to its decisions without fear or favour and will continue to do so, I am quite prepared to have any sabotage case heard before them. But I believe that this House has the right&#x2014;and if this House exercises that right, it is not because it does not trust the judiciary for this or that reason&#x2014;also to tell the judiciary and the country that we regard sabotage in such a serious light that we are placing a minimum punishment on that offence. And if we did not regard it in such a light, then there is something wrong with us; then there is something wrong with our outlook and our philosophy of life. As far as I am concerned, Sir, I regard this as such a serious matter that I have had no qualms about embodying this provision in this Bill. Hon. members must not tell me that we are introducing a new principle into our law by imposing a minimum penalty. A little while ago, in 1961, the hon. the Minister of Lands introduced a Bill into this House dealing with our national parks and that Bill provided that if one shot a rhinoceros or a hippopotamus, just to mention two, wrongfully and wilfully, then a minimum penalty of 12 months could be imposed on such a person. And if a rhinoceros or a hippopotamus is worth this, then a communist is certainly worth far more than that. I say, Mr. Speaker, just to give one example, that this is not a new principle which we are introducing into our law.</p>

<p>Now, according to newspaper reports which I have seen, hon. members are accusing me and asking why I am now charging such a man directly in the Supreme Court. I ask: Why can I not charge him directly in the Supreme Court? What is wrong with that? Does not the seriousness of the offence justify my taking him directly to the Supreme Court? There are sound reasons why we are doing this. I am doing so in the first instance, Mr. Speaker, because as I have said, I trust all judges sufficiently to charge a man before them. And in the second place, because the seriousness of the offence is such that I can charge him in that court. In the third instance, we know from bitter experience why we must do so. We had this bitter experience in Port Elizabeth with the Strachan case. Strachan was charged with running a sabotage school and with training Bantus from the Transkei in sabotage. We held a preparatory examination. That preparatory examination took months and what did we find? One of the essential witnesses in that case was kidnapped immediately after the preparatory examination and to this day he has not been seen again. The suspicion is that he has been murdered. The other witness was so afraid that we had to lock him up in order to protect him from kidnapping and when he appeared in court he committed perjury as a result of the threats made against him. We are dealing with people who are dangerous and who will not hesitate for one moment to get a witness out of the way. That is why my attitude is that we have the right under those circumstances to charge such a person summarily in the Supreme Court. Another provision embodied in this Bill for which hon. members can criticize me is that this clause provides that if a person is found not guilty of sabotage he can again be charged with another offence, and therefore a lesser offence, which is in complete accord with the principles of our law. This is admittedly a new principle: it is a new way of putting it. But bearing in mind the circumstances, bearing in mind the fact that he is being summarily charged before the Supreme Court, my attitude is that he pleads at the commencement of the proceedings and if the Attorney-General should decide that it is in fact not a case of sabotage and that he does not want to take the matter any further, even though he has only pleaded he is technically entitled to a finding of not guilty. It is for this and other reasons which I do not want to discuss now but which I shall readily argue with hon. members at the Committee Stage, that it is necessary that this clause should be inserted.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, bearing in mind the circumstances which I have outlined, the threats which have been expressed towards us, and the <i>modus operandi</i> of the communists in the past as we have experienced it in practice, I have regarded it as my duty to submit this matter to the House in the form in which I have in fact done. I am convinced that I have the support of the public outside for the provisions of this Bill. And I am even more convinced that this artificial protest which certain people are trying to arouse has already failed. I am convinced that the Afrikaans and English-speaking people believe that the time has come for us to deal with the communists in the way which this Bill does in fact do. Then I also want to express my conviction that no peace-loving person will even know that this Bill exists once it is passed; then no peace-loving or law-abiding person will ever come into conflict with this Bill. In addition I simply cannot understand that people can even bring in Christianity in order to oppose this Bill.</p>

<p>I do not know of one single Christian&#x2014;I do not know whether these priests know of Christians who will make themselves guilty of an offence in terms of this law. I also know, Mr. Speaker, that there is an old well-known rule of law that the security of the State is the supreme law. We inherited it in this form from the Romans. It runs right through our legal system, namely that the security of the State is the supreme law. As far as I am concerned, bearing in mind the position in which the world finds itself, bearing in mind South Africa&#x2019;s position, I make no apology when I come to this House and say that in the post I occupy, I regard the security of the State as priority No. 1. This Bill, <span class="col_6079-6080" refersTo="page_0286"/>contrary to what has been said outside, does not take away any freedom, except that it will take away the freedom of the saboteur to destroy, except that it will take away the communist&#x2019;s right to sabotage. And that being so, Mr. Speaker, I therefore make bold to move the second reading.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having listened with great interest to the very innocent exposition of this Bill which the hon. the Minister of Justice has just given, I am left with the impression that either he has not told us everything or he has achieved a larger number of objects which he did not set out to achieve. Because, Sir, my examination of this Bill reveals a number of facets to which he has either not referred or only just referred in passing and in respect of which he seems to have under-estimated the importance in so far as it affects the liberties of the individual in South Africa. May I say that having listened to him and having read the Bill very carefully, it seems to me to be a Bill in which there are six pre-eminent characteristics. The first of those characteristics is that vast new powers are now given to the Minister over the liberties of the people which cannot be controlled by the court and which can be visited upon individuals whom the Minister suspects of certain activities, only suspects, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;no proof whatever, no decision in a court of law. Secondly&#x2014;and the hon. gentleman did not mention it&#x2014;one of the most important characteristics of this Bill is the new powers which the Minister has taken over the freedom of assembly in South Africa, powers so great that he is virtually in a position that he can dictate not only the political but also social contacts of the citizen. He made no mention of that aspect in setting out the clauses in this Bill. [Interjections.] It seems to come as a surprise to the hon. the Chief Whip of the Nationalist Party judging by the noises which he is making. The third characteristic which I would say is evident in this Bill is the unusual powers given to the Minister, this time the Minister of the Interior, to put difficulties in the way of new publications and to intimidate them with a threat of confiscation of money which he will require them to deposit with him before registration.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Sir, we find a further extension of the 12-day detention clause with all the invasion of the right of <i>habeas corpus</i> which that involves. When we remember why that Bill was asked for last year and the case made by the hon. the Minister of Justice last year, you have difficulty in accepting from the hon. gentleman how peaceful and calm everything is in South Africa when you think back to the reasons which the Minister gave for introducing this Bill. I would say there is a fifth characteristic of this Bill and that is that it accords the Government the right to suspend the rule of law in areas unaffected by an emergency which exists in other parts of the country. Then, Sir, there is a sixth characteristic. And that is that this Bill prescribes a minimum penalty of five years and the possibility of a death sentence for the commission of acts which may be of minor importance in the absence of a specific motive and it embarrasses the accused by placing the onus upon him to prove the absence of that special motive. Serious as that characteristic may be, it is clear that in the light of the other attributes which I have mentioned, it is a misnomer to speak of this Bill as the Sabotage Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has a short memory. He says it was named the Sabotage Bill by this side of the House and by the Press. I believe the first person to refer to it as the Sabotage Bill was the hon. the Leader of the House when he was promtly called to order by the Chief Whip of the United Party.

<p>What an admission from the Minister. He seems a little embarrassed; I don&#x2019;t quite know why. It seems that it is a complete misnomer to speak of this Bill as the Sabotage Bill, as though that was the total import of this Bill. Because, Mr. Speaker, in fact there are provisions in this Bill providing for the civil death of persons who incur the displeasure and the suspicion of the hon. the Minister which to my mind is more serious than the provisions in Clause 21 dealing with the new offences vicious as they are. I think it is unfortunate that in circles outside this House this Bill has been dubbed the Sabotage Bill, because I think that clouds the thinking of many people and they are not worried to go into the further provisions of the Bill.

<p>Sir, those are the characteristics of this Bill. What is the justification for this Bill adduced by this hon. Minister? The justification seems to be that everything in South Africa is calm, quiet and peaceful. It being calm, quiet and peaceful the Minister now requires more power. He says we are not sitting on a powder barrel in South Africa. What he wants is power to ensure that no powder is put into the barrel upon which we are sitting. I cannot help thinking back to the Minister of Justice at the time who introduced the Suppression of Communist Act in 1950. He seemed to think of it quite differently then. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6081-6082" refersTo="page_0287"/>In times of emergency and national danger Governments have to take drastic action and to apply more severe means to safeguard the security of the State and of the citizen, and act in a way which normally they would not even contemplate. Who will deny that the world is in serious danger? Is there any right-thinking individual in South Africa who would be bold and reckless enough to deny that South Africa is in danger? Will those of us who behold the signs of the time deny that in our own beautiful and sunny land we are sitting on a volcano.</block>

<p>That was why he wanted the Bill. This Minister wants his Bill because things are calm, quiet and peaceful. He has done his best to indicate that there are possible activities afoot which may render South Africa less clam, less quiet and less peaceful. We heard the usual sort of stories which we get in these debates. We had them when the Suppression of Communism Bill was discussed the first time; we had them when it was amended the first time and again the second time; we had them when the Public Safety Act was before this House; we had them when the Unlawful Organizations Bill was before this House; we have had them on other occasions. I do not think this Minister has made anything like as good a job of it as some of his predecessors. He was unable to produce any real evidence. He told us tories of circulars written by the underground A.N.C. One recalls a former Minister of Justice refusing to support the Bill put up by this side of the House because it would do far worse than anything he could imagine&#x2014;it would drive Communism underground, whereas his Bill would destroy it absolutely! Then, Sir, the hon. the Minister says that he has no intention of curbing freedom of speech and he reads a letter justifying the invasions of the law which are perpetrated by this Bill. Sir, it is rather amusing that that should be the position. One of the things he is trying to justify is shifting the onus of proof. This is what a previous Minister of Justice, the gentleman who introduced the Suppression of Communism Bill, had to say about that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He (referring to the Leader of the Opposition) has departed from the sacred principle that you cannot accuse a man and put the onus of proof on him. He was prepared to move and he did move it in Select Committee, this terrible principle.</block>

<p>The hon. Minister says he is doing a favour to the accused by giving him another chance. When one sees the powers the Minister is taking over the liberties of the individual in this Bill, many of which he has not specified to us, one is reminded of what the hon. the Minister of Finance said when another Bill was before this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister, in terms of this Bill, becomes the main inquisitor, the great pooh-bah, the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord High Executioner. It has no justification either in principle or in precedent, except in totalitarian States. We are witnessing a throwback to primitive passions and to even more primitive morality.</block>

<p>That was what the present Minister of Finance said about a comparative mild Bill dealing with alien affairs in 1946.</p>

<p>We have had the main characteristics of the Bill. We have had some attempts by the hon. the Minister of Justice to justify it. What should be the attitude of the Opposition to a Bill of this kind? I would say, Sir, that the attitude may be simply stated in this way: We in the Opposition are as anxious to maintain peace and law and order in South Africa as anybody else. That means that we are against sabotage and against Communism. That means that we are prepared to take reasonable steps to deal with either. But we are not prepared to see unreasonable powers given to the Executive which cannot be controlled either by the court or by this House. I think that is the first point. I think, secondly, we must say that we are not prepared to see the Executive given the power to rule in certain areas virtually by decree. I think thirdly, we are not prepared to see the unnecessarily wide definition of new misdeeds which are so widely defined that innocent people can be caught within their net, people who are innocent of the crimes which the hon. the Minister is setting out to catch. I think, Sir, one goes further and one says that one is not prepared to see additions to the law which are unnecessary to deal with the situation as it exists at the present time. Lastly one should be very careful of seeing a government take such powers that it creates a false image of the position in South Africa, an image that can do us untold harm both overseas and in respect of the confidence of our own people in the future of South Africa. Therefore I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, while determined to ensure the maintenance of law and order and the safety of the State, nevertheless refuses to pass the Second Reading of the General Law Amendment Bill because <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>it deprives citizens of the protection of the Courts and puts them at the mercy of arbitrary ministerial decisions in such a way as to threaten the freedom of law-abiding people;</li>

<li>it creates a new crime and defines it so widely that it can endanger the lives and liberties of people who are innocent of any intention to subvert the State;</li>

<li>it grants further extensive powers to the Government and ignores the fact that laws already exist which are adequate <span class="col_6083-6084" refersTo="page_0288"/>to deal with any crisis which may arise in the country; and</li>

<li>it will damage the Republic by creating the false impression that a permanent state of emergency exists in our country.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>That being the position, may I say that in respect of the defence of law and order in South Africa, we of the United Party have always tried to be a responsible Opposition, and not only have we tried to be responsible but we have given evidence of our responsibility.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that we were never responsible. I take it that he thinks we were irresponsible then to support the Public Safety Act in 1953; I suppose he thinks that we were irresponsible to support the General Law Amendment Act; I suppose he thinks we were irresponsible to support the Unlawful Organizations Act. Sir, I think we have a sound record in that regard. We were prepared to make sacrifices of freedom and liberty where it was necessary in the interests of maintaining the safety of the State and maintaining law and order in South Africa. But despite all the powers this Government has taken, it is not satisfied yet. Its appetite is absolutely insatiable. We warned it in 1950 when it came with the first Bill to suppress Communism in South Africa. We warned it then that it was embarking on a line which was an incorrect one. Since then it has come to this House on two additional occasions to amend that Act, two occasions when we were once again unable to support them because of the vast new powers they were asking for, some of which were unfair and some of which could not be controlled either by the courts or by Parliament. Sir, the amendments today go even further and they don&#x2019;t seem to provide an answer any more than the previous Bills or previous actions of this Government. Look at the position we are in, Sir! In 1948 this was the Government that came to power by telling the people that they were the only people in South Africa who knew how to deal with Communism. By 1952, their own Prime Minister was getting up in this House and telling the House that after four years of National rule, the position was worse than it had been in 1947 under the United Party. In 1950 they took the Suppression of Communism Act and they told us that they knew how to control Communism. Here we find that after 14 years they are asking for more powers, unprecedented in any country which is not engaged in a shooting war. And they take them because the hon. the Minister tells us that everything is peaceful and calm and quiet in South Africa.</p>

<p>What powers have the Government got already to deal with these problems? First of all under the Suppression of Communism Act, they have defined &#x201C;Communism&#x201D; so widely that it can include many people who had nothing to do whatever with Communism. Nobody knows it better than the Minister himself. Secondly, they have given the President power to deem a person a communist without his having the right of recourse to the courts to prove that he is not a communist. Thirdly, the President has the power to declare any organization an unlawful organization if he is satisfied that it is communistic. And once again there is no recourse to the courts, fourthly, the Minister has been given wide powers over persons who profess Communism, over persons deemed to be communists, over organizations which he suspects, over persons who at any time have been members or active supporters of organizations subsequently declared to be unlawful organizations, and over persons who contravene any section of the Act. We warned that those powers were so wide that it could well lead to the situation where the remedy in many respects was worse than the crime which they set out to control. What are these powers that the Minister has? He has the power already to compel those people to resign as office-bearers or members of any organization and cease to take part in its activities. He has the power to prevent them coming to this House. He may prohibit a person from attending any meeting for a named period, or even from being in a particular area, and the sole requirement was at that time that in the opinion of the Minister the presence of that person at the meeting in that area would further the interests of Communism. He could prohibit any particular gathering in any particular place if that gathering in his opinion would further the interests of Communism. He could organize an investigation on any premises whatsoever, and all these powers were given him in respect of people who had had no right to go to the courts on the merits to prove that they were not communists. All these powers were given him in respect of members of organizations which had never had the right to go to court to prove that they were not communistically inclined organizations. They went further in 1951, and they went further again in 1954, and there we stated very definitely that we could not support the Government in any measure which aimed at making the existing law still stricter and more evil as long as the Government persists in a standpoint that the Minister should exercise those tremendous powers over the freedom and civil rights of citizens in South Africa.</p>

<p>What is the Minister asking, Sir, under this Bill? First of all he has changed the definition of a &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;. A gathering in the past had to have a common purpose. Now it need not have a common purpose.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is a little shy about that part. He has the power now to control the attendance of certain people at gatherings, whether they are social gatherings or not, gatherings of a particular kind or in a particular place. In other words, he would have the perfect right to prohibit any of those individuals under his powers in this Bill from attending a mixed gathering, from attending gatherings of a particular kind. The Minister knows that. He made no attempt to justify that power. Why has he taken it? I go further: He has that power over people who are merely deemed to be communists, and he has it over people whom he is satisfied are engaged in activities furthering, or which may further, the objects of Communism. Now there is no proof that they are furthering the objects of Communism, there is no decision of the courts; all that exists is the decision of the Minister and he has the right to lay down that those people shall not have a right to attend certain gatherings. But the Bill goes further. He has a further power and that is that if he is satisfied that any activities of any person or organization is furthering or may further the achievement of any of the objects of Communism in the Republic, then he may ban any gathering or any particular gathering anywhere. Now I know that that is a wide reading of the Bill, a wide reading of that clause, but if we look at the terms of the clause there is no indication that the furthering of the objects of Communism may be by means of that particular activity by that particular person. In other words, all he needs is somebody whom he suspects of Communism somewhere in South Africa and he can ban any gathering or any particular gathering or gathering of a particular kind anywhere in South Africa. Sir. I am not surprised that the hon. gentleman did not give us an explanation of that. That is one of the most important clauses in this Bill and it makes the Minister&#x2019;s powers virtually absolute. He has other powers over gatherings which I will deal with later. But why does he want this power, how can he possibly justify it? Because there is one man or one organization which is furthering, or may further, the achievements of any of the objects of Communism in the Republic, he can ban a meeting, or any meeting anywhere in the Republic at all. I think that must be one of the most far-reaching powers ever taken by a Minister of Justice in any country in the world, and we have no justification by the hon. gentleman for it.</p>

<p>That is not all. The conditions under which an organization may be declared unlawful have been extended. The hon. gentleman has told us that. The President may now declare an organization unlawful which carries on or has been established for the purpose of carrying on, directly or indirectly, any of the activities of an unlawful organization. Now, Sir, some of those activities may have been perfectly innocent. The interesting thing is that the investigation which used to take place before no longer takes place in these circumstances. Before there was an investigation by a magistrate and two members of a committee. Now there is no investigation. The Minister wants the power at once. Why? He says he wants to act quickly. Organizations may change their names. But it would seem to me, Sir, that if he is to avoid the banning of innocent organizations and if he is to avoid giving himself powers which the Cabinet can abuse (these powers which are exercised by the President are exercised on the advice of the Cabinet), then there must be some safeguard, little as it is. What safeguard there was, is removed; and there is no recourse to the courts to prove that that banning was wrongful because the organization had not the object or was not engaged in these activities. But the hon. the Minister has gone further where he himself wishes to impose prohibitions upon individuals whom he is satisfied are engaged in activities which further or may further any of the objects of Communism, and there is also no investigation as there was in the past. That provision has now ceased to exist&#x2014;there is no investigation of any kind and disabilities may be visited upon those people merely on the say-so of the Minister. Now what can the hon. gentleman do to them? Before he could confine them to an area. We have heard a long tale from him of how very much more humane he is than some people that he does not want to see them in gaol or in a concentration camp. He is prepared to put them under house arrest! He is prepared to prevent them from communicating with other people! He is prepared to restrict their activities. He is prepared to prevent anything they say being reproduced, mechanically or otherwise. In other words, he can sentence them to civil death. He can do it, not the courts; there is no right of appeal to the courts. This hon. the Minister alone decides that he is satisfied that their activities may further the objects of Communism or any of the objects of Communism, and then he takes those powers and there is no right of recourse to a court of law in South Africa, except to show that the hon. gentleman acted <i>mala fides.</i> Is it any wonder that people are worried about this Bill? Can you wonder that it is said that it is an invasion of the rights of individuals?</p>

<p>The hon. Ministers knows as well as I do, that nobody knows who has been named or deemed. The hon. the Minister said so himself. He is now going to publish names in the <i>Gazette.</i> You see, Sir, here exactly is the attitude of the Government to this matter. Because the Minister has asked for excessive powers which depend on his good faith, his honesty and integrity and because they have not been abused so far, and because that hon. gentleman thinks the Minister is a man of great integrity, he thinks there never will be any abuse. But he cannot deny that those powers may be handled by an unscrupulous Minister.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly! This Government is taking powers again which it does not require, which cannot be controlled, just because it believes that it will not abuse those powers. No democracy in the world can be run on that basis. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the more power people have, the more the temptations of corruptions. That is exactly the danger we are running with this Government, which is becoming insatiable in asking for more and more powers which are completely uncontrolled by the courts because the Government believes that it will never abuse those powers.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has told us that under Clause 4 he is going to publish the names of people in the <i>Gazette,</i> but he will admit also that the names of those affected, the classes of people affected are very much wider, and it would seem also that he is entitled to impose prohibitions on people by publication in the <i>Gazette,</i> under Clause 4. He did not tell us that. The clause says &#x201C;the Minister may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> prohibit all persons whose names appear on any list &#x2026;&#x201D; from undertaking certain activities. Is this to be the prohibition? Is this to mean that in the case of an individual he is prohibited from undertaking certain activities? There are later provisions in the Bill which provide that in certain circumstances publication in the <i>Gazette</i> is regarded as service on them and if they fail to observe the conditions laid down, they can be liable to very serious penalties. Sir, is that a provision which the hon. the Minister thinks can be tolerated in a democratic country? It seems this clause is so wide that the hon. the Minister may be able to impose prohibitions here not just on individuals but on a generic class of persons who have been members, supporters or office-bearers of a particular organization, without specifying the individuals concerned. You see, Sir, the opportunities for abuse! You see the dangers that can arise for the individual concerned.</p>

<p>And we come to this clause dealing with newspapers. The hon. the Minister seems very proud of this provision. But surely what is happening is that a newspaper is being invited to pay a fine in advance. Whether or not the people who are running that newspaper, who are responsible for its registration, are to pay that fine is to be decided solely by the Minister of the Interior. There is no recourse to any other tribunal. That gentleman will decide and he decides alone. Now, Sir, they are the proprietors of a newspaper and what the Minister happens to know about them, will determine what he does. Once again it is not a question of their having a conviction before the courts. Once again it is purely a question of the discretion of the Minister, the suspicion of the Minister in respect of the individuals concerned. Here you have this provision which we have no doubt whatever will limit the publication of a number of small journals in South Africa which may do a great deal to form opinion, not in the wrong way but in the right way.</p>

<p>There is another odd clause, and that is Clause 6, which the Minister seemed to deal with only in passing, and that was this power to publish a list in the <i>Gazette.</i> It seemed to us that it indicated that that was so that the public should know who those people were because they were prohibited from publishing their articles or any statements which they make. But, Sir, the list may contain names of people who were Communists many, many years ago. The Minister has a provision providing for their removal.</p></speech>

<p>Yes, but how does he know? Under what circumstances are they going to be removed?</p>

<p>The worst clause, is the power which the Minister takes under Clause 8, which inserts a new Section 10. He widens the class of people over whom he has powers, he takes new powers over them, he does away with the notice he had to give them, he can limit them no more just to an area but to their homes, he can limit their activities, he can order them to report to the police ever so often, he can prohibit them from communicating with other people, he can control their very activity, and they have no recourse to the courts at all.</p></speech>

<p>Do you realize that those are powers probably far wider than were taken by the Government during the war years? Do you realize that those are powers far wider than were taken in many countries in times of emergency? But everything depends on the suspicion the Minister may have. Then he introduced a number of new offences, and certain of those concern your changing your place of residence while prohibition is in force against you, without giving notice. The minimum penalty is three years. But it must be mentioned also that the onus of proof that you have given notice is placed upon the accused, and once again <span class="col_6089-6090" refersTo="page_0291"/>he is placed in an embarrassing position. It is also made an offence under this Act to &#x201C;publish or disseminate any speech or statement, or any extract from or recording or a production of any speech or statement made or purporting to have been made anywhere at any time by any person prohibited under Section 5 or 9 from attending any gathering It should be noted here that if the particulars of the prohibition had been notified in the <i>Gazette,</i> then the defence by the accused that he had no knowledge of the prohibition concerned, is valueless. Now what is the position? The hon. Minister prohibits someone from attending a gathering. He publishes that in the <i>Gazette.</i> Somebody refers to a statement made by that person. He commits an offence, whether he knew it was in the <i>Gazette</i> or not. I go further: What is the position in respect of reproducing in this House or in a court of law statements made by an individual who is under a ban under those clauses? It seems to me that the provisions of this clause are so wide that it is doubtful even whether Parliamentary privilege applies.</p>

<p>It is doubtful what the position would be in a court of law in respect of legislation of this kind. The Minister says &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be childish!&#x201D;. There is the provision that a subsequent law amends an earlier law. Where is the provision in this Bill which excludes that? I go further and I say that all these invasions of the rights of individuals have been taken in a manner which denies entirely the rule of law in South Africa. They are all taken on the question of the suspicion of the Minister, and, Sir, they can be applied not only in respect of organizations declared unlawful under the Suppression of Communism Act, but also organizations declared unlawful under the Unlawful Organizations Act. They interfere with the freedom of the individual and with the freedom of assembly. Sir, it seems to us that the Minister should make out a very strong case for those indeed and he has made out no case whatever in placing this Bill before the House.</p>

<p>There is the second point and that deals with the 12 days&#x2019; detention section. That section was introduced for a specific purpose. The Minister of the day outlined to us the reasons at the time. Now without any additional reasons, this hon. Minister has come along and asked for the extension of that section for another year, the extension of that section in such a way that it will entitle the Attorney-General, if he considers it necessary in the interests of the public or in the interests of law and order, to direct that no person who has been arrested shall be granted bail for 12 days. Last year we were told that there were very good reasons for it being introduced. This year we have just had vague stories by the hon. the Minister, no further attempt to justify the situation whatever, and no indication of it being necessary because of a state of emergency. Last year we were warned of what was going to happen on 31 May when the Republic was celebrated. This year the Minister has given us no information, but having got used to the idea, having got used to invading the right of <i>habeas corpus,</i> having found it useful for his purposes, he goes straight ahead with it, without having any regard to the rights of the individual.</p>

<p>There are other invasions of the freedom of the individual. The first is the question of minimum sentences, which need not labour.</p>

<p>I am grateful to know that. It makes it less objectionable, but it remains nevertheless objectionable. In the past a magistrate had the right to prohibit meetings where he apprehended that the public peace would be seriously endangered by the assembly of a particular public gathering in any public place. The Minister is now taking the power, if he deems it necessary or expedient for the maintenance of public peace, to ban any public gathering in any public place, in any area during any period or on any day or during specified times or periods. Sir, the only sort of justification we have had is the Minister talking about meetings held on the steps of the City Hall in Johannesburg and held on the Grand Parade in Cape Town. The hon. the Minister has suggested that people hold only meeting there who are seeking trouble. I can give him the assurance, Sir, that this party once held a meeting there when close on 14,000 people were present &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It had nothing to do with elections, but there was no question of seeking trouble. I can give the Minister the assurance that that situation and the Parade here in Cape Town had been amongst the few safety valves which have prevented the powder barrel blowing up in South Africa. I think the hon. Minister should remember that when rights are taken to ban meetings because the hon. the Minister deems it necessary or expedient and there is no recourse to a court of any kind, then you are busy sitting on the safety valve and causing trouble for the future of South Africa.</p>

<p>Those are invasions of the freedom of the individual, but I have the other objection against this Bill and that is that it defines crimes in such wide terms that it jeopardises the lives and liberty of individuals who are innocent of any intent to subvert the State. We know that the hon. gentleman has wide powers under the Public Safety Act and that <span class="col_6091-6092" refersTo="page_0292"/>he has wide powers under the Riotous Assemblies Act. He also has wide powers under the ordinary criminal law. I would say that we on this side of the House, because we stand for the maintenance of law and order, are as much against sabotage as anybody on the Government side of the House. But I want to say also that unlike many of those who opposed our war efforts in the years 1939 to 1945, we have no experience of committing sabotage, but we have quite a lot of experience of combating sabotage as we knew it in the war years. May I remind hon. members opposite that it was only at the height of the war years that the United Party Government found it necessary to introduce the death penalty, and then only in certain very serious cases. May I remind the House what the principles were underlying that legislation? At the time there was a slightly increased penalty in respect of serious crimes when they were committed either by means of an explosive or with certain intentions such as hampering the Government in its war efforts. There was a compulsory death sentence for certain serious and well-defined crimes, where those crimes were committed either by explosives or with the intention of hampering the Government in its war efforts. Then there was death or a minimum sentence of seven years in respect of certain serious and well-defined crimes where those were committed without an explosive but with the intention of hampering the Government in its war effort or other similar clearly defined intentions.</p>

<p>Here we are again, this hon. the Minister, supported by his back-benchers, trying to equate the position in South Africa to-day with a real war. You know, Sir, during the war years we had a very difficult organization to deal with. We had the Ossewa-Brandwag. They were extremely able people. They got up to all sorts of mischief in South Africa. We had all sorts of newspapers writing extraordinary things, and we had to try and win the war. The Minister tries to equate that position with the situation here to-day when the Minister tells us that everything is calm and quiet and peaceful!</p>

<p>The Minister is seeing spooks to-night. He is looking round desperately to find some reason to justify an action which he knows he cannot justify. But, Sir, it is such a contrast to the position in the war years. The United Party had its crimes clearly defined. The onus remained upon the Crown, the State, to establish the intent. Here you have a Government which has taken fright already, although the Minister is trying to tell us that he has not taken fright, that he is not being panicky. But he is taking wider powers than the old United Party Government took in the war years.</p>
