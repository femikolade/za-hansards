<heading>NATIONAL EDUCATION COUNCIL BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for second reading,&#x2014;, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Education, Arts and Science, upon which an amendment had been moved by Dr. Steenkamp, adjourned on 15 June, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now had a debate of some hours, a debate which in my humble opinion could have been much shorter had the Bill and its objects been under <span class="col_8173-8174" refersTo="page_1333"/>stood correctly. In the first place I should like to express my gratitude and appreciation to hon. members on my side of the House who facilitated my task considerably. Their contributions, without exception, were to the point and put the perspective quite correctly, not only as regards the contents of the Bill but also as regards its objects. I must say that, listening to the speeches, it became clear to me that they were people of set purpose who, for many long years, have seen a weakness in our education, and that they not only formed a cordon here against the Opposition, but that in reality they interpreted what has been felt to be a need since 1911 by various commissions appointed to express their views on matters of education. The studied speeches were most heartening to me, and I wish to assure them that they were the mouthpiece not only of a political party, but of people who are interested in education and training.</p>

<p>Turning to the Opposition, I must say that I am exceptionally sorry and wish to express my sincere regret that the Opposition deliberately and of their own choice have adopted an attitude which has really deprived them of an opportunity of sharing in a very fine piece of legislation. I think the Opposition have done themselves a disservice. They were not the mouthpiece of the people outside, or that of their own supporters. It is a pity they did so, otherwise in a matter such as this, they could justly have boasted, once this legislation was on the Statute Book, that they had a share in this very important and constructive piece of work. The debate has proved that. They waxed hot and cold. They said there should be a Council&#x2014;but then they added a lot of &#x201C;buts&#x201D;: Where they did advocate centralization, they did so with suspicious minds, but as the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) particularly was the mouthpiece, we have here a moving plea for decentralization, with reference to many countries where decentralization fitted in better. I am sorry for them, about what has happened to them.</p>

<p>What exactly has happened? On two occasions, last year and this year, on the introduction of this Bill, even before it had been referred to the Select Committees, the Opposition fought the introduction of this Bill from the very first stage; i.e. they opposed the first reading. They did so with a very keen sense of responsibility, I think, but they tested the responsibility by reference to their own views. They thought they were interpreting the sentiments of a large section of the population. Then the Select Committees came, and I refer particularly to the Select Committee of this year, and there was a general scramble to get bodies and individuals to send in memoranda and to come and testify before the Select Committee. There were the existing associations, and new associations were established, and then the evidence was received, which, in the words of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) last night, could really be divided into six groups, three groups of witnesses who represented his point of view, and three groups of witnesses representing our attitude. Thereby he himself eliminated a good deal of the evidence in this Blue Book as really representative evidence. The hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) analysed the nature of the evidence and its contents last night and I wish to congratulate him on what he did, for it is a true reflection of what exactly happened, and the conclusion he came to is that the thin evidence against this Bill&#x2014;I am now referring to the principle and not to the details&#x2014;really proved to emanate from the Black Sash and her satellites. That was all that remained that really was opposed to the legislation. The Blue Book has been abused. The hon. members for Potchefstroom (Dr. J. H. Steyn) and Kensington stated very clearly that this Blue Book will be used for many years in the way many people use the Bible. There are hundreds of creeds and all of them base their right to existence on the Bible. Here sentences will frequently be taken out of their context and reproduced in such a way that this or that one was opposed to it. But I should like to say that will not take us much further. What is really the great criterion when so-called contentious legislation comes before this House? The criterion is the reaction outside. Since the second reading started here, and I gave an exposition of the Bill, there was no reaction except 21 telegrams I received from the National Council of Women, a body that knows absolutely nothing about education, save that they profess to be mothers of children, a body which has now associated itself so fully with politics. They were actually worded in four different ways so as to provide some variation, and from the smallest towns telegrams also arrived, from small towns such as Tzaneen and others.</p>

<p>What now remained for the Opposition in this debate was the last trench, and the stand they took was one of suspicion and the sowing of suspicion. The Minister will do this and he will do that. The Minister will appoint a Nationalist Council consisting of only his supporters. Christian National Education will come and goodness knows what else. I should like to say at once that I reject that kind of insinuation with the contempt it deserves. I must say the hon. member for Kensington last night spoke like a true educationist, probably out of despondency and desperation, and adopted an attitude that had much substance in it. The hon. member eventually also said that he would like to help me. The words he used there were proof that the hon. member is not completely opposed to the principle of having an advisory council. The hon. member, with his knowledge as an ex-inspector of schools who had visited many schools, knows that a very great need exists for such a Council. His offer was admittedly pretty thin, for he really wanted to offer me only two things to help me, but it does mean a lot to me that he wished to help me. The one is: Why do I not want to exclude from the operation of the law the remaining 25 private schools as well? Here I must say at once, in reply also to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), who concentrated <span class="col_8175-8176" refersTo="page_1334"/>mainly upon the private schools, that I regret that the members on my side have made that concession in having excluded some of the private schools, and do you know why I am sorry? I think they should have retained all the private schools. According to the hon. member there are only 25 left, and they are being deprived of any privilege they may have, in the first place, and in the second place, where the private schools are providing good and thorough training, they could also learn much about general education through the medium of this Council. We can learn from them, but they will miss a great deal, as it is now requested that they be excluded. I think an injustice is being perpetrated upon those schools by separating them now. Those hon. members are always so concerned about any form of apartheid, but here they now wish to apply apartheid, for they are scared that this cruel Minister, with his Nazi claws, will get a grip on the neck of those people. What an accusation! I hope that the private schools, the few remaining ones, will see themselves what is done under this Act and that the rest in due course will come along of their own accord and say: We should also like to have a more active share in this Advisory Council than the Opposition were prepared to grant us.</p>

<p>What was the evidence?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should rather remain quiet about the evidence now, for we shall now come to the practical aspect. Forget about the evidence, for as I said just now, as a result of the fact that there are many kinds of interpretations of the evidence, it also results in the hon. member and myself belonging to two different churches.</p>

<p>The next bit of assistance the hon. member for Kensington wished to give me is whether I would not be a little more fair and nominate some members of the Council and have the other nominated by representative bodies. I shall reply to this in the course of my further reply.</p>

<p>The best method I can think of to cut this reply down as much as possible is not to reply to every individual in regard to what he has said, but to mention briefly the clauses and the objections raised to the clauses.</p>

<p>The first clause is Clause 2. On Clause 1 all I got was really only the standpoint on the private schools, and my attitude there is that I am definitely not going to make any further concessions in that regard. My hon. colleagues on the Select Committee did much for the sake of good co-operation. I am not blaming them for that, but I am not going to concede one further inch, for I believe that after I have said what I intend saying, it will be clear to everybody, and to the private schools too, that it will be to their advantage that this Council should come into being as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Leave it to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>We have left everything to the educational bodies for the last 50 years, and nothing has happened. We talk and we talk and we do not get a yard further.</p>

<p>On the part of the Opposition, as I summarized it, there were three main objections to Clause 2. The first is that the Council is not what it pretends to be, namely a national council, because it is intended only for Whites and because the non-Whites are excluded. The second objection, and that is the biggest defect they see in Clause 2, is that the Minister himself appoints the Council, and he excludes direct representation of teachers&#x2019; associations, universities, the army, agriculture, industry, mining, private schools, Indian schools, Bantu schools and Coloured schools, etc. And the last one is a very unfortunate objection, but I have to mention it, and that came particularly from the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) and the hon. member for Durban (Berea), and that is that there is no assurance in this legislation that the Council will consist of an equal number of English- and Afrikaans-speaking persons. I shall deal with them, but the essence of the council is really contained in Clause 7, so I shall leave over some of these objections until I reach Clause 7.</p>

<p>The first objection is that no direct representation is given and that the Minister himself appoints the members, with all the frills added, so that it will be a body of &#x201C;stooges&#x201D;, Nationalists and I do not know what all, and I should not claim this right for myself. Now, I have four reasons why I refuse to accept the views of the Opposition, even the modified view of the hon. member for Kensington. My first reason is that there is such a multitude of organizations that are concerned with education directly or indirectly, that I shall require a Council of some hundreds of persons if I wanted to do justice to all these organizations. I have made a summary of all those organizations and I should like to mention it here for the record. Just to give an idea, there are the following organizations: There are 11 teachers&#x2019; associations, seven inspectors&#x2019; associations, there are nine universities with faculties of education. All those are people who are interested in education. There are 21 church denominations. Then we have the Home and School Council, the Afrikaanse Calvinistiese Beweging, the Vereeniging vir Christelike Onderwys, The Christian Education Movement of South Africa, the Education League of South Africa, the Education Panel, the Education Vigilance Association, the South African Council for English Education, the Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Private Schools, the Associated Chambers of Commerce, Die Handelsinstituut, the S.A. Federated Chambers of Industries, etc. When we begin to think of representation for the employers, then we have various trade unions that are combined into five federations, who also can claim representation, for if the employers&#x2019; organizations can have it, then they <span class="col_8177-8178" refersTo="page_1335"/>also are entitled to have it. Then there are the S.A. Agricultural Union, the Chamber of Mines, the Army, the Post Office, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, the Railway Administration and the Public Service Commission, all of which are training institutions and are interested in the education of people. Then come the Indian schools, the Bantu schools and the Coloured schools, and finally there are more than 100 parent-teacher associations, scientific and cultural societies, all of which in one way or another are concerned with education. Surely it would create a senseless situation to give representation to all these bodies. Do hon. members think they have a monopoly of all the knowledge to be able to nominate all the bodies that should have representation? They think that the bodies they have referred to in the report of the Select Committee are the proper bodies, but they are excluding all the other bodies. Now I should like to ask the hon. members a fair question: Who has to advise the Minister in regard to the bodies to whom he should give representation to advise him? For surely somebody has to advise me. Surely I cannot give all those people representation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>How are you going to decide who is to serve on that Council?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>That the hon. member will hear at the end of my speech. If he is not careful, he might even get the right to nominate one himself. I think it is a ridiculous request; it is an ill-considered idea, and I cannot help calling it a mischievous idea. If the hon. members of the Select Committee want to see an improvement brought about, and if they were to say to the Minister: You should not appoint the people, but you should give representation in this and that manner, then they should have acquainted themselves with what the consequences of such a step will be. As regards that matter, I can only say it is an impossible matter. Now I should like to ask the next question in this connection. Hon. members have unanimously decided that this council should consist of high-ranking, prominent educationists and educated men who are acquainted with education. They are very much afraid that I shall do something wrong, and here I am completely at one with them. But if representation were to be accorded to these bodies, who is going to say that it will be high-ranking educationists who will be members of this council? What assurance have hon. members opposite that they are going to be educationists? I do not want to pick out names here, but I know of many of these persons, and I can imagine already who will be on that council. It will be some popular person who might have been some good in his association, but who knows nothing at all about education. Where the Opposition have pleaded that the members should be above suspicion, I should like to tell them that I agree, and that the Bill provides for that. Clause 2 (3) (a) and (b) binds the Minister and any member of this House can call me to account if I have failed to observe the provision of Clause 2 (3) (a) and (b). Clause 2 (3) (a) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the members of the council shall be a person who has special knowledge of the functions of the Department of Education, Arts and Science, and there shall, in respect of each province, be appointed one member recommended by the Administrator concerned, who has special knowledge of education matters in that province.</block>

<p>Sub-clause (3) (b) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The other members of the council shall be persons who have distinguished themselves in the field of education or who, in the opinion of the Minister, are otherwise specially qualified in some aspect of the work of the council.</block>

<p>Surely it cannot be put more clearly; it is quite clear from this that the Minister is bound. Mr. Speaker, the conclusion to which I have come on this senseless proposal, on the objection to the appointment of members by the Minister, is that it cannot be seen in any other light than as mere sowing of suspicion against this council, even before it has been constituted, and even before it has begun to function, particularly when regard is had to the fact that there are numerous other councils or boards, the members of which are appointed by the State President or by the Minister, and to which reference as a rule is made in terms of praise, even by the Opposition. I am thinking, for instance, of bodies such as the following: In the first place there is the Board of Trade and Industries. Section 2 of Act 19 of 1944, which is a United Party Act, provides that the State President shall appoint the chairman, a deputy-chairman, and not more than three other members. The period of office, not more than five years, is determined by the State President. Is there any member opposite who will say that the Board of Trade and Industries consists of a lot of stooges of the Minister of Economic Affairs? Then I should like to mention the C.S.I.R., to which hon. members have referred here in terms of great praise. If the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) will refer to the language groups represented here, she might also perhaps get an eye-opener. Section 5 of Act 32 of 1962 provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the council shall consist of a president and 11 other members to be appointed by the State President, all of whom shall be persons who have achieved distinction in science or industry or who have special knowledge or experience in relation to some aspect of the council&#x2019;s work.</block>

<p>The members are appointed by the State President. This is a professional council, the same kind of council I have in mind. Is there any <span class="col_8179-8180" refersTo="page_1336"/>member opposite who will say that the C.S.I.R. consists of a lot of people who benefit only the National Party; that they are a lot of stooges of this Government? Let anyone stand up there and say that Dr. S. Meiring Naude is such a man; and can they say that of persons such as Prof. Straszaker, Mr. P. E. Rousseau, Dr. H. J. van Eck, Dr. P. J. du Toit, Prof. Dr. S. F. Oosthuizen, etc.? There are 11 of them. The State President appoints the chairman for the period he determines. Then there is a Wage Board consisting of five members appointed by the Minister. The five members sitting there at present have been appointed by me. Will any member opposite get up and tell me that the members of the Wage Board are there only to benefit the National Party? Not even all those people are Nationalists; I know them.</p>

<p>Who are they?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The members are Prof. Steenkamp, Col. P. R. Viviers, Mr. H. W. Tindale, Adv. J. Marais and Mr. A. Juyn. I myself nominated these members. Now I come to an educational council, the National Council for Social Research that consists of 19 members appointed by the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. All of them are prominent people. Is there any person who has spoken otherwise than in terms of praise of the research work conducted by this Council in the field of education? I think I have given hon. members opposite enough rope to hang themselves with it. If that is the position regarding these high-ranking councils, what right have other hon. members opposite to say that I or any member of this Government will set about things in such an indiscreet manner as to go and limit this extremely necessary and important council by merely appointing people who will carry out their own policy? We have had many opportunities with all these Boards I have mentioned&#x2014;and there are numerous others&#x2014;to do something like that but it has never been done, No, it is not only an attempt to sow suspicion, but I have come to the conclusion that a pathetic sense of inferiority has gripped hon. members opposite. The hon. member for Potchefstroom (Dr. J. H. Steyn) has already referred to that. Their conduct can be attributed to a feeling of inferiority that has emerged from the Opposition, and I should like to tell them that they need not be concerned about the constitution of the Council. At the conclusion of my speech I shall tell the House and the country how I propose to constitute the council.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, what is particularly amusing is that the Opposition in one breath pleads for an equal number of Afrikaans- and English-speaking members on this Council. That is really amusing to me. In one breath the Opposition pleads that only high-ranking educationists should be appointed to the council, and then again they urge an artificial classification in language groups. Let me now put this question to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North): Suppose the Council were to consist of 20 members, and that there are 15 outstanding English-speaking educationists and only five outstanding Afrikaans-speaking educationists; do the Opposition then want the Minister to appoint only ten of the outstanding English-speaking persons, the five outstanding Afrikans-speaking persons and a further five Afrikaans-speaking persons of average capability? Is that the view of the hon. member? Then I am sorry for the poor children that are to be taught by her, if she wishes to constitute the Council in such an artificial manner, and I am sorry for her if the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) get her alone and pull her ears until they are red for having said &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>No, l am not going to reply to questions now. The hon. member should put that amendment in the Committee Stage, that the Council shall be constituted in such a manner and then she can say her say if she wishes to do so. Mr. Speaker, I wish to state my point of view unequivocably, I am going to appoint the best people to that council&#x2014;the very best&#x2014;and I am going to appoint the most prominent educationists to that council. I am not going to be an accomplice to placing artificial impediments on the road; I am not trying to bind myself to appoint so many English- and so many Afrikaans-speaking people. The time for that has passed on. The hon. members for Johannesburg (North) and Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) are living in a time that is long past. I am giving hon. members the right and the opportunity, when the council has been appointed, to come and tell me which of those people are no good on the council and ought not to be appointed. They will then have an opportunity of taking me to task.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not even want to use the argument&#x2014;one of the hon. members on this side has pointed out that he is sorry that this is so&#x2014;that the English-speaking people have not thrown their whole weight into education matters. That is a very great pity. I have here figures for the Transvaal that may be very interesting. In 1961 there were, in the Transvaal English-medium schools, 673 Afrikaans-speaking teachers as against 2,079 English-speaking ones; there were 172 that were proficient in both languages and 31 speakers of other languages. I think the English-speaking people are leaving their own country and <span class="col_8181-8182" refersTo="page_1337"/>South Africa in the lurch, and the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) has admitted it. Permit us merely to issue the warning that we consider that everyone should pull his weight. Then it should also be borne in mind that the English-speaking White national group comprises approximately only 43 per cent of the total White population. But I am not trying to suggest that I am going to appoint the members of the Council on that basis; I am not going to do so on any fixed basis, and I am not going to have myself bound by anybody in any way whatsoever. I am going to confine myself to one principle only, and that is to appointing the best and only the best man to that council.</p>

<p>Then I come to Clause 5. The main complaint of the Opposition against this clause is that the Minister may misuse the committees by their acting &#x201C;as inquisitors&#x201D; (to use the words of the hon. member for Hillbrow) at schools of the provinces. Then the positive idea was expressed, in addition, that the inspectors of schools will then surely go and do this work instead of investigating things. What are the motives of this inquisition I shall then, as alleged, launch? Here, too, sinister motives are attributed to the Minister for which there are no grounds. The hon. member wishes to know more than we have already said. May I just remind hon. members of what I said in my introduction to my second reading speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Undoubtedly from time to time questions will arise on which the Council will have to advise and which will be of such a specialized or <i>ad hoc</i> nature that it will be necessary first of all to have the matter investigated thoroughly by a committee of specialists before the Council advises thereon. In view of this, the Bill in Clause 5 provides for the appointment of such committees. These committees will be presided over by one of the members of the Council, while other members will have special knowledge of the matter under investigation.</block>

<p>And then I stressed the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That such committees sometimes will have to have admission to schools in order to gain first hand knowledge of the problem under inquiry, need not be argued.</block>

<p>I stress the last four words, &#x201C;need not be argued&#x201D;. I used those words because I assumed that, among the members of the Opposition, there are those who understand pedagogic language. The reaction, however, indicates that they did not understand it, and therefore I should like to illustrate it with one example. Suppose the committee has to inquire&#x2014;and it is requested that there should be an inquiry&#x2014;or that the council itself decides that there should be an inquiry into the education of the deaf. Surely it is obvious that the council cannot produce a report if there is no proper investigation on the spot. Surely it is obvious that you can only acquire the required knowledge if you send people there to get the data and so I could mention a number of other specialized kinds of work. The inspector of education, the principal, is not concerned with that kind of work. He just cannot do it. Just ask the hon. member for Kensington how, in the normal course, he had to run around so as to carry out an inspection at a school. An inspector will then have to be appointed to every school, and he will have to be a specialist to be able to do the work properly. The hon. member for Kensington will tell you how, during the period he was an inspector of schools, he took five or six of his colleagues along with him when he visited big schools because he did not consider himself competent to have an inspection in regard to all those subjects. What nonsense to see sinister motives here!</p>

<p>The most important clause is Clause 7. Here the Opposition had three main objections in particular, namely (a) that the council will be able to interfere with provincial education matters, and so violate Sections 84 and 114 of the Constitution, and the Bill ought to prohibit such interference. The second objection is that there should rather be reference to &#x201C;cooperation&#x201D; than to &#x201C;co-ordination&#x201D;, and the third objection is that the duties of the council ought to be specified. Mr. Speaker, what strikes one immediately about all these objections is that they prove that the Opposition have not read Clause 7 properly, or are not willing to read it properly, for I do not wish to charge them with an inability to read the clause. Let us take them <i>seriatim</i>. Subclause (1) makes it very clear that the council will be merely an advisory body that will advise the Minister of Education, Arts and Science, and through him other Ministers and the Administrators. The merely advisory and co-ordinating functions of the council are reaffirmed in sub-clause (4). In the case of the Minister of Education, Arts and Science&#x2014;and only in his case (and hon. members should listen very carefully to this for it is cardinal)&#x2014;the council may take the initiative with its advice. In all the other cases, in the case of the Administrators and the other Ministers, the council advises only at the request of the parties concerned. [Interjection.] It seems to me as if hon. members opposite are now acquiring new knowledge. Nowhere in Clause 7 is there a provision that the advice must be accepted. Whether or not the advice is accepted will depend on the body that receives it. I should like to state clearly here that if the Minister considers the advice to be so important that it will require legislation, this House will be approached for the introduction of legislation, and hon. members need not raise ghosts now already. Let me mention an example. Supposing it is felt that Christian National Education should be enforced in all schools, from Natal right up to the Zambezi, it cannot be done without the introduction of legislation, and that legislation will have to be introduced here, and then hon. members will be able to refer to Christian National Education and to the so-called sinister motives behind the constitution of this council. Then <span class="col_8183-8184" refersTo="page_1338"/>the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) may attack the hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) regarding the question of parental choice which, according to the hon. member for Vryheid, is not being exercised properly in Natal.</p>

<p>I am now dealing with Clause 7 and the powers I have, which hon. members opposite have exaggerated. The only lawyer on that side who dealt with this was the hon. member for Durban (North). The other lawyers opposite felt that this was dangerous territory. The hon. members said that the Council does not have a national character, but any other Minister&#x2014;the Minister of Coloured Affairs, the Minister of Bantu Education, the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, the Public Service Commission and all the bodies I referred to just now&#x2014;may come to the Council and say: We should like to have advice. Is that then not a Council with a national character? The Minister of Education, Arts and Science has a say only in White education, but the road is open for any Minister to ask the Council for advice. How can hon. members then say that the Council does not have a national character? I hope my colleagues and other bodies will avail themselves of this.</p>

<p>A further objection is the co-ordinating function the Council will have. The question was asked time and again, what does co-ordination mean and the reply was: Refer to your dictionaries, then you will see what co-ordination means. It merely means co-ordination. But how are things going to be co-ordinated? Subclause (2) of Clause 7 provides unequivocally that the Council will perform its function of coordination in consultation with and not after consultation with the Department of Education, Arts and Science, the Provincial Departments of Education, education bodies and organizations and persons interested in education. Surely hon. members know the difference. If it said &#x201C;after&#x201D; consultation there shall be co-ordination, then it would mean that you are required only to ask the people for their views, and if they say they will have nothing to do with the thing, then you simply say: &#x201C;I am now going to co-ordinate; I am going to do as I please.&#x201D; But if you say it shall be done &#x201C;in&#x201D; consultation&#x2014;and that is legal language, not my language&#x2014;then those people have to agree. You cannot come from above and perform coordinating functions when those people say they will have nothing to do with the whole thing. I should now like to ask this question: Who can now compel whom to do what? There is no such thing.</p>

<p>Just listen to that fatuous remark. Is this provision regarding co-ordination in consultation with these bodies not really a compliance with the request of the Opposition who have pleaded for co-operation? Is that not really the basis on which you achieve co-operation, namely by means of work of persuasion? Mr. Speaker, the members of this Council will not be a lot of politicians who will adjudicate upon these matters. It will be one educationist against another educationist. They will not be people who are always looking for sinister motives.</p>

<p>The final objection to this clause is that the functions of the Council ought to be specified. That is a shortsighted approach. It is quite shortsighted to do anything of that nature with any new undertaking. Legal principles demand that once you start mentioning duties or functions, you have to mention the lot. The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) knows that. You cannot get away with merely mentioning some functions and then adding a little covering one, as you usually do in the terms of reference of a commission of inquiry. If you specify the duties, you must mention the lot from A to Z, otherwise the Council is bound and confined to the functions you have specifically mentioned, and the interpretation of a clause which contains only a general principle is equally bad for hon. members opposite, for if we are going to generalize in that way, then I shall still be able to do everything of which hon. members are accusing me, now of doing with this Council. I could mention the main ones, but if only a general provision is included in the Bill, then I shall still be able to do all those sinister things hon. members are accusing me of wanting to do. What purpose will it serve then? My view, and the view of the members on this side who served in the Select Committee, is that this is a new body and should therefore not be restricted or bound; it has to develop by itself and what should be defined more clearly will become clear soon so that it can do its work more effectively. We must build this Council up together.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with Clause 8 briefly. I do not want to say much about this, particularly in view of your ruling, Mr. Speaker. Your ruling was&#x2014;and I agree with it&#x2014;that the contention that there is a violation of the Constitution here is without substance. Nor is the autonomy of the provinces affected, but the provinces are retaining their autonomy, notwithstanding this legislation. However there is one danger which has been pointed out by the provincial authorities, namely that the present provision will have the effect that the provinces will also have to submit their draft estimates to this Parliament. So it is my intention to move an amendment in the Committee Stage, which will have the effect that draft ordinances of the provinces in regard to their budgets will be excluded from the provisions of this clause. It would be senseless to require anything of that nature from the provinces.</p>

<p>Now I should like to deal briefly with a few of the general objections raised to this Bill. We have been charged with having disregarded the majority view of the evidence given before the Select Committee in drafting this Bill. In this connection reference has been made <span class="col_8185-8186" refersTo="page_1339"/>particularly to the evidence of the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations. I do not wish to take up the time of the House by again quoting from the evidence of that body, but I should like, however, to quote only one thing to indicate that such an allegation renders a disservice to this important body. On page 2 of the report of the Select Committee the following is to be found in the memorandum of that body&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federal Council believes that education &#x2026; should be planned with the greatest discretion and wisdom.</block>

<p>On page 3, this appears&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federal Council has always had in mind an Education Advisory Council consisting of a nucleus of independent educationists who are in the closest contact with the various aspects of practical education.</block>

<p>All the evidence given by that body before the Select Committee is interspersed with propositions of this nature. The fact of the matter is that hon. members opposite are reading this evidence through dark glasses on the assumption that members of the Council will not be independent and will not be people of outstanding educational ability, but that it will be a Council that will be used by the Minister. For the record I should like to say that the Federal Council has done its share.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is contended that the provinces were not consulted when this Bill was drafted. That also is an unfounded charge. Last year the then Minister of Education, when the first Bill was drafted, held prolonged discussions with the provinces. As regards the Bill now before the House, I should like to point out that it also was submitted to the provinces. After it had been amended by the Select Committee in the form in which it now stands I received the following telegrams from the various Administrators:</p>

<block name="quote">From the Cape: We approve of the Education Bill with amendments.</block>

<block name="quote">From the Transvaal: re Bill National Education Advisory Council. Your letter of 23rd ultimo with annexures and my telex reply of 26 refers. Executive Committee and I agree with Bill as now amended.</block>

<p>These are Administrators who support the Government and it is immaterial what hon. members may think; they are still the provincial representatives. I shall read Natal&#x2019;s view too&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the Orange Free State: With reference to your acceptance of amendment as requested telegraphically, my administration accepts the Bill as amended.</block>

<block name="quote">From Natal: Natal Administration has no objection to the proposed amendments to the National Education Council Bill provided it is understood that in agreeing to such amendments the Executive Committee does not in any way accept the principles contained in the Bill.</block>

<p>We know of course what Natal&#x2019;s views are and that is not in issue here, but just as in the case of all other important national issues such as the Flag, the Republic, etc., Natal first took a stand and then shortly afterwards followed suit, so too in this case it can be said that Natal will come round to our way of thinking. It is wrong therefore to say that the provinces were not consulted. They were consulted and certain objections to this Bill resulted from that. As I have already said in this connection, I shall move an amendment in the Committee Stage. I shall have the amendment placed on the Order Paper so that hon. members can see it. It will not, of course, affect matters of principle. However, it is being done to make it acceptable to the provinces.</p>

<p>A further objection raised by the other side to this Bill is that I should have held it over until the Schumann Commission of Inquiry into the financial relations between the provinces and the Central Government has reported. These objections were raised <i>inter alia</i> by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). That is sheer nonsense. The Schumann Commission was appointed to inquire into the financial relations between the provinces and the Central Government. Its terms of reference are specifically confined to this point. At the present moment we are not concerned with the financial relations between the provinces and the Central Government, but with the establishment of a more effective system of education. It has no relation at all to the Schumann Commission&#x2019;s task. But hon. members are obsessed with the suspicion that we are creating institutions here in order to take away certain rights of the provinces.</p>

<p>I wish to say by way of summary that the resistance of the Opposition to this Bill has been a bad blunder, in the same way that its opposition to the General Law Amendment Bill was a blunder. Secondly, it is an exhibition of a hullabaloo without policy and without motive, an exhibition that is amazing its supporters in the country. Supporters of the hon. members opposite are amazed at this, except perhaps in Natal, where they have not all been properly enlightened. Nevertheless hon. members opposite will be astonished at the positive support I have received from people from that province, including the constituents of the hon. member for Durban (North). Once again hon. members have been asked to make the sacrifice&#x2014;if it is a sacrifice on their part&#x2014;of forgetting party advantage and to have regard to the interests of the country and of the nation, and particularly the interests of the child. Once again they had the opportunity, if they could do so, to look after the interests of future generations in the sphere of proper education and co-ordination. Just think of the training of technicians&#x2014;the situation to-day is disquieting. Hon. members opposite have apparently never studied these things deeply. It seems to me that the last time some of them were at school was when they left school; We cannot allow people with <span class="col_8187-8188" refersTo="page_1340"/>their type of speech to advocate a perpetuation of the present neglect.</p>

<p>What is the true position in relation to this legislation? In the first place, an advisory council is being established. The object of this Council is very clearly defined in this Bill, as well as the means it will have at its disposal and the powers it will have. Secondly, the advice it gives can be voluntarily accepted or rejected. It will still be done in public, for the Council will have to Table its reports on its activities. In that way people who approach the matter on the basis of political motives will be exposed, for there will then be an opportunity for discussion. Thirdly, where recommendations have to be accepted and given effect to in the interests of the education of the country, the requisite legislation will be introduced in this House. In the meantime nobody need worry that any ideology or system&#x2014;whether in respect of private schools or in respect of state schools&#x2014;will be enforced with the aid of this proposed Council. I say that with a full realization of my responsibilities. The Council will not have that power. Fourthly the advisory council will consist of efficient educationists from both language groups and from both sexes. So there will be English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking members, and there will be men and women. If there is any fear that I will not consult all prominent persons who are capable of rendering outstanding services to education&#x2014;which is possible since I do not know all of them&#x2014;I say that everybody will be at liberty, even the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South), to submit names to me with a statement of qualifications and an indication of the reasons why it considered that the proposed person will be a valuable member of the council. Any person will be at liberty to do so. How do hon. members feel about it now? I do not know whether I will receive such letters; indeed, I do not believe I will, because after all they do not believe in this kind of council. Nevertheless, I extend this invitation to them. They may do so without any hesitation. I am not binding myself to anything or anybody. In fact, to this very moment I am not committed to any person. I am looking for the best in the country. I hope too&#x2014;and I am pleased the Prime Minister is here to hear this&#x2014;that the five persons on the executive committee will be paid adequate salaries so that we can attract the very best persons.</p>

<p>It is my intention to make a model council of this advisory council, and not a political football. With this object in view, I should like to tell the hon. member for Durban (Central) that what I am staking in this matter is my own political reputation.</p>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to avail myself of the half-hour rule. It so happens that this week marks the 50th year of the existence of the Defence Force as we know it. When we look at its history and achievements during these 50 years we feel honoured and proud, and I would be failing in my duty if I did not on this occasion convey the congratulations of this side of the House to the Defence Force on the occasion of its jubilee. There have been times when things have not gone smoothly but generally speaking we can be proud of what the Defence Force of our small country has achieved during these 50 years.</p>

<p>During the past week there have been demonstrations and displays throughout the country. As far as we know everything went off smoothly, and this redounds to the great credit of the Defence Force. I should like, however, to express the sympathy of this side of the House in connection with the fatal accident which took place at Pretoria. As long as there is a Defence Force there will always be accidents, just as there have always been accidents in the past. We should like to extend our sympathy to the next-of-kin of the brave young pilot who lost his life in this accident at Pretoria and say that we are sorry that the accident had to take place after such a fine display.</p>

<p>This type of demonstration or display is a very good thing and I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to hold more displays of this kind so as to bring our Defence Force more to the notice of the public. I do not think that the public knows enough about what is going on. I do not think the public knows what the Defence Force offers to our young men. We should make more propaganda for our Defence Force, therefore, so that the public can get to know what our force is doing and what opportunities it offers to our young men. The Defence Force offers interesting careers to-day to our young men. I can personally testify to that. I served for nearly 30 years in the Defence Force, and if I had to choose again to-day, I would again choose the Defence Force.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I could not attend the main demonstration in Pretoria, but, from what I saw, I am convinced that we have men in our Defence Force to-day who will not leave South Africa in the lurch. Here I am thinking particularly of our young pilots. The flying displays that we saw were excellent, and if we see to it that those men receive the right training, and that they have the right equipment, we shall be able to rely on them just as we have been able to rely on our men in the past against much greater odds and in the face of much bigger problems.</p>

<p>The Defence Force needs the best brains in our country to-day. As big as it is, it is a technical unit, and we must attract our best men to it. What we need is more publicity. We can make our Defence Force attractive by giving greater publicity to the achievements and the heroic deeds of our present-day heroes.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Will you enlarge upon that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>I shall gladly do so. People in this country know only too well about our Voortrekker heroes; we know the heroes of the Anglo-Boer War. We know a great deal about the fine deeds performed in World War I. In connection with World War I, for example, I have in mind the achievements of men like Smuts, Lukin, van Deventer, Proctor and van Ryneveld. But how much do we know about the wonderful things that were done by our people in the last war, in World War II? We had men in this last war who served South Africa particularly well, men of whom South Africa can be proud, but of whom the public knows practically nothing. We can inspire our young men and attract them to the Defence Force by making the deeds of those men known to the public. Mr. Chairman, will you permit me to mention one or two of them? I am thinking of Capt. Ken Driver, who shot down 11 enemies in the Sudan and in the desert. Subsequently he became involved in an air battle and his aircraft was seriously damaged. But what did he do? He had no alternative but to crash deliberately into an enemy plane so as to bring it down. This meant that he himself had to bale out in a parachute and allow himself to be taken prisoner. This was a wonderful deed of heroism, and very few people know about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Was he decorated?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, he was decorated. But my point is that our own people know very little about it. Then turning to Korea, for example, I think of Major Blaauw who was on patrol together with a colleague. His colleague was shot down and he (Blaauw) continued to fly above him and he kept the communists away with his machine-gun. He remained there until his fuel was finished, until he himself was forced to land. Fortunately for them a helicopter arrived by that time. This is the sort of deed that we <span class="col_8191-8192" refersTo="page_1342"/>ought to publicize. That is the sort of thing that we should tell our people. We should build up these people. Similarly I can tell of many other young men of ours who did excellent work in the last war, who were wonderful leaders, and I think that the members of the public know too little about them. These things could not be publicized in war-time. But the whole of this wide field is open to our writers and journalists. Unfortunately many of those people are no longer with us to-day. Many of them had to make the supreme sacrifice. But there are still many of them who are with us and who could help us to make these deeds known to our people. I do feel that we should do more to present those people to the public of South Africa.</p>

<p>In regard to this I think that the Minister can also make his contribution by seeing to it that our official war history is properly written. We dare not allow these deeds to become lost to us in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it has been said before from this side of the House that we all agree that we must have a strong Defence Force. The Defence Vote that we are discussing here is the biggest sum that we have ever voted in the history of our country out of our revenue account, even in comparison with the war years. Sir, I have certain points of criticism and I hope that my criticism will be accepted in the spirit in which I should like to offer it, that is to say, as constructive criticism.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>We cannot build up our Defence Force on sound lines unless we have criticism.*</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Quite correct. I want to emphasize, however, that in this connection we should forget about politics. Politically I do not agree with the Government, but that does not mean to say that I harbour a grudge against the Defence Force and that I want to try to destroy the Defence Force. That is not my purpose at all.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to say that we all realize that the primary task of our Defence Force is internal security. I think we are all agreed that with the steps which the Government has taken so far, we can rest reasonably assured that we shall be able to maintain internal security. But the time may come when we shall also have to use our Defence Force in a greater struggle against Communism. I think that when we talk about a struggle against Communism, we must accept for the purpose of our discussion that South Africa cannot participate in a nuclear war. We do not have the means and we do not have the manpower and equipment. But if there is a war that is waged with conventional weapons, South Africa can make an enormous contribution.</p>

<p>We have the manpower; we have the workshops; we have the technicians and we can make a great and a fine contribution. With this colossal sum that we are voting for Defence, we have to buy a great deal of new equipment The Minister has not yet given us full details of the new equipment, but we learn from sources such as newspapers and others that new weapons have been bought for the Army. For the Air Force we are buying fighters, transport aircraft and helicopters; for the Navy we are buying helicopters and modernizing our torpedo-destroyers. These are all things that we cannot criticize.</p>

<p>But I am particularly concerned about the position in our Air Force as far as maritime aircraft are concerned. We know that some time ago the Government purchased a small number of these big long-distance reconnaissance aircraft. We also know that in the event of trouble we will not have enough of those aircraft to carry out the task that they have to carry out. We simply do not have enough of them. In the last war we had along our own coasts four squadrons of 16 aircraft each to do this work, and it was difficult for us to cope with it. What I should like to urge upon the hon. the Minister is this: In the event of war breaking out between the East and the West, he cannot expect assistance along those lines from the Western States. They are going to have their hands full with their own troubles. In addition to that we must remember that if we need more aircraft of this type, they cannot be sold off the shelf. It takes years to build these things.</p>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>We need them very much, and I am very pleased to hear that from the Minister. Another matter about which I am a little concerned is this question of our military and naval representation outside South Africa. The Minister told us some time ago in reply to a question who our military representatives were abroad. I find from his reply that in London, for example, we have a fairly strong team. We have Brig. Martin there, Commander Cousins of the Navy, Major Peddie of the Army and Capt. Cloete of the Air Force. But I am very perturbed about our representation in the United States. These are the people with whom we have to co-operate, to whom we have to look for assistance, for additional equipment, etc., and who have to pass on to us the new technique and help us to develop it in the event of any future struggle. I find that there we have one Air Force officer, namely Col. Theron. I find that in Lisbon we have a captain of the Navy. To me that seems to be all wrong. If this captain of the Navy were in Washington, for example, he would be able to render much better service for South Africa than he can in Lisbon. We know for what purpose the Minister&#x2019;s <span class="col_8193-8194" refersTo="page_1343"/>predecessor sent him to Lisbon, but that is something of the past. I think we should make the best of things now and make better use of his services. In Paris we have Brig. Robertse temporarily. In Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia we have a colonel. I feel that we need more representation in the Federation. We definitely need representation at this level in Mozambique and Angola. Those territories are of the utmost importance to us &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>We cannot have representatives in Mozambique and Angola because they form part of Portugal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure that the hon. the Minister with his ingenuity will able to devise some plan. Then there is another matter on which I should very much like to have a reply from the hon. the Minister. Before the last war, and during the last war, we had strong garrison artillery batteries and radar stations along our coasts. We should like the hon. the Minister to tell us whether his General Staff thinks that those installations and weapons are still necessary and, if so, whether they have been modernized, and if they have been modernized, whether men are being trained to handle those installations. It is a lengthy process to train men for that purpose. It is highly technical. The men handling that equipment must be of very high calibre.</p>

<p>We are also very pleased to see that at long last the hon. the Minister has given promotion to the men in the Defence Force who really deserve it. We are very pleased about it. Then I should like to hear from the Minister what the position is to-day with regard to our privates and our non-commissioned officers. It will be of no avail to have an army consisting of a number of high-ranking officers if we do not have the men below them to do the work. I should like to hear from the Minister what the position is in that connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at this stage I want to express my displeasure once again at the Minister&#x2019;s reference to English-speaking commandos. I do feel that that is not the right thing to do. I would be happier if there was no such thing as a unilingual unit in the Defence Force. It is not conducive to co-operation and training to have unilingual units. We are a bilingual country and here we have an opportunity now. The men in our Defence Force and in our Permanent Force are all trained in both languages. Let us try to carry on with that process and let us forget about English-speaking commandos and units. I realize that the Minister cannot rectify all this overnight. This is a process that will take time. But let us make a start with it, and in the Defence Force at any rate let us forget about Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people. They will all serve South Africa well in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, then there is one further matter that I should like to raise with the Minister and that is the pension scales of the men in the Defence Force. As you know, Sir, men holding certain ranks are required to retire at 45 years of age, 46 years and 50 years. The highest age is 55 years. If the person is fortunate and continues to receive promotion until he reaches 55 years of age, then his pension is adequate. But the person who has to retire at 45 or 46 is in an unfortunate position. Sometimes it is not his fault that he is unable to make headway, and then his pension and gratuity are so meagre that he can hardly do anything with that money. I was wondering whether the Minister could not consider the question of placing these people who have to retire at that early age on a different scale of pension.</p>

<p>Then there is just one further matter, which is less pleasant, that I have to touch upon. I refer to the scandalous treatment meted out to a certain Capt. Campbell in the Permanent Force.</p>

<p>The position is that this person was chosen to attend a course overseas. All the necessary arrangements were made; he himself incurred great expense and just one day before he had to leave he was told that he could not go. Well, there may have been good reasons for it. I do not know what the reasons were. But to this day he has not been told why he was not sent overseas, except that he had an interview with his divisional head, who refused to tell him why he could not go but who did say to him, &#x201C;I would advise you rather not to try to find out the reasons.&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, that reminds me very much of what happened in the days of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor. In those days this sort of thing frequently occurred. If the person concerned is not suitable, if he has made a mess of things, if he is not reliable enough to go, very well do not send him then, but tell him why. Say to him, &#x201C;This is what you did and that is why you cannot go.&#x201D; This individual has now left the Permanent Force. If my information is correct he resigned. I can tell you, Sir, that he was worth more to the Defence Force than those men who told tales about him and who manoeuvred him out of the Force, I am very sorry about this and I hope that the Minister will give us an explanation of this case.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for North-East Rand for the trend of his speech. I am glad of the way in which he made his speech. I want to associate myself with what was said about the jubilee of our Defence Force. The fact is that members of our Defence Force have performed glorious deeds in the past which form part of our history, exploits of which we as a small nation in South Africa can really be proud. I am glad that both language groups <span class="col_8195-8196" refersTo="page_1344"/>are co-operating as they are in the Defence Force. Therefore I want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for North-East Rand in extending our congratulations to the Defence Force on this occasion. We also wish them all success with the present training scheme. They are preparing themselves for great tasks in order to safeguard South Africa in case of need. The hon. member referred to some of the deeds in Korea; we know what those men did and what decorations they earned. We also know what our Defence Force men achieved in past wars. I want to say that we can be proud of those men. During recent weeks still we obtained a report from America in regard to the achievements of one of our officers there. There was a report in the <i>Star</i> of 2 June in regard to Maj. Philip Pretorius, who was stationed at the Military College at Voortrekkerhoogte. According to this report, he took a course known as the United States Army Special Warfare School Course in North Carolina. He achieved outstanding success. According to the report, 80 United States and Allied officers took this course and Maj. Philip Pretorius was the top student. South Africa was one of 11 countries which sent men there, and Maj. Pretorius earned those laurels for our country. It is gratifying to know that we send such men overseas for training, because it is of great interest that we should have contact with the other forces. The hon. member pleaded for greater military representation on the diplomatic level, but we are glad that our men do so well when they undertake courses. Whilst this debate is being waged at such a high level to-day, I also want to plead for something connected with the Defence Force. I want to start with housing. I want to express my thanks for the new points system which has been introduced and which will be used in allotting houses to members of the Defence Force. I hope that men with large families and senior officers will benefit from it. I have seen this list of points and I am sure that it will be to the benefit of the people who really have many years of service and who have comparatively large families. I want to express my thanks and I hope that there will be greater satisfaction as the result of this system by which houses will be allotted to members of the Force.</p>

<p>One realizes that much of the capital available for Defence to-day must be used to make provision for the expansion of our Defence Force, to erect buildings, to establish new camps, to have greater decentralization and to provide housing in those parts of the country where there is none. I realize, Sir, that that is necessary, but I want to point out that as the result of this more intensive training, some of these people have lost their houses. Many people had to vacate their houses because those quarters were required for this greater expansion. At Voortrekkerhoogte, in my constituency alone, 32 families had to vacate their quarters to make room for camps and other institutions as the result of the extended training. It is true that they were given other quarters, but the fact remains that the available accommodation was actually reduced. Although in recent times much has been done in regard to housing, there is still a shortage. I wish to express my thanks for the houses which were built. I am thinking, e.g., of the large number of houses built at Simonstown. A reasonably large number of houses were also built in Pretoria. In the last few years 89 of the wood and iron houses were replaced by new houses, for which we are very grateful, and that process is still continuing. At the moment, I understand, there are 26 houses which are in various stages of planning or construction. But there are still 178 of the old wood and iron houses dating from the period just after the Anglo-Boer War, the Milner period, at Voortrekkerhoogte. These wood and iron houses are no longer being repaired to-day; the costs are too great. They stand there and deteriorate and our people have to live in them as best they can. I want to say clearly that we are grateful for those houses, but many of them are no longer a credit to our Defence Force. They derogate from the status of our people, and I think we should, if possible, build houses more speedily. At Voortrekkerhoogte alone there are still 199 families living in these wood and iron houses to-day. Then I understand that there are still quite a number of them spread over the country. Furthermore, there are also a large number of families living in the so-called &#x201C;voetstoots&#x201D; quarters, the old military house used for the accommodation of soldiers during the last year. I should like to learn what the Minister&#x2019;s policy is in regard to this matter. These huts were allotted to members of the force, and they had to repair them themselves in order to live in them. They had to put up partitions; some had to install their own baths and stoves. Many of these quarters are also very dilapidated to-day. They are not being repaired and people sometimes live in them under the most undersirable conditions. This type of house is not good for the morale of our Defence Force. I hope that in view of the fact that a larger amount of money has been made available for the expansion of the Defence Force and for more training, the possibility of replacing these wood and iron houses will not be lost sight of and that an attempt will be made to provide a large number of houses for the Defence Force.</p>

<p>In this regard I also want to refer to an anomaly which I regard as being a serious one. It is that in the Defence Force the members of the force pay rentals on a scale different from, e.g., the police or the staff of the Prisons Department. I cannot understand why a common basis cannot be found for the payment of rentals by members of these three services. In the case of the Defence Force, they pay rental on the basis of their salary. In the case of the Police Force they pay according to the size of the house. I want to point out that this leads to a great anomaly. I want to give you a few facts, Sir, to show <span class="col_8197-8198" refersTo="page_1345"/>what a large difference there is. Take the case of a major. A major in the Defence Force pays R20 per month, irrespective of what type of house he gets. In the Police Force they do not pay according to rank or salary, but according to the size of the house. The highest rental paid in the Police Force for a ten-roomed house with kitchen, pantry and bathroom is R13.37. A major in the Defence Force pays R20 for his house. It goes up to R41. The policeman, for an eight-roomed house, pays from R10, and then it is a brick house. If this eight-roomed house is a wood and iron house, he pays only R7.57. As I understand it, that distinction is not made in the Defence Force. I think that is unjust and I cannot understand why there is this difference in the basis on which rentals are paid. It gives rise to dissatisfaction. The members of the Defence Force cannot understand why they have to pay rental on a different basis from the basis applied to the police and the prisons officials.

<p>On this occasion, when we are celebrating 50 years of the existence of our Defence Force, it is fitting that the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) should have drawn attention to what I believe is one of the underlying ideals which has made that Defence Force what it is, and that is the co-operation between the two language groups. On this occassion one&#x2019;s mind turns inevitably to those who served in the forces and the ideals they served. I think that now that we are starting a new half-century this is perhaps the appropriate occasion for the hon. the Minister of Defence to consider what lies ahead and whether the policy which we have always stood for, of ridding the Defence Force of politics completely by giving it a Defence Council, would not be one of the ways in which this Defence Force of ours could be made a truly national matter completely divorced from politics.</p>

<p>The same old story.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is not the same old story. I think that we are well on the way to getting a non-partisan and non-political approach to defence. It was not so before, but it is becoming so, and I want to ask the Minister to consider whether this is not the time to cement what has been done. I would also like to appeal to the Minister that in regard to the traditions of our Defence Force, he should go even further than he has gone now in preserving the essential traditions which are part of the morale of any army. I refer, e.g., to the right of a person to choose the unit in which he wishes to serve. I know that when individual cases are brought to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, more often than not those cases are met, but on the whole I am sure the Minister will find that if a freer choice of unit were allowed, if the traditional membership of a regiment passes on from father to son as it used to do, he will have even higher morale and an even better spirit amongst our regiments, because obviously a man who has gone to a unit of his own choice will be happier than a man who has been drafted to a unit, irrespective of his wishes. I do not want to go into details of what makes our traditions. The Minister will know. He will know the approaches that have been made to him by various regiments and the extent to which he has met them, and the extent to which he has not been able to meet them. I would like to say that the traditions of a regiment are something which do not carry with them any stigma. In other words, even though circumstances may change and conditions may change, and even though the approach of a country may change, a tradition does not lose its value to a unit because the attitude of people towards a name or a symbol has changed. I refer, e.g., to the names of certain regiments. &#x201C;Imperial&#x201D; forms part of some of those titles. &#x201C;Imperial&#x201D; to many people in South Africa has an unpleasant connotation, and for years the word has not been used. It has dropped away. The Empire became the Commonwealth, and yet that title attached to a regiment is part of the history and tradition of such a regiment, and it does seem unnecessary and petty to try to apply to things which are essential to the traditions of a unit the political connotation which those things have in other fields and in other circumstances. So I ask the Minister in his approach to these things not to look at a word or a symbol and say it has a political connotation, but to look at it in relation to its meaning to the regiment to which it applies, and to the people who for generations have served in that regiment, and to preserve those things as part of our military, as well as our South African, history. I am sure the Minister agrees with me, but he has drawn a line which often does not go far enough. He has left some things, but he has done away with others. I hope he will take the bigger view, which will enable our Defence Force always, in the minds of all people, to be part of the history which we look up to and respect. Dealing with traditions brings me to the question of morale in our units, and here I would like to ask one or two question. Can the Minister tell us what has happened in regard to the reopening of the officers&#x2019; messes and canteens, in regard to the change-over from dry messes back to allowing liquor?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but certain restrictions were placed on it, and I would like to know whether it is working smoothly. The Minister will remember that first of all liquor was abolished entirely, and then it was brought back under very stringent conditions, and was allowed <span class="col_8199-8200" refersTo="page_1346"/>only during certain hours, and strict conditions were laid down in regard to guests, etc.</p>

<p>It was very necessary.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it may have been necessary, but our officers are surely responsible people, and I am asking the Minister whether the relaxation has been satisfactory, and, if so, whether he is prepared to consider any further return to the old system which made of the officers&#x2019; mess a club, the place where the officers got together and felt at home, instead of forcing them out. [Interjections.] I know there were abuses, but I say those abuses could be controlled, and it is better that the officers&#x2019; messes and the canteens should be the clubs of the forces than that the men should be forced to go and drink in hotels.</p>

<p>Another point I wish to deal with is one which partly affects the Minister and partly the Minister of Justice, and that is the question of civil defence. The Department of Justice appointed Gen. George Brink some years ago to investigate and report on civil defence. Approaches were made to Defence and to the various municipalities, but it seems to have fizzled out into nothing. Our local authorities have not been advised of the outcome of the investigation. They have not been advised of the reception of the report by the Government, and I would like to ask the Minister whether, in view of the changing circumstances in the world to-day, he does not feel that civil defence should play a bigger part in the Department of Defence, rather than being merely an adjunct of Justice. I realize that it must cover both fields, the military and the civil, but, under modern conditions, war is total war, and, therefore, civil defence is as much part of a country&#x2019;s defences as its military defence. I would like to ask the Minister whether he will make a statement in regard to this question. [Time limit.]*</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Before making a few remarks on certain matters which the hon. member who has just spoken has discussed. I want to associate myself with those who have congratulated the Defence Force on its jubilee, but I want to go further than they have. I want to convey my congratulations to the <i>Burger</i> on the magnificent supplement which it published two days ago. I know that the staff of the Defence Force had to assist in the preparatory work and did not even have 14 days in which to collect all those facts and information. I think it is necessary that we should not only congratulate them, but that we should say that there should be more such supplements which will gain the interest of the public so that they will regard our Defence Force with greater goodwill but particularly also with the necessary pride, as a Defence Force of the Republic of South Africa. I am saying this because we now have a completely new phenomenon in our Defence Force, and I think it is evident because in all spheres there is far greater <i>rapprochement</i> and far greater confidence and co-operation in South Africa. In the past we often had the position that people were sceptical. They thought they were going to fight for another country because, rightly or wrongly, they regarded themselves as appendages to another country, but at the moment we have this phenomenon in South Africa, and for this reason I cannot agree with the hon. member for Durban Point (Mr. Raw) who has asked the Minister to put the Defence Force outside politics and to establish a Defence Council, because the Defence Force is outside politics. It is not in the service of any political party, but in the service of the Republic. I think we often see samples of this, in view of the fact that there has been a vast increase in the applications by young persons for admission to the gymnasiums and the fact that we now have a period where balloting is being applied and there are practically no complaints. We see that our young people are realizing fully that they are not a political factor or section, but that they are preparing themselves, under the present Government, under the present administrative control and in this defence pattern, to provide the necessary striking power for the defence of the Republic and not to serve a political party. I therefore cannot agree with the hon. member when he asks that we should place our Defence Force above politics and when by implication he wants to create the impression that the morale of the Defence Force is not what it should be. He has asked that we should go back to the old dual, watered-down division in the Defence Force, and he tried to link this to his allegation that the morale is not what it should be. I think that the morale of the Defence Force, not only now, but also in years past, and even when a different Government was in power, has been amongst the highest in the world. It has been recognized throughout the world wherever it has been used, as a force consisting of men of the necessary integrity and courage, and this is the position to-day as well.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another matter. I want to point out to the Minister that on the East Coast we have a vast area which is lying completely open. Portuguese East Africa has built a coastal defence road from Louren&#x00E7;o Marques to Oro Point, four miles from our border, so that they can patrol that whole East Coast with all necessary speed and can reach every point along that East Coast if necessary. When one sees what has happened with the Indonesian troops in New Guinea, one asks oneself what plans the hon. the Minister has regarding that area because here we have part of the Republic of South Africa which lies to the back of Swaziland and which is separated from the Portuguese area by the Usutu River. But downwards from Kosi Bay, four miles from Oro Point, almost to Matubatuba, that area is for the major part practically inaccessible &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_8201-8202" refersTo="page_1347"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not becoming a Bantustan. A commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. de Villiers, Undersecretary of Lands, was appointed to recommend how that area should be apportioned. This is a coastal area which we must take into account, and while we already have a national road which runs from Matubatuba up to Candover and later to Gollel, and while a tarred road is being built from this national road to the new dam wall being constructed there, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not think it is essential that the Department of Defence should make the necessary representations to the Transport Commission to lengthen that road in the first instance to provide access to Sordwana Bay and in the second instance so that the road will be extended from Sordwana Bay to Kosi Bay to join up in effect with the Portuguese road at Oro Point. The nearest areas from which lorries, etc., will have to be sent if they are required there are Piet Retief on the one hand and Vryheid on the other, but we still have the position that a certain area is completely inaccessible. I think that it is essential for defence purposes that our coasts should be accessible to the required road transport from the interior. I think we should go further; I think that somewhere in that area we should also mark out and prepare an airfield so that we can establish an airfield there if necessary, because we must bear in mind that we can have trouble from the East. I often ask myself whether we are not preparing ourselves at the moment exclusively to strike in Africa, to strike exclusively to the North, and whether we are not in this preparation possibly forgetting these other areas. At the same time I want to ask whether the necessary steps are being taken by the Defence Force to map every individual area, apart from the photographic map of South Africa as a whole, so that one can know when one goes to such an area what the topography is&#x2014;whether the soil is sandy, where there are rivers to be crossed&#x2014;so that it will not be necessary, when men have to be sent to a certain area, first to make the necessary preparations and to ascertain what steps must be taken so that the required force can be sent to a certain area with the utmost speed. I think we have not yet done enough to map South Africa properly. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) about our Defence Force over the last 50 years. Over that period we met triumph and disaster but never were we disgraced. There are no troops in the world whose name stands higher than the name of our troops.</p>

<p>In regard to the speech of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) I have only two remarks to make. One is that I do not think he has given any consideration to the effect of the Bantustan policy on our defences, and secondly he does not seem to realize that under this Minister&#x2019;s predecessor morale in the Defence Force was almost non-existent.</p>

<p>I wish to get away from that and I want to appeal to the Minister in regard to Commdt. G K. S&#x00F6;derlund, ex-O.C., Kimberley Regiment. Commdt. S&#x00F6;derlund is an English-speaking officer with a very distinguished record in the war.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>In this case I must point out that he is English-speaking, my reason for mentioning this fact will become clear to the hon. the Minister when I read out his letter. He joined up while at the University of Cape Town; during World War II he was an</p>

<p>S.A.A.F. pilot in the Middle East and with the R.A.F. in Burma. After the war he joined the Sixth Battalion of the S.A.R. &#x0026; H. Brigade and in 1957 became second I.C. Kimberley Regiment and in 1959 was made O.C. of that Regiment, altogether a very distinguished career. Sir, I want to read something out of the <i>Springbok</i>, the official journal of the South African branch of the B.E.S.L. with regard to this man. I quote from the issue of April 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kimberley Regiment Dismissal: O.C. demands inquiry: Commandant G. K. S&#x00F6;derlund, former O.C. of the Kimberley Regiment, who was &#x201C;bowler hatted&#x201D; without explanation, has asked for a Government inquiry into his dismissal. In a letter to the Minister of Defence, Mr. J. Fouch&#x00E9;, he suggests that &#x201C;misguided persons, acting on unfounded allegations, in a moment of panic&#x201D;, were responsible for sacking him. Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund, an English-speaking officer, was put on indefinite leave during the 1961 &#x201C;little emergency&#x201D;, and then stripped of his command. No reasons were ever given. Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund has had a distinguished military career lasting 20 years.</block>

<block name="quote">A number of public bodies including the city council, the Kimberley Regiment Association, and the combined Ex-Servicemen&#x2019;s Association, has protested to the Government. But their requests for an explanation have been ignored.</block>

<block name="quote">I became Officer Commanding of the Kimberley Regiment in August 1959, after having been appointed second in command in October 1957. When the Regiment was called out for the second or &#x201C;little&#x201D; emergency in May 1961 I was mobilized with the Regiment on the Monday and on the <span class="col_8203-8204" refersTo="page_1348"/>following Thursday at 9.30 a.m. I received a message from the Officer Commanding, Central Command, Colonel Odendaal, to phone him at 10 a.m. When I phoned him he first asked to speak to my Second-in-Command, Major Lubbe, and then informed me that I was to hand over my command to Major Lubbe and proceed immediately on indefinite leave. When I asked for a reason I was told that none was available. I then shot down to Parliament and arrived there on the Friday to see Jim Fouch&#x00E9;.</block>

<p>The letter goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I had an informal interview with him and gained the impression that neither he nor Commandant-General Grobbelaar knew anything about my dismissal. Anyway, Fouch&#x00E9; promised that he would investigate the position if I would apply for an inquiry through official channels. This I did. At this stage and until my final dismissal I would not comment to the newspapers, but the matter was raised in the Kimberley City Council and they and various ex-service organizations immediately telegraphed the Minister of Defence. None of them received replies until quite recently, but none of the replies to the City Council and the Kimberley Regiment Association gave reasons for my dismissal. On 20 June, Mr. Gay raised the question in the House but he too apparently got no reply, except that the Minister was investigating the matter. I received no reply at all until I received a minute dated 17 November 1961, notifying me that my services had been terminated on 11 November. On 1 March 1962, Major Lubbe was formally appointed my successor as Commandant. On 9 March, I again appealed to Minister Fouch&#x00E9; to either state the reason for my inexplicable dismissal or institute a court of inquiry into whatever allegations they held against me. Although I had always been known as a United Party supporter, I did not take an active part (a regimental tradition) in politics. All things considered it is quite obvious that only one of the following reasons can be responsible for my &#x201C;bowler hatting&#x201D;: (a) I am English-speaking. My successor is Afrikaans-speaking in an English-speaking unit, (b) I am a United Party supporter. It is well reported in Kimberley that at Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s final meeting in Kimberley, just before the last elections and whilst acting as Officer Commanding, my successor publicly announced at the meeting that he was now a Nationalist and actively supported Dr. Verwoerd. (c) I was a member of Unessa in its early stages. The Army were fully aware of this before I was appointed Officer Commanding. (d) An unfavourable report based on unfounded allegations were used by the local Security Branch. The Minister&#x2019;s steadfast refusal to give a reason makes one favour this as the reason.

<block name="quote">All sections of the community have worked on my behalf, including prominent Nationalists, and even Dr. Venter, our local Nationalist Member for Parliament, interceded on my behalf although, in view of the pending elections, he could not publicize the fact (and quite rightly so) lest it savour of &#x201C;vote-catching&#x201D;.

<p>On 5 April 1962, the Minister sent this letter to Commdt. S&#x00F6;derlund&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With reference to your letter dated 9 March 1962, I have to inform you that the reasons advanced by the Military authorities for the termination of your appointment have been accepted by me, and I am satisfied that no good can result from an investigation as requested by you.</block>

<p>Sir, I suggest that those facts speak for themselves. Here is an honourable man with a distinguished record who was sacked; no reasons were given. He is put in this position that his whole future is clouded. Sir, I am proud to say that I know this man personally. He has been on the national executive of the S.A. Legion of the B.C.E.S.L. for many, many years. In this magazine, the <i>Springbok</i> of December 1957, there is a photograph of Ken S&#x00F6;derlund delivering the unveiling address at the War Memorial in De Aar, which was erected &#x201C;In memory of all men who fought for their country&#x201D;. That is the calibre of this man, Sir. He is good enough to be asked by his comrades to perform a duty, a great and well-deserved privilege to a fine South African. To me it appears that in this matter the Minister has the choice of three courses. He can reinstate S&#x00F6;derlund, he can institute a public court of inquiry into whatever allegations were made against him or he can refuse to do anything further. Sir, if the things which are said about the Minister&#x2019;s sense of fairness are correct and if it is true that it is his earnest desire to remove from the minds of the English-speaking people the conviction that U.D.F. is the preserve of Nationalist Afrikaners and under Broederbond control &#x2026;</p>

He has an equally fine record in peace-time. He is removed from his command in the most humiliating manner that one can conceive. Sir, to me it smacks of another Dreyfus case. I hope the hon. the Minister will reconsider his position. This does not sound like the hon. the Minister. Many extraordinary things happened in the Defence Force under his predecessor; we all know about that and we all know that morale in the Defence Force was then at its lowest ebb. But that sort of thing has not happened under this hon. the Minister. Sir, this matter has now had great publicity and it has had a great effect on the morale of the men in this country. The story has appeared in full in the <i>Springbok</i>, in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, in the <i>Cape Argus</i> and in newspapers all over the country. Here is a man whose future happiness is tied up with the clearing of his name, a fine man with a fine record. Surely the Minister must see that and he must act in this matter. I always find it difficult to plead, but knowing Ken S&#x00F6;derlund as I do I plead with the Minister to re-open this matter and to give Commdt. S&#x00F6;derlund the right to know the reasons for his dismissal and the right to disprove them if they are false.</p>

<p>How times have changed! There was a time that hon. members opposite sat on the Government benches of this House. At that time the then Opposition also submitted complaints by members of our Defence Force to this House. The change to which I am referring is this: To-day hon. members opposite can air fully the grievance of a member of our Defence Force in this House and I guarantee that we who sit on the Government side to-day will not do what they did at that time and describe such a person as a &#x201C;skunk in uniform&#x201D;. [Interjections.] I give the House the assurance that anyone can come to-day with complaints and proper attention will be given to such matters. But we shall not describe a member of the Defence Force who asks a member of the Opposition to air his grievances here as a &#x201C;skunk in uniform&#x201D;. That is the change which has taken place, namely the change in the approach of this House towards complaints by members of the Defence Force. If a person approached the then Opposition and asked that his complaint should be aired in Parliament, he was abused.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I say it was not withdrawn. It is for the hon. member to prove it. In any case, I just wanted to refer to the change which has come about in the attitude adopted in this House towards complaints by members of the Defence Force, namely that while such complaints can be freely discussed to-day, persons who approached the then Opposition were vilified as &#x201C;skunks in uniform&#x201D;. It deterred the members of the Defence Force very greatly to hear that they were called &#x201C;skunks in uniform&#x201D; when they approached the then Opposition, namely the National Party, with complaints.</p>

<p>What I have actually risen to do is to tell the Minister that I wholeheartedly support his two speeches, namely the one at Pretoria and the other at Bloemfontein. The language he used there was the language which a Minister of Defence must use in the times in which we are living. If ever there was a time when the Minister of Defence has inspired and given the nation an infusion, then it was on the occasion of those two speeches. I have had few opportunities to congratulate a Minister on a speech he has made, but I cannot let this opportunity pass. I listened attentively to what the hon. the Minister said and my reaction was that this was the language and these the sentiments which give a nation self-respect and keep the morale of the man in uniform at the highest possible level. While I am now referring to morale, I want to warn the hon. member for Durban (Point) and his colleagues. A former member of the Opposition in this House, namely Mr. Horak, also referred disparagingly on a certain occasion to the morale of our Army and do hon. members know where he is now? He is no longer in this House!</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>He has been given promotion. The hon. member over there is the last person to point a finger at that Minister. The former Minister of Defence is a person who stands higher in the estimation of the people than the hon. member can ever hope to do. Hon. members opposite are careful&#x2014;they feel that something is coming and therefore I shall not castigate them. I do not want to castigate them because I see a great change in the attitude of the Opposition. This is the first time that a main Opposition speaker has spoken in such moderate terms as he has to-day. I actually ask myself whether the Opposition have been milked, they are so <span class="col_8207-8208" refersTo="page_1350"/>harmless&#x2014;just as an adder is harmless after it has been milked, that is to say after its poison has been removed. Similarly the main speaker of the Opposition looked to-day as though he had been &#x201C;milked&#x201D; because in the past he did not speak in such moderate tones. I want to congratulate him. I like to see, when we discuss defence affairs, that we should reveal greater responsibility than on any other Vote. The hon. member has once again asked the Minister for certain information to-day. The Minister will answer but I thought that while the questions he has asked are of importance to him, he as a former military man should realize that when certain information is given it is not only being given to him, but also to the greatest potential enemies to our country. Consequently, when we ask the Minister for information, we must do so with the utmost discretion, particularly when we ask questions relating to certain strategic matters such as the topography of our country with its coasts, rivers, mountains, etc. We must then be extremely careful because what is said here will go directly to our enemies. As a matter of fact, by so doing we give them a map setting out all our circumstances. Why is this necessary? What is said here after all does not stay here, and hon. members must realize that.</p>

The hon. member for Durban (Point) has referred to a tradition in our Defence Force, but the tradition to which he referred does not apply to the Army in general, but only to certain military units or commands. Now that we are a Republic and stand on the threshold of a completely new set-up in our military life, now that it will for the first time take a completely new character based on a South African model, we must try to get away from the tradition to which the hon. member, has referred and which has always been so deeply rooted in certain units.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I, too, should like to congratulate our Defence Forces most sincerely on the occasion of their 50th anniversary. This is of special interest to me because I am the only person alive of those who attended the first staff course at Bloemfontein 50 years ago which started the Permanent Force. There I attended the course with five Boer generals, including Generals Maritz, Kemp and Brand; and two English generals, namely Generals Tanner and Dawson. There all of us studied for six months as comrades. General Smuts, as the then Minister of Defence, opened that course and told us that the Defence Act was a most complicated measure&#x2014;so complicated, in fact, that he was sure not half the Members of Parliament understood it. That was the only reason why he could get it through Parliament! You see, Members of Parliament were not as sophisticated then as they are now! The Commandant-General of the citizen army was General Beyers and the G.O.C. of the Permanent Forces was Sir. Henry Lukin. The tragedy of the matter is this, that those who were then comrades, were fighting each other within a short while in the most tragic thing which has ever occurred in this country&#x2014;namely the rebellion officers who knew each other by their Christian or nicknames were fighting each other. My advice to our army, therefore, on their 50th anniversary, it to think only of the <i>esprit de corps</i> and to forget politics. Personally I never even voted during the period I was a professional soldier. Had anyone then told me I would one day become a politician I would have been horrified.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to say this. I wonder how many hon. members in this House today remember that at the time that staff course was instituted, South Africa had within its borders a British army of occupation whose professional experts were teaching us modem warfare, and that within a few years afterwards that army and our gallant soldiers were fighting shoulder to shoulder for the freedom of the world&#x2014;not only in France, not only in East Africa, not only in South West Africa, but throughout the world? As the last remaining member of the staff course at the start of our Defence Force, I should like most sincerely to congratulate the baby which in 50 years has growned into the magnificent Defence Force it is to-day.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>There are one or two matters which I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister in regard to his portfolio. The first point I should like to draw to his notice is in connection with the expansion of our military forces, particularly the expansion of the Air Force as such. I should like to ask the Minister whether he would consider the establishment of a civil air commando. Commandos are part and parcel of our military organization as a whole. In terms of the Defence Act, commandos are part and parcel of the military organization, and they have a specific function to carry out. I should like to ask the Minister whether he would not give serious consideration to the establishment of a civil air commando. As the hon. the Minister knows, representations have been made to his Department over a number of years by various pilot associations. As the Minister knows, the new extension of the commando system is, to a large extent, based on the use of personnel who have formerly had military training. If the Minister agreed to the establishment of a civil air commando it would mean that members who have retired will be able to use their training and their experience to train other men in these civil air commandos to fit in with the military aspect of the commando system as a whole. As the Minister also knows, the commando system is intended primarily for internal security. They are as much in need of air support as any other arm of the military services. Let me put this to the hon. the Minister. Civil air commandos could be used for patrol work in areas where there is need for security forces, for liaison work, spotting work, for light bombing work, and for the marking of military targets in areas where there may be trouble; they could also be used in regard to transportation, such as the carrying of stretcher cases, for doctors, nurses, etc. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister seriously to give some consideration to these representations which have been made over a number of years. Because, if those men who have gained their training and experience in the military field are not given an opportunity of continually putting that experience into practice, their experience will be lost to the country from a military aspect. The costs will not be too high, because, if the Air Force had to place three or four trainers at the disposal of such a commando in order to train a squadron, it would be of inestimable value if, in time of need, you could have the trained personnel for these commandos who could immediately be used in an active military capacity. Under the new system the men who are balloted receive this training as airmen on a full-time basis, and I do not think it is right that the civilian who has not been balloted should not receive that essence of military training such as we give to the normal commandos in regard to air training. I would ask the hon. the Minister whether he could not give serious consideration to that aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>On the question of the commandos as a whole, the Minister has indicated that he is reorganizing the whole of the commando system. There will now be Afrikaans-speaking commandos in the country areas, and commandos will be established in the urban areas which will be predominantly English-speaking. I would like to ask the Minister whether we cannot get away from this concept of either an English-speaking commando or an Afrikaans-speaking commando. Can&#x2019;t we simply have South African commandos irrespective of the language which is spoken?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) also raised that matter. I am considering it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand raised it in respect of our forces as a whole, but I am referring specifically to the commando system. In both the urban and the rural areas there are many thousands of South Africans to whom it does not make any difference whether they speak English or Afrikaans. So why draw this distinction? I would, therefore, ask the hon. the Minister to get away from the idea that the commando system should be based on whether the men are English- or Afrikaans-speaking. I appeal to the hon. the Minister in that regard.</p>

<p>There is one other matter which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister. If it is the policy to set up an effective defence system, an effective South African army, as we are doing now, the women of our country also have their part to play. The Minister&#x2019;s predecessor on one occasion stated that the Government were giving consideration to the establishment of women gymnasiums. Many conflicting views were expressed on that idea in general upon which I do not wish to go into <span class="col_8211-8212" refersTo="page_1352"/>to-day. But what I do want to say, Mr. Chairman, is that the women of our country, as in any other Western country, also have an important part to play in the defence organization. During the last war, Sir, many women played a very important part as technicians, for example, in the manning of our radar stations; they fulfilled many technical tasks, such as, for example, cipher work at defence headquarters, and in many other spheres. But the most important part which they did play was in regard to the medical services. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has given consideration in the general development programme of the Defence Department to the establishment of medical nursing services where the women of our country would be given an opportunity of playing their full part. I know it is the Minister&#x2019;s policy at the present time of using such organizations as the Red Cross and the Noodhulpliga as supplementary services. But the Red Cross fulfils a completely different function in time of war, so, I would imagine, in the case of the Noodhulpliga or any other organizations such as St. John, for instance. I feel that the women of our country feel that they are as much part and parcel of the general manpower of our country in regard to our defence services as the men. Will the Minister, therefore, consider extending the military medical services in establishing a definite arm where the young daughters of our country will have the opportunity of receiving training even in a part-time capacity in the general nursing services and the medical services? Can&#x2019;t they also receive a measure of training in cipher work and other technical training at defence headquarters as volunteers? They must volunteer for it; it must not be on a conscription basis as in the case of the men. If there are women who wish to volunteer for these particular arms of the service, the Minister should afford them the opportunity to do so by establishing such units. I would ask the Minister to give that suggestion favourable consideration.*</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, seeing that we are voting the largest amount we have ever had on a Defence Vote, we find the attitude of the Opposition particularly gratifying. I want to say that in the dangerous circumstances in which we find ourselves, we consider it encouraging to hear their speeches and to note their approach. I am referring particularly to the speeches made by the hon. members for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst), Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) and now the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) as well. I am sorry the hon. member for Green Point is not here, but I want to take this opportunity to thank him for the speech he made here last Saturday. I just want to add that we can say of the hon. member for Green Point: &#x201C;An old soldier never dies; he just fades away.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But I want to turn to the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross). The hon. member has the right to raise the case of Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund here. We find no fault with that. If he thinks that Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund has been unjustly treated, then it is his duty to raise the matter here, nor do we have any objection to his reading the personal correspondence of Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund to this House. But, Mr. Chairman, what we do object to is the scornful and uncalled for remarks which the hon. member made at the end of his speech when he said that the dismissal of Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund bears out the fact that commanding posts are being kept for Nationalists and members of the Broederbond. Such a remark is not worthy of the hon. member for Benoni and he should be ashamed of having made such a remark. He also knows that such a remark is not true. The hon. member and I know most of the commanding officers, and I can point out to him commanding officers who can scarcely speak Afrikaans and who we know are supporters of the United Party. But they have been appointed to commanding posts. I want to refer the hon. member to the list of officers who received decorations at Ysterplaat on Saturday. I do not know whether the hon. member was there; I do not know whether he knows what their names were. I do not want to read the list to him, but I have it here. We can go through this list and see who received decorations on that occassion. Just as many English-speaking persons were decorated as Afrikaans-speaking persons. Why must the hon. member use this Defence Vote as an opportunity to engender racial hatred? No, Mr. Chairman, I think the behaviour of the hon. member is scandalous. I want to tell him this. He is one of the members of the United Party for whom we still had a measure of respect, because he is one of those members who took up arms for his convictions; unlike so many of the heroes opposite who have never crossed the Limpopo, except perhaps to tour the Federation. We respected him for the fact that he was prepared to join the Army out of conviction. But if the hon. member intends persisting in this type of attitude and in sowing racial discord in our Army, where it does not belong, then he deserves the contempt not only of this side of the House but of the House as a whole. I hope and trust that the hon. member will cease this type of remark. I hope and trust that after his speech, the hon. the Minister will see fit&#x2014;whether it is in the interests of that officer or not&#x2014;to reveal all the facts as to why that officer was dismissed. I hope the hon. the Minister will see fit to do that. I do not think there is any better proof of the incorrectness of the hon. member&#x2019;s submissions than the celebrations held during the past week. The events of the past week have shown that there is unprecedented unity in our Defence Force. I think it is fitting. Mr. Chairman, that I should read this independent opinion&#x2014;if we can call it independent&#x2014;which appeared yesterday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To-day the South African Army has achieved a greater peacetime strength than ever before in its history. Well armed, well equipped and well organized, it is being <span class="col_8213-8214" refersTo="page_1353"/>steadily built up with expanding training schemes for the young men of the country. In an unsettled world armies are a necessary precaution and South Africa can take considerable pride from the fact that for a so-called small country it has a large and efficient force.</block>

<p>This was yesterday said by a paper like the <i>Sunday Times</i> which is not very well disposed towards us. Here is evidence of what the actual position of the South African Defence Force is. The hon. member for Benoni has now sown suspicion and claimed that the commanding and important posts are merely reserved for Nationalists and members of the Broederbond. I think it is a scandal.</p>

<p>We know that every soldier also has his political opinions, and is also entitled to his political opinions. We also know that in the past it was difficult for many soldiers always to agree with the actions of every Government. But we can say this of the South African soldier, namely that irrespective of his political opinions, he has always been loyal to the Government of the day. I have men in mind such as, for example, the previous Prime Minister who in 1914-18 did not agree with the war policy. I am referring to the late Advocate Strydom. But because at that time he was a member of the Defence Force he did his duty. I am referring to people like the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) and others who did their duty. Hon. members opposite must understand that it was not nor is it easy for those people. I could mention thousands who fought in the Second World War of 1939-45. For this reason we want to appeal to hon. members opposite not to refer scornfully to people who perhaps acted differently during that period, people whose political convictions were perhaps stronger than their convictions as regards defence.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that it is a gratifying factor for us to think that if there should be difficulties, during which the South African Defence Force will be called upon, there will not be political differences because if we read the signs of the times correctly, then we expect the Defence Force will be called upon to take action against Communism. And we want to give the assurance that the whole South African Defence Force and also the whole South African public will be united in their actions against Communism. Mr. Chairman, if a threat should emanate from the Afro-Asian States as a result of our internal policies for dealing with our internal problems, then I feel that the Defence Force will be united in its actions and that there will not again be political differences which will make the position of the Defence Force difficult. I therefore want to conclude with this thought. The attitude of the United Party Opposition during this debate has been gratifying to us with the exception of the attitude of the member for Benoni, and we hope and trust that speakers who will still participate in this debate will contribute not to disparaging our Defence Force, not to throwing apples of discord into our ranks, not to raising language questions as matters which can eventually cause suspicion amongst the members of the Defence Force, but that we shall act in such a way that it will be easy for every member of the Defence Force to show that loyalty and allegiance to South Africa which we know the members of the Defence Force genuinely feel.</p>

<p>Many of the speakers who have taken part in this debate, have prefaced their remarks by offering their congratulations to the hon. the Minister on the 50th anniversary of the Army in South Africa. I as a representative of the Coloured people, would like to associate myself with those congratulations and to remind the House and the people of South Africa of the gallant part which the Coloured people have played in all the wars in the defence of South Africa. We are all too prone, Mr. Chairman, to forget the Coloured people when we talk about our Army. I do not intend to refer at great length to what I again describe as the gallant part they have played during the First World War and during the Second World War in all aspect of defence of what we call democracy. That they fought in vain for certain things that they believed in is not the subject of discussion in this debate. But it is quite evident, Sir, that the large amount which we are now asked to vote indicates that the Minister and the Government intend to have a strong mobile Army in South Africa. I think I am entitled to ask what part will the Coloured people play? I do not want to embarrass the Minister. I know he has certain ideas; whether they are military secrets at this stage I do not know. I think that the Coloured people are entitled to know, particularly as they, notwithstanding what anyone else may say, regard themselves as part of this nation. And if South Africa is in danger, these 1,500,000 Coloureds are also in danger, and I believe that it is unfair to expect 1,500,000 people in time of danger to be completely unprepared for the defence, if not of the White people, of their own people. They can be used right now in certain branches of defence. If the Government for political or other reasons feel that they should be excluded from being armed for taking part in certain aspects of our defence, there are other aspects and other work they can do. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) spoke about women being trained. The Coloured women should also have the opportunity of being trained. We must not forget the Coloured people in this great effort of building up a strong Army for the defence of South Africa, because it is their country as well as ours, and I want to say to the Minister that despite the political set-up in this country, the Coloured people want to play their part. I am sure that the hon. the Minister is sympathetic. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) took exception to the fact that some hon. members said that the morale of the Army was rather low, but I think we can say to the Minister <span class="col_8215-8216" refersTo="page_1354"/>that he has built up the morale and that it is now high, and I agree with the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) that we must keep politics out of the Army. We must be determined to keep politics out of the Army, and if we do that the Coloured man will also be considered, as a citizen of his country. We cannot permit this debate to go by without making some reference to the Coloured people and the part they have played in the past, and to express the hope that the Minister will soon see fit to consider what part they can play. I do not believe it is right and fair that they should be completely ignored in all aspects of defence, because if danger comes it comes to them as well, and they want to defend the country as well as the White man. I hope we will have some statement from the Minister in regard to this matter. I do not want to take up more time. If there are other aspects I have not dealt with, it is only because the time is limited.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) will forgive me if I start off by replying to the speech made by the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl). I want to thank him heartily for the friendly attitude he has adopted. He mentioned the fact that he was the sole remaining member who took the first staff course. I just want to tell him that the other day at Pretoria Sir Pierre van Ryneveld sat next to me and after the display he said to me: You should introduce an order service for those men who have rendered long and loyal duty to the country and that should entitle that person to call himself &#x201C;Oom&#x201D;. [Laughter.] Seeing that we have no such order, I trust you will allow me, Sir, to refer to the hon. member, not as the hon. member for Green Point but to tell him that I trust we will still have &#x201C;Oom&#x201D; Piet with us for many years.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand raised 15 matters of importance to which I must reply. He tabulated all the points clearly and if I replied in detail to every one of them, it would take a great deal of time. First of all, the hon. member expressed his sympathy with the families of the men who were involved in the accidents over the past few days. I thank him for that. It is a tragedy when a young man loses his life. It is a double tragedy when a young man, who is willing to prepare himself to defend his country, loses his life in such a way. I am pleased that he has expressed his sympathy.</p>

<p>The hon. member and many other hon. members congratulated us on the birthday of the Defence Force. I accept that. I only wish those people who may perhaps be harbouring unpleasant ideas in their minds about South Africa could have been in this House during these few days to see the unanimity which exists in regard to the basic principles concerning defence. Naturally we differ on minor matters, but we are unanimous as far as the basic principle is concerned. I also wish to point out that we have had wonderful support from the public during these festivities. There was a wonderful attendance at Bloemfontein the other day, when it was a fine day. The attendance at Pretoria was a revelation and I am really grateful to the public for its support. It is very clear to me that the Defence Force is beginning to develop into the pride and the future hope of the people of South Africa. I attended a parade in Switzerland last year in which 4,000 non-commissioned officers marched; their Minister of Defence invited me to attend the parade. When I stood with him on the platform I really felt jealous. It was clear to me that the people of Switzerland formed a unit with their Defence Force. The pride on the faces of those who marched was a revelation, particularly the pride on the faces of the thousands who stood there and cheered them on. I have set myself the duty of once again building up the public in South Africa and the Defence Force into a unit. It seems to me that with the assistance which I am getting from both sides of the House and from my senior officers, we are attaining success.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that more should be done to bring the Defence Force to the notice of the public. Of course it is necessary to do that, but I want to say that I do not believe we can do more than we are already doing to bring the Defence Force to the notice of the public. We receive hundreds of invitations&#x2014;last year there were more than 500&#x2014;for the Defence Force to appear at certain places and the position is getting out of hand and we consequently decided on a fixed programme where the Defence Force would appear. It is being done systematically. Divisions of the Defence Force take part in public functions on occasions which have been decided upon beforehand. Members of the Defence Force, particularly members of the military orchestras, travel thousands of miles annually to perform at public functions. They bivouac throughout the country where the Defence Force is brought to the notice of the public. The Defence Force take part on all important occasions and give demonstrations. I think of the wonderful demonstration which was given at De Brug in 1960. I do not think the Defence Force can be brought to the notice of the public in a more splendid way than is being done at the moment. Celebrations were held throughout the country this year and the Defence Force was brought to the notice of the public on a reasonably large scale. I agree that that must be done; but my contention is that we are indeed doing so.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that our Air Force demonstrations were excellent and that the men in our Air Force were of the best. I just want to ask this question: If the men in our Air Force are so good, what reason is there on earth why the men in the other arms of the Defence Force should not be equally good? Of course, the hon. member formerly belonged to the Air Force and I can well imagine that his heart gives an extra beat of pride when he sees the Air Force but I can assure him that all three branches of the Defence Force are of the <span class="col_8217-8218" refersTo="page_1355"/>same standard and if he believes that somebody who joins the Air Force will not have such an easy time, that person will for the same reasons not have such an easy time if he joins any one of the other sections of our Defence Force.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that too little was known about the acts of bravery that were committed by our men during the Second World War. I might just say that it is difficult to keep individual acts of bravery alive in the mind of the nation. That is somewhat difficult; even when the names of those men are recorded in history, because people do not read about it every day. We still hear episodes of bravery which were committed during the war but that is in the form of anecdotes that are handed down. We have our publication <i>Commando</i> and I think it will be a very good idea if an article on acts of bravery during the war could appear from time to time in that publication. Something like that will encourage our people and inspire our young men and that will mean a great deal to our country and to our Defence Force.</p>

<p>As far as our internal security was concerned, the hon. member said he was fairly satisfied that the State would be able to maintain order. I just want to say to the hon. member that where he feels happy about the ability of the Defence Force to maintain order he is in good company. An article appeared about South Africa in the French paper <i>La Horizon</i> in which the writer said various things; <i>inter alia</i>, he said that in the military field the country was independent. Its Defence Forces and Police Forces were so strong that they would probably be able to meet any internal or external threat. That shows that even overseas people are realizing that our Defence Force is reasonably strong. The hon. member said that in the event of a world war we could play an important part. I agree; we can make a big contribution but I want to add that it is our duty to make a big contribution. The Western world is seriously threatened by the communist world and that position can only be handled by the combined efforts of the West in time of war. The time is past when one state could shield behind his neighbour. It would be an act of betrayal on the part of any Western nation if he did not at this stage develop his defence force to the fullest extent. We must accept the fact that if the West were to go under, that would be the end of us and of our way of life. For that reason we must do everything in our power to build up an independent Defence Force so that we can play our full part in case the strength of the West is put to the test. We in South Africa accept it that we are of geographic value to the West, but that is by no means enough. We should also make whatever physical contribution we can for the maintenance of the West. The West is already spending far too much money in an effort to gain friends. It is all very well to try to get every part of the world on to the side of the West, but I believe that in these difficult times in which we are living, it will be far better to know who is on the side of the West. I believe that in these days it is essential that every individual Western state should prepare itself to the utmost, but I also believe that it is essential for the West to make a joint effort to make every individual state as strong as possible. I want to tell the hon. member for North-East Rand that in order to make this contribution we are, of course, building up our Defence Force in all possible spheres. We first of all tackled the question of manpower and we are giving our young men a much better training than they received in the past. I have already said a great deal about that and I do not want to repeat it. He asked me about the numbers. During the last war 300,000 Whites took part in the war effort and since that time South Africa has progressed. Our potential is over 250,000. We are training our young men and we are preparing our reserves more than in the past; in general we are getting our manpower in order. In addition we have improved upon our weapons. We have provided the land forces with the most modern guns and machine guns. We have purchased large supplies and we have the right to manufacture those things in this country and we are already doing so. New divisions have been established. We have built up our supply of ammunition on a very large scale over the past two years. I wish to report to the House today that as far as our supply of ammunition is concerned, we are reasonably well supplied. I, as Minister of Defence, feel reasonably happy as far as that is concerned. We have also bought the best weapons which are available. I want to tell the House this morning that I am not prepared to reveal the nature of the weapons we have purchased before those orders have been executed or are on the point of being executed. It is simply an agreement that no mention should be made of the orders which have been placed with the various countries but once those orders have been executed it can be revealed, it would be farcical to continue to keep it secret after that. As far as our land forces are concerned, we have also purchased the most modern armoured cars available and we have also acquired the right to manufacture them. The first car has already arrived. It was dismantled, tenders asked for and a start will shortly be made to manufacture it in South Africa, if they have not already started with it, and a great number will be delivered during the course of the year.</p>

<p>As far as the Air Force is concerned, that has been extended enormously. We have purchased modern aircraft for the Air Force. We have the French helicopters. We already have a few squadrons of them. We have placed orders for the most modern transport aircraft. We hope to take delivery of the first consignments within the foreseeable future. We have also purchased the French Mirage III. We conducted an investigation. A team was sent overseas, and I myself went there&#x2014;not that I understand anything about aircraft but I had advisers with me and we eventually decided to buy the Mirage III. The NATO countries <span class="col_8219-8220" refersTo="page_1356"/>use them. Those planes are generally recognized as the best fighter planes in the world and the price is such that we can afford them. Seeing that the hon. member for North-East Rand is interested in our pilots I can just tell him that when I was in France where they build the Mirage III, they showed me the plane and I said that the thing was so complicated that I wondered whether anybody would ever understand it. The person looked me up and down and said: &#x201C;What? a month ago we had three of your men here and after a 20 minutes&#x2019; lecture on the ground, they got into the planes and every one of them went through the sound barrier twice. You know, Sir, you have pilots.&#x201D; Look how heartily the hon. member is laughing now.</p>

<p>We are smartening up our fleet so that it will be equipped with the most modern equipment possible. I must admit that there has been a disappointment. When we purchased those ships, the President ships, they should have been equipped in a certain way, to chase submarines, but because submarines have changed their techniques, very big alterations must be effected to our ships and that costs a great deal of money. However, we have decided to effect those alterations so as to make them effective. We have decided to modernize the other two ships, the <i>Jan van Riebeeck</i> and the <i>Simon van der Stel</i>, because they can be put to very useful work in the changed circumstances. A few years ago we thought they could no longer serve any purpose, but with the changed submarine technique, they can be used very effectively and I am very pleased that we did not sell them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Are they being sent overseas?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>No, we are effecting the alterations here. The hon. member for North-East Rand said that prior to the war we had batteries and radar stations along our coasts and he wanted to know whether they were still necessary. I can just tell him that during the last war we used them to defend ourselves against a conventional attack. But that conventional war is by no means over. We cannot ignore the possibility of an attack with conventional weapons and that is why we still require them and why we are still using them, because there is still a need for them. In all circumstances of warfare an inspection battery will always be necessary. Some of our defence units are being trained to operating them. The hon. member also said, as well as the hon. member for Turffontein, that they did not like the idea of English-speaking commandos and whether we would not at this stage change over to bilingual commandos. My reply is that hitherto we have had our English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking regiments but only Afrikaans-speaking commandos. At the moment all the ballotees receive their training in both languages. All our regiments are, therefore, being strengthened by bilingually trained men. In four years&#x2019; time, therefore, our Defence Force will consist of men who have been trained in both languages, and only the reserves will be unilingual. The question which arises is whether we can change over to bilingual commandos at this stage. Can we at this stage cause confusion by telling all our commandos that they must be bilingual? That is unthinkable. That cannot happen. It will cause the greatest confusion imaginable. As far as the new commandos are concerned, my conscience and my way of life does not justify my saying that we have English-speaking regiments and Afrikaans-speaking regiments, we have Afrikaans-speaking commandos, but we do not have English-speaking commandos. Furthermore we must remember that our commandos will be strengthened more and more, particularly the urban commandos, by people who have undergone prior military training. How can we expect the English-speaking people in Natal and elsewhere, elderly people, who received their military training through the English medium suddenly to respond to bilingual orders? I think it is clear that we will reach the position where our armed forces will receive their training in both languages and that we should not be in too great a hurry. Let me first have an opportunity of establishing English-speaking commandos. Young men are allotted to our commandos. Within the foreseeable future they will consist of young men who have been trained in both languages, and then the time will be opportune to introduce bilingualism. In his objective speech the hon. member for North-East Rand touched one matter of a personal nature and that was the case of Captain Campbell who would have gone overseas on an artillery course and all arrangements were cancelled a day or so before he was due to leave. Allow me to say that I have nothing whatsoever against Captain Campbell. I and my officers regard Captain Campbell as a first-class soldier, but we are living in dangerous times and it is essential that I send as many men overseas at this stage to undergo training in modern warfare as possible, and at the present stage I literally have hundreds overseas, men belonging to both language groups. It was brought to my attention, however, that it was very doubtful whether Captain Campbell would remain in the Defence Force. It was brought to my notice that it was very doubtful whether he would complete his career in the Defence Force and I had reason to believe that that was the position. Had we sent him overseas on that course and had he decided to remain there and to join the British armed forces, he would naturally have refunded the money which we had spent on him but at this juncture it is not the money that we need but the trained man. Because it was such an important course, I decided to send somebody else in his place, somebody whom we were sure would continue with his career in the Defence Force. The hon. member himself said that Captain Campbell had now resigned which proves that he did not seriously intend to continue with his career in the Defence Force. My information was correct, therefore. I have nothing whatsoever <span class="col_8221-8222" refersTo="page_1357"/>against Captain Campbell as a person and as a soldier.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) expressed his satisfaction with the new system of granting points in regard to the allocation of houses. I only hope that the new system will give rise to greater satisfaction than the old system. The system has already been changed from time to time but because we cannot provide everybody with a house, any system will affect somebody adversely. We have now introduced this new system and I wish to express the hope that we will be more successful than in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted to know what our policy was in connection with the &#x201C;voetstoots&#x201D; houses. As the hon. member knows, when anybody moves into a &#x201C;voetstoots&#x201D; house, he undertakes in writing to vacate that house when it is required for military purposes. With the expansion in our training programme we are requiring a greater number of those houses for the men in training and that is why some of those people have to vacate those &#x201C;voetstoots&#x201D; houses. An amount of R750,000 appears on the Estimates this year for the erection of married quarters over and above the money which was not spent last year. We are, therefore, providing houses, but if you asked me whether I was satisfied with the speed at which we were providing housing, Sir, I would unfortunately have to admit that I was not very satisfied. We are making tremendously big financial demands on South Africa at this stage for the expansion of our Defence Force, and we will see whether we can place greater amount on the Estimates next year for housing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) said he thought the time had arrived for us to establish a Civil Defence Council. The hon. member gave different reasons. The one reason was that we would keep defence out of politics in that way. Mr. Chairman, I know the Opposition feels very strongly about this question of a Civil Defence Council. But I really cannot see the necessity for it. We have our Defence Resources Council, a council which consists of prominent businessmen, technicians, etc., who give us guidance as to what we have in the country and what can be manufactured in the country. We have our Defence Research Council, a council which consists of technicians and which guides us in respect of the research which has to be carried out in the military field. We have our Defence Staff Council which determines our defence policy as such and we have our General Staff. We have so many councils that they really fulfil all our needs and I cannot see why we should have a Civil Defence Council at this stage. [Interjections/! Yes, the Defence Act empowers me to establish one but at this stage I see no necessity for it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that we should allow people to choose their own regiments but surely we cannot allow that. To some extent they do have the right to-day to choose the unit to which they want to belong, but we must retain control. You know what the position was during the last world war when so many men chose certain regiments that the balance was completely upset, so much so that we had to tell people which regiments they should join. That is still the position to-day. What will happen if all our men wanted to join the Air Force? No matter how good the Air Force is, they will cut a sorry picture if they have to fight alone. We must retain the right, therefor, to designate people to certain regiments.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that it was detrimental to the morale of a regiment to change its name and he pleaded for the retention of the word &#x201C;Imperial&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have the greatest respect for the traditions of a regiment, but I think we are exaggerating the importance of this question of a name. Has the morale of the Pretoria Regiment suffered because the name of that regiment has been changed from time to time and not by us? Has the morale of the Kimberley Regiment suffered because they were formerly called the Diamond Field Horse? Did the morale of that regiment suffer because its name was changed on various occasions? Did the morale of the Prince Alfred Guards suffer because they themselves changed their name on various occasions in the past? So did the Queenstown Rifles. There have been changes of names in the past and it did not affect the tradition of those regiments in the least; they have retained their traditions in spite of the change in their names. I think we are exaggerating this question of the change of name. Remember, the names of all Afrikaans regiments have been changed. I really think that I have been as reasonable as I could be in the case of the changing of the names of the English-speaking regiments. It was necessary here and there to effect a change. I decided that we could no longer have an Imperial Light Horse. We should remember that we have two national groups in South Africa. We are trying to unite those people and if there is one word which leaves a very bad taste in the mouths of a very big section of our people, it is the word &#x201C;Imperial&#x201D;. I did not ask the Prince Alfred Guards to change their name; it was not necessary. That is the name of a person. I only asked the Imperial Light Horse to change their name to the Johannesburg Light Horse. I do not think hon. members must force me to give in on that point.</p>

<p>Sir, I have a very responsible position to-day. On my shoulders rests the responsibility for the security and welfare of our people. I have to carry the Defence burden to-day, and I have done everything possible to keep politics out of Defence. But I must insist on the absolute carrying out of orders. On 27 September&#x2014;and hon. members will remember that that was a very dangerous period for South Africa; I had to be very careful and the Government had to be very careful&#x2014;on 27 September 1960 orders were issued for the safekeeping of rifles for issue to the Citizen Force Units. This order entailed the transfer of rifles to cells at South African Police stations, where they could be guarded. In Kimberley they had the rifles in the Drill Hall without any guards whatsoever at that time. The order was given on 27 September. By 29 September two other units who had received similar orders simultaneously reported &#x201C;Orders carried out&#x201D;, yet, by 4 October 1960, Commdt. S&#x00F6;derlund&#x2019;s regiment had not yet implemented the order, and he told us that he did not have transport. Sir, fancy not having transport in Kimberley to carry out orders of that nature. The safekeeping of firearms is so important that I insist on the proper carrying out of orders, especially at a time like that. I do not care whether the person concerned had a fine record; that was a failure to obey an order, and I cannot condone it.</p>

We have considered it, and we have decided not to go on with it at the present moment. We have a great deal to do to build up the defence of the country. I know that it will be a valuable asset, but we can do more at the present moment with the money available, and for the present we are not contemplating the establishment of a Civil Air Commando.</p>

Then the hon. member expressed his disapproval of the fact that the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) had tried to spoil the admirable spirit of the Committee in the way he did.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) has asked what the role will be of our Coloured people during the next war, or rather what the role of the Coloureds will be in building up our Defence Force. I just want to say at this stage that I appointed a committee last week with the instruction to go fully into the question of the establishment or re-establishment of the Cape Corps. I also feel that the Coloured people have an important role to play in the defence of South Africa, even if it is not in a combative capacity. This matter is being investigated and I hope that we shall be able to make provision on the next Estimates for the re-establishment of that Corps.</p>

<p>May I just put two questions to the hon. the Minister before he resumes his seat? The first relates to the question which I have mentioned of pensions for members of the Permanent Force who are compelled to retire at an early age. In the second place I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can tell us something about the long distance maritime aircraft?</p>

<p>As regards the question of pensions for members of the Permanent Force who have to retire at an early age, I want to tell the hon. member that I am beginning to consider very seriously whether our men are not retiring at too early an age. I shall give my attention to the matter and of course to the question of pensions as well.</p>

<p>As regards long-distance maritime aircraft, I want to say here to-day that in our efforts to help the West in the case of a world war, it is absolutely and urgently necessary that the striking power of our Navy should be increased. We are not only thinking of maritime aircraft of the type that we have, but we are also very seriously considering increasing the striking power of our Navy by the use of aircraft. I can give the hon. member the assurance that this question of maritime aircraft is receiving our serious attention at the moment.</p>

<p>Now that the hon. the Minister has made this statement regarding a committee which he is to appoint to investigate the question of the Cape Corps, my speech will be much shorter. While the hon. the Minister is investigating this matter with a view to taking some positive action, I want to ask whether the hon. the Minister will not instruct that committee at the same time to investigate the establishment of a type of cadet movement in our Coloured schools, which will also provide basic training, and particularly to give Coloured youths a knowledge of discipline. I am especially glad the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs is present, and seeing that he has already announced that Coloured education will be taken over next year, I think the time has come for the hon. the Minister of Defence to consult him on this matter. I think he will readily agree that it is most essential to inculcate a sense of discipline into our Coloureds. I do not ask at this stage that such a system should be applied in all schools, but I think that the committee will probably be able to recommend that a start should be made in selected schools. It will have a tremendous psychological effect as regards the co-operation of the Coloured people in the sphere of defence.</p>

<p>As the oldest member in this House I should like to associate myself with the sentiments expressed here by the hon. member for Green Point (Major van der Byl) regarding the excellent spirit prevailing here. As one of the first officers of the Middellandse Regiment and later as Chief Commandant of No. 2 military district, I feel the time has come that we should put aside our past differences so that we can continue to build up the Defence Force with the retention of the spirit which exists to-day. After all, the Defence Force belongs to all of us. I want to thank the hon. the Minister for what he has done in the Defence Force and also to convey the good wishes of all our people to him. I also want to pay tribute to certain other people with whom I have been closely connected. The first is my brother who gave his life during the Anglo-Boer War as a rebel. Furthermore, I want to pay tribute to Sir Japie van Deventer, my cousin, and General Dirk van Deventer, and I also want to associate myself with the tribute which should be paid to Captain Nortje, my nephew.

<p>I just want to thank the hon. the Minister very much for the statement he has made regarding the retiring age and the question of pensions and also for the thoughts he has expressed regarding maritime aircraft. I do not want to detain the Committee for long. I just want to say a few words about Messrs. Campbell and S&#x00F6;derlund. The Minister has told us that Campbell was taken off the course at the last moment because the Minister had reason to believe that Campbell would complete the course and then resign and join another Army. The Minister, of course, knows more about that aspect of the matter than we do, but the reason why we have objected is this: Notwithstanding all the attempts he made, Campbell could not <span class="col_8227-8228" refersTo="page_1360"/>ascertain why he was taken off the course at the last moment. He, of course, denies most emphatically that it was his intention to resign, but let us leave that on one side. The attitude of this side of the House is that when such a matter arises, the person concerned should be told frankly why action is being taken against him and then he will have no complaints.</p>

<p>I then return to Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund. The Minister is perhaps quite correct but S&#x00F6;derlund is in exactly the same position as Campbell. I think that he has heard for the first time to-day why he has been deprived of his command. We have no fault to find with that if he did not obey orders, but I suggest that when a person does not obey orders, the military discipline code is after all there; he can be brought before a court martial, or if the authorities consider the offence was not serious enough, he can simply be told what the reason is for his discharge. We should very much like to know why these two gentlemen were not told at the time what the position was. Then we would have had no complaints and no criticisms.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) is an old military man and he knows that in many cases one cannot reveal certain information. If we were to tell certain officers why we are dismissing them and we do not tell others, then we would immediately create the impression amongst the public that the officers who have not been given the reasons for their resignation have committed a most serious offence. In the Defence Force it is difficult to tell officers why they are being dismissed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has said that he cannot reveal the reasons for the dismissal of officers. I want to submit that it is now more necessary than ever before that the reasons should be made known. There was a justifiable suspicion in the past that some sort of snooping was going on and that stories were being told against which the persons concerned never had the opportunity to defend themselves. We want to eliminate that possibility. For that reason it is essential, when something to the discredit of an officer or a member of the ranks is uncovered, that he should be told; &#x201C;Look, there you went wrong.&#x201D; Here we have these two cases and these people have not been told what they have done wrong.

<p>It is in the best interests of the force that the reasons should be given to the persons concerned. They need not be given in public. They can be given the reasons in private. Here we have the case of Campbell who has resigned. I do not blame him for resigning because he was under a cloud amongst his comrades. They begin asking themselves why such a man has been dismissed and they perhaps wonder whether he is a communist. The suspicion is there, and it could all have been avoided. Well, that matter is over and done with and the harm has been done. I just hope that when such cases arise again&#x2014;and there will be such cases; it is always happening&#x2014;that the Minister and his officers will have the courage to give the persons concerned the reasons for their dismissal. Do not leave them under a cloud and place them under suspicion amongst their comrades and the public outside.</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I want to join the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux) in welcoming the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement regarding the committee which has been appointed and the investigation which will be instituted into the question of re-establishing the Cape Corps. Seeing that over the past few days we have been commemorating the jubilee of the Defence Force, it is a pity that that investigation was not carried out previously. I am not reproaching anyone, but one would have liked to see the Coloureds also playing a part in the celebrations. Over the past 50 years, since the establishment of the Defence Force, our Coloured fellow-citizens have participated in two world wars and they have acquitted themselves admirably. They have a proud record and they have played an indispensable part in the record of our Defence Force during two world wars. The matter I should like to bring to the interest of the Minister is that which the hon. member for Karoo has also raised. We know that we have school cadets in our White schools. We have never had such a system before in the Coloured schools. But from place to place, even in the smallest towns, there are voluntary organizations which are usually known as the Church Lads&#x2019; Brigade or the Boys&#x2019; Brigade. These are voluntary organizations and the instructors are volunteers who devote their time to these brigades. It is clear and sociologists will support me when I say that these organizations over the years have done extremely good work by keeping young Coloured boys and even girls busy and by keeping them off the streets on Saturdays and Sundays because then they are usually marching and giving their displays. I have had the privilege of attending, by invitation, and even addressing quite a few commemoration day meetings at various places. Usually it is the Boys&#x2019; Brigade which takes part in the march-past and the Mayor of the town who takes the salute. It is striking to see what those people have achieved over the <span class="col_8229-8230" refersTo="page_1361"/>years on a voluntary basis in order to keep their people busy and to teach them discipline. From place to place there is usually a Coloured ex-serviceman who has had the necessary training and who acts as instructor. This is an essential service which is being provided. The children are being trained and just as we find in the case of cadets in our White schools, they develop a pride in their uniform, They are taught how to wear uniforms and how to care for them. In the nature of things they are also taught elementary drill movements and how to form up. To a large extent this is after all one of the main objects of our school cadet system and it was noticeable during the war years when thousands of people had to be trained, that the men, who in their school days had been school cadets, at least knew their left from their right foot and did not have so much difficulty with the basic training.</p>

<p>But as I have said, it also serves another purpose, because in a city like Cape Town and the smaller towns and cities throughout my constituency it keeps the children busy, particularly in view of the fact the the poorer section of the Coloured population do not have the sport and recreational facilities which the Whites have. Apart from the fact that they are taught discipline and develop a pride in their uniforms and appearance, they are kept off the streets on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>

<p>In this regard I have something in mind which I should like to recommend to the hon. the Minister It will not be at all difficult to implement because as I have said there are from place to place ex-servicemen with the necessary experience and who by means of a refresher course could be given a little additional training or be brought up to date so they can act as instructors. What I want to urge strongly is that the hon. the Minister in co-operation with the Minister of Coloured Affairs&#x2014;because these organizations also serve a social object and this aspect of the matter falls under the Minister of Coloured Affairs&#x2014;should consider whether the existing organizations cannot be paid a subsidy in respect of their uniforms and other equipment. These things cost money. In most places they already have their own orchestra. Perhaps it will also be possible to let people who received Army training 20 to 25 years ago undergo refresher courses so that they can act as instructors. Let us regard this matter in the light that these organizations can initially be used as a basis for the school cadets which I hope we shall still have.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I think that anyone who knows our Coloured people and the matters I am discussing, will agree with me that these organizations are serving a very good purpose indeed. I should like to see uniformity being introduced and the State providing assistance so that this matter can be placed on a basis where there will be supervision by the authorities. I was told during the week-end on good authority that the State President of South Africa is at the moment the patron-in-chief of one of the Boys&#x2019; Brigade organizations. If he sees his way to being the patron of these organizations, then there is something good in them. I have also been told that the State President of to-day was also a member of such a Boys&#x2019; Brigade in about 1902, when there were not yet school cadets, and he therefore knows full well what such a system means.</p>

<p>Every good patriot appreciates the importance of the effectiveness and mobility of his country&#x2019;s defence forces for the safeguarding of his country against internal disturbances and the defence of his country&#x2019;s borders against aggression from outside. We who represent platteland constituencies know that on the platteland there are people who are not always fully familiar with the growth and development of the Defence Force of our State and people. It is encouraging to listen to the information given by the hon. the Minister about what is being done in respect of defence, and about what is still envisaged in connection with the modernization and development of our country&#x2019;s defence forces, including our sea and air defences. I should like to convey my thanks to the hon. the Minister, the Commandant-General of the Defence Force, Commdt.-Gen. P. H. Grobbelaar, and the Department of Defence for what they have done in my own constituency, that is to say the establishment of a defence camp. The placing of a large number of officers who will live there permanently will mean a very great deal to Zeerust. Eventually 800 recruits will receive their training there. It will not only mean a great deal to Zeerust, but also to the defence of our country in general in view of the strategic location of this camp as regards our northwestern borders. We are convinced that the sound training of our young men will increase the striking power of our Defence Force.</p>

<p>We also want to convey our particular thanks to the defence chiefs concerned for the fact that they have devoted one full day of the jubilee celebrations to a small town such as Zeerust. From 9 in the morning to 6 in the evening the Western Command gave a display with &#x00E9;lite infantry, armoured and even mounted units. The mock battle by the Mobile Watch assisted by paratroopers and three Sabre jets was impressive. I am mentioning these matters just to support a statement made by the Commandant-General on one occasion, namely that when a cold war hots up and real war breaks out, it is not only the Defence Force of one power which fights against the Defence Force of another power, but then it is the people of one country who are in a state of war with the people of another country. Then the Defence Force is really merely the arm of that particular nation. When the morale of a nation there is high, and when it is defence-conscious, then the war machine will work best because the people will keep the home front as it should be and <span class="col_8231-8232" refersTo="page_1362"/>will provide the support and inspiration to the men on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Displays such as those which have taken place in recent days and such as that which we saw at Zeerust on Saturday and which were attended by the most senior officers of the Defence Force, the Secretary for Defence, etc., and the opening of camps such as that at Zeerust which are attended by Cabinet Ministers (in the case of Zeerust it was Minister Hertzog) make a tremendous impression on our people on the platteland. It also makes our people feel like the lady in the story which I have heard in my part of the world. The story is that one day, this lady was walking nervously up and down the platform of the station. The station master asked why she was so anxious and whether he could help her. Did she perhaps want a ticket or to take a certain train? She then said: &#x201C;No, Sir. My son has also joined the &#x2018;laventel force he has been given a uniform and today he is going to Cape Town. I am here to bid him farewell.&#x201D; She said this with a shining face. I am telling this story merely to show how proud even the simplest parents can be if their children can play a part in the building up of a strong Defence Force for the sake of their fatherland.</p>

<p>The opportunity for us in South Africa to establish a united front as regards defence matters is better to-day than ever before. In the past there were too many conflicting elements. The Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking peoples never thought alike in time of war. For that reason there was bitter strife and conflict. Now the establishment of the Republic has removed those differences and for that reason we to-day can act with greater unity. The Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking parents who opposed one another in the past and who did not think alike as regards the participation in the war effort of their country, can now feel that they have one fatherland and one allegiance in common, that they are one White people which must establish the machinery for defending their fatherland and that they must support their Defence Force with their sons and daughters and their material resources.</p>

<p>As regards the training camp which has been established at Zeerust. I just want to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that the private airfield there will be used to an ever-increasing extent in future by the Air Force. I therefore want to recommend that the Minister should consider tarring the runway. The soil is of a slippery texture and in rainy weather heavy aircraft may experience difficulties. The Town Council of Zeerust has offered to provide all the gravel and crushed stones required for this purpose. A tarred runway would be more efficient for military use.*</p>

<p>I am also speaking on behalf of many other members who have received similar requests from their various constituencies. We are not trying to divest ourselves of this problem, but we consider that this is a matter of importance. Under sub-head P of the Defence Vote, on page 242 of the Estimates, I notice that during the financial year 1961-2 an amount of R240,000 was allotted to cadets. For the year to which these Estimates relate, that is to say for 1962-3, however, the amount remains the same, namely R240,000. We must therefore infer from this that there will be no extension of school cadet detachments, but that they will remain constant, that is to say there will be 403 detachments for Army cadets, 24 for Air Force cadets, and 9 for naval cadets. I realize that with a view to our large defence programme and expenditure, every rand and cent are required for important items, and that it is not because the school cadets are regarded as unimportant that more funds are not being set aside for them.</p>

<p>It is at least necessary that, as regards the future, we should keep one or two matters in mind and that greater attention should be devoted to the training of our youth. The first cadet detachments were originally established for military reasons. To-day, however, we know that they are almost entirely of an educational nature, and that they fall partly under the Department of Education and partly under the Department of Defence. From a purely educational point of view, we know of the particular characteristics and qualities which our children who enter cadet detachments acquire. I just want to mention one or two of these. There is, for example, self-discipline. One need only look at such children to realize what degree of self-discipline can be achieved amongst these young boys. Another characteristic which is developed is that of leadership. We can never have too many nurseries for leaders, but here is one of them. In addition, there are self-confidence, smartness, neatness, etc.</p>

<p>Even when seen from a military point of view, these detachments also have elements of value. In the first place they create interest in the Defence Force. An elementary knowledge of our Defence Force is provided to the children and at places where Defence Force exhibitions are never held, the children serve to convey to their parents pride in the Defence Force. But even more important is the <span class="col_8233-8234" refersTo="page_1363"/>knowledge of firearms which they acquire as well as the ability to handle firearms. Our ladies are already organized into clubs with the object of learning how to handle firearms. But on the other hand there are some of our boys who go throughout their school careers and even thereafter without any knowledge of firearms.</p>

<p>When we analyse the small amount which has been set aside for the cadets, then we find that it only represents .2 per cent of the total expenditure on defence. But from this .2 per cent we are getting very good dividends in the form of the excellent characteristics which we are inculcating in our youth. And if we can increase this amount slightly, let us say to .3 per cent of the total expenditure on defence, then the dividends will be correspondingly greater.</p>

<p>I ask whether it is not possible to establish cadet detachments at all high schools. I do not know what the total number of cadets would then be&#x2014;however, I estimate that there would be approximately 80,000&#x2014;but the additional expenditure involved would not be so great that it would be impossible to establish such detachments at all high schools. Difficulties may be experienced as regards rifle ranges, but here I think that schools should be prepared to have rifle ranges built with their school funds. If so, the Defence Force will not need to do so. If cadet attachments can be established at all high schools, there will be an opportunity for our children to learn how to handle firearms. And we must not leave our daughters completely out of reckoning. I do not want to argue that they should be organized into units or do practical drilling, but they can be trained in civil defence and first aid to great advantage.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will regard this matter as I do, namely as one of importance and that he and the senior officers of our Defence Force will see their way clear to making the necessary funds available for this educationally and militarily important section.</p>

<p>I should like to bring some further facts in regard to Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund to the attention of the Minister. I understood the Minister to say that the order for the handing over of firearms and rifles to the police, was given at the end of September 1960 and was not carried out until some days afterwards. There can, of course, be no defence for a man who does not carry out his duties. He should then be fired, I agree, but he should be told why it is being done. The unfortunate position in this case is that although the alleged misbehaviour or misdemeanour&#x2014;or whatever it might be called&#x2014;occurred in September 1960 it was not until May 1961 that Commandant S&#x00F6;derlund was sent on indefinite leave, i.e. only seven months afterwards. If the matter was important enough to justify his being fired, then surely he should not have been left in command for a further seven months? There can, therefore, be no shadow of doubt that this man is entitled to the inquiry which he is calling for, even if that inquiry is a court martial.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that to-day is the last day of service of the Commissioner of Police, Brig, du Plooy. I should like, therefore, to congratulate him on a very distinguished period of service and to say that I am convinced that all members of this House will agree with me when I say that his period of service as Commissioner of Police has been one which ranks high and that he has unquestionably acquitted himself of his task with very great distinction. He has earned the gratitude of all for his devotion to duty and for the quality of service he has rendered to the country. We all wish him a very happy and useful retirement. We should like, at the same time, to express the hope that those who follow in his footsteps will service the country as well as he did.</p>

<p>I am glad that this is not an occasion when, during a discussion of the Justice Vote, we have to refer to other unhappy events of a similar nature as those which formed the subject of debate during the Justice Vote for the last two years. I refer to matters arising out of the emergency which existed in the country at the time. I speak on behalf of all of us when I say that we are glad that nothing of this sort has occurred during the past year. Consequently, it will be possible this year to deal with a very much wider range of subjects than was possible on previous occasions because the matters to which I referred then took up a lot of our time. As I said, we all are happy that there has not been a repetition of such events this year and that the country has been in a much more peaceful state. I propose to refer to quite a number of matters, some of which are more important than others, in relation to the Minister&#x2019;s portfolio.</p>

<p>First of all, I should like to make an appeal to the Minister to see to it that the annual Report of his Department for the year immediately preceding the consideration of his Vote, is available when that Vote comes up for discussion. I notice that the Report of the Department in respect of 1960, which became available only fairly recently, was completed very much earlier. It was actually signed on 16 March 1961. The Report is reneod and there appears therefore to be no reason why the Report should not be available to this House by the end of the first quarter of this year. It will be so much better if this debate can take place on the basis of a Report which is up to date. The very fact that the Report for 1960 was signed by the middle of March indicates that it could have been made available for the discussions on the Minister&#x2019;s vote last year.</p>

<p>Secondly, I should like to pay a tribute to our courts and to our police. We are proud of our courts. There are no courts in the <span class="col_8235-8236" refersTo="page_1364"/>world maintaining a higher standard than both our superior and magisterial courts in this country. We can well be proud of the really magnificent services which they have rendered. In regard to our police, who form a vital part of justice, I should like to say that we are proud of their services over the year. I am happy to say that on this occasion there is far less to criticize. There is a much happier state of affairs. It appears that a greater degree of selectivity has been maintained in regard to the engagement of recruits. I am grateful to say that it is my sincere belief that there has been a distinct improvement in the general standard of our police during the last few years and that there has been far less black sheep in the family. I hope things will continue that way because in a country like ours, with the problems which we have to face, it is absolutely vital that we have only men of the highest quality in our Police Force. In this connection, I repeat it can be said that there has been a distinct improvement.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the report of the Van Winsen Commission. I believe the report has been submitted and I hope it will be published soon. It deals with the question of uniform rules. I am of the opinion that it is high time that we have uniform rules for the supreme courts in this country. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us something of this report and that it will not be long before we have such uniform rules. The country also awaits with interest the report on the reduction in the costs of litigation. This is something of great importance and we all look forward to seeing what suggestions have been made.</p>

<p>There is another matter which is of topical interest and to which I should like to draw attention. Some time ago, I put a question on the Order Paper in regard to a report in the Press in connection with the occassion of the tour round the coast of the delegates of the law societies. This particular Press report relates to the occasion when the Minister refused to attend a function because non-Whites were to be present. He then told me that hon. members could raise the matter on his Vote. That I want to do now, and at the same time to say to the Minister that I should like to see him reconsider the attitude he adopted on that occasion. In a country such as ours, occasions of that nature are inevitable and I believe that we must face up to that. I also believe that no good is done to the name of South Africa if we adopt the attitude which the Minister adopted on the occasion in question. It is a matter with which the Minister should deal and, consequently, I do not propose to press it any further now.</p>

<p>Next I should like to deal with a number of matters falling under the various Departments administered by the Minister. I understand that will be in order as it is convenient, when discussing a matter under the Justice Vote which is also related to the Prisons Vote and the Police Vote, to refer to the two latter-mentioned Votes at the same time.</p>

<p>First of all, then, I should like to refer to the annual Report of the Department of Justice. The report is comprehensive. It deals with a large number of matters, not in great detail, I must say, but it does touch on the question of magistrate&#x2019;s courts. I believe that a very heavy duty rests on any Minister of Justice. The position in the case of very many of our inferior courts, that is the magistrate&#x2019;s courts of our country, is that our magistrates are conducting their duties in premises which are utterly unworthy of such an important section of our justice set-up in this country. I know improvements may have been made but an enormous amount remains to be done. In case after case that I know of the conditions in various of the courts&#x2014;as other hon. members can testify&#x2014;are utterly unsatisfactory. For instance in my own constituency of Germiston I regard the magistrate&#x2019;s court there as a disgrace for the sixth largest city of the Republic. It is high time even for the Government to encourage private enterprise to come into the field and to have a real campaign to ensure that justice is being done in premises which are worthy of our system of justice.</p>

<p>Before I go on to deal with detailed matters, there is one other question which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister. Some of our legislation has been amended during the sitting of this Parliament namely the Suppression of Communism Act and other legislation which follows that pattern. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>With reference to what the previous speaker has said about the function which the hon. the Minister attended and, to which Coloured attorneys were not invited, I should like to express one or two thoughts. The first relates to the development of the Transkeian territories. I understand that it is the intention to establish a supreme court in that area, to serve that area because the Transkei will become a state with a certain measure of self-government. This state will probably also have control over its own judicial system, and this will result in the establishment of their own supreme court. I want to ask at once whether the time has not come for consideration to be given in this same regard to the establishment of a separate law society for non-Whites in South Africa, and of course a Bar Council as well. Just as there is a Bar Council and a law society for Whites, I urge that there should be a separate law society for the non-Whites. It is most necessary in this regard. Then those attorneys will also be able to practise amongst their own people. The tendency amongst them at the moment is apparently, as soon as they are admitted to practise, always to go to the White areas and to practise amongst the Whites. In this same regard I also want to ask whether the time has not come for the hon. the Minister to investigate whether there is still place in South <span class="col_8237-8238" refersTo="page_1365"/>Africa for four law societies, and whether the profession should still be on a provincial basis; and whether it is not high time that it should be placed on a national basis. There is an advisory body, on which the law societies meet. But its resolutions must be absolutely unanimous, and I now ask whether the time has not come for consideration to be given to the establishment of one single law society for the Whites in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not asking for new legislation. I am only asking whether this matter cannot be investigated. Whether there will be legislation later on is another matter. The hon. the Minister may find that legislation is not necessary at all, and I am therefore merely asking for an investigation. Such action can probably only be taken after an investigation; it cannot simply be done out of the blue, and I think a detailed investigation will have to be instituted.</p>

<p>If the law societies are to be investigated, then the question also arises of what role the non-White attorney should play in this regard. Should he or should he not be a member of the White law society: or should he have a separate law society of his own? As matters are now developing in South Africa, for example as regards the development of the Bantu areas, I foresee that a separate law society for the non-White attorneys who will practise in those areas will be established. This of course also applies to the advocates. "There will have to be a Bar to act for example in the supreme court of the Transkei. The legislation will of course be discussed next year and I should like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s policy in this regard is.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal with a specific matter. It relates to the arrest, detention and punishment of a youth called Victor Mvula at Port Elizabeth. I deal with it on the strength of information made available to me by welfare societies of Port Elizabeth. In reply to a question raised by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) as to whether the Minister would order an inquiry into this matter, he replied:</p>

<p>The inquiry revealed that the report was exaggerated.</p>

<p>I can only say that if there was an inquiry into the circumstances of the case it must have been a very perfunctory one. The circumstances which I will outline, will indicate to the Minister, I hope, that they warrant a far more serious consideration of the whole incident by the Minister and his Department. The published facts are that the boy was arrested on the afternoon of 18 January for not being in possession of a reference book. He was detained that night in the police cells and brought before the court the following morning when he was sentenced and caned. According to the mother, Sir, the boy is 16 years of age. He had gone on an errand on which she had sent him that afternoon accompanied by a friend and she did not see him again until the next morning &#x201C;when I saw him walking with a group of persons in the new law courts in Adderley Street, under the supervision of a policeman. They went into one of the court rooms. I had certain papers with me to show that Victor was still at school but I was not allowed to go into the court room. A policeman promised to hand the papers to the Native Commissioner&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x201C;A policeman promised to hand the papers to the Native Commissioner&#x201D;. That is her statement. I am not concerned with the merits of the matter in the court itself. In cases of this kind the court, of course, only sees the person while he is in the dock which is usually for a very brief period. The police, on the other hand, have the individual under observation from the moment of arrest until he is ultimately released. I would, therefore, make my representations in regard to this matter from the police point of view. The first matter I want to deal with is to ask the hon. the Minister why a boy of 16 should have been arrested in this way instead of being warned and secondly I will deal with the corporal punishment aspect. My first question is this: Why arrest a boy of this age, place him in a police cell, when his attendance could obviously have been procured by the statutory process of warning. Let me remind the hon. the Minister that in 1959 the Criminal Procedure Act was amended to allow for attendance at court by persons by means of warning instead of arrest. That procedure, as the hon. the Minister will know, is to be found in Section 309<i>bis</i>, the section which was inserted in 1959. When that amendment was under consideration the Minister who was then dealing with the matter specifically indicated that it was necessary to cater for what he called &#x201C;small crimes and technical offences&#x201D;. He indicated that the intention was to keep that type of offender out of detention. I would like to quote what he said (Hansard Vol. 99 col. 1053)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first step should be that the police <span class="col_8239-8240" refersTo="page_1366"/>man, before arresting a person, should find out whether the person concerned is a loafer or a decent Native in service. Then he can find out who the employer is and in that way try to keep the man out of prison. He can serve the document on him, and if we lose him again it would be a pity, but probably we&#x2019;ll get him again.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister what steps have been taken to implement this undertaking given in this House by his predecessor? Is any provision made in the Police Standing Orders for this procedure to be followed? Because here we have a case which, on the face of it, is a very clear case of what was called a small crime or a technical offence in which an arrest had seemingly taken place unnecessarily. My second question is why the standing orders in regard to the infliction of corporal punishment on a person under 21 years were not observed. It is clear from the information available and also from a reply which the hon. the Minister gave in this House, that the boy was not examined by a medical doctor before he was caned and that a medical doctor was not present while he was being punished. The hon. member for Houghton asked these questions and in the case of both the reply was &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Where the court has ordered corporal punishment the Police Standing Orders are quite specific about it. They lay down that the person must be examined by the district surgeon before the cuts are inflicted and if possible he should be present. If there are circumstances which make it impossible for the district surgeon to be present then either a commissioned officer of the police must be there to satisfy himself or otherwise the commanding officer of the station must be present. The infliction of corporal punishment ordered by the court is not intended to be brutal. The standing orders make it perfectly clear that there must be observation by some person such as I have mentioned, preferably the district surgeon, because if he considers that the punishment should not be continued with he is entitled to stop it. In fact, he is obliged to stop it if there is any cutting of the skin. That is in terms of Police Standing Orders. It is quite obvious that in this case those instructions were not observed. The boy was not examined, according to the Minister, and the detailed information which I will make available to the Minister, the photographs in regard to the corporal punishment&#x2014;I do not want to exhibit it here, but I will make it available to the Minister&#x2014;show that some form of inquiry was necessary in this case. These photographs I refer to were taken some 25 days after the offences was committed, and the mother and also the schoolmaster make it quite clear that there was brutality in the infliction of the punishment in this case. The boy was severely cut and for ten days, the evidence is, he could hardly walk and could not attend school. I feel that the Minister dealt with the matter somewhat perfunctorily, because the circumstances I have outlined indicate that the matter warrants closer examination both by the Minister and his Department. The standing orders make it quite clear that the parent is entitled to be present when punishment of this nature is inflicted, and again, although the mother was available at the court, she did not attend the infliction of the punishment. Although she does not claim that she was denied admission when the punishment was inflicted, she obviously was not there although she was at court. I wish therefore that the Minister would give consideration to the suggestions I have made and make it quite clear what steps are being taken to ensure that the standing orders are being applied, and secondly, that he will make it quite clear why in this case there is this breach of the observation of the standing orders, particularly the breach of not stopping the punishment once it was found that it was inflicting excessive punishment. I am not concerned with the merits of the matter, but this is certainly a case which fell within what the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor said the warning was for, and obviously the intention is that once the infliction of the punishment is found to be brutal, the official in attendance can stop it.</p>

<p>I want to raise one other matter with the Minister which arises out of the Ganyile case, which extended from August 1961 to February 1960. There has been wide publicity in regard to the way the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings were handled by the court of first instance. The unsatisfactory features connected with those preceedings were ultimately set right by the Supreme Court. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>We could all tell a lot of stories about where people have conflicted with the law. I do not want to follow the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) in that regard, but I should very much like to bring something else to the notice of the hon. the Minister, namely what I would describe as the congestion of magisterial work in the large centres. What normally happens is that a person is arrested. Within 48 hours or at the next sitting of the court he is brought before the court and his case is then postponed; an order for his detention is obtained; and the reason for the postponement is that the case must be further investigated. It may be that further investigation is required, but often the programme of the court is so full that a court is not available or a magistrate or a prosecutor is not available, and the case is then postponed once again for three weeks. When it comes up again, it is postponed once again. It has happened in the case of the Pretoria magistrate&#x2019;s court that people have waited up to six weeks before being tried. This is an undesirable state of affairs. Although such a person does not come into contact with convicted persons, the convicts, he may nevertheless be in the company of people who have been convicts and who are awaiting trial and they are exposed to the pollution of a criminal atmosphere. It is undesirable, apart from the consequent deprivation of his liberty. It happens that such a person is found <span class="col_8241-8242" refersTo="page_1367"/>guilty or that he is a juvenile and is then given strokes. He is nevertheless exposed to that atmosphere and it is undesirable. The solution here&#x2014;I am not asking for additional expenditure, but I am asking that there should be additional mechanical apparatus made available for the hearing of witnesses and the recording of the evidence. I see under sub-head L that there is an increase on the amount made available last year for interpreting and the mechanical recording of evidence. I am very glad that there is an increase. This year the amount is R150,000 and last year it was R118,000. One magistrate with such mechanical equipment can do three times as much work as he could do in the past.</p>

<p>But this is not the only solution. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that in the larger centres the magistrates&#x2019; courts are &#x201C;cluttered up&#x201D; by traffic offences and a large portion of these are parking offences. I know that we have nothing to do with the parking regulations nor with the provinces&#x2019; right to grant municipalities the power to control traffic; but I think we should move with the times. The whole parking question has developed along such lines that the municipalities to-day are leasing parts of their streets for 2&#x00BD;c or 5c for a fixed period. I have no objection against that. I think it is a very good practice, but under the guise of traffic control they are leasing parts of their streets, and it is a lease, even if it is not worded in those terms. If that lease is contravened, criminal sanctions ensue and I think that is quite wrong. I think the Minister should take up this matter with the provinces and point out to them that they themselves should institute their own prosecutions and pay their own prosecutors, and we can perhaps provide a magistrate. However, we can do something far better. I want to suggest an old remedy which the Cape Provincial Council had discovered and started to use but which is very well-known in all the large centres of Europe. It is that if someone parks for too long in a parking space or should not be there at all, the authorities take the car away and impound it. This is an old remedy which is applied in the case of the impounding of trespassing stock. I want to give the assurance that if the Cape Town Municipality for example were to establish a pound beyond the market at Epping, and one of us who has over-parked or were to have his car impounded and taken there, and he had to go and fetch it with great difficulty, he would only do so once. And if Pretoria, Johannesburg and other large cities were to do so, the traffic officials, who, at the moment, are writing out tickets all day, could do more useful work. [Interjections.] The Minister asks how many vehicles would be needed to tow those cars away. Very few. For the whole London metropolitan area they do not even have 100, but they are very effective and quick. They just lift up the undercarriage of a car and take it away. We can tell the manufacturers of motor-cars that they must provide a master key for all their motorcars, so that they can be unlocked.</p>

<p>This may sound ridiculous, but I can give the House the assurance that there would be very few traffic offences of that type. The magistrates&#x2019; courts would have no such cases, whereas to-day they have 600 to 800 per week. Just think of the trouble and inconvenience which a person will experience when he has to fetch his motor car from the pound. It is a summary cure. Hon. members may say that it is a clever trick, but it works quite well in other countries.</p>

<p>What I want to submit to the Minister is, in the first place, that we should try to introduce greater efficiency into the work of magistrates&#x2019; courts by the increased use of mechanical means to record evidence, and, secondly, the need for a conference with the municipalities to impress on them that when they enter into leases and lease parts of their streets, it is quite wrong to attach a penal sanction to such leases, because what they are actually doing is that they are masquerading as the controllers of traffic, while they are nothing but the lessors of parts of their streets.

<p>I think the suggestion of the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) may make traffic problems worse instead of better. But I want to come back to the Ganyile case, where I indicated that the unsatisfactory features about the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings had been set right by the Supreme Court. I accept that the Minister has also taken other steps which will obviate a similar occurrence in that Court. Therefore, I leave that aspect of the matter there. But the standard of police work in the case was far from satisfactory, and the events reported in the Press have left, in my opinion, an unfavourable image of the Police Force as a whole, which has not yet been properly explained or cleared up satisfactorily. I raise the matter now in order that an opportunity can arise for the Minister to explain it properly and to clear up the position. The wrongful arrest of Ganyile and two other men in Basutoland by the S.A. Police took place on 26 August 1961, but it was not until 21 December 1961, nearly four months later, that Ganyile was brought before the court.</p>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) in that I should like to wish Gen. Du Plooy, who goes on pension in the near future, a very pleasant retirement. I am probably one of those in this House who has known him longest, not in his capacity as police officer, but we worked together for many years in the sporting world, and I speak from my heart when I wish him a very pleasant retirement.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the annual report of the Secretary for Justice. On pages 4 and 5 he refers to the fact that the collection of debt causes many difficulties in the magistrates&#x2019; courts. He says that since 1917 the legislature has made at least seven attempts to solve this problem, and he then mentions a case when an amount of R9.52 was claimed by a creditor, of which R8 had already been paid before judgment was given against the person concerned. After the judgment, further steps were taken, and eventually the R1.52 which was still outstanding totaled, together with the costs, R46.19. This report was issued in 1960 and signed in March. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether, since that time, any progress has been made towards repealing Section 65 or replacing it with something better, as suggested in the report of the Secretary. That is all I want to say about Section 65.</p>

<p>Then I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister and to ask him that this report by the Secretary for Justice should also be printed. It is a roneoed report; this report is distributed to the public, and it does not create a good impression when one of our most important departments submits a report which is roneoed. All other departments provide us with a printed report which looks much neater.</p>

<p>I should be very glad if the hon. the Minister would instruct the Secretary to have this report printed.</p>

<p>Then I should like to come back for a moment to my own constituency and to ask the Minister whether it is not possible to erect a police station in a constituency which has more than 15,000 voters. I am certain that this is the only constituency in the Republic which does not have a police station. The reason of course is that there are such law-abiding people in my constituency. [Interjections.] My colleague on my left says that his voters keep an eye on my voters. But these people are continually in my constituency and it has now become necessary for a police station to be established in that heavily populated constituency.</p>

I am convinced that if it were to depend on them, no police station would be required. This has also been the position in the past and that is why there was no police station. Mr. Chairman, I am in earnest when I ask the Minister to give attention to this matter. Recently there were burglaries in various parts of the constituency, and when the central police station was contacted, they said that the police station at Capital Park, which is not in the constituency, should be contacted. By the time the complainant had contacted the police at that station, the burglars had long since disappeared, and I think that it is most essential that attention should be given to this request which I have made.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) dealt with the congestion in the courts. I would like to say that this is a subject which has worried the attorneys for a long time. I would like to say to the Minister that there is a remedy, and that is the decentralization of courts. By that I mean that in Cape Town you cannot have a large <span class="col_8245-8246" refersTo="page_1369"/>magistrate&#x2019;s court dealing with cases from, as far afield as Maitland and other places. I do believe that the time has arrived when there should be full-scale magistrates&#x2019; courts established in the outer areas to relieve the congestion in Cape Town. I do not want to go again into the facts mentioned by the hon. member for Standerton, but I think he is correct.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that. If the Minister agrees with me then I will not pursue this matter except to say that in many cases it entails hardship for an accused person to have his case postponed from time to time, not through anybody&#x2019;s fault. I do not want to give the impression that there is not full co-operation from the staff at the courts; I know that the prosecutors do their very best to try to complete cases as soon as possible but circumstances simply do not enable them to do so. I want to make this point too for the Minister&#x2019;s consideration that policemen themselves who have to come from outlying areas to Cape Town find it very difficult, from the point of view of the time factor. I did privately mention to the Minister what the position was when we had a court at Wood-stock. In those days the police and detectives were at the building next to the court and they could continue doing their work while the court was in session, and they were called to the witness-box as soon as they were required. To-day they have to go away from the station and come into Cape Town, thus wasting their time.</p>

<p>I want to deal too with the point raised by the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) in regard to the Secretary&#x2019;s Report at page five dealing with Section 65. I would ask the hon. the Minister to go very seriously into the procedure under Section 65 dealing with the recovery of debt. If the Minister has already done something about it, then, of course, I will not say anything more, but I want to say that the procedure is cumbersome and very expensive, as this case shows.</p>

<p>The Minister knows that civil imprisonment, as we used to have it, was called a barbaric system, the system under which we put people in gaol for debt, and for that reason the Government felt that an attempt should be made to devise another system which would not make it so difficult for a man to pay his debt and, of course, to try to reduce the chances of his going to gaol. But I think the cure was worse than the disease, the cure being the present system that was substituted for the old system. I think that we will have to go back to the old system which was less expensive. I want to say that I was articled in the same office as my hon. friend here, the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). We dealt with thousands of cases of debt collection and we hardly caused anyone to be arrested. If you make the fee small in regard to civil imprisonment you will find less abuse. It is because the fees are far too high, in my opinion, that people are prone to institute action for the recovery of debt and to make a business out of it. I believe that there should be a minimum charge and then you will find that there will be less abuse. I believe that there is far too much abuse in the collection of debt.</p>

<p>Yes, under the present system. I think the procedure is far too expensive and that it takes far too long. I think you have to issue about three or four different processes. From my personal experience I believe that the system is too involved, too drawn out and too expensive, with no results. If a man does not want to pay his debts then I am afraid you cannot make him pay under the present system. It has helped to keep people out of gaol, but I say that the old system, if properly administered, was better than the present system.</p>

<p>I would like to avail myself of the privilege of speaking for half an hour.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote under several heads, and I believe that they fall into the heads of the legal profession itself, the courts, the police, the prisons, and certain political matters. I will deal with the first three.</p>

<p>So far as the profession itself is concerned, the hon. the Minister stated what I think is the belief of all of us here that the legal profession is the backbone of the judicial system in this country, and I would like to say that so far as this hon. the Minister is concerned, the professions appreciate very much his attitude and his approach to the two branches of the legal profession; and I would like to congratulate him on the approach that he has adopted especially towards the branch of the profession to which I belong, namely the Bar. And especially his approach so far as that profession is concerned as regards appointments to the Bench. The hon.

<p>I always give credit where credit is due, and credit is due to this hon. Minister.</p>

<p>So far as the profession is concerned, the hon. the Minister invited me when I put a question to him, to discuss the question of silks under his Vote. The hon. the Minister has obviously met the Bar Council so far as its request for the designation of &#x201C;senior counsel&#x201D; is concerned. I believe the original suggestion was that there should be a &#x201C;state advocate&#x201D; (staatsadvokaat), and now it has been agreed that they be called &#x201C;senior counsel&#x201D; which was the view of the Bar Council. But, Sir, I was a little disturbed to see, following the question which I put to the hon. the Minister and his reply, a report in which the <i>Natal Mercury</i> quoted a statement by Mr. Warner, the chairman of the General Council of the Bar, that the hon. the Minister had said that he would not recognize as senior advocates for the purpose of Bench and other appointments any person who might refuse to use the new title.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased to hear that. Sir, other matters falling under the subject-matter of the profession are amongst others, the question of advocates&#x2019; chambers. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of Community Development is sitting next to the Minister, because this concerns him as well. I think the hon. the Minister will agree, as an old member of the Bar, that it is of the utmost importance to the profession that members of the Bar, no matter what their colour, should be able to practise in the same building. I say that because of the long experience of the Bar, and I realize that it is in the interest of justice, and in the interest of the Bar, and especially in the interest of non-European practitioners (the advocates) that they should all be allowed to have chambers in the same building and practise together. I say that because, when the situation is reached as you have it in Durban, that Indian advocates have not been allowed so far to practise in the same building as the European advocates, it brings about a most undesirable state of affairs. The position is, of course, that they usually get chambers in a building which houses an attorney or a number of attorneys, and, as the hon. the Minister will appreciate, the situation is very undesirable from the point of view of an advocate coming to the Bar for the first time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Do you believe that the legal profession is entitled to treatment other than the other professions?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I think the legal profession in this regard is unique, and I think it is entitled to different treatment from any other profession, and, for this reason, they should be all in one building. I don&#x2019;t say that they all should necessarily have their chambers next to each other, but in the same building, which provides the necessary association, without which advocates do not and cannot assimilate and produce what is the spirit of the Bar, and especially the discipline of the Bar. Without that discipline the legal profession would fall to pieces, and the discipline and code of the Bar is a very high one, as the hon. the Minister knows, and it is one which we would like to see properly exercised and applied to every single member of the profession.</p>

<p>I think we must face the fact that there is going to be an increasing number of legal practitioners who are not Europeans. Now the situation which arose under the consulship of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor of an advocate in Johannesburg, a Native advocate, who was told that he should go and practise in some location, and that he should have his chambers in that location, was, I think, not only unfair to the individual, but was also quite wrong so far as the profession is concerned. A man who is an advocate should practise as an advocate, and should practise two things which affect the legal profession and the Bar as a whole: He should practise discipline and learn the ethics of the Bar. I think it is a matter which justifies a different treatment so far as advocates are concerned from the case of the medical profession for instance. Medical practitioners practise normally and have their <span class="col_8249-8250" refersTo="page_1371"/>consulting rooms in the area where they practise, whereas an advocate&#x2019;s practice is different. The courts are in one place and the Bar is usually in the same place. I hope the hon. the Minister will give some indication as to what his attitude will be in that respect. I must say that in Durban the non-European advocates have been allowed to practise in a building called Lincoln&#x2019;s Court, which is very near the court and very convenient, but the situation is far from desirable. Then, Sir, associated with that is the report of the Van Winsen Committee. I know the hon. the Minister has not had time to read that report.</p>

I also hope that the Minister will be able to tell us whether he will have time during the recess to study this report, and whether during the recess he will be able to take any action in terms of the finding of that committee, or make any recommendations in regard thereto. This is probably the most important committee to have sat since Union as far as the legal profession is concerned. It deals with the question of the high cost of litigation which is something which is exercising everybody&#x2019;s mind, and other matters. As far as the high cost of litigation is concerned, they paid particular attention to that especially in view of the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor&#x2019;s attitude towards the high cost of litigation and towards the profession. There was an unfortunate movement that there should be a fusion of the Side Bar and the Bar and that the civil jurisdiction of magistrates should be increased. I am pleased to say that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude has been to say that he will not in the first place proceed with the Magistrate&#x2019;s Court (Increased Jurisdiction) Bill and in the second place, the Minister indicated that he was not going to appoint magistrates to the Bench.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry I do not agree with the hon. the Minister there because his predecessor, when that question was put to him straightforward, would not answer it as this hon. Minister has answered it. If this hon. Minister has changed his mind we are very grateful to him. I myself put this question to his predecessor in the Other Place and he would not reply to it. Whether that was in issue or not, I am very pleased to hear that it is no longer in issue.</p>

<p>As far as the courts are concerned, I wish to associate myself very heartily with the remarks made by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). I think our courts are without peer; our legal system is without peer, and I think our criminal legal system is the finest that you can find anywhere to-day.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister, now that he has taken over the portfolio of justice, should review what his predecessors have done since this Government has been in power. One of the most important matters, I believe, is the way in which the courts&#x2019; hands are tied. I do not believe it can be necessary to impose compulsory sentences. I believe the hon. the Minister should completely review all those sections which tie the hands of the courts so that in respect of certain crimes they are obliged to impose compulsory whipping especially. The hon. the Minister is not only in touch with the profession, he is in touch with the Bench. My experience has been that magistrate after magistrate has told me that there is one thing which they do not like and that is that they are obliged in cases of house-breaking, motor car thefts and so on to impose a compulsory whipping. [Interjections.] That does not affect the issue at all. The fact is that the law now provides that they are obliged to impose compulsory whipping in certain circumstances. As we all know and as the Minister knows you cannot legislate for every instance which can arise; you cannot legislate for all the extraordinary situations which human frailty will bring about; you cannot legislate for human beings, Sir, as far as their behaviour is concerned. This is something which causes great distress to the magistrates and to the Bench generally, this question of a magistrate being obliged to impose a whipping. I think there are cases&#x2014;I think members of the Bench will be frank with the Minister if he were to discuss this with them&#x2014;where they have leant over backwards to find the accused guilty of some other crime than the one in respect of which they would be obliged to impose a compulsory whipping. I think that is natural, Sir, I think anyone of us would do it in circumstances where we could see that a compulsory whipping would do more harm than good to the individual concerned. I hope the hon. the Minister will give his attention to this and that he will do something about it. He will, of course, first consult with the Bench but I do believe that our Bench is worthy of having a discretion in these matters. As my hon. friend from Germiston District has pointed out. I believe that our Bench is without Deer and that they themselves should have this discretion. I do believe that in proper cases they will exercise it as the hon. the Minister wishes them to exercise it.</p>

<p>There are two other matters, Sir, as far as the courts are concerned, and the one is the salary of judicial officers. As far as magistrates are concerned, I was very distressed to read in one of the newspapers the other day that a magistrate, Mr. Nel I think it was, had decided to leave the service because he could get a better paid job as a clerk.</p>

Consider, Sir, the sort of man you want on the Bench. Consider what a very busy Silk earns every year. When he goes on to the Bench he makes a tremendous financial sacrifice. There are many people who accept these appointments because they believe it is their duty to do so. I think we must remember that a man in that position serves his master, the Lady of Justice, at a great financial loss to himself. In many instances it means a heavy financial set-back to both him and his family.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend following the argument advanced by the hon. lawyer who has just sat down. There is only one matter on which I agree with him and that is where he said that the legal profession was unique. If I were to regard the hon. member as an example of the legal profession he is quite right in saying that the legal profession is unique because they usually need 20 words to describe something which an ordinary person can describe in two or three words. However, I did not rise to talk about that.</p>

<p>I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a matter which is very near to the heart of the fruit farmers of the Western Province, a matter in connection with which points of discussion have already been sent to the Union Agricultural Congress for the Winter Rainfall Area and a matter in connection with which resolutions have already been passed by that congress. I refer to the enormous proportions which fruit thefts have assumed during recent years in the fruit producing areas of the Western Cape. No one objects to scholars or university students periodically stealing a little fruit to eat. But what we do object to is the enormous proportions which fruit thefts have assumed in recent years for commercial purposes. If I were to state in this Committee to-day that some individual farmers probably lose R400 or R600 per annum as a result of the theft of fruit, I would not be exaggerating at all. The position has really become serious because it is not an easy task to guard huge vineyards and orchards; and to fence such a vineyard in properly is simply no use, because a 50c pair of pliers do the necessary damage when a hole is cut into that fence and the thief carries on with his raids. Nor is it an easy task to catch the thieves, because whereas in the case of the stock owner&#x2014;as far as I understand&#x2014;he is entitled to use firearms if his stock gets stolen, you may, of course, not shoot at fruit thieves, with the result that you simply have to run after them; and when you have reached my age, that is not such an easy task.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Chairman, your trouble only starts when the fruit thief has been caught. You have to attend court for half a day and wait until your case comes up. Once it is being heard you have to reply to all sorts of questions: Did you catch the thief red-handed?</p>

<p>Can you prove that the fruit in the basket is your fruit? Once everything has been disposed of the final question is put to you: What was the value of the little fruit he had when you caught him? Well, Mr. Chairman, no farmer is going to wait until the thief has filled his basket. He accosts him the moment he starts to pick and in that case he may only have fruit to the value of 20c or 50c in the basket. Then you have to tell the magistrate that the value of the fruit is 50c. A sentence of eight <span class="col_8255-8256" refersTo="page_1374"/>or fourteen days is imposed, sometimes it is suspended, and within two weeks the same thief is back in your vineyards. I said at the outset that I wanted to show what proportion fruit thefts have assumed for commercial purposes. I know of a farmer in my constituency who went so far a few years ago, after he had lost a great quantity of grapes, as to spray his grapes with a certain safe spray which left marks on the grapes. After a few days he went to all the little fruit shops in the Coloured township and in practically all of them he found certain quantities of those sprayed grapes being offered for sale. That farmer had not sold any of those marked grapes to a single local buyer. But within a few days after he had marked the grapes by spraying they could be bought in practically all the fruit shops in the Coloured town. I cast no reflection on the police or on the court when I say that there was no prosecution. I take it that that is the procedure followed by legal people. I do not always understand them but I take it there were good reasons why they did not prosecute. What we do object to, however, are the light sentences which are imposed. As an excuse for the legal people I suppose we must argue that to a certain extent the magistrate simply interprets public opinion. If public opinion does not regard the theft of fruit in a serious light, it is obvious that the magistrate will impose a light sentence. I think, for example, of a well known week-end publication of one of our Western Province newspapers, which published a long article in its week-end supplement a few years ago about all the well-known people in our society, prominent people, who had made themselves guilty of stealing fruit in their youth. That is the sort of thing which make people regard this sort of theft as a mere bagatelle. Let me say, however, that when anybody steals a fowl which is worth, say, 75c, he will very likely get six months, but when he steals R10 worth of export grapes, he gets a month. That seems somewhat out of proportion to me, and that is why I want to plead with the hon. the Minister once again to have a chat to his people and to ask them to retain their perspective, to maintain a balance when imposing these sentences. Because really, Mr. Chairman, this matter has got out of hand completely and the fruit farmers of the Western Province are begging the hon. the Minister to assist them.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Committee will not hold it against me if I reply at once to some of the matters which hon. members have raised so far. I have already had the opportunity in the Senate of expressing my gratitude and appreciation to the retiring Commissioner. Gen. Du Plooy; I am also very pleased that I have the opportunity in this House to-day, which is his last day of service, of saying farewell to an officer who has devoted his whole life to the Police Force and who has at all times served the Force with great distinction.</p>

<p>I am pleased, therefore, Mr. Chairman, to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) as well as those made by the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse).</p>

<p>*It is also a pleasure to me, Mr. Chairman, to avail myself of the same opportunity of welcoming the newly appointed Commissioner, Brig. Keevy, in that capacity. I am convinced, just as in the case of his predecessor&#x2014;we are all concerned with the Commissioner of Police&#x2014;that hon. members will find in him a person who will not only be accessible as his predecessor has been, but a person with whom there can be equally sound co-operation in this particularly important capacity.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) asked that the Annual Report be made available sooner. I agree with the hon. member and the Department do try at all times to have that report available as soon as possible. If I personally had not been so busy during the past few weeks&#x2014;it was not my fault at all as the hon. member will recall&#x2014;it might have been possible to table last year&#x2019;s report this year. I also want to associate myself with the tribute which the hon. member paid to our courts. Our legal system is second to none Sir; the standards of our courts are second to none.</p>

<p>I also appreciate the compliments which the hon. member for Germiston (District) has paid to our Police Force. Hon. members will recall that in the past the training was six months. The training takes twelve months to-day. I am very pleased to state here to-day that last year for the first time we had 1,600 recruits joining the Police Force. We were especially pleased because such a high percentage of the applicants who came forward were matriculated.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the Van Winsen Report. This report was submitted to me in the course of this Session. I can give hon. members the assurance that I did my level best to study that report. It consists of two big volumes and it was just impossible for me to study it. It is impossible, therefore, for me to say anything about the recommendations contained in that report to-day. Had I been one of a pair of twins I would have done so but unfortunately being all alone by myself it was just impossible to study that report.</p>

<p>Without a doubt. I gave the General Bar Council the assurance that I would discuss the report with them as soon as possible and that will certainly be done during the recess.</p>

<p>As I have said, Sir, I am very very sorry that it is impossible for me to discuss this report, but I do want to say that the Department informs me that it is an excellent piece of work and I do want to pay tribute to Mr. Justice van Winsen and the Committee which compiled this report.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the <span class="col_8257-8258" refersTo="page_1375"/>function in Durban which I did not attend. I want to say that I went on this tour with the law societies. I appreciated the fact that they invited me and I can give hon. members the assurance that as far as the law societies are concerned we understand each other and work together very well indeed. But because that was the position, that the law societies and I understood each other, and because there was that good co-operation between us, people naturally wanted to drive in a wedge between myself and the law societies, and the one person whose name I am going to mention is a certain Mr. J. N. Singh, a listed communist who also happens to be an attorney in Durban. What was the position in regard to this dinner? As I said in my reply to, I think, the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), who asked me the question&#x2014;I told him at the time that those hon. members in favour of social integration could take me to task under my Vote. The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) did not take me to task; he asked me a question. Perhaps the hon. member for Durban (North) will still take me to task, I do not know. But in regard to the question asked by the hon. member for Germiston (District), I say again here and now that I am not sorry that I adopted that attitude. I want to say, further, that I cannot for one moment say that all the members of the Law Society agreed with the stand I took on this issue, but I do want to say that they fully understood why I took up that stand. I took that stand because the function to which the hon. member referred was an out-and-out social function and the hon. member knows my personal standpoint as far as that is concerned, and he knows the principles of my party. I have said time and again that as far as professional occasions and professional matters are concerned, that is something different altogether, but when it comes to social integration, the hon. member must excuse me if I stand aside. What was the position? I now refer to the <i>Natal Daily News</i> of 3 April 1962. According to this report, Mr. J. N. Singh, a Durban attorney, was backed by Mr. Ray Swart, a former M.P., and Mr. Arenstein, well known to hon. members of this House. What was the position? &#x201C;There were about 30 Indian and African members of the Side-Bar, all of whom had been invited.&#x201D; I read further from the report in the <i>Daily News</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He (Mr. Singh) said that the non-Whites who had been invited had all responded to the invitation and had already been issued with an official invitation.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In other words, all thirty of them accepted, but what did he say further? &#x201C;They were each allowed three guests.&#x201D; These non-Whites. What does the hon. member expect me to do? Would he have accepted that invitation in those circumstances? What would hon. members opposite have said to me when I came back if I had accepted that invitation?</p>

<p>With all due deference and respect to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), he would have made a 40-minute speech on it and he would have done it in the most flowery language imaginable, if I had accepted that invitation. But apart from that, what I have just said illustrates that this was not a legal or a judicial occasion. It was purely and simply a social function. Having explained my position, I take it that hon. members will now know why I did not accept that invitation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) complained about conditions being unsatisfactory in certain courts. I cannot agree with him more. I personally have seen courts where I would not like to work myself. Hon. members are aware that unfortunately there is a very heavy backlog in the Department&#x2019;s building programme, and that every effort is being made to improve this position. I can give hon. members the assurance that in the recess I will take a personal interest in the matter to see what can be done to speed up matters. Hon. members will realize that many of the old buildings have become unsuitable, and on the other hand members will realize that owing to the rapid development in certain other areas it has not been possible to replace many of the old buildings. If hon. members only think of places like Sasolburg, Virginia, Welkom and Odendaalsrus and other new towns that sprang up during the last few years, they will realize what the position is. But I heartily agree with what the hon. member said on that score.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) touched on a matter, as far as you would allow him to go, Sir, with which I heartily agree. I will give more details when I reply to what was said by the hon. member for Durban (North) in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) raised the matter of the youth Victor. I will deal with that a little later. I just cannot find my notes on it for the moment. The hon. member also raised the matter of Ganyile. Unfortunately, as I pointed out, this matter is <i>sub judice</i>. But let me say that hon. members had all the time in the world to discuss this matter three times in the beginning of the Session, and I was in my seat here awaiting a discussion which was foreshadowed and promised by the Leader of the Opposition in this connection, and I am therefore as sorry as the hon. member himself is that I am now precluded from discussing this matter under my vote. <span class="col_8259-8260" refersTo="page_1376"/>*The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) raised the question of cases which are remanded. Let me assure the hon. member that magistrates and police officials particularly do not like to have cases remanded because that makes their task more difficult and we are trying to bring about a change in this position as far as possible, but that is not always such an easy matter. Every attorney who has practised in our courts knows that. We know of all the petty things which may crop up which simply make it essential for a case to be remanded. I am convinced myself that there is no unnecessary delay in this connection and that where it does happen it is simply unavoidable. The hon. member spoke appreciatively about the increased mechanical equipment which has been acquired. We are doing that on an increasing scale as our financial position allows us and we will continue to do so in future because we realize that that is a method whereby the proceedings can be expedited. The hon. member also advanced the idea of impounding motor-cars. I understand they are doing that in London with good results, but I do not think that falls within my ambit. I have had enough worries and troubles in connection with the Protection of Animals Act to introduce a Motor-car Impoundment Act as well. Other institutions should rather deal with that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) referred to the examples quoted by the Secretary in his annual report concerning the collection of debt in terms of the old section. I do not know whether it is still Section 65 but in the days when I practised it was Section 65. Let me give hon. members the assurance, and I do not think I am letting any cat out of the bag when I say that not only the Department, not only individual attorneys, but the entire Department and the legal profession are at their wits&#x2019; end as far as this position is concerned. I want to go so far as to say that I am prepared to make a contribution to erect a monument to the person who finds a successful solution to this problem. This is a question which is continually being discussed by the Department not only with the legal profession, but also with Commerce and Industry. During the recess further discussions will take place in this connection because we all realize that the existing machinery does not serve the purpose which we should like it to serve. I do feel, however, that the attorneys are not alone to blame in this connection. They receive instructions which they have to carry out, but I feel that we are justified in blaming the business world for giving credit so easily for small amounts to people whom they do not know or without making any inquiries about them. I am systematically asking myself the question whether it should be possible for the business world which gives credit so readily, to rely on the State machinery as easily as they do, to collect those amounts. I want to make it clear that this is no threat to Commerce and Industry, but I think all hon. members will agree with me that Commerce and Industry should be more careful in this regard than they have been in the past. It will make the position easier for everybody concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked for a police station in the Prinshof constituency. This is the first time that representations have been made in that regard. The hon. member knows, of course, that the constituency is surrounded by police stations. I do not know which is better in practice, to be surrounded by police stations or to have one in the centre of your constituency, but his representations will be considered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) raised the question of the salaries of Coloured constables. When the hon. member spoke he did not have the figures and unfortunately I have not got mine either, but I will reply to him in detail a little later in the debate.</p>

<p>I have already indicated that I think the hon. member has a good point when he talks about the decentralization of the courts, and it is in fact the policy of the Department to decentralize the courts as far as possible. It is the policy of my Department, as far as the big locations are concerned, not only to see that there are police stations, but it is also considered to be in the best interests of everyone concerned, the accused, the witnesses and everybody, to have courts in the precincts of those locations and to hear the cases there. Hon. members know that it is difficult for witnesses to get to the courts, and that when two inhabitants of a location are involved in a fight there are six witnesses and 400 people who attend court to see what is going on. It is as the result of that that there is so much congestion in the courts. I think if this policy is put into practice in all the large centres, we will not have so much congestion.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). I wish to thank the hon. member for the congratulations and the kind words he has said about me. I am just sorry that the hon. member tried to push in a wedge between me and my predecessor. I did not think that was necessary. The hon. member raised the question of Silks. I have already told him that I have had a discussion with the General Bar Council about the matter. They then referred the matter to their individual Bar Councils. I had a letter from the Secretary of the General Bar Council a few weeks ago. I have already replied to the hon. member that as far as I am concerned the new designations will be Senior Counsel and &#x201C;Senior Advokaat&#x201D;. In Afrikaans you use the word &#x201C;advokaat&#x201D;, but in English you use the word &#x201C;counsel&#x201D;, and therefore I personally prefer the words &#x201C;Senior Counsel&#x201D; to &#x201C;Senior Advocate&#x201D;. As far as the title Q.C. is concerned, we find ourselves in the difficult position that actually there are two schools of thought. The <span class="col_8261-8262" refersTo="page_1377"/>one school of thought feels that these titles have now lapsed. I personally do not subscribe to that. My own personal feeling is that it is a title conferred upon a man, and a title once conferred cannot be taken away. That is how I see the position. But that belongs to the old r?egime, to the past. As far as the future is concerned, I will take it up again further with the various law societies after having discussed it with the Judges, because they are also involved in this matter. What I did say to the law societies was that I thought the time had arrived when new letters should be issued to all Senior Counsel, be they on the Bench or not, starting from the Chief Justice downwards. But unfortunately I have not had time to discuss this with the Judges. I will do so, however, in the course of the next month or two, and if we then come to an agreement that is what will happen. We might then&#x2014;I hope not&#x2014;get people on whom the title of</p>

<p>Q.C. has been conferred in the past and who might refuse to accept the S.C. from the Republic of South Africa. I want to say this, because I do not want to have any misunderstanding about the matter. If they in fact refuse to accept the title &#x201C;S.C.&#x201D;, then as far as I am concerned they are just Junior Advocates and nothing more, and I think the hon. member will agree with me. Then they will be Q.C.s as far as courtesy goes, but I certainly cannot recognize that when making appointments to the Bench, and I take if that the taxing master will not recognize it when taxing a bill. I think that is just fair. If a man feels so strongly about it, if he holds such strong convictions that he refuses to accept the title S.C., surely he cannot be heard to say that despite the fact that he has refused that honour he must still be treated as one. As far as that issue is concerned, no definite decision has yet been arrived at. It is a matter which I must still discuss and bring to finality with the Bar Council. What I am doing at the moment is to tell the hon. member, in view of the question he put to me, how I personally feel about it, and the hon. member knows that I never dodge an issue and that I always answer questions put to me. I have already dealt with the Van Winsen Report. The hon. member also raised the question of compulsory whipping. I have given this matter some considerable thought, and not only have I done so, but for the last year the Department of Prisons has studied this matter. Let me say at once that as far as the Department of Justice is concerned, I am told that no magistrate, either personally or at magistrates&#x2019; conferences, which are held regularly, has expressed views similar to the views expressed by the hon. member. But I told the hon. member that I have given this considerable thought and the Prisons Department has made a close study of the effect of compulsory whipping of accused persons. This matter will be discussed further between myself and the Department during the recess. Perhaps it is interesting, and therefore I can tell hon. members this in passing, that the facts seem to show that as far as first and second offenders are concerned it serves a very useful purpose, but it is doubtful whether that is the case with third, fourth and fifth offenders. That is what the report we have available shows. If I am satisfied, after having made a close study of the report, that that is in fact so, that it does serve a useful purpose in regard to first and second offenders but not for third, fourth and fifth offenders I will not hesitate to come to Parliament to ask it to change the law on the subject.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of the salaries of judicial officers. He will recall that in reply to a question I told the House that the Department is in the process of having discussions with the Public Service Commission in regard to this, and I am afraid I cannot take the matter any further now. The hon. member referred to the appointment of Judges. He will understand that I cannot comment upon that at all, and in passing, I am sorry that this matter was in fact raised. The same applies to the question of the salaries of Judges, but seeing that the matter has been raised, I can tell the hon. member that in regard to the salaries of Judges and their pensions and allowances, those matters are at present under consideration between myself and the authorities concerned.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to assaults by the police. By way of interjection I said that I did not think the police deserved that from the hon. member, and I am genuinely sorry that the hon. member brought this matter forward. Surely the hon. member knows that members of the Police Force who are found guilty by the courts of assault are dealt with by the Department. Surely the hon. member also knows that each case is treated on its merits, and must of necessity be treated on its own merits. It is not just a question of discharging a man because he has committed a common assault. The hon. member must know under what conditions and circumstances these people have to work. He must take into account the extreme provocation, especially in these days.</p>

They take action and they take prompt action against them, and I may say they take very severe action against them in most cases. By and large let me tell the hon. member that I am quite satisfied with the way in which matters of the kind raised by him are treated in the police.</p>

<p>*I think having said that, I have replied to all the complaints which have been raised by hon. members so far, except that I still owe the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) a reply.</p>

<p>This side of the House has already conveyed its congratulations and deep gratitude to the retiring Commissioner of Police, and therefore it is only my pleasant pleasure to extend an equally warm welcome to the new Commissioner of Police, Brig. Keevy. I think that all of us are aware of the fact that there were no truer words spoken than when it was said that the policeman&#x2019;s job is not a happy one. And therefore our good wishes go out to him in very real strain. My own experience has certainly been that by and large the police do a very fine job in difficult circumstances, and I think that is the experience of most people. But I think it would certainly keep even higher the name of the police if when there were in fact bad cases of breach of discipline, they were dealt with in a firm disciplinary way, and if the impression were not created that there was undue protection extended to people who have definitely been proved to have contravened disciplinary regulations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not say that it has necessarily happened, but I ask the Minister to make sure that it does not happen because I believe that if he does so it will ensure that the reputation of the police remains high. Sir, it is also good news that so many of the recent recruits have been matriculants and indeed that the Police Force is coming up to its proper strength.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said about our system of justice. I am one of those who share the belief that our law, our legal system, and our judicial officers are indeed of a very high order and that we are most fortunate. But equally I think that as in the case of all organizations there is always a continual need for watchfulness, and I want to bring three matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister which I have noticed over a considerable time are real factors requiring attention. The first one is this: I hope that the hon. the Minister, when he has his discussions with his judicial officers from time to time, will remind them that when they are in fact dispensing justice in the courts, they are not only acting as between party and party or accused and State, but they are acting very often before a very large audience. Very often you will have up to 100 or 200 people in the courts, and it is most important that those people should be brought under the impression of a completely correct and a completely impartial system of justice. I have noticed from time to time that in that respect there have been failures. I think they were doubtless due to the fact that the judicial officer perhaps did not appreciate what a factor in maintaining respect for law and order, such impression made upon such a large audience is.</p>

<p>There is a second and related point that I would like to stress. I do not know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s impression has been, but I have repeatedly been struck by a harsh tone which is frequently used by persons connected with the court towards accused persons. Indeed one feels that there is almost a great impatience which leads to a gruffness, which is something which you will certainly not find in our best-run courts. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will impress upon all those who assist in administering justice in our courts the necessity to bear in mind the dignity of an individual, even if he is an accused person, because he is certainly innocent until he is proved guilty&#x2014;and I am not saying that thereafter he should not be treated with dignity either. But I assure the Minister that over many years I have observed that there is a tendency in some of these cases to adopt an unnecessarily gruff manner which offends and which should be eliminated as soon as we possibly can.</p>

<p>There is a third point which I think will strengthen respect for our administration of justice and that is this: There is a tendency for people to be unwilling to come forward as witnesses. I am not now speaking only of the class of case where threats may be used perhaps against a particular witness. I am speaking about the ordinary class of case where people show a disinclination to come forward as witnesses. I think that is partly due to the fact that there are very often delays and postponements of trials. People come forward to give their evidence, which may not perhaps be of very great moment, but the matter is postponed from one day to the next and then again to the next day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I have never come across a case where a case had been postponed where there has not been a good reason for the postponement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>There may be a good reason for the postponement, although I do not accept that there are always good reasons. There may be a good reason, but I suggest that the Department should go to greater lengths, by telephone or otherwise, to inform witnesses that their case has been postponed, or, if possible, to inform them that it will not be heard before lunch, or whatever the case may be. I am certain that with a little extra bit of trouble and probably one or two extra officials connected with the court&#x2014;perhaps even the clerk of the court could do it himself&#x2014;there <span class="col_8265-8266" refersTo="page_1379"/>could be a record kept of the telephone number of the witness at home and at office so that they can be informed if the case is postponed. I feel that that would go a long way towards eliminating this most undesirable feature, namely that there is a reluctance on the part of people to come forward as witnesses. I do not say that that is the only explanation by any means but it is a very common complaint that one gets.</p>

<p>Reverting for a moment to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech a moment ago and his reference to the title Q.C., would he please tell us whether it is his intention that persons who are in fact present Silks, will be asked to apply again for letters patent to obtain the new designation, or what he has in mind, because he did say that certain consequences were going to follow upon refusal to assume these new titles.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that earlier in this Session it was necessary for the Chief Whip on this side to express regret that the House had not been kept busy at one time. I think it was agreed by both sides of the House that this was due to a shortage of legal advisers to draw up the Bills. I think that this falls properly under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, and I would like just to touch on that. I notice from the Justice report that there are in fact about 20 odd vacancies in the professional division, and I do suggest that the hon. the Minister should attempt to remedy this position. I appreciate that he has doubtless been advertising in an attempt to get these people. If in fact he is unable to get them within a reasonable time, he might consider briefing practicing advocates to help him with certain of that work. Already you have advocates at the Cape Bar who do assist and have assisted as Parliamentary counsel, and I think that that might possibly be a solution to his problem. Speaking of this matter, my own experience is that their assistance could probably also be invoked to overcome some of the other professional shortages in the Department. [Time limit.]*</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>I think every member in this House can pay tribute to the police officials for the service they render South Africa. It is only human that an odd one here and there will overstep the mark and I do not think it is fair to discuss that in this House; it only leaves a very nasty taste in one&#x2019;s mouth, Sir.</p>

<p>There are two matters which I should very much like to discuss with the hon. the Minister. The one is the distressing shortage of housing for our police officials as well as for our magistrates in the various towns. Mr. Chairman, when you take a town such as Brakpan and you look at the residence there in which the chief magistrate is expected to live, you would not expect the most inferior person to live in that house. I want to plead with the Minister to-day that we should once again place our magistrates on a pedestal so that everybody can look up to them as the first citizen of any town because the magistrate is the person who has to maintain law and order in his town. I know there is a shortage of money and I know that the Minister is very sympathetic towards this question, but I want to plead for it that decent housing should be provided to our magistrates and our police officials. I want to pay tribute to the Minister and his Department for what they have already done in connection with the provision of housing for the police at New Kleinfontein, but in View of the fact that so many mines are closing down on the East Rand I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he consider the possibility of taking over the housing which already exists at the various mines, such as at the State Mine and later on at the Brakpan mine and the West Springs Mine, so that cheap housing can be made available to our police there. I am convinced that if that is done a great deal of dissatisfaction will disappear.</p>

<p>Another matter which I want to bring to the notice of the Minister is this: We know that as far as transport is concerned, everything possible is being done for the police but I am convinced that there are not sufficient vehicles in every town to provide sufficient protection to the police when it is necessary that they have it. The areas which the police have to patrol are big areas and the police have to cover many miles every year. I personally can testify as to the position which prevails at Brakpan, particularly on the East Rand and I want to plead for more vehicles for the police there.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I want to raise. I was pleased to hear the new policy which the Minister announced, in terms of which provision is to be made in the new Bantu towns for magistrates&#x2019; offices together with police stations. However, we find this incongruity in the whole situation: We find a local authority establishing a big modern Bantu town. Provision is made for all the necessary facilities but no provision is made for the most important aspect, namely a magistrate&#x2019;s court and a police station. That is not the responsibility of the local authority; land is only set aside for that purpose. Three of the biggest Bantu towns are on the East Rand&#x2014;they are in the Minister&#x2019;s constituency and they border on to mine&#x2014;namely Kwatema, Tskane and the new Nigel location which will very definitely have nearly 100,000 inhabitants by the end of this year, yet there are no magistrates&#x2019; courts or any police stations there. It is nearly two years to-day that those local authorities have been trying to have those magistrates&#x2019; courts and police stations established there, but the Government says there is not sufficient funds. What must happen now? The local authority must first obtain authority to raise loans; it must apply to the Administrator and then it has to apply to the State in connection with the hiring of those buildings. Valuable time is lost during the process, and there is chaos in <span class="col_8267-8268" refersTo="page_1380"/>some of those places. I want to plead for it that before a local authority establishes a Bantu town provision should be made in its capital programme for important buildings such as police stations and magistrates&#x2019; courts.</p>

<p>My final request to the hon. the Minister is this: Has the time not arrived for the Department of Justice to take over the municipal police services in the locations? That is where you find the most serious points of friction to-day, Sir. You have municipal policemen in the locations of the big municipalities; those Natives are untrained. Over the whole weekend they are in charge of that whole big location, alone with the White superintendent whom they can only contact by telephone. I wonder whether the time has not arrived that serious consideration be given to the taking over of that municipal service. If the Department of Justice took over these services there would be much greater satisfaction because the police official of the State has been properly trained; he knows how to treat a fellow human being. Those persons employed by municipalities receive no training. They are taken off the street and placed in employment to perform that important task of maintaining law and order in the Bantu towns.</p>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the other half-hour? I want to raise a few matters with the hon. the Minister, but before doing so I want to comment on some of the things which he himself has said in reply to previous speakers. I am sorry if in so doing I am going to introduce a note of discord into what has been a singularly amiable discussion up to now.</p>

<p>The first thing I want to say to the hon. the Minister is that as far as I personally am concerned, the hon. the Minister would have done himself a great deal of credit had he attended the Association of Law Societies dinner in Natal. I want to make that quite clear.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Oh indeed. The hon. the Minister would cover himself with glory if he joined the Progressive Party, but he would have to make considerable changes in his political convictions, I am sure, before he could do so. But I do not think that he would have had to change any of his political convictions or have lost any of his political principles had he in fact attended the dinner given by the Association of Law Societies. Sir, every member of the Cabinet who goes overseas, every South African representative in the diplomatic corps who is stationed overseas, as part of his professional duties as to attend social gatherings which are, of course, not segregated gatherings, where non-White persons are present, and they conduct themselves very well indeed at these mixed gatherings. They do not in any way give the impression that they have thrown overboard the political principles in which they believe or that they have let their political party down.</p>

<p>I believe it is the height of political irresponsibility for members of the opposing party to use against members of the Cabinet any propaganda in relation to that sort of behaviour.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the hon. the Minister must conduct his own private quarrel on this account. It has been done in the past; I will concede him that; there have been occasions in the past where unfortunate propaganda has been made about ministerial appearances at mixed functions overseas. I say that the hon. the Minister should not be so small-minded as to take any notice of the possibility of that sort of propaganda being made. He should do what he believes is the right thing to do, and I believe that in his professional capacity, when he is invited by the Association of Law Societies to attend a function which, although it is a social function, is a function held by the members of the profession, he should do so, and he should ignore any of the petty party political propaganda which may ensue. I think it is a bad precedent that the hon. the Minister has set in refusing to accept the invitation. We hope in this country to have international conferences&#x2014;medical conferences and professional conferences of all kinds. There are frequently non-White persons who are invited to attend these conferences; they make a considerable contribution in their own right in their profession. It is the custom to invite Ministers to attend the functions, and I hope that the hon. the Minister has not set a precedent which is going to be followed by his colleagues on future occasions.</p>

<p>I want to say something else about a mater which the hon. the Minister raised and he must stop me at once if I have the wrong impression. I understood him to say that he was considering setting up Bantu Commissioners courts in the urban townships where cases can be heard.</p>

<p>I want to say that I hope the Minister will take a little time off in the recess to do something about investigating the conditions of non-White prisoners. I give full credit to the Commissioner of Prisons for the work that he has done as far as prison reform is concerned. I know that he has done a great deal in that regard, that it is a particular baby of his and that conditions are improving. But as far as the non-White prisons are concerned I am afraid one cannot give the same unstinted praise. Conditions are very bad there; there is overcrowding; there are frequent assaults on prisoners by other prisoners. Conditions generally are very bad, and I think that if this country wishes to be considered a modern country, there is a great need for prison reform as far as non-White prisoners are concerned, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will do something about that.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I went to see the Deputy Commissioner of Prisons on one occasion; I have had people making representations to me, and I have innumerable letters from prisoners and prisoners&#x2019; relatives from the non-White gaols. On one occasion I submitted a long document I had received to the Commissioner of Prisons this Session. He had the matter investigated and reported back to me. Since then I have received other letters, one in particular about Roeland Street gaol and the condition of non-White prisoners there, so it is a matter which I think really does need some investigation.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister what he intends doing about this private army of Mr. Robey Leibbrandt. I have raised this two or three times during the course of this Session; I have put two questions to the hon. the Minister. Mr. Leibbrandt boasts that he is raising a private army of a thousand people and they are to be the head protectors to save South Africa. This may be one of Mr. Leibbrandt&#x2019;s crackpot schemes or it may be something very much more dangerous. But what I do not like is the nonchalant attitude that the Minister has adopted towards this. When I first asked him whether he intended to take any steps to prevent such activities he said, &#x201C;No, because such activities do not at present seem to reveal any contravention.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That might very well be so, but I suggest that the hon. the Minister should make it very clear that he does not desire to have private armies to assist him to maintain law and order in South Africa. If ministerial disapproval is put on this scheme <i>ab initio</i>, the chances are that it will not develop any further, but if the hon. the Minister adopts the attitude that he is going to wait <span class="col_8271-8272" refersTo="page_1382"/>until there are contraventions of the law, until private armies are organized to break up meetings and generally to disturb the peace, by then a very serious situation may have developed and the hon. the Minister might be sorry that he did not put down his foot originally.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not in favour of any private armies, be they communist private armies or Nationalist private armies. I think it is the duty of the State to maintain law and order; it is the duty of the police to maintain law and order, and I must say that they should not always be at the receiving end of praise as far as this is concerned because we have had instances in recent weeks where police action, if taken in time, would have prevented a lot of disturbances. The second question which I put to the hon. the Minister about Robey Leibbrandt was based on a statement that the leader (as he calls himself) of the anti-communist protection front had been co-operating with the Security Branch in Bloemfontein. I asked the hon. the Minister whether he would make a statement in that regard, and he said: &#x201C;The Government welcomes assistance from all persons who genuinely wish to co-operate in the fight against Communism,&#x201D; even persons who are going to form private armies, who perhaps are going to arm people and go out and create public violence. Is that what the Minister means by this broad generalization? Because that is certainly what it sounds like. As far as the other half of the question is concerned, that is the question of co-operation with the Security Branch in Bloemfontein, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not considered in the public interest to disclose whether such assistance has in fact been received from any particular person or body, or to comment upon claims by persons or organizations that they are supposed to have rendered such assistance.</block>

<p>I want to take issue with the hon. the Minister here. I think it is very much in the public interest that the hon. the Minister should immediately disclaim any of the claims made by the leader of the anti-communist private army that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department and the Security Branch are co-operating with him. I believe the hon. the Minister is really treading on very thin ice if he allows persons like this, no matter who they be, Robey Leibbrandt, communists or anybody, to organize what they call private armies to help the hon. the Minister to keep law and order and to fight any political movement in this country. I hope the hon. the Minister will take strong steps indeed to stop the organization of any of these so-called private armies.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the main subject that I want to raise with the hon. the Minister and that is a question which I raised a few years ago in this House, but at that time under the Department of Bantu Administration. Now this no longer falls under that department because this is something that the hon. the Minister is now administering under his department and that is the question of the employment of short-term prisoners who are, as the official jargon puts it, released on parole. These parolees are persons who have been sentenced to a sentence of not more than four months imprisonment, and they may, according to an official document, which the Minister&#x2019;s department very kindly supplied me with, immediately apply for parole and be employed as parolees by approved employers. If one takes this document and reads through it, it would appear on the face of it that this is a very admirable scheme indeed. It appears that the objective is admirable. The only trouble is of course that the implementation of the scheme is not admirable, and I will tell the hon. the Minister in a minute why I say that. In terms of this document, it is applied to White and non-White prisoners. I should very much like to know how many Whites in fact are employed under the parolee scheme, what sort of employment they are placed in, and so on. But at the moment I am busy with non-White prisoners, although the conditions apply to all. The object of this scheme is to see that these short-term prisoners will have (a) an opportunity to assimilate in freedom with the community at an early date and (b) to lead an independent existence and thereby provide for his own needs and those of his family. An admirable objective. Furthermore the object is to see that short-term prisoners avoid association with hardened criminals, learn habits of industry, perform healthy work under unrestricted circumstances, free of the stigma of imprisonment, and (4) enable them to earn a wage which will contribute towards their self-support for at least a reasonable period after the expiry of their sentence.</p>

<p>The memorandum then goes on to give us some of the conditions under which parolees are supposed to be working, and so on and it mentions for instance, that the employers shall pay a wage of 20 cents a day for White parolees and 10 cents a day for non-Whites, and that the employer shall provide the parolees with accommodation which does not restrict their freedom of movement, with bedding, working clothes and sufficient food which is not inferior in quantity and variety to the prison diet, and provide the parolee who is ill or has been injured with the necessary medical and hospital treatment applicable to ordinary workers or employees, and the employer is responsible for any costs incurred in connection with such medical and hospital treatment. The parolee is required to work not more than ten hours a day, and he may not be harshly treated, nor may his services be hired out If the employer fails to comply with the conditions set out, further releases on parole in his employ, are discontinued, and the officer in command shall without delay inform the commissioner and furnish him with <span class="col_8273-8274" refersTo="page_1383"/>full particulars and recommendations in that regard. The most important thing is that prisoners sentenced up to four months imprisonment who are released on parole remain under supervision of members of the prison service and supervision must be arranged and exercised by commissioned officers and members in charge of prisons, unless other arrangements for supervision have been made by the department. The parolees must be notified that complaints should be lodged with the nearest member in charge of a prison. Well, Sir, all this sounds fine, and as I mentioned earlier, there are two annexures to the memorandum, very long, and I do not intend to weary the House with reading them, but one of the annexures is a contract signed by the parolee&#x2014;or I suppose thumb-printed by the parolee in most cases&#x2014;and the other is an undertaking by the employer that he will provide proper accommodation which will not restrict the parolee&#x2019;s freedom of movement, adequate food of a quality not lower than the prison diet, proper medical services in the event of illness, and not treat him harshly, etc.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I cannot imagine that it could be otherwise. The hon. the Minister will remember that when I raised this question about three years ago, it was in respect of the &#x201C;in lieu of prosecution&#x201D; cases, and that scheme was found to be illegal, because actually what was happening was that people who had been arrested on petty offences were not even brought before the courts&#x2014;they were given this option of taking up employment on farms. That was found to be illegal and it was discontinued. But only the legal technicalities have changed. These are the same people who are arrested on petty offences, but they are in fact convicted of these petty offences, but thereafter everything is exactly the same: They are given out as labourers under these conditions to farmers all over the country, and my contention is&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t think the hon. the Minister can possibly deny it&#x2014;that the whole system of inspection is faulty. It is quite impossible for the Prisons Department to keep up a regular inspection of the hundreds of farmers throughout the country who are using this parolee labour. The other thing I want to say to the hon. the Minister is that before parolees are given to farmers, his department should make absolutely sure that this type of labour is not the bulk of the labour used by the particular farmer, because if it is the bulk of the labour then certainly the whole objective of the scheme is immediately undermined&#x2014;in other words, to enable them to associate with other members of the Community&#x2014;if these persons are all parolee labourers, living under conditions where they are treated as prisoners. That should be another condition laid down before anybody is allowed to employ parolee labourers. The other important thing is that I don&#x2019;t believe that anybody really can volunteer to do anything if he is already a convict. As far as I am concerned the two are mutually incompatible that is that a person who is in prison is still capable of a voluntary act. The whole circumstances surrounding being a prisoner make it very difficult for a person to say &#x201C;No,&#x201D; to suggestions which are being made by persons who are in authority.</p>

<p>I will tell the hon. the Minister why. There was one case, before the Nationalist Party came into power, in 1947. This is not a new system, it has been used for years and years in this country, and I say it is time that it should be discontinued. A whole and complete rehaul of the whole system should be initiated, and I want to tell the hon. the Minister what I want to suggest in that regard. In 1947 there was a case which the hon. the Minister may remember, of a man who had been sent to a farm. His wife came to pay the fine and she was told that he had volunteered to work on the farm instead of going to prison. A case ensued in the course of which the Judge remarked as counsel indeed implied, that it could not have been a voluntary contract between man and farmer. The Judge said &#x201C;this is not a sound contention, because the contract was not one made by a free man, but the contract was made under conditions in which he was <span class="col_8275-8276" refersTo="page_1384"/>a prisoner In other words, it is virtually impossible to talk about people making a voluntary contract when they are prisoners.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows that this is going on all the time, and I think it is time that the hon. the Minister did something about it. The system continues as before: Short-term prisoners are paroled to farmers, and I maintain that there is not adequate supervision of this scheme. I want to know why the Minister does not want to agree to let us see the report of the commission of inquiry into the old scheme. We have never been able to see that. I want the hon. the Minister to give us some information if he will, about the contents of that report, or at least to make it available to those Members of Parliament who are interested in this matter. There was a commission of inquiry set up at the time of the &#x201C;in lieu of prosecution scheme&#x201D; and when there was that public scandal over the whole business.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister what I think should be done about this scheme. Firstly, I think that it should be abandoned until certain things have been provided. First of all he should make sure that parolees do know what they are doing when they so-called voluntarily elect to become parolees. I believe this should not be done in a prison and there should be at least either a magistrate present or some other person in the Department of Justice, but not a member of the staff of the prison where the man is confined. The second thing is that it is quite clear that there is not an efficient and adequate system of inspection. I wanted to know how many parolees there were in one year. The Minister said he could not give me the answer because too much work was involved. But it should not be difficult to find out how many of these people are in fact parolees because all of them have to sign a contract. I hope that during the recess the hon. the Minister will get that information, because I intend tabling another question on this next year. So I am giving him six months&#x2019; notice of the question, and I hope he will have the information available by then. But I also want to know how he can possibly guarantee an adequate inspectoral system to see that people are properly fed, properly treated, properly housed and that they are not working more than ten hours a day? The cases that do come to light show that the boss-boys are given vast powers over these people, that parolees are badly fed and that the medical attention is inadequate.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish the hon. the Minister would not try to make party political capital out of this. At no time did I say that this was always the case. I have no doubt that in certain instances the system is conducted admirably, that there are farmers who provide adequate accommodation, good food and good attention, but equally the hon. the Minister must grant me that there are farmers who do not. My point is that there are not sufficient inspectors to see whether or not this scheme, which on the face of it is working very well, or should work very well, is in fact working adequately. I again make the point that no farmer should be allowed to have more than a small percentage of his labour force made up of these parolees. Otherwise he gets into the habit of employing only prison labour under conditions very much worse than that afforded to the labour he would employ if he were in the ordinary labour market as a competitive employer&#x2014;in other words he would have to pay better wages and to give better conditions, or he simply would not get the labour, because other farmers offering better conditions would be getting that sort of labour. So a maximum percentage should be laid down for each farmer of this type of parolee labour. Then, Sir, at the time when this &#x201C;in lieu of prosecution scheme&#x201D; was under fire, the question of black-listing of farmers was raised, and the then Minister who was dealing with the matter, the then Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration stated that a black list was kept and that farmers who were found to illtreat their labour, did not get any further parolee labour. I hope that this system will be most carefully continued, and that farmers who are found guilty of illtreating their labour are black-listed and are not able to use this sort of labour at all.</p>

<p>I have raised this matter for one reason only apart from the human side of it&#x2014;the fact that one&#x2019;s blood runs cold every time one reads of this kind of case when one picks up a newspaper and sees the sort of accommodation that is given in some cases, the sacking is provided for bedding and so on &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister may think so, but it is widely read by people who are interested in these matters, and two sections of this are devoted entirely to the cases that arose at the time of the &#x201C;in lieu of prosecution scheme&#x201D;, and I want to obviate it being possible for anybody in future ever to write a report like that again about South Africa. Until the hon. the Minister can assure us that he has got adequate inspection <span class="col_8277-8278" refersTo="page_1385"/>and that labour that goes out on this parolee system is indeed labour that has volunteered, and there is no suggestion of labour being induced to volunteer, I don&#x2019;t believe that we should continue with this system, however admirable the system may be in terms of the memorandum which the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department supplied to me.</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>So far this debate has been conducted in a very friendly spirit, except perhaps to some extent in the case of the speech to which we have just listened. I think the way in which this debate has been conducted can be interpreted in no other way than that it is a compliment to the Minister and a testimonial to every section of his Department. I think that can particularly be said in view of the fact that in practically every section of the Department of Justice they have to deal daily and every day with people and the problems of people. It is because a human being is different from a machine, because a human being knows his own ways and because the one decides differently from the other, that it is so difficult to satisfy everybody. In view of the fact that so few complaints have been raised under this Vote, I say we can regard it as a testimonial to this Department. Once again the hon. member for Houghton has commented on the fact that the Minister refused to attend a certain function in Natal. It is quite understandable why she differs, and I can also understand that she differs because of the attitude which she and her party adopt; because of that we differ basically so widely that little can be gained in arguing this question across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>At the commencement of these discussions the hon. member for Germiston also raised this matter, and the position is somewhat different in his case. He asked the Minister what his attitude would be in future in this connection and the hon. member for Germiston (District) expressed the hope that the hon. the Minister would change the attitude which he had adopted on that occasion in regard to attending that function. I gained the impression from the attitude which the hon. member adopted that he thought the Minister had acted incorrectly on that occasion. The hon. the Minister has replied in detail to that and I think hon. members opposite owe it to the House to say whether or not they are satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister, whether they accept it, whether they think he acted correctly, or whether they still insist that he should in actual fact attend such functions in future. The reason why I am asking this is because of the fact that while the Minister was giving his explanation it was not clear how hon. members opposite felt about this matter.</p>

<p>I also want to say a few words about certain matters regarding the Department of Justice. I wish to raise certain matters affecting magistrates&#x2019; courts and in discussing those matters I do not wish to make any destructive criticism; I am aware of it that there are certain defects which can possibly be improved and in so far as it may appear to be criticism it is really only an attempt to bring about an improvement where weaknesses do exist. In the process of training a magistrate, the policy is to a great extent followed, if not to the full extent, that he also acts as the public prosecutor. I want to ask the Minister whether it is possible not to follow that procedure in the process of training a magistrate; whether it is possible that in the process of his training a magistrate need not be the public prosecutor as well. I will go into that at greater length at a later stage, but the reason why I object to that is that particularly in the case of the younger generation, a magistrate often finds it difficult to forget the idea that he was once a public prosecutor&#x2014;there are good reasons for that; we are all human. However, I think we must look deeper into the matter to find the reason and I think the problem can to some extent be solved in the training of public prosecutors. In this respect I think it is essential that public prosecutors in general should be taught to realize that in the case of a criminal case, unlike in a civil case, there is no question of anybody losing or winning the case. In the case of a criminal case, as I see it, the position is simply this: A charge is made; if the accused is found guilty, is he guilty or not guilty? If the public prosecutor does not succeed in getting him found guilty, he has most certainly not lost his case. Justice has only been done. And if the prosecutor does succeed in getting the accused found guilty by the magistrate, then it is not a case of the accused having lost his case but in that case it must also be taken that justice has been done. In the process of training prosecutors, I think the emphasis should be laid on this, that the only duty which rests on him is to lay certain facts before the court, and once the prosecutor has laid those facts before the court to the best of his ability, I think he has discharged his duty; he has done his work. But I think the problem arises in this, that it often happens that the person who decides that a prosecution should be instituted is also the person who prosecutes. The result is that, having considered the statements, the prosecutor decides, in view of those statements, to prosecute; he assumes that in such a case the accused must be found guilty. In that case he strives to have that person found guilty and not simply to place the facts before the court. I also think that in such a case the approach should be that when the prosecutor decides to prosecute he decides to do so purely and simply on the documents he has before him, and if documents or evidence come before the court which prove the opposite, the prosecutor should not regard that as a reflection on himself or an error in his judgment in having decided to prosecute.</p>

<p>I said a moment ago that particularly among the younger magistrates who were formerly public prosecutors, you find that they often have difficulty in forgetting that they were public prosecutors and because of the <span class="col_8279-8280" refersTo="page_1386"/>attitude which they probably adopted a year or two or three ago when they were prosecutors, they are inclined to cross-examine witnesses or even to put leading questions to them, and what is more, they even take down a report of the court proceedings. In other words, they themselves write down the replies to the questions which they themselves have asked. That is why I wish to avail myself of this opportunity of making representations to the hon. the Minister. We are to-day living in a mechanical age and in a highly developed world, and it is wrong to allow a highly paid official, such as a senior magistrate, to sit there and to write down in longhand all the evidence which is given in that court. I think the time has arrived&#x2014;and I think this will solve most of the problems which I have outlined&#x2014;that we gradually import machines (I realize that it will cost a great deal at the outset) in our more important magistrates&#x2019; courts and that we get shorthand-typists to take down the evidence and place it on record with the assistance of the machines. That will make it unnecessary for the magistrate, that highly paid official, to spend three-quarters of his time in court writing down the evidence. You can save two-thirds of his time or more by employing a typist who, with the assistance of a machine, will probably do the work just as well if not better in the interests of the administration of justice.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I rise primarily to correct an impression which I might have given in connection with what I said about the collection of debts, and to say that I had not the slightest intention of attacking my own profession and to indicate that there was any reason to attack the profession as a whole. Apparently one or two members of the House felt that I had created that impression. I want to correct that at once. I have a very high regard for the legal profession and I certainly will not say anything at all to give the impression that I was attacking my own profession. I think the hon. the Minister has made it clear that the costs of collections under Section 65 is something which requires very close scrutiny and investigation, and I hope the hon. the Minister will go into the matter because at the moment it is far too expensive. Then there is the question of the wages of Coloured constables. I have information which confirms the figures printed on page 287 of the Estimates. I am afraid both the Minister and I overlooked that page. The point I wish to make. Sir, is this: A Coloured constable&#x2019;s commencing salary is R360 per annum&#x2014;&#x00A3;15 per month as it used to be; whereas a European constable commences with a salary of R720&#x2014;double. As the progress of their wages will indicate as printed in the Estimates, a European constable is in a much better position than the Coloured constable. The European constable can rise to R1,700 whereas the Coloured constable only rises to R840. I do not know how any Government can expect the Coloured man to join the police and to be able to live on R30 per month; that is asking too much. He has to render the same service as the White constable. As I said earlier he faces the same dangers. There is no question as to how much you earn when you have to do your duty. When there is danger the Coloured man is sent there and he has to go. On R30 per month there is no incentive for the Coloured people to join the Police Force. I do hope that this Minister will at least accept the principle of equal pay for services rendered.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I know, but I hope the Minister will be able to influence his colleague. I have raised this before. Coloured constables and Coloured detectives have come to see me. They want to do the work. They have entered the service with the object of serving their country but they feel that their lives are in as much danger as those of the White constables and they feel that the discrepancy against them is unfair. In addition they are asked to face a dangerous situation completely unarmed. That is also a question which I have already raised. I think the hon. the Minister should consider the position of these people.</p>

<p>I now want to read from the Annual Report for the year 1960-61 of the South African Police. On the first page it gives the authorized establishment of Coloured policemen and the number employed. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what the reason is why this establishment cannot be completely filled. I am talking about the Coloureds. In the case of first-class sergeants there are 18 vacancies; in the case of second-class sergeants there are 22 vacancies and in the case of constables there are 160 vacancies. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister why this establishment cannot be filled completely.</p>

<p>The next point I want to raise with the Minister has nothing to do with the Coloureds really. I am reading from the Annual Report of the Department of Justice under the heading &#x201C;Legal assistants&#x201D;. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is still a shortage of legally qualified junior officers. Including the posts in South West Africa, which the Department must fill, there are at the moment 263 vacancies for legal assistants. During the year 40 officers studied for the final Public Service Lower Law Examination and 17 of them passed.</block>

<block name="quote">Out of a total number of 282 posts of Legal Assistants, only 19 are filled by officers who possess the necessary legal qualifications, while Clerical Assistants, Grades I and II, who are not legally qualified, are employed against the remaining posts.</block>

<p><span class="col_8281-8282" refersTo="page_1387"/>I do not know what is meant by &#x201C;legal assistants Does it mean public prosecutors? Because it is not defined. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether some of these posts cannot be filled by Coloured people. Surely, Sir, the Minister should not close the Department of Justice to the Coloured people in respect of employment. There must be some way of finding work for young Coloured lawyers who want to take up the legal profession. Those who want to enter the service should be given some encouragement.</p>

I am very thankful to the hon. the Minister for what he has just said and I am sure the Coloured people will be thankful. I am very glad I raised it.</p>

<p>There are many other aspects of the Department of the Minister that one could deal with but I have no intention of delaying the Committee any longer. I do want to say this, however, in conclusion in reply to the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. S. L. Muller) and I want the hon. the Minister to listen. If the hon. member suggests that evidence should be taken down in shorthand or by mechanical means, I want to bring this point to the Minister&#x2019;s attention: the Minister must consider the costs to the litigants to pay for that record. That was the position at the time I still practised. [Time limit.]*</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to touch upon three matters, but before doing so, I want to return to what the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) said when she referred to that prison scheme. I hope the Minister will not abolish that scheme because of the criticism she has levelled against it. It is being applied on a large scale in my constituency and I can mention numerous cases where it has worked very satisfactorily to the advantage of the prisoners. There are cases where the prisoners have subsequently gone to work for the same master. I have employed numerous of those prisoners and they have subsequently come to work for me. That has not happened only in my case but in the case of numbers of other farmers in that district. In a few exceptional cases it has been abused, as those referred to by the hon. member, but we cannot go according to that. It is a pity that all the cases where the scheme has been a success, do not appear in the newspapers, but only the few cases where there has been abuses.</p>

<p>The first matter I want to raise is in connection with the regional magistrates. They are appointed on an increasing salary scale. I believe the maximum notch is R5,000. My submission is that when a regional magistrate is appointed, he should immediately be placed on the maximum notch, just as in the case of a judge. In view of the responsible work they have to perform I do not see how a difference can be made between the responsibilities of one regional magistrate and another. They all do the same work and carry the same responsibility. I think that if they get appointed to that position they should be placed on the maximum notch. As a matter of fact, I think the scale of the regional magistrates ought definitely to be higher. They do very important work. They do a great deal of the work which was formerly done by the Supreme Court, and I think they deserve much more than the amount they receive at the moment. It must be a higher amount. After all, Mr. Chairman, they do work in which they should be incorruptible and they should receive a salary which keeps count of that fact.</p>

<p>The second matter is on connection with the training of magistrates. A certain scheme is in existence whereby public servants are sent to a university by the Department to equip themselves to become magistrates. We know there is a great shortage of magistrates. We find, however, that after they have been trained those people are sent to places such as Pofadder or Villiers or other small places, where they deal with two cases a month. He loses interest in legal work. It is a great wastage of legal energy, legal knowledge and legal ability, because the magistrates who are sent to those places, are overloaded with ordinary administrative work. I want to suggest the establishment of a kind of circuit magistrate&#x2019;s court which can hear trial cases in those places and do the legal work. Administrative officials can be appointed to do the administrative work in the magistrate&#x2019;s offices. It is very discouraging to a person who has gone to the trouble of writing his lower and higher law examinations in the Public Service to find that he is buried in a place where he never requires that legal knowledge. I want to insist very strongly that some plan be evolved so that the legal knowledge of such people is not wasted.</p>

<p>The third point I wish to raise is in connection with prisons. The policy is apparently to have prisons for non-Whites in White areas. I have had that experience in my constituency where we formerly had the Stofberg Memorial School. It was a missionary institution of the D.R. Church to train Bantu in the service of the Gospel, as teachers and so forth. A large farm prison has been established there for non-Whites. I say it is not right that it should be there. The prison <span class="col_8283-8284" refersTo="page_1388"/>which has been erected there is a beautiful prison. But what I want to plead for is that they should be detained in their own areas in similar farm prisons. They should, as it were, be re-established in their own area. We have thousands and thousands of non-White prisoners in the White areas and those people really belong to the Bantu areas. They should be detained there and released from prisons there and re-established there. I can give the example of foreign Bantu who are caught because they do not have the necessary immigration permits or whatever it may be. They are sentenced to a month&#x2019;s imprisonment. When they have served their time they are simply let through the door and they once again become forbidden immigrants and can again be caught and returned to prison. In their case I want to plead for depots to be established on the borders of the country so that when they are released from prison, they can immediately return to their homelands. In the case of our own Bantu I want to plead for prisons in the Bantu areas and if they are released there they should immediately be re-established in the Bantu area, and not allowed to return to the White area, because he has already committed an offence in the White area or has been a criminal. In other words, he has made a nuisance of himself and he should now be re-established in his own area, so that he may become a useful citizen there. As a matter of fact I want to plead for the removal of all these gaols to the Bantu area.</p>

A certain point was made and I just wish to remind the hon. the Minister in that regard.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The first point on which I should like to touch is the question of the necessity for providing incentives to encourage policemen to learn one or other of the various Bantu languages. I believe it is essential, in these times particularly, that a great number of the White policemen should be able to speak a Bantu language, and Zulu in particular. I would suggest for the consideration of the hon. the Minister that he holds out very substantial pay increases, by way of a bonus, in order to encourage that. We know, Sir, that when you are dealing with human beings it requires an effort to learn a language other than one&#x2019;s own, particularly when one does not hear it spoken all the time. A moderate bonus of one or two pounds per month will not in itself be sufficient for policemen to undertake training in, for example, the Zulu language. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that this is a matter of such importance that he should consider providing a very substantial bonus indeed for any policeman who cares to qualify himself in a Bantu language. It has always been surprising to me that our police force, i.e. the White section, has managed to do its job as well as it has, when its job is concerned mainly with dealing with a group of people whose language they cannot speak. I do not know how one can control or manage the affairs of a group of people if the person concerned cannot speak to them and cannot understand what they have to say. Not only will it assist in controlling the situation but it will do away with the many petty misunderstandings which arise at the present time and which often billow up into something unfortunately large. Those things, Sir, would be done away with if there were this language link between the men who have to deal with any situation and the persons they have to deal with. One only has to think of the recent disturbances a year or two ago in Cato Manor. The hon. the Minister will know of the case I have in mind, where the whole position was kept under control by one police officer, a major. He went in alone, sitting on top of a saracen tank. He was able to deal with that crowd of thousands of tumultuous people merely because he had a fluent command of the Zulu language. That was a memorable occasion; an exhibition of devotion to duty by a very brave man. But the outstanding fact was that the crowd respected him and was prepared to listen to what he had to say because he spoke their own language. I would suggest, Sir, that had he had to have a non-White standing next to him interpreting what he had to say from either English or Afrikaans into Zulu, that crowd would have booed him down and there might have been bloodshed. As I am reminded, his name is Gerrie van der Merwe&#x2014;a most outstanding police officer. I believe the time has come when this problem cannot be shelved. One knows that in the Northern Provinces and in the Western Province of the Cape the great majority of the Bantu speak either English or Afrikaans in addition to their own language. But so far as Natal and I believe the Eastern Province are concerned, the great bulk of the Bantu do not speak either of the official languages. I cannot see, Sir, how their grievances can be put to the police authorities and how the police authorities can put across their point of view, if they cannot speak the Bantu language to the people with whom they are dealing. One recalls from what one hears, the old days in South Africa when the magistracy by and large spoke the language of the people with whom they were dealing. To this day you will hear the older Natives speaking with great respect of those old-time magistrates simply because they spoke the language of the people concerned. I realize, Sir, that to-day where we have official languages and where everything has to be recorded in either English or Afrikaans those proceedings must be conducted in either of those two languages, but so far <span class="col_8285-8286" refersTo="page_1389"/>as the police are concerned I would urge most strongly that their tuition on the Bantu languages be encouraged.</p>

<p>There are one or two factors in relation to my own constituency which I should like to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister and one is the need for more housing for the police at Empangeni. In addition to that, Sir, there is also an urgent need for a new police station at Matubatuba. I think the building there dates from pre-Union days. As the hon. the Minister will know he is dealing here with a sub-tropical climate where in summer the officials concerned have to work under very trying climatic conditions. When they have to work not only in a very old building but in a very crowded building the situation becomes quite impossible. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has ever spent a February in the coastal areas of Natal and Zululand. If he has he will realize that crowded conditions become virtually insupportable during that time of the year.</p>

<p>There is also the question of the extension to the police station at Kwambonambi where the same criticism can be levelled at the existing accommodation, that is of over-crowded conditions. The same applies to Nqutu particularly in respect of married accommodation. Coming to the magisterial staff I should like to support the plea made by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) and that is for improved conditions of service for the magisterial staff. There is no doubt at all, Sir, that the pay increases to the magisterial staff have not kept pace with the increase in the cost of living. One has only to look at the report of the Department for the year 1960 to see that that is borne out. Because there one finds that the resignations have increased from 1959-60 from 304 to 454&#x2014;an increase of over 100. The vacancies have increased from 559 to 640. There again the magistrate is not only the key judicial officer in his district but he is the administrative peg around which the whole civil service administration hinges. The quality of the magistrate is directly related to the quality of the intake of the clerks into the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department. Unless those people are paid a remuneration which can compete with what is offered in private enterprise, in commerce and industry, these figures in regard to vacancies and resignations will continue to increase and the quality of the men coming to the head of that department, the future magistrates, will fall lower and lower. We cannot allow that to take place. I would urge upon the hon. the Minister to consider, as a matter of urgency, the substantial upgrading of the salary scales for the magisterial department.</p>

<p>There is one other small matter appearing from this report which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister and that is the provision of consultation rooms as envisaged at pages 17 and 18 of the report. It says there &#x201C;One consultation room for use by White advocates/attorneys for interviews with White clients and one by White attorneys for interviews with non-White clients. Then there is to be a third consultation room for use by non-White attorneys for interviews with non-White clients. I can understand that arrangement, but what happens when a non-White attorney has to have an interview with White witnesses? What does he do? Where does he go? Where can he consult his White witnesses? Will a fourth consulting room be made available to cover that particular instance? I am merely mentioning this Sir. This is the sort of thing which should be made clear to the officials concerned so that there can be no embarrassment to the practitioners concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) raised the question of the salaries of non-White constables and noncommissioned officers and he gave the figures as printed on page 287 of the Budget. I will, therefore, not touch upon that again because it has already been done. I would, however, like to plead with the hon. the Minister to give attention to this matter as soon as possible. The Minister will also find&#x2014;and his officials will tell him that this is the truth&#x2014;that an indication of the important role which salaries play in the lives of the people whom we get, can be found in the fact that as far as Coloured constables are concerned, the best men or the majority of them originally came from the platteland. That to me, Sir, is an indication that in the cities where living standards and the cost of living are higher, you simply cannot find the better type of person to join the Force and to work for that salary. What I have just said in respect of the Coloured policemen, also applies to another branch of the Minister&#x2019;s Department, namely the prisons section. The same position obtains there. I honestly do not think that a salary which is half that of a White man is justified in this case. I hope that the Minister will in the foreseeable future make a statement in respect of this matter, and that the salaries will be appreciably increased.</p>

<p>Like the hon. member for Boland, I welcome the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s announcement that he can absorb any Coloured person with legal training into his Department. This question arises, however: Will those people, once they have been trained, once they have their B.A. in law, or even their B.A., LL.B., see their way clear to work in the Department at the salary which is offered?</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister is a lawyer himself and surely he knows that when he qualified he asked himself the question whether he would do better by going into the Public Service at a fixed salary, with fixed increases etc. or by practicing at the Bar, struggling at the beginning but with the prospect <span class="col_8287-8288" refersTo="page_1390"/>of possibly doing better later on? The hon. Minister himself knows that when you are at that age you do not always consider the fact that if you make the Public Service your career you will retire at a certain age on a fixed pension, whereas if you practise at the Bar and are too old one day to practise, you will not receive a pension. That is a matter of great importance. I personally know of many a young man who has obtained his B.A. degree in law or his B.A., LL.B. degree but who did not see his way clear to enter the Public Service. He hoped to do better in some private undertaking or by practicing at the Bar where his income would be higher than in the Public Service. I know that is their problem but I do feel that the Minister will have to give this his serious attention, because with existing training facilities we are hoping that more Coloured people will undergo this training and qualify in the legal profession so that they can enter the Public Service.</p>

<p>There is another small matter which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister and I am doing so for this reason that other hon. members of this House may not perhaps be as well informed or acquainted with the circumstances as I am, because hon. members do not use the entrance to this House which we on these benches have to use of necessity because our offices are there. What has struck me is the fact that the policemen, the constables, non-commissioned officers and even officers, who do duty in this House, have nowhere to go to drink a cup of tea in private or eat their meals. The argument may perhaps be advanced that when a constable is on duty he has no time to drink tea, but there are non-commissioned officers who are married men and who do not go to the barracks in the afternoon for lunch. They bring their food with them and there is not a place in this House where those people can enjoy their meals. This has come to my notice because every day when we leave or enter the entrance at the lower end, you see a man, half shyly swallowing down a quick cup of tea. I noticed it particularly during the last session when I had occasion to speak to one of the sergeants and when I found him in the machine room where the air conditioning plant is situated.</p>

<p>I appreciate that in answer to the point raised by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), the Minister did say that he was aware of the crowded conditions in the courts in several parts of the country, and I have no doubt that his remarks were directed to the crowded conditions in Durban also. [Interjection.] I am pleased to hear the Minister say that, but I would point out that these conditions have existed in Durban for many years. I hope that the Minister will give his urgent attention to the construction of new magistrates&#x2019; courts in Durban, because they are very badly needed, not only because it is difficult for the magistrates to conduct cases under the existing conditions, but also because the generally unsatisfactory conditions give a very bad impression of the administration of justice to members of the public, such as witnesses and others who come to the courts. I notice that in answer to a question put by the hon. member for Umbilo, reported in Hansard No. 13, the Minister said it was his intention to erect new magistrates&#x2019; courts in Durban, and that the site had already been acquired and the planning of the project would commence as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Thank you. But I would like to know which site it is. In the past, two sites were considered and I would be interested to know which site was decided on. The other matter I wish to raise is one which unfortunately is not quite such a simple one. It has to do with the two statements the Minister made in the Other Place during the course of the debate on the General Law Amendment Bill. The first statement was that the two former Chief Justices, Messrs. Centlivres and Fagan, had discredited the South African Bench by their active participation in politics.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister does not go so far as to suggest that once a Judge ceases to be a Judge, he has no right to participate actively in politics. If that is his contention, I would suggest that there is no substance at all in it. I would point out that the custom whereby Judges refrain from taking active part in politics arises from the fact that a Judge must be impartial. That is the basic reason for that custom, and obviously if the Judge, whilst he is a Judge, takes <span class="col_8289-8290" refersTo="page_1391"/>an active part in politics, it is unlikely that he will be impartial, or at least there is the danger that he may not be impartial. If that is the reason for the custom, there is clearly no reason why, once a Judge leaves the Bench he should not take an active part in politics. I go further and say there are many reasons why ex-Judges ought to take an active part in politics, the most important being that they are obviously men of considerable ability, or otherwise they would not have been appointed to that high position. They are men who by the time they retire as judges have had considerable experience and their opinions and views would be valuable in the political sphere.</p>

I suggest that it is abundantly clear that so far as Senator Fagan is concerned, his participation in politics, since he left the Bench, has been on a very high level and he has conducted himself with the utmost decorum and in a most worthy manner.

<p>Let me say at once to the hon. member who has just sat down&#x2014;I do not think you will allow me, Sir, to discuss it&#x2014;that I should like to repeat emphatically on this occasion, if it is necessary to discuss this matter further, what I said in respect of retired Chief Justices who take part in politics. I hope that in the future no retired Chief Justice will act in the way in which these two gentlemen have been acting. I think they have rendered a disservice to politics as well as to the administration of justice and a tremendous disservice to the Bench&#x2014;and this applies to all Judges who enter politics. I do not want to suggest for a single moment that a retired Judge should not have political views. Heaven forbid! I want everybody to have political views, but one should bear in mind the position that one occupies when one retires and enters public life again. If a person is allowed to sit on the Bench to-day and to take advantage of the first opportunity on his retirement&#x2014;and hon. members must not hold it against me if I discuss this matter at length because they raised it, not I&#x2014;to play an active, leading role in political parties, then it stands to reason that people who formerly instituted litigation in which he was the Judge may have the suspicion&#x2014;and hon. members are always so insistent that &#x201C;justice must be seen to be done&#x201D;&#x2014;that he was politically prejudiced against them when he gave judgment. Cannot hon. members realize that that must inevitably be the position? The position is that an authority in respect of Communism, a person who himself took a very active part in that connection and who makes no secret of that fact but who says that he has become converted, Sen. A. Z. Berman, has told us that the Congress of Democrats&#x2014;and he knows what he is talking about&#x2014;is the mouthpiece of the communists in South Africa at the moment, and here an ex-Chief Justice, Mr. Centlivres, comes along and organizes a certain movement and openly admits, according to his statement to the <i>Cape Times</i>, that the Congress of Democrats has joined his movement. In other words, the communists have joined him; he is an ex-Chief Justice and he applies to the City Council for permission to march through the streets of Cape Town because Parliament makes use of its sovereign right to pass legislation. Just imagine, Sir, a retired Chief Justice, together with certain people, about whom I do not wish to say anything now, but also together with communists, wants to march through the streets of Cape Town to protest against this sovereign Parliament&#x2019;s right to pass certain legislation. If that does not bring the court into discredit, then I do not know what can bring a court into discredit.</p>

<p>No, it is Parliament&#x2019;s right to judge the contents of a measure; it is not the right of a retired Judge and of the populous (&#x201C;gepeupel&#x201D;) of Cape Town. It is bad enough when an ordinary person does so, but when an ex-Chief Justice does it, it is much worse. And let me say this to hon. members on the other side. If what he did was right, if his attitude was correct, why did hon. members opposite not join <span class="col_8291-8292" refersTo="page_1392"/>him? In that case they should have done their share and they should have been there with him. I want to condemn this in the strongest words at my command, and in doing so I do not stand alone. There are other retired Judges too who feel that the conduct of these two gentlemen has brought the Bench into discredit. I am very sorry about it and I hope that there will be no repetition of this.</p>

<p>Time does not permit me to go into that aspect of the matter at greater length.</p>

<p>I want to reply to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), who raised the matter of the boy Victor. He was arrested on 18 January 1962 not by a White policeman but by a Coloured policeman, on a contravention of Section 15 (1) (a) of Act 67 of 1952. At the time it was thought that he was 19 years of age. There is nothing on record to show that he is 16 years of age, as is now alleged. It is interesting to note that as far as the age is concerned the records of the school he had attended show his age as 19. In other words, according to the school records he was born on 24 April 1943. Subsequently&#x2014;I am not blaming anybody in this connection and I do not know when this was done, but I am just giving the facts&#x2014;the register was changed to read &#x201C;24/4/45&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;24/4/43&#x201D;. His mother was present at court when he was found guilty and sentenced. According to my information, she took him home. The district surgeon subsequently examined him. In all fairness, I want to say that this examination took place after the question was put by the hon. member for Houghton. The examination took place on 24 February 1962 and this is what the district surgeon says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is evidence of six strokes having been inflicted. These have completely healed with no loss of tissue, indicating that the strokes were superficial in nature. There is no evidence of any damage to the skin deeper than the surface, and the findings are consistent with a moderate caning without excessive force. I estimate him to be 18 years of age.</block>

<p>But what happened was that after he was caned&#x2014;and in all fairness let me say that he was caned by an old hand in the Police Force who did this job 20 years ago when I practised in Port Elizabeth. I see his name in the record and he is a humane man in all respects. But what apparently happened was that after he was caned and went home with his mother, she put Vicks on the places where he was caned, and that is the last thing that one should do, according to the medical evidence. That is why the hon. member is now in possession of the photographs he has. But the district surgeon&#x2019;s certificate makes it quite clear that he had a moderate caning. From the record it is also clear that he did not tell anybody that he was a scholar, and as far as I am concerned he was fairly treated at his trial and I cannot find any fault whatever with the proceedings. The hon. member asked me why he was arrested at the time. The answer is that it was as the result of certain happenings connected with Mr. Strachan and his friends. The police were on the look-out for certain tsotsis and other people on account of the conditions prevailing in Port Elizabeth at the time, and that is why this particular youngster, together with others, was arrested.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) has explained the difficulty, and I may say that I have great sympathy for him as far as the theft of fruit is concerned, not only in his area but also in other areas. I am not talking now about the fruit that hon. members think about when they think of the days of their youth; I am talking about fruit which is stolen for commercial purposes. I want to tell the hon. member that I have noted his remarks and that we shall have discussions to see what we can do to alleviate the position.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) has referred to the fact that certain officials often address prisoners and others in a gruff way. Those are the exceptions. I have, of course, heard it myself, but it is very easy for me and for the hon. member to talk because we only hear it once or twice and we only come into contact with these people once or twice. But has the hon. member ever tried to place himself in the position of the man who has to deal with these obstreperous people day after day? If he does not use an ugly word occasionally, then he must be the sort of person whom I still have to meet on this earth. However, I have noted the hon. member&#x2019;s words and I shall convey his attitude to the conference when the next conference is held again. The hon. member has mentioned the fact that we might make use of the services of practicing advocates. Unfortunately that is not practicable because there is hardly a basis on which that can be done and because this is such specialized work that it is very difficult to make use of their services.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) has put forward a plea in respect of housing, a plea to which I heartily subscribe. I wish we were in a position to provide housing to all these people. His suggestion in connection with mining houses on the East Rand will certainly be followed up if there is any substance in it. As far as vehicles are concerned, we have to cut our cloth according to the material that we have available in the shape of vehicles. We should very much have liked to have had more vehicles than we have at the moment, but we have to cut our cloth according to the available material. The question of municipal police, which the hon. member touched upon, is a difficult problem. I agree that unfortunately you find municipal police who have had no training and who have no background or experience. Nevertheless, there are some of them who do very good work, and I knew many of them in the days when I was still practicing. The ideal would be not only to have trained people in our own Police Force but also in the municipal service. I thank the hon. member for <span class="col_8293-8294" refersTo="page_1393"/>his suggestion. It will be followed up.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton referred to the bad conditions in some gaols as far as non-Whites are concerned, but it is not only as far as non-Whites are concerned. Let us face the fact that we have old gaols like Durban Gaol and Roeland Street and The Fort, and it is not a question of only keeping the non-Whites under such conditions, but unfortunately we have to keep White prisoners in those gaols under conditions which are far from ideal. It is not the Department&#x2019;s fault. It is not because we want to keep people under those conditions, but because these buildings are old and under the circumstances it has not yet been possible to transfer all prisoners to new buildings. In the case of Roeland Street, we transfer them to Pollsmoor as far as possible, but the hon. member must appreciate that it takes time before these old buildings can be demolished and new ones built.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) dealt with the question of magistrates who were also prosecutors. I listened to the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks with interest. I think the position that the hon. member outlined here for us is the ideal position that one would have liked to have, but unfortunately our manpower problem makes it impossible for us to achieve the ideal position. I think the hon. member will agree with me, however, that most of the prosecutors are very fair in their attitude&#x2014;perhaps not always as fair as we, who would like to win our cases, would like to see; that is only human. But I do not think that the system we have leads to any injustice. Nevertheless I have noted the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude with interest and will bear it in mind.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland), together with the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett), mentioned the question of the salaries of non-White members of the force. The figures mentioned by the hon. members are correct. But they only mentioned the basic salaries; they did not mention the additional benefits such as sick fund benefits, security, leave, allowances and pension benefits. Under present conditions in South Africa to-day you will find very few places where a young Coloured can earn as much and where he can work under such ideal conditions as in the Department of Prisons and in the Police Service. I am convinced of that. Hon. members know what the salaries of members of the force are, and those members who had the privilege of seeing the training facilities of Coloured warders will know what excellent work is being done for these people. The hon. member wants to know why all the vacant posts have not been filled. The reply is simply that they have not been filled because suitable applicants have not been forthcoming, and as soon as suitable applicants come forward, I assure those hon. members that the Coloureds can climb as high as they like in that particular branch of the service. There are excellent opportunities of promotion if the Coloureds are prepared to come forward and to qualify for promotion. But let me give this advice to hon. members who represent the Coloureds in this House. I think the spirit that they should encourage amongst their Coloured constituents&#x2014;and I am pleased to see that the hon. member for Outeniqua is imbued with that spirit&#x2014;is that they should not only want to receive but that they should be prepared to give. They should be encouraged to give their best services. I think that is the spirit that should be cultivated amongst them, and I am very grateful to see that that spirit does prevail. I was very grateful to see that spirit, for example, with the training of Coloureds as warders. A particularly find spirit prevailed amongst those people, and if that spirit can be extended to the whole of the Coloured population, then I visualize very good prospects for them in that connection. I am grateful to the Coloured Representatives who are encouraging that spirit amongst the people.</p>

<p>Hon. members will understand that this salary structure is not one for which I am entirely responsible; the Public Service Commission and the Public Service as such are also concerned in this matter. This is a matter which the hon. member can hardly raise with me because I can give him no decision in that regard. This is a matter to be decided upon by the Public Service Commission, under the responsible Minister. Nevertheless, I have listened to the hon. member&#x2019;s representations and will bear them in mind when this matter comes up for discussion.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has referred again to the salaries of regional magistrates. I think the hon. member made out a strong case in that connection. More than that I do not want to say at this moment. The hon. member also referred to prisons in White areas in which Bantu are detained. The ideal position, of course, would be as stated by the hon. member, but he realizes that unfortunately we do not have these institutions in the Bantu areas. We shall have to acquire them systematically. But in the case of many of these offences for which people have to go to gaol, it would scarcely be a practical proposition to send them to gaol in the Bantu areas because before the prisoner arrives there his time will have expired and he will have to be released again. However, this is a matter of policy which I shall discuss with the hon. member and with the authorities concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) has reminded me that I still owe the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) a reply in connection with the chambers of non-White lawyers. In the first instance, of course, this is not a matter which falls under my Department as the hon. member knows, but I do not want to shield behind that fact. I asked the hon. member by way of interjection whether we&#x2014;not only he but I too&#x2014;as members of the legal profession were entitled to claim that an exception should be made in our favour in so far as State policy is concerned simply because we are members of the legal profession. I do not think we can do so. In what way do we differ from the medical profession or the dental profession or the engineering profession or the surveyors&#x2019; profession in that regard? I do not think that we should view the matter from that point of view. I think it will be better for us to view it purely from the practical angle. But we must not exalt ourselves and say that because we are the legal <span class="col_8297-8298" refersTo="page_1395"/>profession we are entitled to better treatment than that meted out to other professions in terms of the country&#x2019;s policy. I think that if we have a case to put forward, we should say that it is practical to follow a certain course, but then my reply to the hon. member is this: I think that we will serve our cause better if we proceed along the lines which were mentioned by the hon. member for Heilbron and which he could not enlarge upon unfortunately under the rules. Other professions, as I see it, are working along those lines. I think the time has come when we shall also have to work along those lines as far as the legal profession is concerned. I cannot possibly&#x2014;and I say this with a full realization of my responsibilities&#x2014;go to my colleague, as the hon. member asked me to do, and ask him to make an exception in the case of the legal profession because it happens to be the legal profession, because then my colleague is going to laugh at me and I would not hold it against him. As a matter of fact he will not even ask me then to go to the cinema with him! But it is quite a different matter if I go to my colleague and ask him to assist me in certain respects for practical reasons. That is quite a different matter, and that is something that one can consider. But the hon. member must not expect me&#x2014;and on this point we must understand each other perfectly clearly&#x2014;to violate or to help to violate basic Government policies simply because the legal profession is involved. I am not prepared to go to those lengths. But where it is practical, I am prepared for practical considerations to make representations and I shall do so, but not because I want to undermine basic Government policies.</p>

<p>Other professions would be equally keen to do so. Moreover, advocates have not always been in the same building. There was a time when they were in many different buildings. It is desirable to have them in the same building. That is why I say that from a practical point of view it may be desirable, but there is not a single urgent reason why that should be so. Let the hon. member and I be honest. Apart from the fact that it would have been a loss to us socially, would it have made any difference to his practice or my practice if we had not been in His Majesty&#x2019;s building but on the other side of Eloff Street? It would have made no difference to our practices.

<p>That I grant the hon. member at once, but the question of discipline is not something which only applies to our profession. It applies in all the other professions.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. member for Zululand for having raised the question of a bonus for those members of the Police Force who know Native languages. At the moment the allowance is R3 per month. Whether it is sufficient is a matter of opinion. I will go into the matter, but it is not so much that we want people to learn the Bantu languages; we want youths from the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency to join the Police Force who know the language, who grew up with these people and who know their customs. We want those youths to come along and to join the Police Force. Unfortunately I do not have the facts with me at the moment. I cannot tell the hon. member what the position is with regard to the Empangeni and Matubatuba buildings at the moment. I will let the hon. member know in due course. I have also noted what the hon. member said about consultation rooms.</p>

<p>*I have dealt with a portion of what the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) said. I have also noted what he said in that portion of his speech which was, as it were, inadmissible. I was not aware of the circumstances mentioned by the hon. member. I shall go into them and, in co-operation with the authorities, see whether I can do anything further in that connection. If the position is as stated by the hon. member, then something should definitely be done about it, because this is an essential service that these people are performing for us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Musgrave) (Mr. Hourquebie) referred to the Durban magistrate&#x2019;s court. By way of interjection I told the hon. member that I was going to agree with everything he said about those courts. The magistrate&#x2019;s court there is a disgrace to Durban and to any city for that matter. I have already given the hon. member the assurance that as far as this Department is concerned, it is a question of priority No. 1. I personally would have preferred the building on the old site. Judging from what people in Durban told me it would have been better, but I am not the judge in that regard. I am informed that the Department of Public Works has decided on the other site.</p>

<p>Having said that, I think I have dealt with all the points raised by hon. members up to this stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>While this Vote is still under discussion, I think one particular aspect which should receive the attention of this Committee is the question of the increase in crime, and with a new Minister in charge of this portfolio I would appreciate it if he would give his attention to the increase in juvenile crime. Sir, when you look at the statistics and realize to what extent crime is <span class="col_8299-8300" refersTo="page_1396"/>increasing, it is most alarming to find that there is such an increase in juvenile crime. We must concede that crime will always increase with an increasing population, but as far as juvenile crime is concerned, if you look at these figures we see that in 1954 the total number of convictions of juveniles was 158,461. That figure steadily increased until in 1960, six years later, it rose to almost 200,000 convictions of juveniles. To be exact, 193,338 juveniles were convicted for offences, both serious and non-serious, according to a reply that the hon. the Minister furnished in this House on 16 March of this year. This increase in juvenile crime is alarming because various surveys that have been carried out show that the present persistent law-breaker was the juvenile delinquent of yesterday. Surveys carried out not only in this country but in other countries show that certain steps have been taken to prevent an undue increase in juvenile crime. However, I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree that it is a problem that does exist in South Africa as well. The surveys that have been carried out, for instance in the United Stated of America, show, according to the case history of 500 criminals who had been investigated, that 88 per cent of them exhibited criminal tendencies before their 11th year. In Great Britain no fewer than 60 per cent of 1,000 cases of persistent and practised offenders had fallen foul of the law before reaching the age of 16 years. Therefore I think it can be reasonably assumed that to-day&#x2019;s persistent lawbreaker is yesterday&#x2019;s juvenile delinquent. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what steps are being taken in this country in an effort to reduce the increase in juvenile crime. I know that the hon. the Minister may refer me to the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions who, I am pleased to see, is in the House at the present time, because the prevention of juvenile crime is supposed to come to a certain extent under the jurisdiction of that Department. But unfortunately, the staff position being what it is, it is almost impossible for that Department to do very much to prevent juvenile crime. We all know that in dealing with this particular problem the most important thing is to take preventive steps. In the United States of America, for instance, the Police Department has a special youth squad dealing with the whole problem of juvenile crime. In New Zealand, when they realized that this problem was assuming serious proportions, they established a special branch of their Police Force known as the Juvenile Crime Prevention Branch. Here in our own country, in the area of Durban, we have had trouble from time to time, particularly during the holiday periods, when there is an influx of young persons from other parts of the country, with behaviour problems and hooliganism. The Minister of Justice, or rather his predecessor, at one time disbanded a special squad, known as the Ghost Squad, which was producing excellent results in the Durban area. Fortunately that particular squad has now been resuscitated and is, I understand, operating with a certain degree of success. It is hoped that the Minister will extend this scheme as a matter of policy to other large centres in an attempt to prevent this increase of juvenile crime. I believe that this particular preventive work is vitally important. Therefore I do hope that steps will be taken to establish that particular squad as a permanent part of the forces under this Department in order to combat juvenile crime.</p>

<p>Then there are certain other aspects to which I believe the Minister should give his attention in combating juvenile crime. In our urban Bantu townships we know that when night falls terror often reigns in these areas due to the unlawful elements that come out under the cloak of darkness and commit crime and endanger the lives of the law-abiding Bantu living in those townships. I believe it is important that these law-abiding citizens should have confidence in the maintenance of law and order and in the protection of the Police Force. I would ask the hon. the Minister in this regard to take up with the authorities concerned the question of improving the lighting in these townships. The constituency which I represent is near to the Cato Manor area, where there is also inadequate lighting, and we know how high the incidence of crime is in that area. I believe that as a deterrent the Minister should take steps to see that more adequate lighting is provided in these townships. We know of one particular area in Durban along the Esplanade where crime was increasing, and immediately steps were taken to floodlight this area there was a drop in the incidence of crime in that particular section of the city. I do ask the hon. the Minister therefore to take up this matter with the authorities concerned to see that more adequate lighting is provided in the urban townships.</p>

<p>Another matter which I believe should also receive the attention of the Minister in combating crime is the greater use of women in the Police Force. We know that women have been admitted to the Police Force in a clerical capacity. But at the same time social welfare workers know that the police have great difficulty in combating vice in some of the large cities. It is felt that the introduction of women police, to deal particularly with these various social problems that arise, would be welcomed not only by the public as a more effective means of combating these problems, but also by the Police Force and officers themselves. Last year it was suggested that there was a possibility of more use being made of the services of women in the Police Force. A report which appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> of 7 March 1961 said that several of the police officers expressed the opinion that women, specially selected for their education and training in social work, would be able to deal far better with certain aspects of police work than men. I feel therefore that a great number of women should be taken into the Police Force to deal particularly with certain social problems. It is clear from news items <span class="col_8301-8302" refersTo="page_1397"/>which appear in Johannesburg papers that a great deal more can be done to combat this problem of vice. Indeed in January of this year I asked the hon. the Minister of Justice whether his attention had been drawn to an article in the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 29 October 1961 which highlighted this particular problem in that city. His reply was that the Detective-General did not suggest that legislation be introduced, but that certain recommendations were being made to the Department of Justice to deal with this problem. In the second part of his reply the Minister said that the matter was being considered by the Department of Justice. Therefore I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether any further steps have been taken in regard to this particular problem. I feel that the whole question of the prevention of crime is one which should receive the active attention of the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to raise two matters that fall under the control of the hon. the Minister. The first is the matter of civil defence which falls under the control of Justice, but which under modern circumstances extends to a large degree into the Department of Defence. We did raise this matter under the Defence Vote, but unfortunately the hon. the Minister did not reply. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister of Justice whether he can give the House some information on the Brink investigation. His predecessor, or his predecessor&#x2019;s predecessor, appointed Gen. George Brink to draw up a report and recommendations on the question of civil defence. That report has been submitted and I know that local authorities have been trying for a long time to find out what has happened as a result of those investigations, because ultimately the onus falls back on local authorities to carry out the details of civil defence planning. So I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could tell us what has happened in regard to that report, and what he envisages in regard to civil defence. I think the hon. the Minister himself will agree that we cannot afford to ignore completely this aspect of our security in South Africa.</p>

<p>The other matter which I wish to raise is in regard to the Liquor Act and its administration in regard to hotels. The first point I should like to raise is whether in view of the amendments to the Liquor Act made last year&#x2014;the extension of liquor privileges to non-Europeans&#x2014;whether there are not a large number of restrictions currently in force (and which were necessary under the old conditions), which can now be done away with. I am thinking for instance of the keeping of registers in bottle stores and off-sale departments. Whilst it was necessary when liquor was restricted to certain classes and certain races, now that it is available to all races it seems that that is one of the things that can be done away with, and so there are numerous others. I do not want to delay the Committee by going into details, but there are similar consequential restrictions which no longer seem to be necessary. In the same way there seem to be aspects of the inspection system which need no longer occupy the importance which they used to do. I know that there is a strong feeling amongst hotel licensees that officials from his department doing inspections tend at times to become rather high-handed when doing inspections. I know this from personal experience. When I was ill in an hotel last year, a captain of Police insisted on entering my bedroom although the proprietor had told him that I was in bed ill and was not to be disturbed. He insisted on entering the room and said that he was entitled to go into any room and he came in. It is that sort of thing which does happen, and I would ask the hon. the Minister now, where the whole issue is under consideration, to restrict as far as possible the necessity for this continual probing into the normal administration and management of hotels. There is no field in South African life where a licensee is so subject to committing a criminal offence. There is almost no hotel proprietor in South Africa who does not every day of the week make a criminal out of himself, because there are so many restrictions, so many things he can do, quite unwittingly, which bring him into the orbit of the law. I realize that it was necessary. But because there are so many restrictions the control by the police over the management of an hotel tends to become almost a super-management and the hotel proprietor feels ultimately that he is there by the grace of an official in the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Another aspect in regard to this is the supply of liquor to Japanese and Chinese persons. It is an absolutely incredible situation at the moment, because in terms of Proclamation 214, of 1928, Japanese are excluded from the definition of &#x201C;Asiatic&#x201D; under the Liquor Act, which means that they are entitled to the supply of liquor as though they were Europeans. But if any liquor licensing board imposes a restriction in granting the licence, laying down that there should be facilities for Whites and for non-Europeans, then a Japanese must use the facilities for non-Europeans. So if you have an hotel solely for Whites, the Japanese are treated as Whites; but if the hotel has a Coloured canteen, then the Japanese, although not Asiatics, are classed as non-Europeans and have to be served in the Coloured canteen. And if there is a restaurant with a liquor licence, then the Japanese and Chinese may not enter that restaurant with a liquor licence, if it is in a White group area. So a Japanese can in the same area (a) drink as a White man (b) drink as a Coloured, and (c) commit an offence if he goes into a licensed restaurant. The same person in respect of three adjoining buildings, can go into a White bar and drink quite legally, he can go next door into a Coloured canteen and drink quite legally, and he can walk into a White restaurant with a liquor licence and be arrested for committing an offence. When you come to the Chinese you have the same sort of provisions. The Chinese are classed as Asiatics&#x2014;South African Chinese. They can get special exemption, but <span class="col_8303-8304" refersTo="page_1398"/>they are Asiatics and therefore they are excluded from the provisions of &#x201C;White people But if you are a foreign Chinaman, you are classified as a White person, and therefore you are entitled to go into a White hotel or into a White bar. So if a South African Chinaman is entertaining his father or his uncle who is visiting him from China, his relative who is visiting this country, can go and have a drink in an hotel, but his South African host, who may be his own son or relative, is not entitled to do so. And a South African Chinese falls under all the conditions imposed by Section 95, unless he gets an exemption under Section 101 of the Act. So you have the provision now where South African Coloureds, South African Natives, South African Asiatics will be able to obtain liquor, whereas Japanese fall under three different provisions and Chinese fall under three different provisions. A Chinaman can either be refused permission, or he can have exemption, or if he is a foreigner he is treated as a White person. I hope the hon. the Minister will do something to clear up this Chinese puzzle which faces every hotel proprietor in South Africa.</p>

<p>Finally, may I ask the hon. the Minister whether he will make a statement in regard to his plans in regard to the Malan Commission and the major recommendations and the amendments to the Liquor Act which have been hanging fire now for some two years, because it is a matter of anxiety to the industry.*</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has asked certain questions to which I wish to reply before I come to the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). Firstly, as regards the matter of Civil Defence, it has always been an open question to me whether this is a matter that falls under Justice, or whether it should fall under Defence. In any event, I am accepting that it is part of my duty to look after it as it falls under Justice at the moment. The hon. member will recall that one of my predecessors appointed Gen. Brink and others to collect certain data. That Commission, if I may call it that, in the course of years collected very much information, and all that is required now in that connection is something that a &#x201C;one-man commission&#x201D; unfortunately could not do in the past, and that is to correlate the information that was gathered and then, as regards the bigger towns, to draft plans as the circumstances require as to what steps should be taken in times of danger and of war. But it is not only my Department that may suggest schemes in this regard. That is why, when I took over this portfolio, I felt that I should go further, and in consultation with my colleague the Minister of Defence, I proceeded to appoint a permanent Committee that will now have to take this matter further than Gen. Brink took it with the limited means at his disposal. A committee has been appointed consisting of a senior officer of the Department of Justice, a senior police officer and a senior army officer, and it is now the task of that committee of three not only to correlate the information that has been collected, but, in fact, to draft a scheme and submit it to the various local authorities. I do not think the hon. member can expect me to be able to go further than that at this stage.</p>

<p>What progress have they made?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>They are engaged on it now. The committee was appointed by me shortly after I took over the portfolio and when I ascertained what the position was. So I cannot tell you exactly what progress they have made, but here we now have a permanent committee with a definite mandate to put this matter right, and I think that is further than we have ever gone in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the Liquor Act. The hon. member has rightly said that at the present time the licence-holders are burdened with many restrictions that will no longer be necessary when the non-White Liquor Act comes into operation, &#x201C;for the basis of all those restrictions was to combat smuggling, and the moment these people can obtain liquor in their own right, the reason for the existence of most of those restrictions falls away On the other hand, when we come to the system of classification of hotels&#x2014;the hon. member knows what our policy is in this connection&#x2014;then again many of the inspection difficulties the hon. member has rightly mentioned fall away. In other words, we can expect that when the new Liquor Act is published later this year (and it will very definitely be published), many of the restrictions will not appear in it. At this stage I should like to emphasize that the new Liquor Act will come up for discussion in this House on a non-party basis next year, and then hon. members will find that many of the irritating restrictions to which licence-holders have rightly objected in the past will no longer be found in that legislation. I wish to repeat this, because there is some misunderstanding about the matter, that if and when the new Liquor Act is introduced next year, it will be a measure that I shall indeed introduce, but the tradition that a measure of this kind be a non-party measure will be maintained on that occasion also. As the hon. member has rightly stated, there are certain anomalies in regard to the Liquor Act. All of us are aware of that. They are anomalies that will in any event be removed if and when the new Liquor Act is introduced.</p>

<p>May I now avail myself of this Committee Stage to appeal to the Press not to make all kinds of wild statements and predictions as to what will and will not be included in the Liquor Act. That does nobody any good. To give you some idea: The other day there was a report in the newspaper that I would, during this Session still, introduce legislation restoring the old system of &#x201C;bar-maids&#x201D;, And you have no idea how much <span class="col_8305-8306" refersTo="page_1399"/>consternation that caused among barmen and how many of them wrote me letters expressing their displeasure in this regard. So if I may make an appeal to the Press, then it is to refrain from speculation in this regard, and to let matters run their course until such time as we shall publish the Bill, and then surely everybody will be able to see what the Bill contains. As regards the recommendations of the Malan Commission, it has to be decided now which recommendations of the Malan Commission will be embodied in the Bill and which not.</p>

<p>I have made a study of the Report of the Commission, but of course time does not permit me to give a judgment on that now. It will have to be decided now which recommendations will be included in the Bill and which not. If I incorporate some and omit others then, because it is a non-party measure, hon. members of course will be at liberty to come forward with other views or to propose some of the other considerations by way of amendments to the Bill. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) raised the two matters of juvenile delinquency and of police women. Of course we have not yet had police women in South Africa. It is a matter of principle against which my predecessors from all parties have always set their face in the past; they felt, for very good reasons, that the time had not yet arrived in South Africa to appoint police women. I think one of the main reasons why Ministers of Justice of all parties decided in the past not to appoint female police, was because of the composition of our population, and they felt that women would be exposed to a position of danger to which they ought not to be exposed, to a greater extent than in other countries. I myself have certain views in this regard and I have noted what the hon. member has said about it. It is a matter that will be discussed again by me with senior police officers when we have our periodic discussions. As regards the question of juvenile delinquency. I have been given the assurance by the officers of the Department of Social Welfare, the field officers, who are very well informed, that serious juvenile delinquency is indeed on the decline in South Africa.</p>

<p>What about the statistics?*</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, our difficulty in connection with the classification of data in regard to crime, is that it puts us in the position that we are creating the impression with our statistics that the incidence of crime is much greater in our country than it actually is. The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) for instance has pointed to the large number of traffic offences. Now we take all the traffic contraventions and we include them in our classification of contraventions, and then we tell the world that as many as 100,000 contraventions occurred in South Africa, whereas thousands and hundreds of thousands of them are traffic offences of such a nature that other nations will not regard them as contraventions, yet we are in fact classifying them as contraventions. I have asked myself whether the time has not arrived to put this matter of crimes and contraventions in the proper perspective and whether we should not disregard completely all the minor little things that normally are not contraventions, when we compile statistics of contraventions of the law. I think we are rendering our country a disservice. But that is merely typical of us. We always are honest with the world. We always say: Look, this is the picture, and then we furnish the whole lot. Other people do not do that. But I have wondered whether the time has not arrived, in the circumstances, to adopt a different classification in order to put the position in its proper perspective. I should like to assure the hon. member for Umbilo that my colleague has assured me that the tendency as regards serious juvenile delinquency does not show an upward trend, but there is a downward tendency thanks to the good work and actions of the officers of the Department of Social Welfare on the one hand, and thanks to the preventive actions of the police on the other hand&#x2014;the hon. member knows how they acted in Durban.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I gave notice of a contingent notice of motion which I should like to move now, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Committee of the Whole House on the Legal Practitioners&#x2019; Amendment Bill have leave to consider the advisability of making provision therein for the payment of a minimum remuneration to articled clerks other than articled clerks referred to in Section 20 (a) of the Attorneys, Notaries and Conveyancers Admission Act, 1934.</block>

<p>In the Bill before us provision is being made for the payment of a minimum salary of R50 to certain types of articled clerks. The articled clerks covered by this Bill are those who have entered for a five-year period and who after having served three years pass their legal examinations and are allowed to appear in court. No provision is, however, made for articled clerks who have entered for two- and three-year periods. Those who have entered for a period of two years are those who are barristers and wishing to become attorneys become articled for the purpose. After having served for one year they are allowed to appear in court. Those who enter for three years are those having a degree who become articled. After having served two years they are allowed to appear in court. These two categories have been excluded from the minimum salary to be paid to articled clerks. To rectify the position, I will move an amendment in the Committee Stage in terms of the motion.</p>

<p>Fourth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Finance Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This is the usual Bill to give effect to certain proposals in the main and railway budgets. In addition, it deals, with miscellaneous matters affecting either the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Railways Administration. As the various provisions of the Bill are explained in the White Paper which hon. members have before them, I do not propose to deal with the Bill clause by clause. I shall, however, confine myself to giving supplementary information on certain of the clauses.</p>

<p><span class="col_8309-8310" refersTo="page_1401"/>Clause 1 deals with the disposal of any profits arising from the purchase of shares on the London market on behalf of institutional investors in the Republic. Details of this scheme, which I announced in my Budget speech, have been worked out by the Treasury and the Reserve Bank and particulars have been given to the public. The scheme is now in operation and some purchases on the London market have already been made.</p>

<p>Clause 3 deals with advances to the Bantu Education Account. According to the latest estimates, any such advances which may become necessary are not likely to exceed a total amount of R500,000.</p>

<p>Clause 6 gives effect to the announcement by my colleague, the Minister of Mines, in his reply to the second reading debate on the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Bill, namely that sufferers from pneumoconiosis in the fourth degree, who are already in receipt of a constant attendant allowance, would be granted an extra allowance of R10 per month when the provisions of that Bill come into operation. I may add that there are altogether about 440 persons in the group who are to benefit from this proposal. This number is, however, gradually being reduced.</p>

<p>Clause 23 deals with the withdrawal of coins which may be found to be surplus to requirements. According to figures supplied by the Reserve Bank, half-crowns to the value of about R900,000, i.e. about 3,600,000 coins, and 3d. or 2&#x00BD;c coins to the value of about R300,000, i.e. about 12,000,000 coins, have accumulated in the hands of the banks and are beginning to create a serious storage problem. If the demand for these coins does not improve, the State must be in a position to relieve the banks of this problem. This is what we propose to do here, namely, that if and when any of these coins become redundant and are no longer popular and so become a burden on the Reserve Bank thereby creating storage problems, the Treasury will have the power to withdraw such coins from circulation gradually.</p>

<p>If there are any questions in regard to any of the clauses I have not specifically dealt with, I am sure hon. members will find the answer in the very exhaustive White Paper which has been tabled.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>On this side of the House we do not object to the second reading of this Bill. I think&#x2014;and the Minister will agree&#x2014;that this is a Bill which can be dealt with more appropriately in Committee. I should like to make one observation, however, at this stage. Clauses 12 and 17 contain various amendments to the Estate Duty Act. In this connection I think it is unfortunate that we have legislative amendments to another Act in an omnibus Bill of this nature. If legislative amendments are treated in this way, it is very difficult to follow the statute in question. I consider, therefore, that it would have been better to have the relative amendments to the Estate Duty Act in a separate Bill. Otherwise it becomes increasingly difficult to follow a particular statute. The amendments to the Estate Duty Act proposed here are intended to close gaps in that Act and it would have been preferable to have such amendments embodied in a separate Act rather than have them included in an omnibus Bill.</p>

<p>We have no objection, however, to the second reading of the Bill and will deal with the clauses separately in the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>We have already gone a great extent towards removing all unnecessary provisions from the omnibus Bill. The principle on which we act is that this Bill must be confined to financial aspects only. Only provisions which do not warrant the introduction of a separate amending Bill, are included in it. We do not want to have a multiplicity of Bills. The amendments to the Estate Duty Act which the hon. member referred to, probably form a borderline case. However, it was considered that these amendments do not warrant the introduction of a separate Bill.</p>

<p>I realize that the provisions of this clause constitute a temporary expediency in respect of the current year. It must, however, be obvious to the Minister that the demands on the Bantu Education Account are growing. This year we have had another Bill, the University College of Fort Hare Transfer Amendment Bill, which is going to place an additional charge on this account. The revenue accruing to this Account, on the other hand, remains more or less static. I should like to know from the Minister whether he is sufficiently optimistic to believe that advances of the nature dealt with in this clause will be required only for the current year. To my mind some other provision should be made. The real solution to the problem lies in increased contributions from the State, rather than deal with it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as is being done here.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot give information off-hand as to the amount which this Account at present owes.

In regard to the point raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South), I should like to point out that we shall have to introduce a clause of this nature whenever that is necessary. What the hon. member is really proposing is a change in principle. This I cannot discuss under this Bill. I can only explain what the underlying idea is. There is a deficiency in the Fund by reason chiefly of the fact that the collections are not what they should be. I understand, however, that if these are up to expectations, it will not be necessary to make any provision of this nature at all.</p>

<p>The object of this clause is to empower the Treasury to withdraw half-crown and 3d. or 2&#x00BD;c pieces from circulation. Ostensibly there is no demand for these particular coins. I should like to know, however, what is intended to substitute for the 3d. or 2&#x00BD;c piece. I ask this in view of the fact that this piece is being used for telephone calls and parking meters.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I already indicated earlier this year that the whole coinage system would be reviewed. This, however, is not the occasion for discussing it. We are dealing here only with those coins that have become unpopular. Apparently there are more of them than are required for use in telephones and parking meters. Actually there are 12,000,000 of these coins that have become superfluous and therefore are no longer being used, we cannot permit these coins to go on accumulating. The demand for these particular coins apparently is not such that the stock can be consumed. That is why we are now taking this only practical step. Last year we also did so with pennies and half-pennies when these became too numerous for handling. We then also asked for powers to withdraw those coins from circulation with the object of melting them for the making of other coins. That is what is being done here also. This is only a sub-division of the reform that is planned in respect of our coinage system. However, I am unable to say with certainty at this stage whether the 3d. or 2&#x00BD;c pieces will be replaced. However, it is possible particularly when regard is had to the number of these coins that have already become superfluous. Apart from this problem, however, there are other more important problems we are now investigating&#x2014;for instance the sizes of the coins, the composition of them, what will appear on the coins, etc. These are matters that will still have to be investigated. I have no preconceived ideas in this regard, but will discuss the whole matter with the Director of the Mint and then decide what is practical.</p>

<p>This clause embodies a strange principle. We are dealing with a surplus which will have accrued for the financial year 1961-2, and the clause now proposes to utilize that surplus for that same year. I do not know whether something similar has ever been done in the past. It is, to my mind, an innovation which I hope will not be perpetuated because such a procedure interferes with the finalization of accounts. I cannot see how one can arrive at a surplus for a year and then take that surplus and utilize it for the same year in respect of which it is supposed still to be a surplus. This seems to me to be introducing a very strange accounting principle.</p>

<p>The origin of this clause, of course, goes back to last year when the hon. the Minister of Transport found himself in difficulties in respect of an amount of R4,000,000. He has now found that money not by means of an adjustment as he promised he would do but as a result of a fortuitous increase in the surplus for 1961-2. Had the hon. the Minister been present here, I would have put my question to him in the form of the following verse&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>As I have told the House on previous occasions, this Bill of course is not the main Liquor Bill we hope to deal with next year. This is only a small amendment of the Liquor Act, amendments which I do not doubt in the slightest hon. members on both sides of the House will regard not only as unassailable, but which will also have the support of both sides.</p>

<p>This Bill contains two principles mainly. The first is the grant of privileges to sell liquor to Coloureds and Asiatics in their own group areas; and secondly, there is a smaller provision that nevertheless contains an important principle, namely the extension of the so-called compulsory stock provisions to three kinds of South African beer. Those are mainly the two principles contained in this Bill. In referring in this connection to the compulsory stocking of more than one kind of beer, hon. members will recall that we have the same principle in respect of wine and other kinds of liquor, except <span class="col_8317-8318" refersTo="page_1405"/>that under the Liquor Act it is more than three in the case of the ordinary kinds of liquor. I shall say more about this provision later on. As regards the Coloureds and Indians, the new provision that is being inserted will make it possible for them to enter the liquor trade on the authority of the Minister of Justice and on the recommendation of the National Liquor Board without having to purchase the ordinary liquor licence and without having to apply for it to the local liquor licensing boards. Now hon. members will recall that we are dealing with a position here that as regards the larger towns and cities, we are over the quota in almost every case. In most cases it will be a long time before a quota will be available again. If such a quota does arise, we are aware that there will be a tremendous number of applicants who can make out a good case as to why such quotas should be granted to them. Now it is a fact that with one exception, as far as I know, there is only one Coloured company that holds a liquor licence, namely the one in Athlone, and that Coloured company could acquire that licence only because they were prepared&#x2014;and I do not think the House or that company will take it amiss of me if I say so to-night&#x2014;to pay &#x00A3;18,000 for that licence. If we are serious&#x2014;and I have not the slightest doubt that we are serious on both sides of the House&#x2014;about giving the Coloureds their share in the liquor trade, as we ought to be serious about giving them their share in respect of all the other matters in their own areas, then we have to concede that we have to do this thing for the Coloureds. Now it so happens that I announced last year as the policy of the Government, by way of a Press statement, which I have repeated on several occasions, that it is our view that in regard to this matter, we want to give the Coloureds their share in the liquor trade. I do not think there is one of us who will have any objection to that on any moral or other ground. The people who may object to it of course are the existing licence-holders because it will or may prejudice their trade. But this will be an objection that will not be valid inasmuch as it will be a selfish objection, which has regard to self-interest only. So I do not have the slightest hesitation in recommending to this House that we should grant those licences to the Coloureds. Now I have not just lightly decided to grant licences of this nature to the Coloureds, but I have done so after I had very full discussions with various Coloured groups. I can assure hon. members that I have had discussions with Coloured groups of divergent views and ideas, and that the provisions of this Bill were drafted only after I had heard the views of those Coloured groups. They were at one with me on two provisions. They agreed with me that licences should not be granted to individual Coloureds, because these licences from the very nature of things would be limited, but you have to try to distribute them having regard to the back-log the Coloureds as a group have in this respect. The suggestion came from them that you should not give it to one single Coloured person, so that as many as possible of them may share in that trade. That is why hon. members will find that this Bill provides that it should be a Coloured company of at least ten members, and to prevent one individual obtaining a monopoly in the business, that no one may possess more than 40 per cent of the shares.</p>

<p>The second principle on which the Coloured leaders agreed with me, is a matter we shall have to consider very seriously. The Coloured leaders put it to me, and I have taken it to heart, that there are few if any places where the more affluent Coloureds can entertain their friends or can take their visitors to dinner. That is why hon. members will find the principle in this Bill that an off-sales licence will only be granted if there are certain on-consumption rights accompanying it; in other words, there should be the establishment together with the off-sales division, of a restaurant, a place where people may be entertained, or an eating place. We want to put it very clearly. We do not wish to encourage people to be drunkards, and we do not wish to encourage the sale of liquor in a bottle store without more ado, but we should like to guide the drinking habits of these people in such a way that they go hand in hand with their eating habits. I am convinced that whereas we are now making a new start for the Coloureds, had we done so for ourselves right from the start, our liquor habits would have been wholly different to-day, and then we would have had less reason to complain about the abuse of liquor among our White people than is the case at present. I have now stated the two principles of this Bill, and said that the grant will be made only to a company or association having not less than ten Coloureds or Asiatic shareholders, and that no one shall have more than 40 per cent of the shares, and it follows of course that the premises in respect of which the licence will be granted will have to be situated in a proclaimed Coloured or Asiatic group area. I have also explained what the position will be in respect of off-sales rights as against on-consumption rights. For the rest hon. members will find in this Bill that as in the case of authorities for the sale of liquor to the Bantu, the Minister may also impose restrictions and conditions upon this authority that apply to ordinary licence-holders and their premises. The fee for the authority is prescribed in the Bill and is limited to a maximum of R150. As in the case of the Liquor Act in respect of the Bantu, hon. members will find in the Bill that regulations may be made and promulgated in due course to determine the time and the manner of applications for these authorities.</p>

<p>I have referred to the fact that the principle contained in the Liquor Act in respect of the stocking of certain quantities of wine or brandy has been incorporated in this Bill too. At the present time, as hon. members know, liquor licence-holders are required to supply the reasonable needs of the public by stocking and exhibiting for sale at least six kinds of brandy and eight kinds of wine of independent manufacturers. The Malan Commission recommended <span class="col_8319-8320" refersTo="page_1406"/>that these requirements be extended to three kinds of South African beer to be available and effect is given to this recommendation in Clause 6 of the Bill. As hon. members will recall, the underlying reason why we provided that six kinds of brandy and eight kinds of wine shall be stocked, was that everybody felt that it was an unsound state of affairs that one group or one person should acquire a monopoly in the liquor trade. All countries in the world share that view. That is why I have no hesitation at all in asking that in view of the same state of affairs, and without blaming anybody, but merely from the point of view of principle, we should not encourage a monopolistic state of affairs, and that this principle should be incorporated in respect of beer. Hon. members will ask me whether we have three kinds of beer. I do not believe we have it within the ambit of this Bill, but we have to keep the back door open in the event of another company coming forward. Competition is the lifeblood of any undertaking, and also of political parties. The more competition there is, the better. I am sorry only that some small parties disappear and are absorbed by the others. Now the old Act provides that a compulsory supply should be stocked, but now there are several ways in which this provision may be evaded, and it was never intended, and it is not in accordance with the spirit of the Act, that that provision should be evaded. Although the Act provided that that compulsory supply should be stocked, no penalty was imposed for failure so to stock that supply. But now failure to stock the compulsory supply is being made an offence. From the nature of things it should be so, for what is the good of saying this has to be done and there is no sanction? The position at present is that the police report to the Liquor Licensing Board once a year whether the compulsory supplies have been stocked. The Malan Commission found that this provision was ineffective and recommended that the police should at any time hold an inspection, and where the requirement was not complied with, an interim meeting of the Liquor Licensing Board should be convened to consider the cancellation of the licence concerned. This procedure is not only cumbersome, but a sanction for the failure will be much more effective. Hon. members will agree with me that we no longer want to play policeman. Why should the police go and snoop around in the bars to see whether supplies are being stocked?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I say so too, and it is not fair that the police should now hold an inspection and report at the end of the year, or call for an interim meeting. We have to leave it to mutual competition for this provision to be given effect to, where the companies themselves take the initiative. If there are complaints, why should the police go and snoop around? Let the companies competing with one another see to it that it is carried out. I should just like to add that an hon. member of the House has told me how people evade this provision. They do in fact keep the supplies, but they have a special cupboard against the wall and they store the liquor in that with the label against the wall. In other words, technically these people are within the law, but they are not complying with the spirit of the law. But I do not want the police to involve themselves in this kind of thing. It can be left to mutual competition, and I am particularly grateful that hon. members on both sides of the House agree with me in this respect. Apart from certain consequential amendments appearing in this Bill, provision is also made that mines that are authorized to sell liquor may sell minerals too. Last year we forgot about the Act dealing with mining land, and then we provided that we could sell whisky to the Bantu but not soda. All we intend doing now is to provide that the soda may also be sold. In the past, under the old Act, a mining company could supply Bantu beer or Kaffir beer to his Bantu free of charge, but it could not sell it to them. Now we are providing that it may sell not only minerals and cool drinks, but Bantu beer as well. This does not impinge upon the people who have concessions for trading on mining land. This clause authorizes mining companies to sell under these circumstances. Certain bodies, such as the Health Board for Peri-Urban Areas in the Transvaal, have been held not to be urban local authorities for the purposes of the Liquor Act, although they also have Bantu locations under their control. The amendment proposed in Clause 2 (c) will now make it possible for such bodies to apply under Section 100<i>bis</i> of the Liquor Act for a licence to sell liquor to the Bantu. The present position is that city councils and other local authorities may sell liquor to the Bantu, but according to the opinion of the legal advisers, unless we say that peri-urban boards are specifically authorized, they may not do so. We are now using Clause 2 (c) to put that matter right.</p>

<p>During the discussion of the Bantu Beer Act. hon. members will recall, the question arose as to whether a non-White servant occupying a room on his employer&#x2019;s premises is a lawful occupier of the premises also, and may therefore bring liquor onto the premises without the consent of the employer. Actually it was never intended that he should be able to bring liquor on to the premises without the consent of his employer, but it was not quite clear whether that is the position, and we are now putting it beyond doubt that such a servant must have the consent of his employer before he may introduce liquor into his room, and hon. members will find that in Clause 3.</p>

<p>I have now fully explained the Bill, particularly as regards its principles and its details, and I have done so trusting that I will enjoy the support of members on both sides of the House, particularly the clause dealing with the Coloureds, and I am glad that one representative of the Coloureds is present here now. As <span class="col_8321-8322" refersTo="page_1407"/>my friend is concerned about the Coloureds at all times, I trust that when I resume my seat he will come forward as a very enthusiastic seconder of this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I do not believe there are many members of this House who will disagree with what the hon.

I do not believe that any member will object to the granting of licences to Coloureds or Asiatics in their own areas. But this Bill, as it stands now, does not provide clearly that it must be only Coloureds and Asiatics. According to this Bill, there may be an association of one or two White persons plus ten Coloureds.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is why I am bringing this point to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, so as to have absolute clarity. It is in Clause 5. It provides that the Minister, or a person acting on his authority, may, subject to such conditions or restrictions as he may deem fit to impose, grant an authority in writing to the nominee of an association having at least ten Coloureds or Asiatics as shareholders. It does not say who the others may be. It does not lay down that it should be an association of Coloureds or Asiatics with at least ten members.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>That is the intention.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is the object, but as usual with this Government, they come along with this kind of legislation, poorly drafted, towards the end of a session when Parliament is tired and their officials tired, and they hope to get the legislation through without opposition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Read the English version.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The English version is still clearer. It refers to &#x201C;written authority to a nominee of any association having not less than ten Coloured or Asiatic persons as shareholders or members in other words, it may be any association, as long as there are also only ten Coloureds or Asiatics. Next year the Minister will have come along with an amendment because he now wishes to force through this Bill at the end of the Session.</p>

<p>But that is not the last of the defects in this Bill. I quite agree with what the Minister has said to-night. I have no objection to the object as explained by the Minister, but this Bill makes it possible for unfair competition to arise, because the ordinary applicant for a liquor licence in the Transvaal pays &#x00A3;5,000 plus &#x00A3;100 per annum. Under this Bill a person may obtain an authority for &#x00A3;75 or R150, as against R10,000 for an ordinary White person or any person who applies for a licence. Secondly, the ordinary applicant, White, Coloured or Asiatic must, if he wishes to have an on-consumption licence, build an hotel with a minimum number of rooms, and it will cost him at least R60,000 to R80,000 to erect such a building. He has to provide all the services that go with the hotel, the room service, the serving of meals and all the other facilities and amenities an hotel has to provide. Now this point arises. When last year we were discussing this principle of authorization, we were dealing with a new group of customers, a new class. They were not the existing customers of existing businesses. It was the Bantu who were now becoming the new clientele, the new buyers of liquor. Under these circumstances, by accepting the principle of authorization, we did not impair any existing rights. But now we are dealing with an authorization that will draw away some of the existing customers of existing licence-holders, for the Coloured person and the Asiatic always were entitled, even under the old Act, to buy liquor for on- and off-consumption. In other words, we are taking an existing class that already have the right to buy liquor, and that already buy it from the existing businesses, away from the existing businesses, hotels or bottle stores. Now we are creating a new group of vendors, enjoying special privileges, and those special privileges are that they do not necessarily have to provide an hotel&#x2014;definitely not. They may provide only a bar and then they are given on- and off-consumption facilities. They need not pay the same licence fees and they need not provide the same facilities. Such a person may, without capital, or with very little capital, obtain an authority without the guarantees the ordinary applicant has to provide.</p>

<p>I wish to make it very clear that I am now talking in my personal capacity, for we on this side of the House have left the matter to the free vote of our members. It is the tradition of the House, and this side of the House has always honoured tradition, that when we discuss liquor, we talk as individuals. I should have said this at the outset, but I now say that every one of us on this side is free to speak on his own behalf as a person.</p>

<p>As regards myself, Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to the granting of a licence even on privileged grounds as compared with the existing licences. But the advantages such an applicant for an authority enjoys should not be of such a nature that it is unfair to the existing rights of existing traders. That is the point I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister very clearly.</p>

<p><span class="col_8323-8324" refersTo="page_1408"/>Under the Bill as it stands, even if that is not the intention, a White man or two White men may establish an association. Each of them may take 40 per cent of the shares for their own account. Then they get 10 Coloureds or Asiatics with 2 per cent each. In terms of this Bill as it stands, that association will fall within the ambit of the Bill. You will then have two White persons holding 80 per cent of the shares, divided 40 per cent as against 40 per cent, with a sham front of 10 non-Whites. Furthermore Mr. Speaker, the authority these persons will obtain may provide that the prices at which these persons will be able to sell may be much lower than the usual prices in the ordinary hotel. For instance, I have here regulations in regard to authorization in the case of Natives and here is a provision to the following effect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No liquor shall be sold by the holder of the authority at a price which is more than 10 per cent lower than the prices charged by the holders of bottle liquor licences, etc.</block>

<p>The Minister has the power under Section 100 of the principal Act to lay down certain conditions. He may fix the price at which liquor may be sold, a price lower than that in the ordinary bottle store. So not only has the applicant for an authority less expense, but he may also sell at a lower price. The Coloured Areas are usually nearer the White areas than the Native Group Areas. As soon, therefore, as you obtain an authority to sell liquor more cheaply than in the neighbouring White area you will merely reverse the smuggling trade. Instead of their buying at the White bottle store and smuggling the liquor to the non-White area, they will purchase at the cheaper non-White bottle store and smuggle it back to the White area. You simply reverse the smuggling trade. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is his intention to permit liquor to be sold at a cheaper price under the authority he will grant, or whether the price will be equivalent to the ordinary retail prices in the ordinary bottle store.</p>

<p>It is in the hands of the Minister to provide that. This is a question of his policy. But we are now being asked to grant the authority without any restriction, and he may do with that power what he likes. He may fix the price as he wishes; he may impose the restrictions he wishes to impose. Before we vote for this Bill, I should like to ask the Minister to tell the House and the country clearly that he does not intend to establish a competing business that may sell at a lower price, and thereby cause smuggling from the non-White to the White areas.*</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Thanks, that was one of the objections. Then I come to the next point, and that is the provision as to where these authorities may be granted. The wording is &#x201C;in an area predominantly occupied by such persons&#x201D;. A proclaimed group area is clear, but an area that is &#x201C;predominantly occupied by such persons&#x201D; is a very vague statement of where these authorities may be issued. I am asking this, Mr. Speaker, because the amendment of last year laid down that no licence shall be granted to an ordinary applicant within half a mile of any non-White group area. In other words, the ordinary dealer, White, Asiatic or Coloured, cannot under the ordinary law obtain a licence within half a mile of an ordinary non-White area without the approval of the Minister.</p>

<p>These are points on which we should have great clarity, Mr. Speaker, for the power we are giving here permits the Minister to give an authority along the borders of group areas or even in unproclaimed areas where predominantly Coloureds or Asiatics reside, even though it has not necessarily been declared such a group area. Even in those areas the Minister may grant authorities, but the White man may not come within half a mile of that area. In other words, one forces the border trade into that area.</p>

<p>Thank you. But, Sir, the further we go the more we see the weaknesses of this Bill. Here we have already had three points that could easily have been put right in this Bill. I hope the hon. the Minister will accept amendments in the Committee Stage. Firstly, we should have clarity in regard to who will constitute an association; secondly, where these authorities will be granted. We learn from the Minister now that it will not be within half a mile of the boundaries. It will not be an association including White persons. Two important points. And thirdly, it will not include the right to sell liquor at cheaper prices. Those are three very important principles the Minister has not put very clearly here, and I am thankful to him for it. He has now eliminated three of the big objections to this Bill. But it would have been much better <span class="col_8325-8326" refersTo="page_1409"/>if these principles had been embodied in the Bill so that we could now know clearly precisely what the objects of this Bill are.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>We do not say so in respect of Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It says so in the Act of last year. There is another point in regard to this so-called association. As the Bill reads now, I should like to know from the Minister what the position will be of a public company with shares that are sold on the stock exchange and where, e.g., 10 non-Whites have bought shares in that company. In terms of the provisions of this Bill, the licence of an existing licensee falling under one of these areas will be converted into an authority. If he holds a licence to-day, that licence will be converted into an authority. If a public company falling within the provisions of this Bill, owing to the fact that it has 10 Asiatic or Coloured shareholders, has such a licence, what will its position be? I hope the hon. the Minister will explain to us what the position of such a company will be.</p>

<p>Another point is that there is no provision that an association as contemplated here has to be registered in accordance with the ordinary commercial laws of the Republic. As this Bill reads now, 10 persons may come together and say, &#x201C;We are an association&#x201D;. It cannot be done in the case of any other business in commerce. They have to be registered as a company or as a partnership. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether Coloureds and Asiatics will be entitled to form an association without having themselves registered, as in the case of ordinary commerce, as a company or a partnership, and thereby fall under the provisions of the Companies Act.</p>

<p>Then I come to the other principle of this Bill. I do not wish to dilate upon the Coloured and Asiatic trade. I think I have now covered the main points. The other points may be discussed in Committee. But the second principle is that of the compulsory stocking of at least three kinds of beer. The hon. the Minister himself said in his introductory remarks that he was not sure whether there were three kinds of beer available. But we, the House of Assembly of South Africa, are now being asked to put a statute on the Statute Book in terms of which every licence-holder in South Africa is to be compelled to stock three kinds of beer. And the Minister cannot tell us whether there are three kinds of beer in South Africa. But notwithstanding that, whether or not it is available, he asks us to provide that every licensee shall stock at least three kinds of beer. [Interjections.] Unfortunately it does not include gingerbeer of Bantu or kaffir beer. What this Bill does as it reads to-day, is that any brewery, except the two that exist already, may enter the market and in terms of this Bill its beer will have to be bought. And it may charge any price it likes for its product. It will merely have to be reasonable; that I concede, but it may charge two or three cents more per bottle and under this Bill each licensee will be compelled to stock that beer. I think it will be much better if the hon. the Minister were to provide that at this stage, where we know of only two kinds of beer&#x2014;save the two that might come on to the market&#x2014;a licensee should keep at least half of the available kinds of beer. Then it will be equitable. Then you have free competition, for then the one brewery has to compete with the other. But as long as there is no choice, there is no competition. I should like to suggest that the Minister should consider laying down that every licensee should stock at least half of the available number of different beers in this country. If there are three, he will compel the three to compete, for the one trying to make too much profit will fall out. If another comes in, as we understand might be the case, then the licensee has to stock two of the three. If still others come in, he has to keep three kinds, and so on. You exclude a monopoly but you also eliminate the possibility that there will be only three kinds and that the brewers of those three kinds will maintain that monopoly as a group. As long as it is less than the number of breweries you will have free competition. For we have found in practice, in the case of the restriction on wine and brandy, it has not had the effect at all that off-consumption vendors have kept in stock more kinds of wine and brandy. They have stocked just enough to comply with the law. For in any trade, the demands of the public determine what a dealer stocks. If the public does not demand a certain kind, the shopkeeper&#x2014;whether he sells clothing or liquor or anything else&#x2014;will not stock that particular article. [Interjections.] Yes, but we are now getting two new breweries.</p>

Why should we now lay down conditions for a state of affairs that will only occur a year hence? For in the year in between we shall see to it that the beer of the two companies that are going to brew in the Transvaal only will be forced upon every vendor throughout the Republic. The product of the Transvaal brewers will be forced upon the licensees in the Cape and Natal and in the Eastern Province. [Interjections.] No, Mr. Speaker, it is not so. The wording is very vague.

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister of Information will give us a little information in this regard. I hope he will tell us how he justifies a new company&#x2014;we know who the company is&#x2014;automatically having an established market for its product, for every one of the 1,800 hotel-keepers in South Africa will have to buy his beer whether he sells it or not. So you immediately create a market for that beer. That beer has to come from the Transvaal to all the other places. The hon. the Minister of Information is now prepared to foist it on the liquor trade just because the Minister, for some reason or other, refuses to give any latitude, will have no competition, while there are only three breweries. Had there been only two, there would have been competition. Then the owner could choose between two of the three, but at the moment he has to buy the three, and it will remain like that for quite a while. [Interjections.] I know it is one of the recommendations of the Malan Commission, but, Mr. Speaker, it is a principle that has been tried out. It does not work: it only works when a vendor has a choice. But in terms of this Bill as it reads at present, there is no choice. I hope it is clear to the Minister that, although his intention is a good one, the effect of this Bill will not be what he wishes it to be. As he has now done by way of interjection, I hope the Minister will make it possible for us to support this Bill unanimously by removing the problems and difficulties I have referred to here and by putting it right in the Committee Stage on this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>There is much of what the hon. member who has just resumed his seat has said, that I consider the hon. the Minister should give his attention to. There is something else I should like to mention. I should like to say here that I do not think there is another hon. member in this House to-night who has seen every hotel in the Peninsula inside and out, as I have, during a tour of inspection I made at the request of the association of under-privileged hotels. They took me on this tour of inspection: it cost me nothing. The discussion of this Bill finds me slightly unprepared, because I was to have had an interview to-morrow only with the person who drafted the Bill, with a view to the drafting of an amendment to Clause 5, paragraph 100<i>sex</i> (1).</p>

<p>I should like to bring this matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister now. I have the data here-, I can mention the figures. But there are people here in the Cape Peninsula who have created facilities for the Coloureds, hotel facilities, that nobody else was willing to create for them; people whose throats are going to be cut within the next six months if the hon. the Minister does not <span class="col_8329-8330" refersTo="page_1411"/>come to their assistance. We have two Coloured hotels in Kimberley; one in Paarl, the finest hotel in Paarl; we have a luxury hotel in Retreat; we have two large Coloured hotels in East London; we have two in Port Elizabeth; four in Durban; we have two in Pietermaritzburg, and there are five in Cape Town.</p>

<p>I myself have visited those hotels, and I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that they themselves apply considerably more apartheid than the Government is applying to them. That I have seen with my own eyes. The people there have a decent luxury hotel with three small dining-rooms that can accommodate from six to 12 to 24 guests. Professional men or teachers or whoever you like, can go there and they can meet there as decent people. That is a service those hotels are providing. Such an hotel only has a liquor licence for its bar. Around it other liquor trade is being carried on, and we know by whom. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat has referred to these people. They go along and they buy small, old hotels last visited by a White man 80 years ago, in District Six, for the value of the land of that hotel, merely so as to be able to obtain the transfer of the licence to another place. I now say this: We should either make these Coloured hotels to which I have referred white elephants that will not be able to remain in business if they do not obtain off-consumption licences, or we should make valuable institutions of them as they are to-day. I can give you the assurance, Mr. Speaker, that if the hon. the Minister visits these hotels he will agree with me that the people are rendering a service, a service that has to be appreciated. I can mention the name of one person, but I shall not do so lest you think I wish to advertise him. But that person has invested nearly R200,000 in that business. And his throat is being cut. As I have said, this caught me a little off my guard; only to-morrow was I to have had a discussion. But I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should amend Clause 5, paragraph 100<i>sex</i> (1), either here or in the Other Place, in such a way that these under-privileged hotels in South Africa&#x2014;and I am not referring to the Coloured hotels only, I am referring to White hotels as well&#x2014;will not be handicapped by concessions that may be made in terms of this clause, at least until the principal Act is placed on the Statute Book next year. Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether this has occurred to the hon. the Minister, but, as this clause reads now, a Coloured man or a group of 10 Coloureds, who have a bar in one small room, may apply for an off-consumption licence. These under-privileged hotels to which I have referred have all been inspected by me; I have been given photographs of all of them, taken within and without. These people provide board and lodging. I want to mention one hotel. This hotel has 30 rooms. It provides cheap boarding to the man in the middle income group of &#x00A3;50/&#x00A3;60 per month.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the hon. member is now pleading in the interests of a group of people who are not covered by this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#von_moltke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>With great respect, Mr. Speaker, I should like to refer you to Cause 5, which covers this whole matter. The people are providing board and lodging. One hotel, e.g., has 35 people on its staff. The bar next to him has one person on its staff. He has to keep 35 people on his staff; he must provide a menu; he has to keep his rooms tidy. He has to render all those services, and now, in terms of this clause, a man may open a bottle store next door to him in two small rooms. It is a pity it came so suddenly, but I really feel that the hon. the Minister should give his earnest attention to this matter, and, if there is any possible opportunity, before the Bill is passed by the Other Place he should amend this clause. If it is not practicable for him to do so this year, then I should like to urge, in fairness to so many under-privileged hotels in South Africa, that the hon. the Minister should give favourable consideration to the question of freezing the grant of such licences for off-sales in the meantime&#x2014;it is only a matter of six months&#x2014;until he introduces the principal Act next year. I can give the hon. the Minister the absolute assurance that, if that is not done, I could mention several hotels in the Cape Peninsula that will go under, and these are hotels that cost from R100,000 to R200,000 each; hotels that are rendering services that no bottle store provides; hotels that offer a service that no bar provides. I should like to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider this matter. I shall tell the hon. the Minister what I have in mind, and that is the amendment of the Bill before it passes its final stage, or otherwise for him to give the assurance that, during the six months from now until the principal Act is placed upon the Statute Book, the whole position will be frozen. Otherwise I am afraid a very great injustice is going to be done to many people who have invested, for the sake of the public and for their own sakes, much capital in the hotel business.</p>

<p>I accept that that is the intention. But I merely wanted to indicate to the Minister that the clause was capable of the interpretation placed on it by the hon. member for Durban (Point). But I accept the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that the intention is as set out in the marginal note. I accept that completely. The intention is then that Coloured people should now have the right to have licensed premises to sell liquor. This right which the hon. the Minister now wants to give to the Coloured people must be universal, a right which in my opinion is a great advantage to the Coloured people. They should not feel that they have not got the same right in this regard as the Europeans. I believe it is a great step forward in recognizing the rights of the Coloured people in South Africa. But, Sir, the Minister must appreciate that it appears to me <i>prima facie</i> to be a limited right, limited not in the sense of the people who should be able to get an authority, but limited as to the area. The Act of 1909 and subsequent Acts in regard to reserves such as Genadendal, Groot Drakenstein and Pniel, which are Coloured areas, have imposed a limitation that they cannot get a licence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>No, with respect that is not the case. The information I have got is to the effect that that is not the case. Let us take a place like Genadendal. The Act which covers Genadendal and similar places still stands. If the hon. the Minister wants to override that Act, I think he must either repeal it or place something in the Bill now before us. There is nothing <i>prima facie</i> in the Bill that will make that possible. I draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to it, and two friends of mine who have studied the Act closely agree with me that there is absolutely nothing in the Bill to that effect. My information is that those Acts make it absolutely impossible for any authority to be given and I do not think the hon. the Minister can override those Acts which established these places. There are lots of churches there, and I think the hon. the Minister ought to go into that aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>There is another point I want to raise. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is the intention that Coloured people and only Coloured people should be licensees in the Coloured areas. The hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) mentioned certain hotels which are owned by Europeans in completely Coloured areas, areas declared as such by the Minister of Coloured Affairs who is sitting next to the hon. Minister. Let me take an area like Elsies River.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is the question of quotas. There is nothing in this Bill which indicates to me that when the Liquor Licensing Court sits for the granting of liquor licences under its present powers, these authorities which are granted by the Minister will have an effect or will not have an effect on the Liquor Licensing Board with regard to quotas. That is why I wanted to take the example of an area like Elsies River where there is a European hotel or Athlone where there is a European hotel.</p>

<p>I am sorry, an hotel owned by Europeans, but in a completely Coloured area. Quite an amount of money has been put into these hotels. Now if the hon. the Minister were to grant two or three authorities in the Elsies River area, you might find that the quotas would be affected and that the Liquor Licensing Court might say: I will refuse to renew the liquor licence for the hotel in the Coloured area owned by Europeans because there are now other liquor licences which had been granted. That is the danger. Of course the Liquor Licensing Board is an autonomous body and it has great powers and the question whether liquor licences should be granted or renewed may be affected by these authorities that the Minister is going to grant. I am not going to say any more on the subject. I must admit that I have not studied a great number of the amendments in this Bill. I will allow the Bill to go through, but I am raising these points which affect the Coloured people.</p>

<p>But I will only be completely satisfied if these authorities will be granted to every Coloured area, and I am not convinced that this Bill gives the hon. the Minister the power to grant a licence to a place like Genadendal or a place like Pniel, or any other Coloured area which has been established under the 1909 Act, and I want to tell the hon. the Minister now that unless he can satisfy me that that is so, I will not vote for the Bill, because I am not prepared to allow further monopolies to be granted in special areas to the exclusion of others. If the Coloured people are entitled to be licensees, then they must have the universal right and it must not be restricted to specific areas to the exclusion of other areas. I hope the hon. the Minister will give me a complete answer in regard to that point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. I. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps one should have regard to the background of this Bill, for if you do that you will obviously agree with it. The whole idea behind it is that certain areas have been proclaimed as Coloured areas under the Group Areas Act, and the sale of liquor in these areas is completely in the hands of White people. That is an unsound position. One would like to see, surely, that where you have a proclaimed Coloured Area, the distribution of liquor should also be conducted by Coloureds or Asiatics (not to differentiate between the two). That is the basis of this, and it is on that basis that I say that speeches such as those made by the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) and the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) are not relevant here at all. With that end in view one wants to try to do the best for, and make the best of, the Coloured areas, and if we then look at Clause 5, we see there it is stated very clearly: &#x201C;Special authority for sale of liquor by associations of Coloured or Asiatic persons.&#x201D; If there is a White man who also has money invested in that company, then it surely is no longer an association of Coloureds and Asiatics. Then there are White people involved, surely, and so it is not applicable. And if this clause is not worded in such a manner as to exclude Whites, it will be worded so later on. Personally I believe that that is the construction.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>May I refer the hon. member to page 5, right at the bottom, sub-clause 12 of Clause 5, which reads as follows:</p>

<p>&#x2026; or other association of which all or some of the shareholders or members are Coloured or Asiatic persons &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. I. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is why I say that if there is a loophole in the clause itself, it will have to be closed, for the object of the clause is indicated in the summary contained in the marginal note of Clause 5. It must be an association of Coloureds and Asiatics only. The hon. the Minister of Information also served on the Commission, and he will be able to confirm that it was the whole intention that in the same way as the Whites like to distribute their own liquor in the European areas, so also it is not more than proper and honest to give the Coloured man also an opportunity to distribute liquor in his own area. The tragedy really is this, that the Coloureds are being exploited in the Coloured areas by Whites at the present time, not because the White man is to blame for it, but because an opportunity was created there for White people to go and distribute liquor there, and there were no Coloured people to do so. That is why one of the hon. members has just referred to an hotel in Athlone that was owned by White people. It is the only centre for the distribution of liquor there. You have that position and for the uplift of the Coloured it is necessary that a Bill such as this be applied.</p>

<p>In the Western Province the Malays really pass for Coloureds, and it is difficult to differentiate between the two, and for this reason it is put thus. In the north there will probably be difficulties and we shall probably have to make other arrangements, for there are separate Asiatic areas as distinct from Coloured areas. But we leave it at that for the moment. But that is the whole object of it. And we should move in the direction that as in the case of other commercial undertakings in the Coloured areas, they eventually will have to belong to the Coloureds exclusively, so the object of this also is that things should eventually develop in the direction that liquor distribution will be in the control of the Coloureds alone in the Coloured areas.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has missed the point completely in regard to beer. Permit me to mention this example to him. At the moment there are only two kinds of beer that are manufactured in the country. The hon. member says &#x201C;If half is made compulsory&#x201D;. Nothing will be more welcome in South Africa to the big beer companies than that, for then they will stock only one kind of beer and then no other beer company will ever be able <span class="col_8335-8336" refersTo="page_1414"/>to enter the market, for the one company manufacturing beer in South Africa is a tremendously powerful company financially. I am not saying this to the prejudice of the company that it has become big and financially strong; they are rendering very good services, and they are producing first-class beers, but in fact they are all only one kind of beer, for it is being manufactured by one company only.</p>

<p>No, two. So what the hon. member is suggesting is impossible, for then a second kind of beer will never enter the South African market. That is why the recommendation of the Commission was, and this Bill gives effect to it, that if the kinds of beer are available, that at least three kinds of South African beer shall be stocked by the distributor of liquor. It is the least that can be done, and it will have the proper effect that this question of a monopoly will be eliminated and that there will always be an opportunity for competition, which the hon. member also would like to see. He merely misunderstood the matter somewhat, for otherwise he would not have argued in the way he did. The hon. member for Karas is now advocating off-consumption licences for hotels that have no right of sale of liquor.</p>

<p>That is not in question in this Bill at all. It will probably be in question next year when the big Bill comes along, and then he can discuss it. It is not in question at all here that off-sales privileges be granted to hotels in general&#x2014;I am not referring to Coloured areas now. I should like to emphasize this only, that the idea of this Bill is applicable only to the areas that have been proclaimed Coloured areas under the Group Areas Act. Now I also have some misgivings, but I do not think they are important misgivings in the sense that they cannot be put right next year when the big Bill is introduced. The hon. the Minister now comes along with Clause 6 (1), the underlying idea of which is that bottle licences, restaurant licences, hotel licences in those areas, or wine and malt licences, or bar licences, should comply with the requirement, and that the licences therefore may be created by such a company that consists of Coloureds and Asiatics or only Coloureds, as it is defined. Now my concern is not so much with bottle licences, for they sell for consumption at home, and we cannot really stop it now, although I think it will be a pity if we have to extend it on a big scale, but the bar licences are what are bothering me most, and wine and malt licences are the things that are next bothering me most. Now I should like to say this for the consideration of the hon. the Minister: Leave things as they are, but merely warn people that next year there will be new definitions for wine and malt licences and for bar licences. I am of course referring now to the position if the recommendations of the commission are accepted. But then any bar licence and any wine and malt licence will also be subject to the condition that food will also have to be provided.</p>

<p>That is an hotel, and we are not talking about that. The hon. the Minister has explained it so well that the idea behind the Bill is that food and liquor will go together. Now I should like to say at this stage, that even if this Bill is applied under the old conditions of bar licences, and of wine and malt licences, there will be new definitions of these kinds of licences next year that will make it obligatory for the holder of such a licence to provide food also. I do not want to go into detail now, for that is not included in this Bill. If the hon. the Minister will issue that warning, I think we may proceed with this Bill as it stands. The only indication that is required is that people may also be compelled, as in the case of a restaurant, to provide food.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? If I understood him correctly, he said it does not concern hotels that are owned by White people in the areas. It is a fact that if the bottle-stores or bars or what have you can sell liquor, where they will of course compete with the persons who have hotels, it is possible that the hotels, in which people have invested much money, will be destroyed?</p>

<p>That would be the right direction if that were to happen. I am now saying how I myself feel about it but I think one does not want to kill the existing hotels in the Coloured areas at once, but they may be permitted to carry on as long as they are rendering a service there, but eventually they will have to get out, they will have to be bought out eventually. They will not be able to remain there for an unlimited period. It is a Coloured area and it will have to become a Coloured area utterly and completely.</p>

They need not suffer any loss, but they are not at home there, any more than we shall permit Coloureds to come and run businesses in White areas or to come and reside there. We cannot permit White areas to emerge in Coloured areas eventually, for that is the whole object of it, surely!</p>

<p>Let me say at once that I have every sympathy with the idea that is behind this Bill, but I believe the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) is perfectly correct as to the effect of this Bill as it stands. Quite clearly under Clause 5 the &#x201C;association&#x201D; could be an association which is controlled by non-Whites or any other racial group. I accept that that is not the intention. The hon. Minister will agree with me that it is a clear principle of construction that in construing the wording of the clause, the side note is entirely disregarded by our courts. In the circumstances it is essential that the proposed new Section 106 should be amended. The argument that has been put up by the hon. member for Durban (Point) is strengthened by the provisions of sub-section (12) of the same Clause 5, because there it is accepted that the shareholders in a company which already has a licence, can be deemed to be an authority granted or renewed under this section.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate that, but there is no point in arguing this across the floor of the House with the Minister of Information. The position is quite clear. It is intended that these should be associations which will have only Coloured shareholders. As the hon. the Minister has said that he will put that right, I am perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>I would like to raise certain points though which have not been raised up to now, and the first is this: I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us what is to be the race group of customers, i.e., is there to be a particular group of customers who alone can be served by the holders of these authorities? As the Bill stands read with the Liquor Act, an authority holder may supply liquor to all classes in their own areas, it seems to me. In other words, these new licences will be granted for Coloured areas, but it is clear that in respect of sale of liquor by the bottle they will not be limited to residents of the group which occupies those areas. We should have clarity on that point. I would be glad if in his reply, the hon. the Minister would tell us in relation to sub-section (12) whether if those associations which are referred to in that clause happen to be under the control of Europeans, they will be deemed to have been granted a licence or renewed a licence in terms of this clause. It is a point on which there might just as well be clarity.</p>

<p>The further point I would like to raise is in regard to &#x201C;associations&#x201D;. It would be as well to get the position clear, because under the Companies Act, you can&#x2019;t have a partnership or association with more than a certain number of shareholders, and the question would arise as to whether this Act overrules the Companies Act in that regard and might be admissible for some limitation to be placed. In regard to a company of course that position is perfectly clear, but then the question arises what is the position in regard to the transfer of shares in the company? One could go on raising innumerable points. I raise them merely to say that I very deeply regret that legislation of this complexity comes forward at this very late stage.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have tried to put it very briefly in view of the time, because I do not want to delay this Bill. But I put it to the hon. the Minister: The Companies Act provides that there shall not be an association, i.e. that there cannot be an unincorporated body which has over 50 members, I think it is. Here there is a provision for associations to be formed with no limitation of membership.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is a minimum but no maximum. Certainly all the legal members of this House will agree, that in dealing with a business matter of this sort, it would be far better from a practical point of view to limit licences to companies, but if there are to be associations, it should be made perfectly clear that the limitations on associations or partnerships which exist in other laws should be abided by so far as this legislation is concerned.</p>

<p>With great respect to the hon. the Minister, I would suggest that where you have a new piece of legislation which has a provision like this, it is not certain that it will have to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>An association can take on any form. It can take on the form of a company, and then naturally it falls under the Companies Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite true, and then you have the articles of association which must comply with the companies law, but here we are introducing a provision for associations. That association, I suggest, might have to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act, the provision for instance which limits the number of members. There can be an association which is not an association incorporated as a company or under some other Act of Parliament. I am raising these points now because thereby we might shorten the Committee Stage on this Bill. I take it that the hon. the Minister would like to pass this stage of this Bill to-night and in case there are other speakers. I will deal with these points again in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>My principles are that it is wrong to facilitate the availability of liquor to the people of whom I regard we are guardians. I know from experience that the Coloured people cannot resist the urge to drink, and this Bill will make this more easier available. I have had much experience. During the wartime I recruited Coloureds for active service and I was guardian for every family whose husband or child went on active service, and I got to know the inner life of the Coloured people, and I know the disabilities they suffer under through this drink habit, especially among the men. In many of our Coloured families, the men never bring home at the end of the week any of their pay. The womenfolk have to earn a livelihood by doing charwork or taking in washing, and things of that nature, and I think that at this stage of the development of the Coloured people it is wrong for us to provide them the same facilities in Coloured areas as the Whites enjoy in theirs. We can deprecate what has happened under White control as regards the availability of liquor to the Coloured people!, but at the same time it does remain our responsibility. Now this Bill is going to throw the responsibility on the Coloured people themselves, and imagine that under this Bill we will create drinking places where the Coloureds will meet; perhaps there will be certain light refreshments and they will stay there until they have spent all the money they had in their pockets. I think it will be to the detriment of the Coloured people. I have had examples of that this year in Cape Town, where respectable Coloured people have said that they cannot resist the urge to drink and that they have always welcomed the limitations on the availability of liquor to them. I say that if they have to purchase the liquor in the White areas and to carry it home it will not be so readily available to them as it would be in the specified Coloured areas. I feel that it is my duty to voice my opinion on any legislation that makes liquor more easily available. One can say that this legislation lays down the same principles as those that apply to the Whites, for instance in respect of what the various drinking houses have to keep in stock, but we cannot say that the Coloured people will avail themselves of the various beers that will be kept in stock, because the Coloured people are not beer-drinkers like the Europeans. They like stronger liquor and the stronger the liquor, the better as far as they are concerned, and it is the stronger alcoholic liquor that they have an urge for. I have no doubt that keeping stocks of beer will only be a matter of entry in the books and that there will be no marked consumption of beer by the Coloured people. In fact with my knowledge of the Coloured people, I have very rarely seen a Coloured man taking beer. They are not beer-drinkers. If we could induce them to drink beer, it would be better. The labour force in Great Britain of course consists of people who consume beer, and beer is a wholesome drink, especially as compared to raw liquor. I feel that it is right that people in this House should resist any extension of the availability of liquor. When the Bill comes before this House next year which the Minister has notified us of, I imagine there will be strong opposition to that legislation. But I am afraid that by committing ourselves to this legislation at this stage, we may perhaps prejudice our case next year when we have to face up to the new Liquor Bill which the Minister has foreshadowed.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the amendment to the Explosives Act of 1956 embodied in this Bill results from South Africa terminating her membership of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Section 31 (a) of the principal Act provides <i>inter alia</i> that the provisions of the Act shall not apply to the importation, storage, use or transport of any explosive by the regular naval or military forces of the United Kingdom. No such exemption is granted in the Act to any other country.</p>

<p>As a result of South Africa leaving the Commonwealth, the Government has therefore decided as a logical step to replace the specific exemption in the Act in respect of the United Kingdom by a more general provision, in terms of which the Minister of Economic Affairs, after consultation with the Minister of Defence, can grant exemption to any country, including the United Kingdom, by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, and can similarly cancel or suspend any exemption thus granted.</p>

<p>In drawing up this Bill the present position existing between Britain and South Africa as regards defence matters was kept fully in mind and it is also the South African Government&#x2019;s intention to grant the necessary exemption to the British forces as from the date of commencement of this Bill, if Parliament approves, in order by so doing to maintain the present position.

<heading>EXPORT CREDIT RE-INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>Third Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Export Credit Re-insurance Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the amendments proposed in the Bill now before the House are regarded as being urgently necessary in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the Export Credit Reinsurance Scheme which was established in terms of the Export Credit Re-insurance Act of 1957.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, that Act provides for the promotion of South Africa&#x2019;s export trade through the re-insurance by the State against political and transfer risks involved in export transactions. As the scheme has developed, however, practice has shown that the existing legislation has certain deficiencies which to a certain extent hamper the smooth functioning of this re-insurance scheme and, as I have said, we are now proposing to remove these deficiencies by means of a few amendments. I shall now briefly explain the amendments which we propose effecting.</p>

<p>Hitherto the scheme has only provided cover in cases involving suppliers&#x2019; credit. This type of credit provision is satisfactory when short-term transactions are involved. When durable consumers&#x2019; goods, capital goods, or expensive construction work are involved, interim and long-term credit are required and suppliers&#x2019; credit is often unpractical so that the financing of such a transaction has to be undertaken by a financial or governmental institution in the exporting country. This type of institution advances the money to the foreign buyer on condition, of course, that the funds thus lent to the latter will be used mainly or exclusively to pay for goods or services supplied by the country providing the credit. This means in practice that the country providing the credit on occasion undertakes the financing of a transaction part of the components of which originate in a country other than the country of the buyer. In this regard I can however mention that the South African scheme at present already provides overall cover in respect of contracts in which certain components produced in other countries are added to South African manufactured equipment. Such cover is however limited to cases where such a foreign addition does not represent an unduly large proportion of the whole and the addition is necessary for the obtaining of a contract. If the foreign addition is, however, relatively large, for example more than 30 per cent to 40 per cent, the granting of cover is only considered in respect of the South African component part of the contract. It is now the intention to apply the same principles in the granting of cover in respect of financial risks.</p>

<p>Although at present it is impossible for the Republic to undertake the large-scale provision of capital goods to the outside world on liberal credit terms, it is nevertheless considered advisable that we should participate in this type of export in specific cases and that we should cover financial credit. It seems as though the construction and engineering industries particularly are taking an ever greater interest in participating in this type of export trade and that they appear quite able to compete with the outside world on a cost basis. What is more, export transactions of this nature can become a valuable source of foreign exchange and stimulate the country&#x2019;s economy directly and indirectly. Clauses 1 (a) and 6 of the Bill deal with this matter.</p>

<p>As the scheme is implemented at present, the State provides cover against the risk of postponed payment or non-payment in cases where the buyer is a governmental body. While the object of the scheme is in fact to cover such political and transfer risks, Section 2 (a) of the existing legislation in fact contradicts that intention by providing that the circumstances must be beyond the control of the buyer, as is apparent from the fact that the section concerned provides that the non-compliance with the conditions of payment must be due to &#x201C;the operation of a law, or of an order, a decree or regulation having the force of law&#x201D;. Insurance against the non-compliance with the conditions of payment is therefore only afforded in those cases where such non-compliance is due to governmental action over which the private buyer probably has no control.</p>

<p>In Clause 1 (b) we now propose that this anomaly in the existing legislation should be removed by the deletion of the words &#x201C;in circumstances beyond the control of the insured and the buyer&#x201D; which appear at present in Section 2 (a) of the Act.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the intention is to extend the cover which can be afforded under the present legislation to include any war and not to confine it to a war between the buyer&#x2019;s country and the Republic or any other country, as the Act provides at present.</p>

<p>Similarly, it is proposed that it should be possible to insure the credit risks of a South African exporter when they arise from hostilities, civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection or any other disturbances in a third country.</p>

<p>These two aspects of re-insurance constitute a real need in the case of South African <span class="col_8355-8356" refersTo="page_1424"/>exporters and the object of Clauses 1 (c), 1 (d) and 1 (e) of the Bill is therefore to make it possible to grant fuller cover in respect of risks which arise from wars between any countries, as well as civil wars, revolutions, etc.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment contained in Clause 2 of the Bill is aimed at enabling the Export Credit Re-insurance Scheme, with the approval of the Minister of Economic Affairs and in consultation with the Minister of Finance, to allow a higher percentage cover than the maximum of 90 per cent which the Act at present authorizes. In practice cover varying between 70 per cent to 90 per cent of the export value has hitherto been granted, depending on what has been considered desirable in each particular case. The underlying principle in this instance is that the exporter himself should retain an interest in the transaction in order to induce him to be cautious, and furthermore that, as a general rule, profits should not be insured.</p>

<p>In exceptional cases practiced experience has shown however that the affording of cover to a higher percentage than 90 per cent is desirable. Cases where capital goods are delivered the value of which is considerable and in respect of which the contractor makes use of loans are examples of this. As a result of the contingent obligation which the exporter must bear in respect of the uninsured percentage of a specific transaction, he sometimes finds it difficult to obtain sufficient financial assistance particularly if his profit margin is lower than the percentage I have mentioned. It is also conceivable that even in the case of exports for example of raw materials or agricultural products a higher cover than 90 per cent may be considered desirable if surpluses arise which have to be exported at an exceptionally low profit margin or at no profit margin.</p>

<p>The fund which has been established for the purposes of the Export Credit Re-insurance Scheme is being built up out of premiums received on insurance policies, as well as funds voted by Parliament for this purpose. The administrative costs and claims which result from re-insurance are met from this fund.</p>

<p>As there is a possibility that the fund at any specific time may not be strong enough to meet claims and Parliament will therefore have to be asked to vote additional funds, a provision has hitherto been inserted in all policies that claims will not be met before the expiry of a period of nine months after the date on which such claims arose. The intention was that, even if Parliament is not in session, there would be sufficient time to have the necessary funds voted.</p>

<p>The Export Credit Re-insurance Scheme has been approached from time to time to afford cover in cases where South African exporters tender for the delivery of goods overseas and considerable amounts are involved. Owing to the provision in the insurance contracts that payment of claims will only be effective nine months after a claim arises, tenderers are obliged to make provision in their tender price for a possible loss of interest which may result from the fact that they will have to wait for payment for some considerable time. In sharply competitive markets the addition of interest for such a relatively long period can mean the loss of a contract. If interest is however not added to the tender price, the South African exporters find it a particularly heavy burden to carry this interest themselves, particularly when big contracts are involved and they are compelled to make Use of outside financial assistance. The facilities which the South African scheme offers in this regard at present are also inadequate, compared with similar schemes in other countries, in that the prescribed waiting period to which I have referred, is six months in the Netherlands and four months in the United Kingdom for example.</p>

<p>In order to make possible the payment of claims at an earlier stage, consideration has been given to the possibility of replacing the fund&#x2019;s deposit account with the South African Reserve Bank with a current account which can be overdrawn to a certain amount, subject to Treasury guarantee, if claims arise which exceed the reserves of the fund. The amount by which such claims exceed available funds can then be voted by Parliament as soon as possible thereafter in order to reimburse the account concerned. Such an arrangement will make it possible for the scheme to meet claims sooner and will facilitate its administration by making it possible to tide the fund over smaller deficits, if the current premium income is such that an overdraft can be repaid within a reasonable time from that income.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this problem, it is therefore being proposed in Clause 3 of the Bill that the Minister of Economic Affairs will have the power to overdraw the account of the Export Credit Re-insurance Scheme&#x2019;s fund at the South African Reserve Bank, subject to the condition that the adjustments which must still be effected at any specific time in respect of such an overdraft must not exceed the amount to be specified in the guarantee to be given to the bank by the Minister of Finance. This authority will only be used to enable the fund to deal with claims more expeditiously than is at present the case, and it will further only be necessary to ask for Parliamentary appropriation if the fund cannot obtain from its own resources, for example by way of premium income, the amount required to meet the outstanding overdrafts.</p>

<p>All these amendments are being proposed at the request of the Credit Guarantee Insurance Corporation in consultation with the advisory committee which has been appointed in terms of the Act, and I can assure the House that it will meet a genuine need on the part of South African exporters.</p>

<p>Clause 4 of the Bill merely provides that any amendment to the principal Act, just as the principal Act itself, will apply to South West Africa. Clauses 5 and 6 adjust the wording of this legislation to the change in South <span class="col_8357-8358" refersTo="page_1425"/>Africa&#x2019;s form of government. Furthermore Clause 6 provides for the necessary adjustment in the long title of the present Act, with a view to the amendments which I have just explained. This legislation which I am moving can make an important contribution towards helping our exports.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>This side of the House obviously agrees that this Bill is necessary. The Minister&#x2019;s explanation was clear and precise and I do not propose spending much time on the matter. The extension of the export credit insurance to financial credit is especially welcomed, and as the Minister said, this allows credit on contract prices, and it is obviously of importance to contractors in South Africa who are at the moment looking for contracts all over the world. This Bill also allows the Minister wide powers which we think are justified. It extends his right to give cover in the more unstable conditions over a wider area, and the Bill also allows the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, to increase the margins of insurance beyond the 90 per cent figure. This is obviously welcomed and is the result of experience, as the Minister said, because in the export a large number of capital goods on which the profit is very small, the 90 per cent figure has in the past been found not to be large enough to cover the cost to the exporter. Now we will be able under certain circumstances to give a guarantee for the total cost of the product. The other provisions were explained very clearly by the Minister, in regard to the finance to be made available to the Corporation through the Reserve Bank, and in the event of the Reserve Bank suffering a loss they can then come to us to make good that loss. I suggest to the Minister that this matter must be watched very closely in future. I saw a report during the last few days that the members of the Common Market have now decided that they will not allow credit to be granted to any of their members for a period longer than five years, although I believe that in the past this was observed more in the breach than otherwise. Anyway, we welcome this Bill because it renders assistance to our exporters.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to say that I am glad the hon. the Minister has seen the error to which I referred at the second reading, the psychological error which was made in omitting this word, namely &#x201C;advisory&#x201D;. We feel, however, that the harm has already been done. The Minister knows as well as I that as a result of the Bills which have been before him during the past two or three years, suspicion has arisen. On the Select Committee we on this side also tried to prevent this psychological mistake which was committed when this word was omitted, but hon. members in their wisdom did not accept our suggestion and omitted this word, and now the Minister has restored it. I am not going to devote any more time to the evidence on this matter, but I think the Minister will agree, after studying the evidence before us, that the overwhelming majority of those to whom this question was put and who gave evidence before us, felt that this council should not only be advisory but that the word &#x201C;advisory&#x201D; should also appear in the Bill. I have gone into the matter and I find that we put this question to 21 witnesses and of them 19 stated that &#x201C;advisory&#x201D; should appear in the Bill and that the council should be an advisory council. I am therefore glad that the Minister has now conceded this point by restoring the word, where it should have been in the first place. However, I still feel that I must stand by the proposal I made originally, that is to say, that the council should not be called a &#x201C;National Advisory&#x201D; Council. I wonder why in the Afrikaans version the Minister is using the word &#x201C;advieserende&#x201D; (advisory) in respect of an &#x201C;adviesraad&#x201D; (advisory council). Furthermore, I feel that we must insist on the omission of the word &#x201C;National&#x201D;. I have already said that no one can have any objection to something that is national, which has the characteristics of the people as a whole. But I pointed out at the second reading that the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; in our vocabulary has unfortunately already acquired a restricted meaning. Over the past few days I have listened once again to my hon. friends opposite, and <span class="col_8359-8360" refersTo="page_1426"/>one repeatedly finds that they use the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; in a narrow political sense because they speak of &#x201C;a National Party Government&#x201D;, &#x201C;a National Cabinet&#x201D;, and &#x201C;the National Party&#x201D;. This word has therefore lost that broader meaning which it always had and which all of us would like it to have, and it has not only acquired a restricted meaning, but it also to a certain extent creates suspicion.</p>

<p>We can all sing together, but we cannot all talk together! I know that when we sing together, that hon. members will in any case sing false! I have pointed out that the word &#x201C;national, does not have that comprehensive meaning which it should have. In other words, as far as Clause 8 is concerned, the Minister is not including all sections of the population in the legislation.</p>

<p>It is for these reasons that I now make a further appeal to the Minister to simply call the Council an &#x201C;Advisory Education Council&#x201D;. Then he may make a further contribution towards removing the suspicion which already exists and for this reason I stand by my amendment which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>I just want to give my opinion regarding the two submissions the hon. member has made. The first is that he objects to the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;. I still maintain that this is in fact a National Education Council. An opportunity is being created whereby this council can give advice to any Minister who is concerned with the training of students. There are Bantu education, Coloured education, the Railways and the Public Service and the training they provide. These are not institutions which fall under one department such as the Department of Education, except that that department is the agent for training artisans on behalf of the Department of Labour. This council will, therefore, in fact be a National Education Council. Regarding the suspicion which exists in respect of the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;, I think that the interjection which the hon. member has just made about the fact that the United Party has swallowed the National Union is really appropriate.</p>

<p>They disappeared into the indigestible stomach of the United Party. But this council will be of national scope and I maintain that we would be doing the council an injustice.</p>

<p>As regards his second argument, namely that it should be called an &#x201C;Adviesraad&#x201D; in Afrikaans, I think that this is more of a philological difference between us. I personally feel that &#x201C;Adviesraad&#x201D; is an Anglicism. It is an advisory council of national scope which will give advice, but to me &#x201C;Adviesraad&#x201D; does not sound as well. I think we should not quarrel over the name, and we should submit to the authorities. I personally feel in this way. I remember that when we sat on the Select Committee on the Constitution, the question was also raised of whether the Republic should be called &#x201C;Die Republiek Suid-Afrika&#x201D; or &#x201C;Die Republiek van Suid-Afrika&#x201D;. The matter was vigorously debated. Some language experts said it was correct to speak of &#x201C;Die Republiek Suid-Afrika&#x201D; but colloquially &#x201C;Die Republiek van Suid-Afrika&#x201D; is said, and we then decided on that. Here we again have a question regarding which we can quote dictionaries and language experts, but my personal feeling is that we should call it the &#x201C;Nasionale Adviserende Onderwysraad&#x201D; (National Advisory Education Council Bill). That will be the more correct name, as far as the Afrikaans version is concerned, and I do not think there is any difference as far as our English-speaking friends are concerned. I am sorry that I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>Before I propose my own amendment I should like to say a word about what the Minister has just told us. When we were on the Select Committee we tried to find a suitable name on which we could agree, and as I said in the second reading debate, I went to the English Education Act, where they call the council the Advisory Council for Education. The Minister has said it affects the whole nation and the whole country and therefore we should call it the National Council. But whilst he was speaking I was looking at the statutes passed last year. It is not the custom in South Africa to call anything &#x201C;national&#x201D; because it applies to the whole country. Let me give some examples. There is the Unemployment Insurance Act. It is not the National Unemployment Insurance Act. There are several more examples. All the Acts are just called by their names without adding the word &#x201C;National&#x201D;. It seems to me that it is superfluous, tautology and unnecessary repetition.</p>

<p>I am talking about these statutes and not about a society which the hon. member dislikes. In the statutes we do not use the word &#x201C;National&#x201D;. There is the Dairy Industry Act, not the National Dairy Industry Act, although it applies to the whole country.</p>

<p>But I want to come to my own amendment, standing on the Order Paper to-day. Perhaps I should explain that I have withdrawn the other amendment, and I want to explain the reason for doing so. When we were on the <span class="col_8361-8362" refersTo="page_1427"/>Select Committee, I proposed the original amendment standing in my name on page 901. The present one is on page 912. The original one was in order when I proposed it on the Select Committee, but now that the principle of the Bill has been approved, I realize that to insist on that amendment would possibly be out of order. The principle of appointment by the Minister has been accepted in the second reading. Therefore I framed an amendment which accepts the appointment by the Minister, but in making the appointments I wish to have recommendations from various bodies made to him. That is contained in my amendment, which stands on the last page of the Order Paper of to-day and which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-sections (2) and (3) and to substitute the following new sub-section:</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) The council shall consist of&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) a chairman and a vice-chairman; and</li>

<li>(b) additional members, not less than 13 in number, who shall be recommended by the Administrators of the provinces, the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, representatives of the universities, technical colleges, vocational schools, commerce, mining, industry and agriculture, the Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Private Schools and the Standing Committee of the Association of Church Schools generally.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>I have said here that the Council Executive shall consist of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, not five members or two members with the Minister&#x2019;s option of appointing another three. Secondly, I say in (b) that additional members, not less than 13 in number, be added who shall be recommended by various bodies, the administrators, the Federal Council of Teachers, etc. I hope the Minister will be able to accept this, because it does not deprive him of the right of nomination. He still has the power to nominate, but the recommendations will come from these various bodies.</p>

<p>I have considered this amendment very carefully and I came to the conclusion that in my second reading speech, and in my reply to that debate, I dealt very fully with these points now dealt with in this amendment. First of all, the additional members, not less than 13, who shall be recommended by these various bodies&#x2014;I think I made out a very good case and I really hoped that the Committee would accept the arguments put forward by me, especially the difficulty which would arise if all these interested bodies&#x2014;they are not associated in federations&#x2014;recommended people. It would put me in a checkmate position from which I would never get out again, if I accepted this amendment. As far as the point that the executive shall consist of a chairman and a vice-chairman, and the arguments I advanced on that point, my arguments were very clear that I forsee that there will be a lot of work to be done by these people, and that I cannot cope with all the problems if there are not at least five members on the executive. Therefore, I am very sorry that I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I once again want to come back to the Minister&#x2019;s advisory council. The Minister says that in terms of Clause 7 the council is wide in its scope; that it is in actual fact national in character, in that it can give advice to all racial groups. But I base my argument in the main on Clause 8. I know of course that in the original Bill, as it was submitted to us in draft, the words &#x201C;relating to Whites alone&#x201D; appeared, but they were then omitted. However, I am sorry that this principle is not upheld in Clause 8 and it is for this reason that I feel that this council is in reality not a national council. Furthermore, it is not national for the reasons the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has mentioned. I admit that there are in fact certain Acts in which the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; is used, but there are so many of our other laws in which the word is not used and which also cover the whole of South Africa and all groups. It is not the custom in the majority of instances, to insert the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; before the word &#x201C;council&#x201D;. I repeat that in my opinion the word no longer has the meaning which it had previously.</p>

<p>I want to support my hon. friend in respect of his further amendment. I can&#x2014;and I say this with all respect&#x2014;unfortunately not accept as resting on a sound basis the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s exposition and explanation for refusing to recognize the groups or organizations concerned. I know that the hon. the Minister has pointed out that there are dozens of these organizations, amongst the teachers for example, but he knows after all as well as I that these organizations are combined into central, federal groups, and it is to these that I am referring. For my own purposes, when we discussed this Bill, I considered this question, and I found that the universities for example are combined into the committee of principals, and the representative whom the Minister wishes to appoint to represent the universities could easily be nominated by the committee of principals. I find that all the teachers&#x2019; associations, Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking, namely S.A.T.A., the T.T.A., the Natal Teachers&#x2019; Union (both sections) etc., are all combined into one group, namely the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations. Similarly I find that the technical colleges and vocational schools are combined into one large association, and similarly we find that the private schools are combined into one group.</p>

<p>In my opinion the reply which the Minister has given is not so convincing that he is justified in acting in conflict with the wishes of the organizations who gave evidence, the experts in this field, or in conflict with the recommendations of the commissions which preceded the Select Committee dating from 1911. We asked 17 organizations who appeared before us whether the members should be nominated by the various organizations, and 15 of them said: &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;; one said &#x201C;No&#x201D;, and one was not quite sure. Then we asked whether the representatives on this council should also include people who are not connected with the education profession. I have it here in English: &#x201C;Should representation on the council comprise educationists and other bodies?&#x201D; To this 15 out of the 24 to whom we put the question replied &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. In other words, the overwhelming majority replied in the affirmative.</p>

We would even be prepared to accept that, but let the Minister recognize them; or if the Minister does not want to accept this <i>in toto</i>, let him then tell us that he has so much confidence in the organizations who are directly connected with education, that he will allow them to recommend persons to him.</p>

<p>I really cannot agree with the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) that the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; in our country has acquired a narrow meaning merely because the name of a political party also includes the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;. As far as the public are concerned, when one refers to a national council or a national advisory council, then the public interpret it as meaning a council which will represent the whole nation. It is only in the United Party that the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; has acquired a narrower meaning; for the rest of the country, the word still retains its true meaning. I can therefore not see what objection the hon. member has to the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; being in the title of the council.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has after all said very clearly in his speech that his Department has no control over non-White education. Coloured education will be transferred to the Department of Coloured Affairs next year, Indian education is to be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs, and Bantu education <span class="col_8365-8366" refersTo="page_1429"/>already falls under the Department of Bantu Education. But the hon. the Minister has said quite clearly that he hopes that his colleagues will make use of this advisory council. The council will therefore be fully at the disposal of those Departments which control non-White education, and it is wrong to say that the council will only serve one section of the population. The hon. member urges that the Minister should accept nominations from teachers&#x2019; associations because 15 witnesses to whom this question was put, said that they should be consulted in connection with the appointment of members of the council. It is surely obvious that if one asks an association whether it considers that it should be consulted in connection with the appointment of a member, it will reply &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, because it would very much like to have a person there whom it nominates; it would like to have a say on the council. What would happen if the hon. member were to be given his way, and if the Minister were to consult the various associations or organizations about whom he should appoint? We would have group interests represented on that council and not national interests. What we want is that national interests should be represented, or does the hon. member want group interests to be represented on this council? This council is not being appointed to serve groups; the council is being appointed to serve and to advise the nation on a national basis. This also applies to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), and I really hope that the hon. the Minister will not accept that amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) seems to be speaking at cross-purposes when he talks about the naming of this council. How can this possibly be a national council in the true sense of the word if there is no reference throughout this Bill to Coloured or Bantu Education? Sir, none of the members on that side of the House are prepared to exclude the Coloured people from our national way of life, and right throughout this Bill all reference to the education of Coloured people is avoided. If the hon. member for Vryheid is right in saying that the Minister hopes that provision will be made in the future for the betterment of Coloured and Bantu education by this advisory board, why then does the hon. the Minister not make provision now for the appointment of persons representing the Coloured and Bantu sections of the population? No reference is made to them in the Bill; no opening is left for the representation of these people on the advisory council. How then can anybody in this House say that this will be a national council. There is no opportunity to make it a national council in the future. If the Minister was correct in what he said to us then he should make provision for the appointment on this council of people who can represent Coloured and Bantu interests as far as education is concerned. Our whole future educational life must be bound up with the Coloured and Bantu educational systems, and if the hon. the Minister thinks that for all time there is going to be a separation of the systems he is making a terrible mistake, because come what may their system must become integrated with ours, because education is such that it cannot be divided up to suit certain people. I therefore support the hon. member for Hillbrow in his contention that the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;, at this stage at any rate, should be taken out of this Bill, and let the Minister apply it then, as he wants to do, to the White population only.</p>

<p>During his Second Reading Speech the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) advocated <i>inter alia</i> that this council should consist of practical educationists, that is to say, the professional people. I want to agree with him completely in that regard and I also want to support that submission. Then he also asked&#x2014;and it was because of this that the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) was drafted&#x2014;that on this educational organization bodies which deal with the product of education should be represented. On that occasion he mentioned <i>inter alia</i> representatives of the Army (apart from representatives of commerce and industry) which is a State department. Mr. Chairman, if we are to give representation to everyone who deals with the product of education, then I can imagine what a big, cumbersome body the council would have to be, because then we would also have to give representation to the Post Office and to the various facets of the Public Service, and I regard that as absolutely ridiculous. I find it strange in fact that hon. members do not have sufficient confidence in the educationists to let them serve on this council. I believe that the hon. the Minister will appoint people with knowledge of education in its various aspects&#x2014;nursery education, primary education, secondary education, technical education and higher education&#x2014;people who have or are still acquiring intimate knowledge of education. It seems to me as though insufficient confidence is placed in the teaching profession, in the educationists as such, as though sufficient capable persons cannot be found in their ranks to serve on the council. That is the implication of this amendment which the hon. member for Kensington has moved.</p>

<p>Recently we had yet another example when the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs proposed the establishment of an advisory committee on exports, to which representatives of organized commerce and industry will also be appointed. In this case people will be appointed who are familiar with commerce and industry and no other persons from various professions. Why should persons from other spheres in the community be appointed and not teachers and educationists as such exclusively?</p>

<p>As regards the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; I should just like to submit that in the reports of all the commissions which have been appointed hitherto and which have reported on this matter, the word &#x201C;Union&#x201D; and even the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; <span class="col_8367-8368" refersTo="page_1430"/>were used. The word &#x201C;national&#x201D; was used shortly after the establishment of Union. A &#x201C;National Council of Advice for Technical Education&#x201D; was established in 1912. At that time already the word was used. <i>Inter alia</i> the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; was used by the Secretary for Education in 1935. In his annual report for 1935 the then Secretary for Education for example said: &#x201C;The Union does not have a national education system&#x201D; and he suggested that he would like to have a national education system. The word &#x201C;national&#x201D; has therefore already been used on various occasions. The De Villiers Commission also used the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; in its report in 1948. Why are the United Party as afraid of the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; as the devil of holy water? I think that objecting to the use of the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; is a revelation of pettiness. After all it means &#x201C;comprehensive it means &#x201C;belonging to the people&#x201D; as any one knows. I should therefore like to support the hon. the Minister and ask that this word should be retained and also that he should appoint persons to the Advisory Education Council who know something about education and not bring in people from outside.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has alleged that we on this side do not have sufficient confidence in the educationists, and that is why we want to include all these outside organizations as well. But I once again want to refer the hon. member to the amendment as moved by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). In addition to representatives of the Federal Council, the Administrators, the private schools and the Standing Committee of Church Schools, we only mention commerce, the mines, industry and agriculture; those are the only four. The rest are all educationists. How can the hon. member allege that we do not have confidence in the teaching profession and that for this reason we refuse to limit the council to educationists? This side of the House in fact wants to make this council as wide and as representative as possible. The hon. member who has just sat down has said that it is ridiculous to allege that the persons who deal with the products of the schools should have representation on this council. Who are the people who should be represented on that council? The people who in their daily life see the products of the schools are precisely the type of people who are representative of commerce, industry and agriculture; it is precisely these people who could make a vast contribution to the deliberations of such an educational council. The hon. the Minister has said that he will not appoint these people of his own accord; that he will even give the 160 members of Parliament an opportunity to recommend persons. If the hon. the Minister is prepared to ask 160 different members in this House whom they would like to see on such a council, does the hon. the Minister then want to tell me that he cannot ask 25 different organizations in this country whom they would like to have on the council? How is the Minister going to appoint this council if all the 160 members of this House should give him ten or 12 names? But if he gives commerce, industry, agriculture, the mines and the various educational interests mentioned in the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington the opportunity to nominate persons to serve on the council, then his task will be so much easier. The hon. the Minister would then immediately have the assurance that he will have the fullest measure of co-operation on this council. They are capable enough and have sufficient qualifications to nominate the right people. If the hon. the Minister wants to make this body genuinely representative of the whole nation, if he wants to make it a body which will care for our interests in the wider sense, then he should accept this amendment by the hon. member for Kensington. I think this is a good, sound amendment, and this is what these people themselves have requested.</p>

<p>I do hope that the hon. the Minister will not accede to the recommendations which have been made here and that he will not allow himself to be bound to any greater extent than Clause 2 (3) already binds him, and that for the rest he will retain the absolute freedom to appoint those persons who are qualified for such appointment by virtue of their personality and their own knowledge. What hon. members opposite are now proposing is nothing but a conditional (gebonde) mandate. They want the Minister only to consider certain persons who are recommended by certain other organizations or bodies, and as soon as he does that, those persons will feel bound to report back to those bodies by whom they were nominated. As soon as that happens, he is bound. Whether it be directly or indirectly does not matter a great deal; and as soon as he is bound, he will no longer have a council which can think freely and which can make recommendations freely to him. Because what will happen to such a person who is nominated by the Agricultural Union for example. I am just taking an example which has suddenly come to my mind. Hon. members must note that such a person will not be a representative of the Agricultural Union; he will merely be recommended by the Agricultural Union. What will happen to such a person if he acts on this council in a way which does not meet with the approval of the Agricultural Union? Then they will of course never recommend him again. And what will that help us? Then we shall be exactly where we were. I want to urge very strongly upon the Minister that he should uphold this principle of an unconditional mandate as far as appointments are concerned and that he should recruit people who are qualified by virtue of their own personality, knowledge and value to assist him by giving him the best possible advice they can give without feeling that they must look to anyone else.</p>

<p>I am surprised to hear a responsible person like the hon. member for Potchefstroom (Dr. J. H. Steyn) put forward <span class="col_8369-8370" refersTo="page_1431"/>the proposition that because certain people might be recommended by bodies they will feel that they represent those bodies and that they must report back to those bodies. To me it seems unreasonable to put forward such a proposition as a reason for giving entire freedom to the Minister to use his own discretion in making these appointments. Sir, that has not been my experience of people who have had responsibilities given to them by bodies of a national character or of a fairly widespread character. I repudiate entirely the suggestion that any person recommended to the Minister for appointment to this council by any body of people, by any confederation or association of people, would possibly feel that his hands are tied. Sir, this is not like a political appointment. We are trying to take this matter out of politics and to make this a council which will vote and act according to the merits of the situation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) gave some examples of &#x201C;national&#x201D; bodies which had been created, but he went back a long way in history. He managed to find one example in an annual report in 1935, whereas the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has been able to quote Acts passed in this House within recent times and even in earlier days where the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; is not used.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us see what this body&#x2019;s approach was to this matter. On page 32 of the Committee&#x2019;s Report, the following questions which the hon. member for Hillbrow put to Mr. Wahl of the S.A.T.A. and the latter&#x2019;s replies are recorded, namely&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>102. Who should appoint the members of the council?&#x2014;That function will presumably be the prerogative of the Minister in consultation, of course, with the bodies concerned. Preferably these bodies should be asked to nominate their representatives.</li>

<li><span class="col_8371-8372" refersTo="page_1432"/>103. Should he act on the advice of these bodies?&#x2014;Yes, but this need not necessarily mean that he need accept it. He should certainly seek their advice.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is more or less typical of the attitude of all these bodies, namely that they were prepared to trust the Minister because they themselves saw the danger that otherwise persons who were not educationists, could be appointed to the council and also that nominations by bodies could result in the formation of groups.</p>

<p>As regards the use of the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;, I want to say that I regard this whole business as a joke. Hon. members opposite are so afraid of this word because they confuse it with &#x201C;nationalist&#x201D;. But I want to ask them whether, if we had introduced this Bill before the establishment of the Republic and had therefore used the word &#x201C;Union&#x201D;, would they have objected to that? They would definitely not have done so. Now, however, we can no longer use the word &#x201C;Union&#x201D; and the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; must be used but in the same sense as the word &#x201C;Union&#x201D; was used previously, namely to indicate the whole as against the provincial. When we therefore refer to &#x201C;national&#x201D; we are merely trying to indicate that we are speaking of the whole country and not merely of the provinces. But hon. members opposite are afraid of this word despite the fact that it is being used in this sense, and despite the fact that even in their own beloved motherland, that is to say England, it is used. It is also used in France, Germany, and everywhere else.</p>

<p>Read the reports which were submitted by the commissions which were appointed to investigate our education system and hon. members will see that the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; is used throughout. The De Villiers Commission deplored the fact that there was not a &#x201C;national&#x201D; outlook on our education system and that there was no &#x201C;national&#x201D; perception of the problem. We are not referring to the National Party. This word is not being used in its political connotation, but only to contrast the interests of the whole against the interests of the component parts&#x2014;in this case the provinces. I therefore hope that the hon. the Minister will not pay any attention to what hon. members opposite have said about this matter hitherto. In any case they have not convinced me that the word should be replaced.</p>

<p>In regard to the interjection by the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) during the speech of the hon. member for Hillbrow, whereby he indicated that a large number of the witnesses who gave evidence before the Select Committee were of the opinion that the Council should also be representative of other bodies outside the educational field, I should like to quote some facts which will prove beyond any doubt that the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington is supported by the majority of the witnesses who gave evidence. Many of the witnesses were asked whether they were in favour of the Council having on it representatives of bodies outside the education field, and the following answers were elicited: &#x201C;Die Akademie&#x201D; was doubtful; the Black Sash was against it; &#x201C;die Calvinistiese Beweging&#x201D; was against it and so were the Cape School Board; the National Council of Women was in favour of it and so were Professor du Plooy, the Cape Council of Education, the Education Panel, F.A.K., Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses, the Home and School Council, the S.A.O.U., Dr. Prinsloo, the Scientific and Technical Association, Cape Council of School Committees, S.A.T.A., the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, the Teachers&#x2019; Association of the Transvaal, and the United Party Provincial Caucus. Other bodies which were not in favour of it are the &#x201C;Inter-kerklike&#x201D; Committee, Professor Malherbe, the &#x201C;Onderwysersvereniging van Transvaal&#x201D;, the S.A. Association for Technical and Vocational Education and the University of Potchefstroom. In the circumstances, it is fair to say that the majority of the educationists who gave evidence was in favour of other bodies being represented on the Council.</p>

<p>At this stage I should like to move the amendment which stands in my name on page 901 of the Order Paper, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 29, to omit &#x201C;recommended&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;nominated&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sub-section (3) (a) of Clause 2 deals in the first place with the appointment of someone to the Council who has special knowledge of the functions of the Department of Education, Arts and Science, and then goes on to deal with appointment of provincial representatives. I submit if the term &#x201C;recommended&#x201D; is retained in this sub-section, the Administrators will be deprived of a final say in who will represent them on the Council. If, on the other hand, the word &#x201C;nominated&#x201D; is substituted for it, it will leave no doubt that the autonomy of the provinces is not being interfered with. This will also be in accordance with the opinion expressed by the majority of witnesses who gave evidence before the Select Committee. Altogether 16 witnesses representing different organizations expressed an opinion on the question of provincial representation, 13 of whom expressed themselves in favour of such representation. On the question of whether such representatives should be appointed or nominated 13 favoured nomination and five appointment.</p>

<p><span class="col_8373-8374" refersTo="page_1433"/>Reference has been made to the fact that some of these bodies who expressed themselves in favour of provincial representatives being nominated were activated by political motives instead of purely educational sentiments. It is of interest, therefore, to find out to what extent the witnesses concerned represented purely educational interests or not. When analysing the evidence, I found that eight witnesses were not only in favour of provincial representation but would like to see the provinces nominating their own representatives. Four of the eight represented purely educational organizations, like the &#x201C;Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging&#x201D;, the S.A.T.A., the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations and the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association. The remaining organizations were the &#x201C;S.A. Akademie&#x201D;, the Associated Scientific and Technical Societies and the Council for School Committees of the Cape. All these bodies are intimately associated with education. The principle that the provinces should be allowed to nominate their representatives has, I believe, always been observed in the past and I should like the hon. the Minister to accept it, therefore, also in respect of this Bill. In the past the persons serving on the Committee of Heads of Departments were virtually the choice of the provinces concerned by virtue of the fact that provinces play a large part in the appointment of the head of the department of education in each province.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>At this stage I should like to deal, in the light of how I see matters, with the two amendments which were moved first. The first amendment is that of the hon. member for Hillbrow, namely that the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; should be omitted. I just want to point out to him that there is already an Advisory Education Council in the Transvaal of which Professor J, Chris Coetzee is the chairman. This body is called the &#x201C;Advisory Education Council&#x201D;. It is not stated that it is an advisory education council for the Transvaal. All the arguments in favour of the retention of the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; which hon. members on this side of the House have submitted, are well-founded and I think enough has already been said on that point. The hon. member for Hillbrow by his amendment wishes to derogate from the status of the proposed council. The hon. member for Kensington has referred to the use of the word in legislation and has pointed out that in certain laws it is not used. Of course it was not. Here, however, the word is a uniting factor. It indicates unity where in fact there has never been unity before. Hon. members must remember that I have said I do not want a deadly uniformity, but that there should be greater unity. Do hon. members opposite want to fly in the face of all the evidence to the effect that there is dissatisfaction with our education system? Are they then not parents as well? Is everything satisfactory and are they satisfied? We are now saying that a unifying word is being used to give expression to something of great significance. It should therefore remain&#x2014;no matter how many times we have to divide on the point.</p>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington goes so far as to propose that there should only be 13 members of the council, that is to say in addition to the chairman and vice-chairman.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>My own feeling. I am convinced that five members will immediately be required for the executive committee. What is the idea underlying the appointment of the members of such a council? Do hon. members know what the position is in this regard in connection with other councils, such as the Board of Trade and Industries, etc.? Just allow me to mention something else in this regard: I would have been very glad if an advisory education council could have been established without legislation&#x2014;as the hon. the Prime Minister was able to do in the case of his Economic Advisory Council. I would also have been able to do this if we had not had so much division in the field of education. I required the co-operation of the provinces for this purpose. I obtained this cooperation with the exception of Natal. But Natal, as I have already said, is always a little difficult in the beginning&#x2014;later she cooperates. I stake my reputation when I say that this council will be so constituted that it will be representative to the greatest possible extent of the various groups. We shall also bear in mind that this council will be representative of the Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking sections as well as the sexes, that is to say male and female. As a matter of fact, there are many problems which must not be lost sight of.</p>

<p>Hon. members should not waste their breath. No further improvement can be made here. The council must be established. I am bound as far as the appointment of its members are concerned. The proposal of the hon. member for Durban (Berea), namely to substitute &#x201C;nominated&#x201D; for &#x201C;recommended&#x201D;, touches the principle of the legislation because the Minister will then lose his discretionary powers. The Minister must be in a position to tell an Administrator that the person whom he has nominated is not the best person for the purpose. It may be that an Administrator, because he does not want to lose his best people, may choose a person, let us say the <span class="col_8375-8376" refersTo="page_1434"/>assistant of the school at Pampoenfontien, who has never achieved anything and whom he can therefore best do without. In such a case the Minister must have the right to say that the recommended person is not good enough, and that another person, someone who at least means something and has already achieved something of importance, must be recommended. If I am to be bound by the recommendation of an Administrator, however, he can nominate whomever he likes and I would have to accept his nomination. The provisions at present in the Bill are based on an agreement reached by my predecessor. In this regard I want to state that if the agreement had provided for appointments on the basis proposed by the hon. member, then I would not have accepted it. The Minister is the person who is responsible to Parliament and the people. Once the Advisory Education Council is appointed, then I shall have no further control over it. All I can do is to ask it for advice. However, I may not interfere in its activities. The day I do so, hon. members can impugn my actions. Allow me to say that there will not only be Nationalists on the council. This will in the first place be a council which must advise the Minister. As far as I am concerned, I do not want to be faced with a council which is not constituted in accordance with the requirements of Clause 2 (3) (b). Can hon. members then not see that Clause 2 (3) (b) limits me just as barbed wire would do? It lays down that the other members of the council must be persons who have distinguished themselves in the field of education or who, in the opinion of the Minister, are otherwise specially qualified in some aspect of the work of the council. I do not want to anticipate the amendment moved by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) but he also wishes to eliminate the Minister&#x2019;s discretion. According to them the Minister should not have any discretion at all. They want the Minister to accept a council which other people appoint for him. The Minister must then accept the advice of such a council. What assurance will he have that such a council will be able to give him professional and expert advice? He will have absolutely no such assurance. For that reason I cannot accept these amendments.</p>

<p>There are organizations in this country which have such a knowledge of persons who have distinguished themselves in the field of education that they will be able to make a recommendation to the Minister in this connection. Here, however, the Minister takes that decision upon himself. He is the only person who shall decide who must be appointed to the Council. I cannot understand why the Minister should want this power. He said he wanted to co-operate, and that he did not want this Council to be a body of a political nature. I suspect the Minister, however. He might very well appoint a policeman to this Council&#x2014;a political policeman. He might do so and say that that policeman has a special knowledge of the work of the Council. That is what I do not like. If the Minister did not take it upon himself to be the adjudicator as to who is specially qualified or not, we would have accepted the paragraph. As it is. I cannot get away from the fact that the Minister is not the only person who is qualified to appoint persons to this Council. For this reason I ask for the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D; to be deleted. It will also serve as a protection to the Minister himself and if he will look at the matter in this light, he will agree that my amendment is worth consideration.</p>

<p>I hesitated to take part in this debate at this stage. We have already had a great deal of childishness. I wish to refer to the principles which made me decide to leave out the word &#x201C;advisory&#x201D;. No pressure was brought to bear on me to come to that decision. Even after I knew that the Minister wanted that word we nevertheless decided to leave it out. I am, however, accepting it now, but after I have handed in my report. I did not want the slightest suspicion to exist that anybody&#x2014;least of all the Minister&#x2014;had influenced me. To deprive the Minister of the discretionary power will mean that I will have to abandon a principle which I incorporated in the Bill when I drafted it namely that if the Minister accepts responsibility, he must have proportionate rights. You cannot burden any Minister or any official or authority with any responsibilities without rights. Anybody with the most rudimentary brain, ought to understand that. If the Minister has to appoint a person and be 100 per <span class="col_8377-8378" refersTo="page_1435"/>cent responsible for the council and its actions and its very existence, then the Minister himself should be able to say: I am doing it on my own responsibility and this is the type of person I wish to have on it. As a matter of fact that was what made me decide on the whole principle of having educational interests represented, instead of having groups of persons represented. However, I do not want to revert to that because that has already been effectively replied to. But this council must be completely unbiased, it must be of high standing and it must be beyond reach, its quality must be beyond doubt; and where the Minister takes the responsibility of fulfilling those demands upon him, he cannot allow himself to be guided by any group of people. Certain bodies are referred to in one of the amendments. There are Church schools and Church bodies. Had I suggested this morning that there was a C.N.O. society which should definitely be represented, surely I would only have been looking for trouble in this House. In that case I would not only have been putting up a hare but a lion.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite&#x2014;I am talking about informed members who served with me on the Select Committee&#x2014;know as well as I do that as far as we got with this clause, with the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;, with the idea of the broad representation of educational interests instead of groups, with the difference between the National Board and the Provincial Advisory Board, with the question of nominating and appointing, the matter was clear-cut to all of those who knew how this Bill had come into existence. I sat there and made notes when I asked a well-educated person: Do you think that bodies should recommend persons to the Minister or should the provinces recommend them? He replied without thinking: Yes, I think they should nominate them. He used the word &#x201C;nominate&#x201D; unthinkingly instead of &#x201C;recommend&#x201D;. I again had to ask him: Do you want them to nominate him, i.e. appoint, leaving the Minister with no choice, or must they recommend a person? The hon. friend for Berea (Mr. Hourquebie) on those benches over there is still a new member and he still believes in statistics. He will still learn a great deal about those figures he has quoted. I only believe in what I have been convinced to believe and in my contact with as many educationists as possible with whom I have discussed this matter. I feel that as it stands at the moment it is the best. If the Minister carries the responsibility, let him have the rights which go with it. Do not deprive him of that. It is a legislative monstrosity only to impose burdens without conferring rights.</p>

<p>No, no. Not that either. They are cleverer people than I. I do not wish to offend my hon. friend here. He was a good chairman, and I should like once again to pay tribute to him for the impartial manner in which he acted. Nor is it my intention to plead for the omission of the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; or to say something about that I think the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) has said that the people who testified, or the organization that was asked whether they should recommend the members, of course would say yes, because they themselves wished to serve on it. I think that is an insult to prominent people, people who are independent of anybody else and who do not know politics. I regard the teachers&#x2019; organizations and associations as bodies that are above politics. And although the hon. member did not intend it that way, I regard it somewhat as an insult to them and I am sorry he made that utterance.</p>

<p>The Minister will of course determine which organizations he wants. If he accepts the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) he will not open the matter to all organizations, but he will as a practical man provide in his Bill which bodies he should like to see represented on the Council. He can do it easily, surely. An hon. member over there and I think the Minister also in his second reading speech, referred to the army, to which reference had been made. Of course he will not go to every department of the army. He will go to the Minister of Defence and ask him to furnish him with the name of a person who will be able to serve him best on the advisory council. He will say that he also wishes the advisory council to give the army advice in regard to their gymnasiums, so that they also can have a share in the advisory council.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I repeat the Minister can lay down which bodies he wishes to consult or to be represented. It is not a thing we are sucking out of our thumbs. We asked so many prominent bodies about it, and the majority told us that there are certain outstanding organizations whom we should give representation on this advisory council. I think the hon. member for Potchefstroom (Dr. J. H. Steyn) said that the members that are nominated by the organizations, would then be committed to the organizations. But will they not be equally bound to the Minister who has appointed them? Will they not every three or four or five years, as a result of their conduct on that Council, be dependent on the good grace of the Minister? Are they not more committed to the Minister now, especially if they give advice he does not like; or if there is something in their conduct the Minister does not like? They will of course be bound in the same manner that the <span class="col_8379-8380" refersTo="page_1436"/>members that may be recommended by the organization will be bound. Of course they will also feel bound to the Minister.</p>

<p>My hon. friend the Minister says that he does not wish to interfere with the functions of the Council. Nor will he do so, he says. I shall accept that. But this state of being bound on the part of members of the Council may exist, whether or not they are nominated by their own organizations, with whose wishes they surely are more acquainted and whose wishes they surely will be able to represent better than the nominees of the Minister. Someone said they should be impartial. I agree. They should be above suspicion, and because they should be above suspicion, that is the basis of our objection and it is the basis of our proposal here, namely that when they come from their own organizations, they will be above suspicion. I should like to say honestly this morning that if I were the Minister, I would not have passed over the teachers&#x2019; organizations. I might have passed over any other organization, but I would verily have consulted the teachers&#x2019; associations in this matter. I may also refer to the hon. member who quoted the S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Association, but I do not think it is necessary to do so.</p>

<p>However, I should like to refer to the proposal by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) namely that the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D; should be deleted. I also feel that those words are unnecessary, because the Minister should have inserted it in the previous sub-paragraph (3) (a) too if he had a valid reason for it. I shall read it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the members of the council shall shall be a person who has special knowledge of the functions of the Department of Education, Arts and Science, and there in respect of each province be appointed one member &#x2026;</block>

<p>It does not say &#x201C;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;. It is unnecessary and that is why I wish to make this appeal to the hon. the Minister once again: Omit it, for it is not necessary. It seems as if the Minister wants to have all the say in regard to the matter and does not wish to consult anybody. I do not think that is his intention. I think the Minister is honest when he says he wants to have the best Council, But he not only wants the best Council; he also wants that Council to be free and untrammelled, which will be impartial and which will be above suspicion.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I get the impression that we are discussing something which does not need to be discussed. The position is so clearly defined and clearly stated in Clause 2 of this Bill, that the whole reaction of the Opposition at the moment amounts to this: They anticipate in advance what the composition of the Minister&#x2019;s council will be. They wish to close all possible little loopholes so that he cannot do what they suspect him of perhaps wanting to do. In other words, all the arguments of the Opposition are inspired by distrust in the Minister. That is precisely the crux of the whole matter. Let us accept it that they are in Opposition and let them accept the fact that they do not govern the country. They cannot have this council constituted in the way they want it constituted. The Government is there to do that and the Minister is the responsible person; he will exercise these powers. But, Mr. Chairman&#x2014;and I think this is very important&#x2014;he will be called to account in this House in respect of this matter and that is why we must give him these rights. We will not call the Opposition to account if a stupid council is established. The Minister remains responsible. If he has to carry the responsibility he must also have the powers. But all these arguments about whom should be on the council are covered in this Bill. The Minister may appoint people from outside the educational profession. He may give the Federal Council or the teachers associations representation. Why are these people so unnecessarily suspicious that they do not trust anybody? Surely it is very clear that when the Minister establishes the Council, he will be staking his whole political reputation, because I know in advance that when the names appear of those people whom the Minister has appointed, the Opposition will place them under a magnifying glass to see exactly who has been appointed. Do they think the Minister will give all these assurances and then appoint a number of political &#x201C;stooges&#x201D;? Surely he knows that will be criticized. Clause 2 (3) (b) states very clearly that the Minister may appoint the following persons&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8381-8382" refersTo="page_1437"/>&#x2026; or who, in the opinion of the Minister, are otherwise specially qualified in some aspect of the work of the Council</block>

<p>And the work of the Council is defined in Clause 7&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to promote co-operation generally in the field of education &#x2026; with a view to adapting the education system to the needs of the country.</block>

<p>Surely it is logical that the products which education produces should ultimately be able to meet the needs of the country, and that the Minister can appoint people who represent that section of education as well. That is why it is futile to have this whole argument because the Minister has the power under the law to appoint such people. As far as the question of representation is concerned, I want to quote two persons in order to state the matter clearly, and the one is prof. E. G. Malherbe. In reply to the question put to him: &#x201C;Do you want him to appoint them in such a way that they represent specific aspects of education or educational bodies or should they be appointed merely on the ground of merit&#x201D;? he replied: &#x201C;The members should be appointed solely on the ground of merit&#x201D;. He gave an interesting example: &#x201C;In this connection I want to refer to the Council of Social and Educational Research. Initially this was a small Council consisting of prominent experts. Minister Hofmeyr then came along and converted it into a large Council of approximately 30 members of whom each represented a specific organization. The entire Council simply became stultified&#x201D;. He went on to say: &#x201C;When, for example, research bursaries had to be awarded to persons in the Transvaal the representatives of the Free State wanted to know what about them, etc. In this way things went round in circles until a point was reached where one thing cancelled out another and no progress could be made. When a particular matter had to be discussed, it was often found that representatives said that they had not yet received instructions from their organizations and then discussions had to be postponed until the necessary instructions had been received. From a practical point of view the establishment of the Council on a representative basis is not to be recommended&#x201D;. That is a stronger argument than anyone of us can advance why the Council should not represent bodies.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot remember for the moment whom he said but does that make any difference to the argument? However, I want to quote another interesting witness who said they should be educationists, namely the leader of the United Party caucus in the Cape Provincial Council, Mrs. Taylor. I quote question 734. There was an argument about the composition of the council and Mrs. Taylor said this: &#x201C;The point which I want to stress is that the educationists and nobody else should be allowed to handle these matters&#x201D;. The United Party was, therefore, divided on the point, Mrs. Taylor says they should be educationists and nobody else, but here they say it can be anybody. I think we are having an argument here which is not relevant. The law is clear and I think the Opposition can leave their opposition at that.</p>

<p>I just want to raise another matter and that is in regard to the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;. &#x201C;National&#x201D; conveys to us an idea of a whole, geographically or otherwise. I want to know whether hon. members would be satisfied if the Minister changed the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; to &#x201C;Republican&#x201D;? That word has no political connotation, or has it? Hon. members do not react. It is clear that we are dealing here with a national council which is composed on a broad basis and when the hon. member for Hillbrow alleges that the members whom the hon. the Minister will appoint, will only carry out his wishes and will be tied to him, I want to say that I think he is insulting them more than we on this side are when we say that they will only be representing certain organizations. Those are people who will be elected and appointed on an extremely broad level and if he wants to tell me that those people will allow themselves to be intimidated by the Minister, he has no conception of the quality and the standard of the men who will be on the council. Those people should not be tied down in any way and should be able to judge in an unbiased way. I suggest, Sir, that this discussion be stopped because everything that can be said has been said and that we might just as well vote.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to refer particularly to paragraph 2 (a) of my amendment, the composition of the Council&#x2014;not whether there should be a Council or the manner of its appointment, but its composition. The Minister has indicated to us in his second reading speech that five members of the Council will be full-time members, as an Executive. In my amendment I propose that two members should form the executive. I do not wish to anticipate our discussions on the other clauses, but we shall have to consider the functions of the Council in connection with this matter, and the <i>ad hoc</i> committees which we are all agreed will have to be appointed. I am not going to discuss the functions of the <i>ad hoc</i> committees, but we should bear this in mind. How will this Council function? I remember seven years ago when the Interkerklike Komitee of the three Dutch Churches sent us their memorandum, they gave us their ideas, and said that they envisaged that this Council would meet at least twice a year. There need not be many full-time executives if the Council is going to meet only twice a year. Let us take one problem that this Council will have to <span class="col_8383-8384" refersTo="page_1438"/>consider. It was mentioned by several witnesses who appeared before the Select Committee. They mentioned, e.g., the question at what age children should be admitted to school, that we should try to get uniformity throughout the country because it created difficulties when parents moved from one province to another. Now that seems to be a trifling matter, really, but there is one I should like to mention, and which was mentioned by other witnesses: the training of teachers. I consider that important. We have many certificates today for qualified teachers. How will this question be investigated? How will the Council investigate the training of teachers in South Africa and make recommendations to the Minister and to the Administrators? It seems to me that this Committee of 15 will meet, say, in December, discuss their work and say that this is a matter which should be investigated. They will appoint an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, consisting of some members who have had experience of the training of teachers and others who are representatives of the Provinces. Let me say in passing that I do not think we should restrict the number of these <i>ad hoc</i> committees to three members. Sometimes they may have to be a little larger. But how will they go to work? They will visit the training institutions throughout the country, or they may only ask for reports, and find it unnecessary to visit these institutions. When they have considered the evidence&#x2014;most of which is known to us to-day&#x2014;they will present a report to the full Council when it has its second meeting, say in July. Then there will be general discussion on the question of the training of teachers, and they will make recommendations to the Minister. Now what puzzles me is this. Why do we require five members on the executive to do that? The Minister interjected to say that they would have to work overtime. How can they work overtime if they are giving advice, and not issuing directives? My suggestion was that there should be two members of the Executive Committee, a chairman and a vice-chairman, with a secretary, and they could operate from head office in Pretoria. These <i>ad hoc</i> committees would provide the information, and the main body would meet twice a year, or perhaps three times, and come to a decision. But I cannot for the life of me see why you need five full-time executive members. It appears to me to be another example of Parkinson&#x2019;s law, that once having started a Department you make it bigger and bigger. I hope the Minister will reconsider this, if he investigates the question of the training of teachers, which is one of the most important investigations which will have to be made. The other investigation I regard as important is the question of the failures in the first year at the universities. I regard those as two important matters which will have to be investigated. The second one may be in close cooperation with the universities, but I cannot see how the investigation of the training of teachers requires the large organization the Minister has in mind. Therefore I feel confident that paragraph 2 (a) of my amendment is sufficient.</p>

<p>Before dealing with that I would like to reply, or rather, I would like to hear more from the Minister in regard to a statement he made in reply to the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood), who moved an amendment and asked that the Minister should substitute &#x201C;recommend&#x201D; with &#x201C;nominate&#x201D;. The hon. Minister said he could not accept this amendment because he would like to have the power to say to an Administrator, if the Administrator should recommend somebody and the Minister finds that the nominee is not suitable, then the Minister would like to ask him to nominate somebody else. He wants to have that power. If he should amend this, then the Minister would not have that power. Sir, according to the Minister&#x2019;s second reading speech this is to be an advisory body. Surely if this is going to be an advisory body then we should give the opportunity to the Administrators to nominate people. I do not think that an Administrator would be so foolish as to nominate somebody who is not fully equipped for this particular task.</p>

<p>We suggest that the Administrator should nominate somebody from his province to represent his province.

Why should the hon. the Minister have the right to say to an Administrator, &#x201C;I do not agree with your nomination; I want to have the right to appoint somebody else&#x201D;. Surely he should credit our Administrators with a certain amount of intelligence. After all, they are concerned with the education of our provinces. On numerous occasions Administrators have to nominate people to represent a province on various bodies, and in those cases we do not say that the Administrator must recommend somebody for appointment. Those people are appointed by the Administrators. Why not follow the same procedure in this case? Sir, I think that the hon. the Minister has not given us a satisfactory reply in that respect.</p>

<p>I rise merely to refer to something I really forgot to raise. The amendment of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) seeks to make provision for the council to consists of a chairman and a vice-chairman. In other words, we are suggesting that we have an executive management consisting of only two members. I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to another body which one can say has similar functions, a body on which I had the honour of serving for many years, and that is the Historical Monuments Commission, which is known as a secretariat, and the only full-time official on the establishment of the State is the Secretary. The Historical Monuments Commission also does nation-wide work, and meets twice a year. I feel that the council of the hon. the Minister, as he has told us in advance that he is going to start off with five members, will be too big and cumbersome, especially at the beginning when specific work will have to be done. In my view he will do much better if he has only a small nucleus as a secretariat. What the Historical Monuments Commission does is to appoint an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to do research in regard to certain matters of historical importance: they report and then the Commission decides what shall be done. With great respect, I think the nucleus of the Minister&#x2019;s council will be too large. We have thought of two executive committee members; at first we thought of one, but we should like to have two so that when the one is occupied with other functions, a vice-chairman may continue with the work together with the secretariat, the officials on the establishment of the State. The position will then be the same as in the case of the Historical Monuments Commission, where the nucleus is small but the Commission has its paid officials who carry out the work, and the big body, the Historical Monuments Commission&#x2014;or in this case the advisory council&#x2014;then meets twice a year to confer and to hear what the <i>ad hoc</i> committees recommend. I should like to support my hon. friend the member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) as regards that aspect of the matter. I feel we should not have more than two. The Minister might perhaps tell me there should be three, but as he proposes there should be five, I think he will himself feel later on that it was not the soundest procedure he could have adopted.</p>

<p>I am sorry to have to come back again to this question of the naming of this council. I fell that even the Minister, if he gives this matter sufficient thought, will feel that it is an unsatisfactory name in more than one respect. This advisory council will have to deal with a very wide field. There are other committees of this nature, committees which also give advice to Ministers and for the information of the Minister I want to quote the two committees with which I have been connected to some extent personally, namely the S.A. Medical Council and the S.A. Pharmacy Board, then there is also the S.A. Nursing Council, all of which are specially created. It is true that they have other duties, but one of their duties is to give advice on health matters to the hon. the Minister of Health, and that also includes education, because education is one of the most important functions of all these bodies. In fact I might say that it is the most important function of all, because the country looks to these three bodies to see that the Ministry of Health is correctly advised. After all, it is the Ministry of Health that grants licences to practise when you come back to the primary role of the Ministry of Health in that respect. These bodies actually advise the Ministry of Health as to what should be done. Furthermore, these three councils which I have mentioned have connections with outside foreign bodies. They all have to deal with foreign personnel, personnel who come here to practise, and personnel of our own who go to other countries to practise. I can easily foresee that this body which the Minister is now bringing into being may have to deal with foreign countries on matters affecting education, and when they communicate with bodies abroad, those bodies will never quite know with whom they are dealing, whereas if the Minister were to call this council the South African Education Advisory Council, then he would be fulfilling his purpose and he will also be satisfying this side of the House.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the proviso to sub-section (2).</block>

<p>We feel that there is no need for a large executive to this council. We feel that essentially, as it has no executive powers, it can only act and can only give advice to the Minister after the full council meets. One feels, Sir, that the probability is that in the ordinary course of events this council will only meet, shall we say, for a few days twice a year. That is the sort of council which we envisage. If that is so and if there is no executive action, there seems to me no difficulty about the whole office being run by permanent officials attached to the permanent staff, with a chairman and vice chairman to give decisions which may be necessary during the interval of the meetings of the council. If information has to be collected there will be <i>ad hoc</i> committees to do so. If in the opinion of the chairman or the vice-chairman a further investigation should be carried out so that the papers could be studied, then they can be circulated to the members and there will not be any need for this large cabinet. If it is to be merely advisory, and we accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s word on that <span class="col_8391-8392" refersTo="page_1442"/>point, obviously there is no need for a cabinet. If on the other hand, it did have some executive power, one can easily see that it is necessary to have more than this small number. The opinion of the council is the opinion of the council, not the opinion of the executives. These are items which in the ordinary way can wait. The most serious problem improves on further consideration. I can find no evidence of the functions of the executive being described in this Bill. Only the functions of the council are. The creation of these extra two or three seats which is envisaged in this Clause suggests rather, as my hon. friend, the member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has said, that Parkinson&#x2019;s law is again to apply in this instance.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move the amendment as printed in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 38 and 39, to omit &#x201C;two members to be vice-chairman&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;one member to be vice-chairman&#x201D;,</block>

<p>Clause 3 (1) will then read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister shall designate one member of the Council as chairman and one member as vice-chairman.</block>

<p>We strongly object to the idea being introduced into this Bill that full-time members and a fulltime executive committee should be appointed for this particular Education Council. We believe that that is a wrong idea.</p>

<p>It is accented, however, that there must be something of that nature, and our object is to limit the powers of that executive committee as much as possible. We say that if there has to be such an executive committee we want to limit the number of its members. The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) has moved that two of the five executive committee members should not be appointed. I wish to move that instead of two vice-chairmen there should only be one.</p>

<p>Our basic idea is that this should be an advisory council. The administrative section should be kept as small as possible. Where it is indeed necessary to have an administrative section it should consist of public servants who are already there and who will perform purely administrative functions and not functions of an advisory or executive character, as envisaged in the Bill at the moment. We must clearly distinguish between the administrative and the advisory functions of such a council.</p>

<p>A second reason why we have moved this amendment is this: We feel, together with certain very important educational bodies, that if members are appointed on a full-time basis they will lose touch with the practical side of education. We should like to see people serving on it in a part-time capacity, people who will have practical every-day experience of education. We already feel that five executive members as envisaged in this Bill are too many. As the Bill reads at the moment, it provides that there should be at least three members on the executive committee, the chairman and two vice-chairmen and that the hon. the Minister can then appoint two additional members. In other words, if it appears in future that it is necessary to appoint an additional two members. the hon. the Minister can do so. As the position is at the moment, however, and as the hon. the Minister has led the House to believe, he will at the outset immediately appoint five. In other words, he ignores the provision in this Clause that he &#x201C;may&#x201D; or &#x201C;can&#x201D; appoint them. As the hon. member for Durban (Central) has said this is once again a manifestation of the Parkinson law that if sufficient posts are created, sufficient people will always be found to fill those posts.</p>

<p>We have been informed, and the hon. the Minister has indicated that he wants two vice-chairmen instead of one because he should like one of them to be English-speaking and one Afrikaans-speaking. I presume that the chairmen will be Afrikaans-speaking, although I can see no reason why that should be so. There is no reason for it. But I take it that that is indeed what the hon. the Minister has in mind: An Afrikaans-speaking chairman, one Afrikaans-speaking vice-chairman, and one English-speaking one. The position under the Minister&#x2019;s suggestion will be that of the three senior members of the council, two will be Afrikaans-speaking and one English-speaking. I presume that will be the position, whereas in terms of my amendment the division will be fifty-fifty, namely, there will be two senior officials, the chairman and the vice-chairman, one Afrikaans-speaking and the other English-speaking. I do not want to provide 100 per cent that the one must be Afrikaans-speaking and the other English-speaking. But as things are in the country to-day, and with the insistence on equal language rights, I think it would be reasonable to accept my amendment instead of the suggestion of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>There is the other factor of the additional costs which will be involved if there are so many members on the executive committee. Mr. Chairman. I am not an expert in the field of education, but I do believe that we should allow ourselves to be guided by experts in this sphere. I have the July 1960 issue of <i>Die Unie</i> here. As you know <i>Die Unie</i> is the official publication of the &#x201C;Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwvsersunie&#x201D;, a body consisting of Afrikaans teachers in the Cape Province. The leading article in <i>Die Unie</i> says on page 10 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is obvious that such a council should have a permanent secretary and staff, and we would even agree to a permanent chairman &#x2026;</block>

<p>As is provided here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; although on a similar council in England not even the chairman is a permanent member. Such a chairman and secretary <span class="col_8393-8394" refersTo="page_1443"/>will then form the kernel of the education council, while the remaining 20 members, ought to be part-time.</block>

<p>The highest educational organization in the Cape Province, the S.A.O.U. says that if there has to be a permanent member, it should only be the chairman, perhaps the secretary, and the other members of the council should serve on a voluntarily part-time basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have mentioned the Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie. There is a body which is far more important than the S.A.O.U. in South Africa and that is the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations in South Africa. As you know, Mr. Chairman, this Federal Council represents all the teachers&#x2019; associations in the whole of South Africa. It represents the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association and the Secondary School Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association. In the Free State it represents the Orange Free State Teachers&#x2019; Association; and in the Cape Province the Federal Council represents the S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Association and the Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie. In Natal it represents the Natal Teachers&#x2019; Association and the Natal Teachers&#x2019; Society; and in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own Department of Education, Arts and Science all the teachers belong to the Association for Technical and Vocational Education. In other words, we have an organization in this Federal Council which represents all the teachers, Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking, whatever their political views may be. Let me read what this Federal Council said when it gave evidence to the relevant Select Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federal Council believes that the Council should not be composed of full-time members. The Federal Council visualized an Education Advisory Council consisting of a nucleus of independent educationists who are in contact with different aspects of education and the educational ideas of those involved in it, and supplemented by representatives of the central government, the Education Departments and other interests. The Council is of the opinion &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the words of the teachers of South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that full-time members will soon lose contact with practical education and the ideas of those who are concerned with it. They will, therefore, soon be regarded as full-time professional planners and overseers of the Education Departments. In view of the fact that they will be civil servants, they will easily forfeit their claims to being regarded as independent educational thinkers and instead of the Education Advisory Council being looked up to as an institution born of the needs of education, it may easily be considered as having been forced on education from without.</block>

<p>The united voice of the teachers of South Africa ask the hon. the Minister to accept an amendment such as ours. To some extent the debate on this particular clause is unrealistic. At the second reading the hon. the Minister said that it was his intention to let us know who the five members of the executive committee will be, the committee for which provision is made in this Clause. I am directing a friendly request to him to give us an indication at this stage who those five members will be so that the debate on this clause in particular can be conducted in a realistic way, particularly in view of the five members which he is going to appoint. We will have a better idea as to what the hon. the Minister has in mind and that might perhaps indicate to us whether he will do something which will satisfy the entire teachers&#x2019; community of South Africa. As the position is at the moment, this clause is in direct conflict with all the teachers, with the teachers&#x2019; associations and with the Teachers&#x2019; Federal Council of S.A.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 37, after &#x201C;shall&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after</block>

<p>consultation with the council&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, I move this amendment because I have received representations from the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association who wish to have such an amendment incorporated in this clause in order to protect the democratic right of council members to be consulted as to whom should be their office bearers, chairman and vice-chairman. I may say that in the evidence which was submitted earlier, the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association went further than this. On page 217 of the evidence the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association&#x2019;s proposals suggest that the council, when constituted, should elect its own chairman. These words which I am moving to be inserted into this clause are on the recommendation of the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association. I feel we have the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that these members who are going to serve on this council will be educationists, men of the highest calibre. On this assurance I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would not be willing to consult educationists of this high calibre in order to find out from them who would be acceptable to them as chairman and as their office bearers. Those people who will be represented on the council, as has been suggested by this side of the House, should also be drawn from industry, commerce and mining, besides educationists. Those members of the council will have very valuable advice to give to the Minister. They would also wish to put forward their ideas as to which one of their members could guide them best through the years it is an advisory council. These council members will be men of high standing in the educational field and one trusts and hopes that they will also be drawn from outside the educational field, from those fields which will be dealing with the products of our education. I feel that in moving <span class="col_8395-8396" refersTo="page_1444"/>for the insertion of these words &#x201C;after consultation with the council&#x201D; that if the power is given to the Minister alone to exert his opinion, then surely it might happen&#x2014;I am putting this forward as a question&#x2014;that the council&#x2019;s suggestions might be rejected by the Minister? I feel that we are legislating not only for the present generation and for this present council, but for the future. With due respect, Mr. Chairman, Ministers change and I am moving this because I feel that it is wiser to insert this addition and rely instead on the definition in this clause &#x201C;in consultation with the council&#x201D; which has already been nominated by the Minister. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister very seriously to consider this amendment.</p>

<li>(a) who becomes a member of the executive committee with the consent of his former employer, shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be deemed to have been seconded for the period of his service on that committee, and the period of such service shall for leave purposes and for the purposes of the relevant pension or provident fund be reckoned as part of and continuous with his service with his previous employer, and the provisions of any law applicable to him as a member of any pension or provident fund or, in the event of his death, to his dependants, shall in so far as they are not in conflict with this section, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> continue to apply: Provided that the former employer may regard the post vacated by the service member in order to become a member of the executive committee as vacant and fill it by the appointment of another person;</li>

<li>(b) shall have the same right to vacate his office and to retire as he would have had on the attainment of an <span class="col_8397-8398" refersTo="page_1445"/>age prescribed by the said provisions or any other law or on any subsequent date on which he desires to do so, if he had remained in the service of his former employer.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(9) A service member who on the expiration of his period of office as a member of the executive committee is not again designated or appointed as such a member, and who has not attained the age at which he would in terms of any law referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (8) have been entitled to retire, shall have the right to retire or may be required by the Minister to retire, and shall, if he so retires or is so required to retire, be entitled to the retirement benefits to which he would in terms of the said provisions have been entitled if he had been discharged from the service of his former employer, in the case of a member of a pension fund, on the ground of abolition of his post or, in the case of a member of a provident fund on the superannuation date applicable to his case.</li>

<li>(10) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-section (9), a service member whose service on the executive committee is terminated for a reason not mentioned in sub-section (6) or (7) on or before the expiration of the period for which he was appointed, shall have the option to be transferred back to the service of his former employer and may be so transferred if his former employer has available a suitable post in which he can be appointed.</li>

<li>(11) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law, any contributions required to be made by a service member to any pension or provident fund during the period for which he acts as as a member of the executive committee, shall be based on such an amount, not being less than the amount on which he would have contributed if he had not become such a member, as the Minister may from time to time determine in consultation with the Public Service Commission.</li>

<li>(12) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law, any contributions which in terms of any provision referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (8) are in the case of a service member payable to a pension or provident fund by a person other than such member, shall be paid during his service as a member of the executive committee out of moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purpose.</li>

<li>(13) If any benefit or portion of a benefit which becomes payable to a service member under any law referred to in paragraph (a) of sub-section (8), is not payable out of a pension or provident fund, such portion of that benefit as may be determined by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance, shall be paid out of moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purpose.</li>

</ol>

<p>I think I owe the Committee a clear explanation of the true meaning of sub-sections (3) to (13). I do not think there ought to be any difference of opinion about this, but I think we should be very clear on what they mean. Sub-section (3) of the Bill as it stands now makes provision for the conditions of service of the members of the executive committee. As some of the members may be nominated from the ranks of officials, including teachers, in the Public Service, in the Provincial and other Government administrations, or from the departments of education, or from universities or university colleges or proclaimed institutions, technical colleges with vested rights and privileges in respect of pensions, etc. I shall hereafter refer to them as service members&#x2014;and that will be done in Clause 1. It is necessary to make provision for the protection of their rights so that they will not be prejudiced by accepting an appointment to the Council. Accordingly it is now proposed that this sub-clause be replaced by the new sub-clauses (3) to (13). Sub-clauses (3) to (9) follow the precedents, with minor adjustments, of the legal provisions and customs in other cases where officials in government service are appointed to similar Councils. In the proposed new sub-clause (3) the Minister of Finance is substituted for the Public Service Commission to bring this into line with the recognized practice that where financial considerations are in question, the Department of the Minister of Finance is consulted before the Public Service Commission gives a ruling. The reference to pension benefits is omitted also, for it is dealt with in the next succeeding subclause. Now I should like to ask: Is there any of these sub-clauses (3) to (13) about which hon. members require a special explanation? If so, I shall give it immediately. But perhaps I had better do so.</p>

<p>Sub-clause (4): it is the recognized practice to include this condition in the conditions of service of persons appointed to Government service on a full-time basis. It relates only to the executive committee. Sub-clause (5): This sub-clause seeks to bring these conditions of service into line with similar conditions of service applying to Government posts of this nature, and eliminates the need to have a comprehensive set of dictates for only a small group of people drafted. Sub-clause (6) provides for the circumstances under which a member of the executive committee may be suspended or removed from office. Paragraph (b) applies a procedure provided for by law which gives to such a member the right of a hearing and appeal in the event of his being charged with misconduct. As the Minister <span class="col_8399-8400" refersTo="page_1446"/>cannot be both prosecutor and judge, the provision, has been inserted that if the Minister instructs that disciplinary steps be taken&#x2014;I wish to draw attention to the word &#x201C;instructs&#x201D;&#x2014;the head of his Department has to act as prosecutor, which of course I hope will never happen, but we have to provide for all contingencies. It will ensure that members may not be dismissed arbitrarily with loss of rights and privileges. In this connection I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the provincial administrations, including Natal, have unanimously approved this amendment I am proposing. We must have someone who has to prosecute and the Minister is the judge who will hear the matter. Sub-clause (7) provides that if a service member is removed from office on the ground of ill-health, he will be permitted to resign and still receive the benefits to which he would have been entitled if he had been discharged for health reasons. Here the Public Service procedure is adopted. That is to say, on such discharge he will be eligible for an annuity instead of a gratuity as in the case of ordinary resignation. Sub-clause (8) (a): As the laws applying to his previous service do not in all cases make provision for secondment with retention of privileges and rights to bodies such as these, it is necessary that the hiatus be put right to ensure that a service member will not be prejudiced in respect of pension rights by accepting service in the Council. His membership of a pension or provident fund will be continued. As a (result of representations from the Provincial Administrations, the proviso was added to the end of this paragraph: provided&#x2014;from those words onwards&#x2014;that the former employer may regard the post vacated by the service member in order to become a member of the executive committee as vacant and fill it by the appointment of another person. We added that part as a result of representations from the Provincial Administrations because otherwise certain Provincial ordinances prohibit the Provinces from filling such a post, while a teacher may be serving in the executive committee. Paragraph (b) simply provides that his rights on superannuation are retained.</p>

<p>The rest of the sub-clauses contain more or less this. Sub-section (9) provides that a service member who is retired on the expiry of his term of office in the Executive Committee and before he has reached the normal age for retirement, will receive the benefits which would have been payable if he had been retired on the ground of abolition of office. In the case of a member of a pension fund, a certain number of years are added to his actual service for pension purposes. Sub-clause (10) gives a member referred to in sub-clause (9) a choice of returning to his previous employer&#x2019;s service if the latter has a post available for him, in preference to retirement. Sub-clause (11) provides that if a member qualifies for promotion or salary increases while serving with the Council, that portion of his emoluments on which his contributions to a pension or provident fund are based, may be adjusted to ensure that his retirement benefits will not be adversely affected by service in the Executive Committee. Sub-clauses (12) and (13)&#x2014;I want to take them together&#x2014;provide that any contributions normally payable by a previous employer are paid by the Government while he is serving in the Executive Committee. Any additional liabilities in respect of retirement benefits in the event of such member being retired before reaching the pensionable age, will be paid by the Government. The object of these two sub-clauses is to indemnify the Provincial Administrations and other bodies concerned in respect of additional financial labilities which may result from service in the Executive Committee. I hope that with these few words I have explained my amendments fully, and that it will be appreciated by the Committee that it is necessary. May I again say that these amendments were sent to the four provincial administrations and they all replied that they accept these amendments as they stand.</p>

<p>Now, returning to the amendments moved by the other hon. members, first of all by the hon. member for Durban-Central (Dr. Radford), whose amendment amounts to this, that the hon. member wants to delete that part where two extra members can be appointed by the Minister. I have already made it very clear that I consider that these two members will be of very great assistance right from the start. There are, as far as I can see, numerous important problems to be solved immediately. I find that by working in <i>ad hoc</i> committees, these five members or rather four of them, the two vice-chairmen and the two others, will be most valuable members to appoint as chairman of these <i>ad hoc</i> committees, and I have satisfied myself that it is not Parkinson&#x2019;s law which will build a new empire here, but I feel more than assured that these people will serve a very useful purpose. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment, as I have already intimated in my Second Reading speech, I intend to appoint them immediately, and I still feel that no arguments have been advanced to the contrary to convince me that it would be rather risky or unnecessary to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) feels that the two vice-chairmen are not necessary. Why is the hon. member unwilling to accord to this Council the necessary status that such an important Council deserves? Does he not know that the C.S.I.R. has a number of vice-presidents? Does he not know that in the S.A. Federated Chambers of Industries and the Association of Chambers of Commerce there is not only one vice-president, but quite a few? Does the hon. member not know that it really is an honorary title, that they are the two arms, the Asron and the Hur Moses had to lean upon to be able to do his work? Why is the hon. member dissatisfied that there should be two? If it may be helpful later on, it is so easy, as the hon. member has suggested, to have one Afrikaans- and one <span class="col_8401-8402" refersTo="page_1447"/>English-speaking vice-chairman, or to appoint one man and one woman, for there are so many interests that have to be served. The hon. members are making such strong pleas that the teachers&#x2019; associations should be recognized and consulted and the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) now urges very strongly what the T.T.A. asked for, and that hon. member again referred to the S.A.O.U. The Minister has to put it as broadly as possible, for we are concerned with many interests here, also with provincial interests. I shall have to be very careful in appointing the members of the Council, that I do not appoint all the people from one province. I shall have to distribute them. It is a torn thing we have to try to put together. Now the Committee should not impede me in trying to achieve the greatest possible degree of co-operation by making it as broad as possible. Satisfaction at the commencement is much better than to explain subsequently why you have not done certain things. That is why I should like to say to hon. members, and to the hon. member for Orange Grove in particular, that their concern for the teachers&#x2019; associations is groundless. It is their Council. They are the ones that are most concerned with it, and the expression I used was that the majority of the members will be people whose fingers will still be whitened with chalk. Those are the people who can best advise you and the hon. member for Orange Grove need not worry that the people will fall into a groove and get out of touch. They will be people who have absolutely lived with the teachers and understand his interests, and of course there will be teachers too. I cannot say how many today because I have not yet thought about it. Coming to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North), who asks that I should appoint the chairman only after consultation with the Council, I should like to ask her whether she has considered how many pressure groups will be formed? Every teachers&#x2019; association will insist that their man be appointed, and the churches will do the same. It will be an impossible position. I should like very much to give this Council to the teaching profession, but I am not going to establish a council that will from the outset make me lose the last few hairs on my head. If the hon. members only will accept that the Minister shall appoint the council, for it is his Advisory Council, then the Minister has the right to do so, in the same way that the Minister has the right under the C.S.I.R. Act to say: Naude, you are chairman. The Minister did not ask everybody whether he should appoint Naude as Chairman, and here it is precisely the same. Don&#x2019;t say to de Klerk: Make A, B or C chairman. They are my advisers, who have to advise me. And I certainly am not going to have a chairman there who from the very beginning may not even like my face. I should like to put it thus, that these amendments will not help to improve the Act. This Committee will have to adopt the point of view that the Minister wants to have a Council that will be able to advise him best, and the advice will be known to this hon. House. Everything they do will be Tabled, and if the Minister does not see his way clear to give effect to it, he may be called to account. For those reasons I cannot accept these amendments.</p>

<p>If he were to indicate to us that there is some special work for the next five years, then I could understand why he wants five members on his Executive. But to nominate two vice-chairmen seems unjustifiable. The Minister has mentioned the Chamber of Commerce and other associations. We have this in the teachers&#x2019; associations as well, where you have a chairman and a vice-chairman, and sometimes an ex-chairman, but the reason for that is because they are telling us who will probably be chairman the following year. When there is rotation you get two vice-chairmen nominated, and they have order of precedence, but there is no order of precedence here. This Council will be run in exactly the same way as the board of directors of a company. There will be a chairman, and should the board meet when the chairman is absent, the members will appoint a chairman. Similarly, if you have a vice-chairman, the risk of having to appoint a chairman is very small indeed. I support the hon. member for Orange Grove. I think he has made out a very convincing case. There is no one I can think of who will be competing for these jobs. There will not be several nominations of people who wish to be chairman. The Minister will appoint his own chairman, and if he wants a nucleus he can appoint a vice-chairman as well. We thought two would be sufficient, but the Minister says he wants five. We see no justification for it, and we cannot see why there should be two vice-chairmen. It seems something absolutely unknown in such an organization.</p>

<p>I should merely like to refer to the Minister&#x2019;s amendment and tell him that, as far as this side is concerned, it would appear to us that it is an improvement that puts right some of the defects and shortcomings to which we referred at the second reading. But now I should like to refer him to subclauses (7) (a) and (b), and to make my objections clear I should like to read what appears there; (a) provides that if a service member becomes afflicted with a permanent infirmity of mind or body which renders him unable properly to discharge the duties of his office, the Minister may allow him to vacate his office; or remove him from office on the ground of incapacity. Then the Minister says in (b) &#x201C;a service member who is in terms of sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (a) allowed to vacate his office shall be deemed to have been retired on the ground of ill-health and shall be entitled <span class="col_8403-8404" refersTo="page_1448"/>to receive the benefits from the provident or pension fund to which he would have been entitled if he had been discharged from the service of his former employer on the ground of ill-health &#x2026; as the Minister may direct&#x201D;. Now it seems to me that the Minister is providing in (b) that the one falling under (a) who is allowed to vacate his office voluntarily may draw benefits under the pension fund, but if he does not do so and the Minister removes him from office, he loses all. I shall be pleased if the Minister will tell me where the case is dealt with under 7 (a) (ii). What about the man who is discharged from office? What about the pension contributions he has paid? What happens to that?</p>

<p>I do not wish to take the Minister back to the replies we have already dealt with this morning, except again with reference to his large executive body. I think I should once again refer the Minister to a body such as the Historical Monuments Commission, which performs functions that are as important as those this body will perform, and whose Chairman is not even a member of the permanent division or nucleus, or of the secretariat. The secretary, with his officials, constitute the secretariat. The Minister has referred to the fact that in the C.S.I.R. and other bodies there are a president and a vice-president, but they are there in honorary positions and it is irrelevant to the matter we have before us now. The members before us do not occupy honorary positions. They are important persons who are appointed on a permanent basis and who will receive high salaries, and who will be members of a body which in my view is too large and clumsy to be able to do its work thoroughly. The Minister will recall the evidence before the Select Committee, and that the bulk of the evidence was in favour of such a nucleus, but the vast majority of the witnesses also felt that the nucleus should be small and not large. I think the Minister would have acted much more wisely, and would have been more realistic, if he had been satisfied with only a chairman and two vice-chairmen, but I think it is wrong to appoint those two extra persons. But he has already indicated that he is going to do so, and I merely wish to repeat that I think he is making a mistake. The body will be cumbersome. For that reason I wish to support the hon. members on this side who spoke before me. But it seems to me the Minister has now put his foot down. He has become stubborn. He simply will not listen. He has now decided firmly that the body will consist of five members, and I think he is making a mistake, and that is why we cannot support him.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the point raised by the hon. member for Hillbrow on 7 (a) (ii). The person&#x2019;s vacation of office in that case is governed by the laws of the scheme to which he belongs, whether it be provincial or that of the Central Government. In his case we have no difficulty, and we do not require further provision. I do not think hon. members need worry. When he has attained a certain age, he receives his pension. Ample provision has been made here and I am satisfied with it. To the other two members who have spoken here, I should just like to say this. In my second reading speech I mentioned very clearly some of the matters to which the Council will have to give its attention. I am thinking here of the diversity of training and awards of diplomas to teachers at universities, university colleges and technical colleges; the question of the organization of secondary education; differentiation; the question of puberty education; the diversity of choices of subject and contents of syllabuses; what is understood pedagogically under general moulding education and vocational training &#x2026;</p>

<p>I can well believe that the Minister believes that this work is piling up. Nevertheless it is most important that the steps which are taken to deal with this work should be taken after a good deal of consideration. The picture which the Minister paints of this council of his&#x2014;and I hope he will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;seems to indicate that there will be a sort of executive committee of five sitting permanently in session and then calling the council together at odd times. The Minister goes on to say that these five, or four of them at any rate, will be busily occupied as chairmen of <i>ad hoc</i> committees investigating different subjects. It seems therefore that these five permanent officials, all of whom will be designated by the Minister and whom he admits himself he will choose because they fit in with his ideas&#x2014;I think that is what he said just now, namely that he would not choose them merely because he liked the colour of their eyes but because they fitted in with his ideas&#x2014;it seems to me that this is rather doing things in a hurry. I would suggest that he should consider getting his council together and then asking them, as was suggested by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North), to appoint their chairman themselves. Am I to under <span class="col_8405-8406" refersTo="page_1449"/>stand that the chairman will be a full-time official? In other words, he will become a State official, as do the other four members of the executive. Is that correct?</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>These are permanent officials, and from my experience of very important work with which I have been connected, I think the work can be done very much better if it is done by people who meet from time to time, who mix in the world other than that of Pretoria, where presumably this council will be stationed, and who apart from occasional trips overseas will mix with other people in the country. I do feel that part-time employment, even in the case of the chairman and the vice-chairman, produce the best results in a democratic state. Where items quite as important as education are concerned, that system works quite satisfactorily, and particularly does it work well where advice has to be given, because this is a purely advisory council. Then I want to go further and I want to know why these <i>ad hoc</i> committees must always have a chairman from the executive committee? Surely there will be members of the council in different parts of the country with which they are familiar who know the local circumstances better than the executive committee and who presumably will be quite competent enough to be the chairmen of these <i>ad hoc</i> committees. Furthermore, in the Minister&#x2019;s choice of his executive, must he always think in terms of a man being a suitable chairman? Because there are quite distinguished people in different branches of science and education and learning generally who are hopeless chairmen but who would be quite valuable people on this council of his and who may have a particular knowledge of the subject which he wants to have considered. I want also to refer to the clause which prevents fulltime members of the staff from taking on remunerative work without the consent of the Minister. Sir, this practice of full-time officials assuming other remunerative posts is a growing evil in public life in this country and one which is very difficult to check. It means that at least one post must suffer. I know of people who hold two or three posts, one of which is full-time, for which they receive separate salaries. I can quite understand that if on the Minister&#x2019;s advisory council he has a very distinguished man in a certain branch, the Federation of Rhodesia or Great Britain or France or some other country might say: &#x201C;We would like you to lend us this man to investigate something for us&#x201D;, and that he might then be seconded to this work, and if necessary he could receive not only the honour but also some remuneration for it. That I can well understand but I very strongly object to the habit which is appearing now amongst public officials occupying various appointments in the Public Service or at universities or in hospitals and similar places receiving full-time salaries and then, with or without consent, take on other remunerative posts. If I had had time to consider this matter I might have moved an amendment in this regard. If somebody takes a full-time post he should devote the whole of his time to that post.</p>

If that is the position, then a lot of people are going to be appointed to this council who will have nothing to do. Sir, this is a dictatorial attitude that the hon. the Minister is adopting.

<p>I will do that, Sir. These people on the executive committee are going to be responsible directly to the Minister and apparently to nobody else. I was hoping that this executive committee of the council was going to be a group of people appointed for their ability in one department of education or another for the benefit of the whole country, and I was of the opinion that this executive was going to advise the Minister on education matters as a whole. I was also of the opinion that under those circumstances the present provincial set-up would not be interfered with. But I can see now, from what the Minister has said, that this executive committee will determine what is good; the Minister will decide that these people, who as I said in my Second Reading speech will be the reflection of the Minister, do the right thing and he will then instruct the provinces to carry out his wishes. There is nothing that the hon. the Minister has said that will detract from the opinion that I have just expressed. I cannot see any gleam of hope of independence for this group of people if the hon. the Minister is going to continue along these lines.</p>

<p>I should like to support the amendment of the hon. member for Johannesburg (Mrs. Weiss), in which she asks that the Minister should consult with the council before appointing the chairman of this Council. I think that the success of this Council will depend largely on the reputation and the personality of the chairman and the position the Chairman of this Council will occupy. In other words, the chairman will have to be a person in whom the rest of the members of the council will have complete confidence. I think that it is essential when you have a group of educationists together as in the case of this council, that will have to perform such an important task, <span class="col_8407-8408" refersTo="page_1450"/>that one should ascertain who is the best man to take the lead. To give that lead he must enjoy the confidence of the Council itself. When the chairman has to be elected, then I believe it will be best to convene the Council so that they may have, a discussion among themselves and decide which one of them is the best one to take the lead. Then they could come to the Minister and recommend that so and so should be the chairman. Alternatively, the Minister may consult the Council and say to them: I think Mr. A or Mr. B or Mr. X will be the best chairman. In that way he will have the confidence of the Council and ensure that the best man is appointed for this important task as chairman of that council. But if the hon. the Minister, as the clause now stands, simply goes along and appoints the chairman as he thinks fit, he must realize that a certain member of that council might feel that he is a wonderful leader in the sphere of education and he might feel aggrieved because he has not been considered for the chairmanship. This Council itself will be best able to decide who should be the chairman. If the hon. the Minister will accept the amendment of the hon. member for Johannesburg North, he will ensure that the <i>esprit de corps</i> of that Council will be of the very best immediately.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) has replied to the question of the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. Van Nierop). The members will consult with one another. They can be asked who should be the chairman: who will be the best leader of the council.

The hon. the Minister the other day himself said that when you consult with people, it does not mean that you are depriving them of any of their rights. That is why he said in the case of the provinces. So here he will not be depriving himself of any rights; he simply asks the members of the council who in their view will be the best chairman. That is why I think the hon. the Minister ought to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>When I was speaking before, I asked the hon. the Minister a question regarding these five permanent members. I should like to have clarity in regard to one more matter. If my memory serves me correctly, the hon. the Minister in his second reading speech said that he was not going to appoint three, but that he was going to appoint the full five and that in the course of the debate he hoped to give an indication of who the persons are.</p>

<p>I fully accept the word of the hon. the Minister that he did not say that. I was under the impression that he had said something along those lines, but I accept the assurance of the hon. the Minister. Of course it would help a lot if we could know whether the hon. the Minister already has a chairman in mind, and if he could then give us some indication as to who that person is.</p>

<p>No. If it is a person who cannot be attacked politically, that would be the strongest argument the Minister could use by now mentioning the name of that person. But the mere fact that the hon. the Minister has given an indication that if the name of the person is mentioned, he might possibly be dragged into politics, makes me feel still more anxious to know who those five persons are going to be.</p>

<p>It was contended by the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations and by other teachers&#x2019; associations, whose evidence I have not quoted here, that these five members that are proposed here, will forfeit their independence if they become full-time Public Servants, and that as a result of that forfeiture they will be subject to the Minister instead of to the interests of the child and the school and education in South Africa. The hon. the Minister has not replied adequately to this complaint of the organized teachers and the fact that he has not done so will be held against him in the future by all the teachers, by all our schools, large and small.</p>

<p>I am not going to detain the Committee for long. I know the hon. the Minister wants to have co-operation on the Council which he is going to appoint as soon as possible. We are not asking for the approval of the Council in this amendment; we are not asking for the consent of the Council. We are only asking that the Minister will go to the Council and say to them: &#x201C;Look, I should like to appoint this person or that person; I have my eye on him; I think he will be an outstanding chairman. Let me consult with you now.&#x201D; If he can get co-operation after that consultation, he immediately starts off on firm ground; then he starts off with the confidence of those people and with a chairman who enjoys the confidence of the Council. That is what we are asking for; we are asking nothing more. I think it will be a wise addition to the clause, which will have the immediate effect not only that the Council will be well disposed towards him but also that the Chairman will immediately have the support and the goodwill of the Council.</p>

<p>I should like to state the matter thus: What stops me under this legislation first of all to appoint the five executive committee members and then to consult with them and to say to them: Look, here I have a long list of names; who do you think will be the best members to appoint? But now the hon. member wants to pin me down; I have to nominate the council first, and then the council must tell me whom I should appoint as Chairman. I am pleading that I should be given a free hand, because it might be better. When it comes to tin tacks and brass nails, the idea expressed here is the best, but why have I laid it down in the legislation? I have to see to it that I get the best chairman, and the best executive committee and the best councillors. I think it will be best if hon. members will leave it at that.</p>

<p>I must say that I cannot see how the Minister can possibly have a freely-thinking council with a permanent member appointed as chairman by somebody else. How can you possibly have a free debate and a free decision when you have at least five members who are permanent and one of whom is the permanent chairman? We must assume that the council will not meet very often; in other words, that there will be intervals between the meetings. Apparently, as I see the picture unfolding, a picture which was so well described by my colleague here, it seems to me that these five members will be in the nature of an executive Cabinet and that they will take decisions and give advice to the hon. the Minister. They will be a minority in the council. What is to happen if the council decides that the advice given to the Minister by the executive in the interval is advice which they cannot endorse? What is to happen under those circumstances? That is not an uncommon thing to happen, and I can easily see it happening here. If the Minister appoints 23 and there is a minority of five or six at a council meeting, what is to happen then?</p>

<p>On Clause 4,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 4 deals with the tenure of office of members of the council, and I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 1 and 2, page 5, to omit &#x201C;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Minister after consultation with the council is of the opinion that&#x201D;; and to omit all the words after &#x201C;council&#x201D; in line 4, to the end of the Clause.</block>

<p>Of course I want to say again that I do not think it is right for the Minister not to keep to his promise when he says that he will not interfere with the working of the council, as he said earlier on in the debate. He said he would not interfere, and he would leave it to the council to run its own affairs. However here he says quite blatantly that a man may be removed from his office by the Minister &#x201C;if in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D; he has made himself guilty of improper conduct. How is the hon. the Minister going to know about this if he does not get information from somebody in this council? If that should happen, surely the right thing would be to have a consultation with the members of the council to find out what has happened. The hon. the Minister himself wishes in certain cases such <span class="col_8415-8416" refersTo="page_1454"/>as when misconduct or something else arises where there shall be removal of the Administrator&#x2019;s nominee, to take the advice of the Administrator or to consult with the Administrator, but in all other cases, he takes it upon himself to remove the person. I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us presently why he takes it upon himself whilst in other cases he consults the Administrator. If the hon. the Minister agrees to my amendment, then the second part of this clause will fall away automatically and it will not be necessary to introduce this part of the clause which says &#x201C;or if the Minister after consultation with the council is of the opinion that due to other circumstances &#x2026;&#x201D;. I do not know what the other circumstances are. Will the hon. the Minister tell us? Does it mean that if the man does not come up to the Minister&#x2019;s expectations in carrying out some of the duties, he will be removed? I also want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this special dispensation that he is prepared to give in regard to the Provincial Administrator will be explained fully, and why they should be treated differently to, say, a teachers&#x2019; organization?</p>

<p>I have; but the hon. member won&#x2019;t understand them. It has been received. Sir, at the very least with strong reservations and at the most with trepidation and repugnance by responsible bodies throughout South Africa. This is the clause which empowers the hon. the Minister to appoint small committees of three to investigate all schools, public and private, which may receive public funds, however small the extent of those public funds may be. It is a clause which is instituting a not so very Special Branch of this educational council. It is a clause which introduce a form of snooping by these small committees into all the schools in South Africa, and it will indeed make the hon. the Minister the Snoop-er-intendent-General of Education in South Africa. In view of all this, Sir, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (2).</block>

<p>This clause says in detail that the hon. the Minister may appoint a committee of three to investigate any school. I do not wish to interpret the clause unfairly; I want to add that he must consult with the Administrator and also act on the recommendations of the council before any such investigation is made into any particular school. I do not think that either of those is a tolerable guarantee to prevent abuse. First of all, consulting with an Administrator who has been appointed by the Government, probably a person with the same views as the Government, is no safeguard. And secondly, acting on the recommendations of the council, or rather the majority of the council, whose views will be the same as those of the hon. the Minister, is by no means a safeguard that this clause, particularly subsection (2), will not be abused by this council.</p>

<p>These little committees of three cap obtain access to schools in two ways. First of all, if the school falls under the Provincial Council, access can be obtained through the consent of the Superintendent-General of Education or the authority in charge of that school. In the case of other schools, private schools receiving a small proportion of public funds, access by these investigating committees can be obtained with the consent and the approval of the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science.</p>

<p><span class="col_8417-8418" refersTo="page_1455"/>That simply means the hon. the Minister himself can say that a private school, even though it receives a very small amount, can be investigated by one of these small but potentially dangerous little committees.</p>

<p>As I have said this is a most deplorable clause. If this is a clause to investigate defects in a particular school then I maintain that this clause is utterly and completely unnecessary because the machinery already does exist for investigating your ordinary schools to-day. We have that machinery in the professional men, the inspectors of the Departments of Education of the four provinces. If the intention of this Bill is to see that the ordinances are complied with then the inspectors can do that&#x2014;and there is no need for a special committee. If the intention of the hon. the Minister is to see whether the teachers are doing their jobs, the inspectors can do that; that is part of their job. If the intention is to see whether public funds are properly administered, that too can be done through the usual channels, through existing channels. If the intention is to see whether the proper syllabuses are followed as laid down, that can be done&#x2014;and it is being done by the inspectors of the four provincial departments. In other words, if you want to see whether the laws of the land, the ordinances are being carried out, there is a fine body of professional men, the inspectors, who can carry out the necessary inspection. That, Sir, is if you want to see whether the law of the land is being carried out.</p>

<p>But, Sir, if you want to start changing the law, if you want to start interfering in the law and its application in the schools, then the ordinary inspectors cannot do that type of work. Then indeed the door is opened for abuse by committees of this nature for bringing about changes in the schools and in the law. I am particularly worried about the private schools in this country and the extent to which they will be affected by this clause. That concern is shared by the conference of headmasters and headmistresses of private schools in South Africa. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to go into any details but I do want the hon. the Minister to give us some indication of what these particular committees will do! what type of investigation can they possibly carry on in the schools of South Africa which the ordinary inspectors cannot do to-day? If it is to investigate, as the hon. the Minister said in the Second Reading, more modern ideas and more modern methods which particular schools may be following, then one can understand it. But there is not a single school in this country adopting modern methods or advanced ideas in education, which will not be proud and happy to invite a member of this council to come to investigate what is going on.</p>

<p>In fact, Sir, in the memorandum submitted by the conference of headmasters and headmistresses of private schools, a specific invitation was extended: &#x201C;Please come and look at the way in which we are running our schools; we have nothing to hide: come and have a look: if, you can learn anything, please da come.&#x201D; To conduct an investigation of that nature, I am sure, does not warrant the appointment of these committees. [Interjections.] Did the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) say that these committees may not go? We do not want an official committee of this particular council to do the investigation. What I said was this: There was an open invitation to the members of the Select Committee to investigate those particular private schools so that they could see that they had nothing to hide, and so that they could learn from them. The Minister has admitted that there were many respects in which we Could learn from them such as the introduction of post-matriculation courses, the leaving of discipline in the hands of prefects, new methods of teaching science etc. But for that you do not need an investigating committee of three of the nature envisaged by the hon. the Minister in this particular Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, again the question arises: What do the experts say, those people who really know about teaching, the teaching bodies in South Africa, on this particular issue? There are three different groups of teachers in South Africa. There are first of all the teachers in the largely Afrikaans schools; secondly, there are the teachers in the largely English schools, and thirdly, there is the combined organization of all these different teaching organizations. I should like to read to the Committee what these organizations have to say about this particular provision, and about the dangers inherent in the idea of having these little committees of three investigating the different schools of our country.

<p>I should not have condescended to reply to the hon. member, if he had understood the matter as well as his colleagues who served on the Select Committee. Messrs. Kidd, Wilson and Osier, who represented private schools before the Select Committee, personally asked me to tell the Minister that his council will be welcome at all times to visit those schools. I then said yes, but that is not the idea of that committee at all. In the whole clause there is nothing relative to a private school. Where does the hon. member get the whole tirade he has held on private schools, when there is nothing in this clause about it? But there is a guilty feeling that things are done in the private schools that would have been done by the United Party if we had had private C.N.E. schools. But we do not have them. It was pointed out expressly by the witnesses that the greatest C.N.E. principle is to found at the present time in the school of Mr. Osier, namely Kearnsley College. That is where C.N.E. is. We do not have it. But even if the hon. member had reason to take the field against this clause, then everything just turns on their assumption that we will act in the manner in which they might have been expected to act if they had been <i>U</i> in our shoes. And, Mr. Chairman, the Clause has no such object. The Clause simply seeks to appoint committees to do certain work, <span class="col_8419-8420" refersTo="page_1456"/>where the whole Council will not be needed. I put a question to Prof. Burger, a dignified man who represented a very big organization, namely the Academy. Should there be such committees that will snoop? His words were: A Council of this nature would not stoop to such trivialities. It would not stoop to such trivialities. Why does the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) now try to drag this Bill down to those trivialities? Why is he trying to do that? Those committees will conduct their work in a purely scientific manner. They will approach the provinces. In fact we inserted a provision there that nothing less than the highest authority in the province should grant permission beforehand. And if that Council is tied down in such a way that it may not visit a school or may not send people to visit any educational institution, it will be powerless. But now, after the pleas this morning as to how the members of the Council and the members of the committees should be so closely connected with education, we find now that they are concerned with the Council, and they do not want the council to seek contact with education. Certain motives have been ascribed by members of the Opposition and by witnesses to this idea that sub-committees may visit schools and institutions&#x2014;unworthy motives&#x2014;and I hope the Minister will not take notice of any attempt to detract from the worthiness of this legislation and the dignity of the Council he wants to establish.</p>

<p>The hon. member opposite calls it a Gestapo clause. I would call it an inquisitor&#x2019;s clause. One of the witnesses referred to it as that, in giving evidence before the Select Committee. This is a clause which has caused a great deal of anxiety throughout the circles of educationists in the four provinces of South Africa. This is one of the clauses in this Bill which has created a great deal of controversy.</p>

<p>I would like to refer the hon. the Minister back to 1960 when there was a debate by educationists in the Transvaal Provincial Council on this very issue of a National Education Advisory Bill which was then introduced for the first time. I am referring to the Hansard of the Provincial Council of 11 May 1960. It was condemned by our side of the House in no uncertain terms as unwarranted interference and the imposition of control over the functions of the Provincial Councils regarding the inspection of schools. They stated that there was no need for an advisory council with such sinister powers as provided for in this Clause.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister something about this particular Clause. Earlier this year the hon. the Minister said, when the Bill was first introduced, before it was sent to a Select Committee,&#x2014;that was on 22 January&#x2014;that in appointing a Select Committee he was giving an opportunity to all interested people to appear and to give evidence. He said then what more could a Government do to take the public into its confidence? I would like to know from the Minister, if he wishes to have public confidence, whether he could not suitably amend this Clause which is one of the most unhappy Clauses of this Bill before us this afternoon. As I said in the second reading, the investigating powers which these committees will have are far too wide. All the information that they may require about schools can be obtained through provincial sources. If these committees wish to have any information at all they can obtain it through statutory machinery, machinery which exists in all the four provinces. Therefore I wish to put forward seriously for the Minister&#x2019;s consideration the insertion of these words that the investigation should be conducted &#x201C;in accordance with the provisions of any law relating to the conduct of the inspection of schools&#x201D;, any provincial law which prevails at the time. In the evidence that we heard in the Select Committee witnesses stressed the anxiety which there was regarding this particular clause. Surely an amendment on the lines of the one which I am putting forward now will go some way to allay their anxiety and to improve this clause. I therefore put this amendment forward for the Minister&#x2019;s consideration in order that this very unhappy clause of this Bill may not interfere with provincial powers and that they will utilize the services of the provinces which are available to be used.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) has already replied to a large extent to the speech of the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan). I merely wish to add that it is a long time since last I came across so many negative arguments and negative persons. The hon. member first of all referred to everything that is bad and what could possibly happen. It is not in this Bill and Mr. Chairman, you will not permit me to refer to it; he dilated upon everything that will be done, whether it will be defects that will be sought; whether it will be an enquiry into the funds, into the activities, into the syllabuses&#x2014;and having referred to all the negative things, he asks me a question. He nevertheless has retained such a degree of positiveness that he wished to know from the Minister what he now really wishes to do with these committees. That is pathetic con <span class="col_8421-8422" refersTo="page_1457"/>duct. He wants to know what we are going to do with these committees. Everything occupies so much time. I am appointing a council here. I am not the expert; the hon. member is not an expert either. But it is this very Council that will have to tell us when it becomes necessary. I remind the hon. member that in my second reading speech I mentioned an example. If e.g. you wish to know something more about the deaf, surely then you will want to visit a school for the deaf; then surely you will wish to collect first-hand knowledge there. How many commissions of enquiry relative to school and educational matters do not go to the schools direct? I was Chairman of a commission of enquiry relative to central schools in Transvaal, e.g., when we investigated the whole movement of centralization of schools. My commission and I&#x2014;the commission consisted <i>inter alia</i> of officials&#x2014;visited the schools. We were admitted to those schools. We investigated and studied the matter on the spot. I just want to say the two amendments are alike&#x2014;six of the one and half a dozen of the other. If the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) succeeds, then the amendment of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) is not necessary. If the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington does not succeed, then the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) will try to let hers succeed. But in both cases we are exactly where we were&#x2014;in other words, no <i>ad hoc</i> committee, no enquiry, but everything should be done on the usual inspection level. Now that is very strange to me. Hon. members quote from the Blue Book time and again, and then they tell us what the Federal Council of the Teachers&#x2019; Associations say, etc. Here the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations says what they are quoting all day long, that the <i>ad hoc</i> committees are one of the best things, and they want them. The teachers want them, for they will be experts who know how things go. I cannot say which problems will be investigated. If the Government is bent on snooping, to find out what is going on, why should we require this legislation? We could then surely do it through our ordinary inspectors. The inspectors appointed in the three Nationalist provinces, and in the other one too, are Public Servants. We can give those inspectors an instruction. I can instruct all the inspectors in my Department to keep their noses to the ground and to do what the hon. member for Orange Grove does&#x2014;smell out whether there is something wrong. We do not need a committee of people who are appointed to make an enquiry at all. Remember, Mr. Chairman, that only the chairman of the committee is a member of the Council. The two additional members are experts in the field of the subject to be investigated. These two people do not get there of their own volition. The clause should be read in its context. These people have to get the permission of the Directors of Education in the other provinces, and of the Superintendent-general of Education in the Cape Province, or of the Secretary for Education Arts and Science&#x2014;that is to say from the people who control admission to the schools. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) wants to come along with another amendment. I hope he withdraws it, for it is an amendment that is wrong. It is not the Administrator or the Minister who controls it. Admission to schools by commissions or whoever it may, be, is in the hands of the Directors of Education, and he delegates his powers to inspectors and school principals. We are not just going to admit any committee which wishes to go and visit a school, and say that it may go there on its own. The Council will in the first place have to say that this or that matter will have to be investigated. It will say: We do not have enough knowledge; 15 of us are gathered together here and we do not have sufficient information before us; we shall have to obtain more information now, and so now we appoint member A of the Council as chairman and we appoint the following two experts and we ask them to submit reports to us and to furnish us with information on this matter. I have already replied during the second reading to the hon. member for Kensington. He is an ex-inspector of schools. Does he want to get up here to-day and say&#x2014;he will not do so for he is an honest person&#x2014;to Committee: As an ex-inspector I have knowledge of every subject in education and I am an expert on every phase of education, and it is not necessary to send a committee; I shall be able to furnish the answers? He will never do that. There are so many facets, so many divisions. If he wants to tell me that he and all his inspectors can do so, then I could consider this amendment. But, Mr. Chairman, it is simply impossible. We who have the practical experience&#x2014;and I also had the practical experience&#x2014;know that it cannot be done. Let me tell the hon. members this. When I was the principal of a school, I found that young inspectors were appointed by the Department of Education, and they were told: Go and visit that school or certain aspects of the work De Klerk is doing in the school, and stay there for two or three days. I received young inspectors in my school, who stayed there for two or three days, and they came there not to conduct an inspection but to come and learn. Then they go to another school for something else. I have one inspector who stole a lot of my school-children&#x2019;s scripts because they were so nice, and he proceeded to exhibit them at other schools and to say that the work should be done in that way. I am not boasting, but I am merely mentioning this from my own experience. If it is necessary for us to smell out and seek out things then I would rather use our officials; I would rather use an inspector of schools and say to him: &#x201C;I believe that in this school this is happening and in that school that is happening&#x201D;. But these committees have been defined in the clause in such a way that I really cannot understand this amendment, except only to attach the one interpretation and meaning to it, <span class="col_8423-8424" refersTo="page_1458"/>namely that hon. members do not believe it themselves. They wish to spread the idea in the whole country that here we have a Nazi Minister who wants to smell out things by Nazi methods. [Interjections.] The Opposition are very welcome to feel that way about the matter. This adverse propaganda does not harm me as a politician in any way. It is almost the same as in the case of a Hollywood star. The more the Press say about him that is, wrong, the less other people believe it, and the more they think of him. That is why I say that these two amendments are devoid of any necessity, and I am standing here like the Rock of Gibraltar and I will riot concede anything more.</p>

<p>It will not help the Minister at all for him to become hasty or to get irritated. We do not wish to arouse any ideas. It is not our intention to engender suspicion. We wish to state our case and we have the right to do so. Nor do we wish to accuse the Minister of intending to use his Council or Committee for purposes of snooping, but he knows as well as I do that the S.A.O.U. said that this Council that is to be established should not act as a body of inquisitors. [Interjections.] I shall be pleased if those hon. friends whose mouths have been sealed will get up and talk and help us to improve this law. But what are the members who sat on the Select Committee doing? They are silent. I wish to refer once again to what the S.A.O.U. said about this matter, and the Akademie also. To the question: Ought committees to be given the power to investigate matters in schools? the Akademie replied, through Prof. Burger, who cannot really be called a United Party supporter: &#x201C;I would not like either the Council or its committees to stoop down to investigate questions which are not related to matters of general principle and which fall within the purview of the school authorities&#x201D;. That is why we say these committees should be appointed. They are needed. We are not opposed to the establishment of these committees, but we feel that these committees could so easily be charged with being inquisitors if we were to permit them to go to schools to ascertain certain things. The local provincial machinery is there and that could be used to report to the Committee or to the Council itself. That is the reason why we feel it is dangerous to give these people access to the schools. I do not believe there is a single principal who would like people to come from outside to investigate matters in his school. The Minister, at the time when he was still a principal, would have had no objections if his provincial inspector had told him: The Advisory Council wishes to conduct research into certain matters, e.g. the preparation of scholars for the matriculation examination. We can understand that, especially as there is a rumour that the matriculation examination will no longer be a written examination, and in passing I should like to say that that is already 50 years too late. It should have been so long ago already. If the provincial machinery were used to report to the Council, it would have a sound effect, but this kind of thing as proposed here may give rise to suspicion, and that is one of the things the Minister himself wishes to avoid. He does not wish his Council to act as inquisitors but the possibility is there that they may be accused of being just that. For that reason we feel that the Minister should accept our amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to put one matter right, for the point of view of the Akademie is being referred to time and again.

Now I should just like to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow that as regards his whole argument in relation to these two amendments, it is quite clear surely that I should have preferred the amendment of the hon. member for Orange Grove. Delete the whole provision and let the inspectors do it, instead of your being able to appoint committees, but as the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) puts it, provided that such an investigation should be conducted in accordance with the legal provisions relative to the management and inspection of schools. But the inspectors can do that. Then you merely make a travesty of this clause. There is only one thing, and I am repeating this now, which hon. members must realize. We have the honest object that the <i>ad hoc</i> committees&#x2014;and that is why they are called <i>ad hoc</i> committees and not standing committees&#x2014;are appointed to do certain work.</p>

<p>I am sorry the Minister took the line he did just now. I feel that our children are now entitled to say that they asked for education and the Minister has given them a stone. This reference to the Rock of Gibraltar is all very well in politics, but what we are seeking from the Minister is not only his co-operation in this matter but that it shall be seen to be done, and it is not good that that kind of language should be <span class="col_8425-8426" refersTo="page_1459"/>used in this debate. I want to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;the&#x201D; in line 24, up to and including &#x201C;education&#x201D; in line 26, and to substitute &#x201C;Administrator concerned</block>

<p>I regret that the Minister found it necessary in advance to say that he was not prepared to accept it, because he condemned it with scant ceremony, but I want to ask him to apply his mind to it. The position is this, that as the clause stands at present, when a committee has been established for the purpose of an investigation, it gets permission to enter certain schools from certain people who are referred to in the clause as &#x201C;the person authorized to give such consent&#x201D;. The person authorized to give such consent is being specified, which is a great pity. It would have been much better if no person was specified, because the authority entitled to give consent is known, and there is no difficulty about that. The Minister has chosen to insert who those people should be and I can understand that there might be some difficulty in regard to private schools, where private schools fall to be dealt with for such purposes as are envisaged in this clause by the advisory council to be established. In other words, there are private schools which will not come under the purview of the council, but some will, and I can understand the Minister&#x2019;s trouble there. But let me deal with the position of the provincial schools. Sub-clause (2) (a) says that the Minister may after consultation with the Administrator concerned appoint a committee to make certain investigations. Let us look at it from the practical point of view. The Minister consults with the Administrator concerned and presumably he puts to the Administrator precisely what it is contemplated to investigate. But at that time he does not ask the Administrator for authority to enter his school, as the clause stands. He waits until the next succeeding clause, and having consulted with the Administrator in regard to the ambit of the inquiry to be undertaken, he then goes to an official, a servant of the Administrator, and says he wants his permission to enter the school of the Administrator. I am sorry the Minister shakes his head. That is what is before us. Surely the simple thing is that while consulting the Administrator, he should at the same time be asked for authority to enter the school. That would be in line with present policy and usage. But it is quite wrong for the Administrator to be consulted and then for the Administrator not to give consent for the entry to the school. The Director, or the Superintendent-General of Education, is the servant of the Administrator. They work on the basis of instructions received, and under the present system which obtains in all the provinces, usually known as the A.A. system, or &#x201C;Approved in Advance&#x201D;, they go to the member of the executive committee dealing with the matter, who is acting as the mouthpiece of the Administrator, and he approves these things in advance. These things are dealt with in that way by the hundred in all four provinces, and when the full executive meets these matters are dealt with in quick order because every member of the executive knows what authority he can exercise. But the way this clause is framed it is simply a slap in the face of all four Administrators. It says: We will consult with the Administrator, but we will not ask him for authority to enter his schools; we will go to his servant and ask his permission to do it. If it is to be passed in this form, in what position are we putting the Directors-General of Education? It may well be that in the other three provinces they will bow and accept it with grace, but I am dealing with this from the point of view of someone who values the authority conferred on the Administrators, and I feel I am entirely justified in telling the Minister that when he is negotiating with the Administrator, please ask him for permission to enter his school. But do not put the Administrator in the position that one of his officials can give permission to enter a school, and the Administrator is put out of the picture completely. I think you are putting the Director-General of Education in a hopelessly false position when you clothe him with that authority which you are not prepared to give to his master, the Administrator, because as the law stands to-day the head of the Department of Education is the Administrator.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>First of all I want to explain my reference to the Rock of Gibraltar. I was not referring to the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast. I was referring to the two amendments moved by the hon. members for Orange Grove and Johannesburg (North). A principle is involved in those two amendments, but there is not such a big principle involved in the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast. Still, there is a vast difference between (a) and (b). In Clause 5 (2) (a) the Administrator is asked to accede to a principle, to have an investigation. The Minister of Education discusses the principle with the Administrator, that we find it necessary to have an investigation on a certain point. After the Administrator accedes to that request, it moves on to the next person, who acts under delegated powers from the Administrator as head of the Education Department, the Director or the Superintendent-General, or my own Secretary. That is only asking for admission to individual schools. The Administrator cannot be burdened with these minor tasks. They may say, e.g., that they want to visit a primary school in a vicinity where you have well-to-do people. Then they go to the head of the Education Department and ask him to name one. Then we want to visit another school in a poorer area, and they ask him to name one. Then we want to investigate some more intelligent children, and we ask him to mention a school where the percentage is rather high. What does the <span class="col_8427-8428" refersTo="page_1460"/>

Administrator know about these details? What do I as Minister know about it? I must go to my Secretary and he again must consult his officials. I think the way it is put here is logical. It is not a slap in the face of the Administrator. In 5 (2) (a) the principle is discussed, and in 5 (2) (b) the principle is put into practice, and I cannot agree with the hon. member for South Coast. In my view there is nothing wrong with it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>May I just ask this? The Minister said that after consultation with the Administrator, and his consent having been obtained, they go to visit the schools. The first question is this. Is the issue as to whether there shall be an inquiry or not settled when the Administrator says yes or no, and if the Administrator says there can be no inquiry, then there can be no approach to the Director-General?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>No, let me put it very clearly. It is not in consultation, but after consultation. The Minister still has the power to have that investigation in any case. But that does not alter my argument as I stated it here. After I have consulted the Administrator, they discuss the principle of whether it is necessary to have an investigation, and after that has been settled you get to the mechanics of the thing. Now, this committee having been appointed, they go to the head of the Department and tell him what they want to do and ask him to get everything ready for their visit to the school.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has trodden first on one side of the fence and then the other, and at the moment he is just sitting on the fence, and I want him to come down on one side or the other. At the time of the inquiry, if the Administrator says no, he is not willing that a Committee should investigate anything in his schools, from the way the hon. member started off it appeared that he was saying that that decision was final, but now he has rather changed it and has indicated that the inquiry can still be held, even though the Administrator does not agree.</p>

<p>With the greatest respect, my amendment says that approval must be obtained from the Administrator because it is with the Administrator that the Minister consulted. If the Administrator says no, the Minister must then go on with his inquiry against the wish of the Administrator, and he has to get the consent of the Administrator to enter a school.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Now the Minister has come down on one side of the fence quite clearly. He has said that if the Administrator refuses he can go on without his approval, and that is precisely why my amendment is framed in the language it is. What has the Minister admitted now? Having failed to get the consent of the master, he is going to use 2 (b) to compel the servant to open the gate. The master has said in 2 (a) that he cannot enter, but the Minister says that in 2 (b) he will clothe the servant with authority to open the gate, even when the master has said no. My intention in my amendment is that the Administrator shall open the doors of the schools in his own province, and the time to do it is when negotiations take place under 2 (a). But it is now quite clear to me that it was intended to have the position that the Minister now admits to, and it is not by chance that 2 (b) is framed in the way it is. It is done deliberately. The Minister says that this is a matter of the Administrator delegating his power to an official, but there is no such power. No Administrator can give the Director-General of Education the right to open the door of any school to an investigation without the knowledge of the Executive Committee and himself. But the Minister seeks to clothe the official here with a legal power which is not derived from the Administrator by delegation. It is not a delegated power at all. It is an original power conferred by Act of Parliament on the official that the Minister is seeking to clothe the official with, when the master, the Administrator, has himself refused consent. That is why I said to the Minister that we should not talk about co-operation. It is not sufficient to talk about it. Co-operation must be seen to be done. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment and leave the Administrators and the executive committees the masters in their own house and do not let us through Parliament confer powers on officials to override the Administrator, because that is what the Minister is trying to do here. I ask the Minister to meet us in this matter, and let him show his willingness to cooperate by accepting my amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I am really astonished to hear such remarks from the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell).</p>

<p>I have been so co-operative that I have already accepted one amendment. I have great respect for the hon. member, and he himself having been an Administrator knows exactly the mechanics of the provincial system, and it does not give me any pleasure to tell him some things which he ought to know. The hon. member knows very well that under sub-clause <span class="col_8429-8430" refersTo="page_1461"/>(2) (a) the Minister may after consultation appoint a committee to carry out an investigation. &#x201C;After consultation&#x201D; means this: Say, for instance, that an Administrator refuses to accede to a very fair request made by the Minister of Education; then the Minister may go forward. But then under sub-clause (2) (b) &#x201C;Such a committee may obtain access to such a school with the consent of a person authorized to give such consent &#x2026;&#x201D; The hon. member now wants to press for this amendment. He knows very well that if an Administrator has very definite views and definite reasons for refusing, after consultation, to accede to the request of the Minister, the Administrator can direct the Director of Education not to give that authority for admission. The Administrator can give any direction to his Director of Education. If the Secretary for Education has the right to admit people to a certain school and I do not like it as Minister I can direct him not to allow it and he must obey. The hon. member knows that very well. Why place this additional burden on the Administrator when it is only a question of carrying out the mechanics of the whole thing after it has been decided that the principle is a good one and that these committees should be allowed to investigate.</p>

I think you might require four members of the council and perhaps one or two other persons to go to a training college. What is a &#x201C;school&#x201D;?

<p>Sir, I tried very hard with this pupil on the other side but I have had very little success with him. He should have been an inspector in the Transvaal&#x2014;then he would have known something&#x2014;instead of being an inspector in the Cape. No wonder the Cape system is in the state in which it is and has to have this council! Sir, the next point is this: We do not need these rigid <i>ad hoc</i> committees. You can have any kind of committee for the investigation. I had in mind an investigation into the training of teachers, in which I agree with the hon. the Minister that there should be, not an investigation but a policy formulated in consultation with all the provinces. I think that is the one thing that is necessary. Now I come to sub-clause (2) (b). I agree entirely with what the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) said. Unfortunately he was not here during the debate on Friday, but the hon. the Minister will remember that in that debate I said that the authority of the Director is derived from the Administrator. In the law the Director derives his authority from the Administrator, and I am glad this afternoon that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education is here because I want to refer to him. The authority of his officials is derived from the hon. the Minister, and I want to come to him now. Sub-clause (2) (b) says here that if the authority is to be given in the case of any other school, not a provincial school, it is to be given by the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science. What does the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education think of that? What does the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs think of that? They are not going to derive their authority from the Minister through the Secretary for Education; they are going to derive it from the Minister of Bantu Education. For the first time since I have been in this House I find myself a supporter of the authority of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education. He will be the authority in that case. Sir, I would suggest this: The hon. the Minister said at the end of the second reading debate that he would award marks to us for what we had said and contributed in the second reading debate. In the case of sub-clause (1) I think we can let it pass. In the case of sub-clause (3) we might let it pass, but in the case of sub-clause (2) he should go back and do his homework again. It is a badly, clumsily drafted clause and we should have it done again.</p>

<p>I first of all wish to revert to the investigation by a committee in schools. I said that as far as I could remember, the majority of the bodies that testified before us felt that the committee should not have direct access to the schools, and I quoted from the evidence given by Professor Burger on behalf of the Akademie. I do not know what the Akademie telegraphed subsequently and I accept of course that the telegram the Minister has read is correct. But then you must also admit that Professor Burger said something he ought not to have said, for he came here as the representative of the Akademie, and under cross-examination he said what I have quoted here. But I went further. We examined 16 witnesses in all in regard to this matter: Should the council or its committee have the power to investigate matters in schools? Two said &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; and 14 said &#x201C;No&#x201D;. In other words, only two of the 16 felt that the council should be able to enter the schools. The others said it should not be permitted, that the ordinary provincial administrative machinery could be used for that purpose; and this side insists upon that, not in order to frustrate the Minister and his council, but once again to prevent any unpleasantness from arising.</p>

<p>As regards the Administrators, personally I am glad the Minister has now made that admission, for I cannot imagine that an Administrator could refuse a request under (a), and that the Minister could then go to the Director of Education or to the Superintendent of Education and get the requisite approval from him. He simply could not give it, he would get into trouble. So I wonder whether the hon. the Minister cannot draft this clause of his more clearly, so that his intention may appear clearly, in the way he put it to us. I accept that that is his object, but an intention as expressed in a speech does not count in law; what counts is what is said in the Act itself. That is why we move this amendment.</p>

<p>I do not think that the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) should be allowed to get away with the impression that the private schools welcome this particular clause of the Bill. The private schools are quite prepared to receive educationists and to show them the great work that is being done in their institutions, but they are certainly not prepared to allow an investigating committee to come within their walls with the purpose of changing the system that they have built up with so much trouble and so much diligence during the years of their existence.</p>

<p>I also cannot see how the hon. member for Witbank can say that private schools do not fall under this clause at all. I say that any private school which receives financial assistance from the Central Government does fall within the ambit of this Bill. After all, Clause 5 (2) (b) refers to &#x201C;any other school&#x201D; in line 26, and &#x201C;school&#x201D; is defined in Clause 1 as including any school which receives financial assistance out of public funds; in other words, private schools do fall under this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank also quoted Professor Burger and his point of view, But what Professor Burger stated is clearly laid down in the evidence given before the Select Committee. This is the evidence that he submitted on behalf of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie. Let the hon. member for Witbank listen to these words again; Professor Burger said (page 108)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the opinion of the Akademie that the Advisory Council should not undertake investigations at schools. Such investigation should be undertaken by the department of education which is concerned in the matter.</block>

<p>In other words, it should be done by the provincial departments of education through their inspectors.</p>

<p>Sir, I come now to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister has objected to my suspicions of this Bill, which he seems to regard as rather unworthy. It is not I who think that this particular clause might mean an inquisition in schools; I did not use the word &#x201C;inquisition&#x201D;. The word &#x201C;inquisitor&#x201D; was used by the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Organizations of the whole of the country, representing all teachers, Afrikaans- and English-speaking. Let me read to you the evidence of this Federal Council before the Select Committee. This is what Mr. H. C. Botha said; these are the words of the Federal Council (page 5)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federal Council views the Education Advisory Council as an advisory body which should be placed on the highest plane possible and it should at all times inspire confidence through its scientific and professional approach. This should not be jeopardized by allocating functions to the council, which places its members in the position of inquisitors.</block>

<p>There the word &#x201C;inquisitors&#x201D; is used. I did not use it; the Federal Council representing all the teachers used it. Then the Federal Council goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federal Council considers that this is precisely what might happen if the provisions of &#x2026; (this clause) &#x2026; were carried out.</block>

<p>If all the teachers&#x2019; organizations of this country have a suspicion that there might be something very much wrong in this Bill, surely I am permitted to voice those suspicions too! After <span class="col_8433-8434" refersTo="page_1463"/>all, it was easy for the hon. the Minister to have mentioned the type of investigation that he had in mind. The hon. the Minister mentioned investigations into schools for the blind and schools for the deaf. If he can mention those two instances, surely he can mention the type of investigation that he envisages into the ordinary schools of the four provinces. If he cannot do that, why introduce this clause if he does not know what it is for? The hon. the Minister accused me of sniffing along the ground seeking for something unsavoury. Let me tell the hon. the Minister that I do indeed smell something wrong, and that should anything be done under this particular clause to harm the schools that I have mentioned, then I shall be able to cry with Mark Antony&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</block>

<block name="quote">With carrion men, groaning for burial.</block>

<p>When I spoke earlier this evening I said that all the teachers&#x2019; organizations disapprove of this particular provision, the Afrikaans-speaking as well as the English-speaking organizations. Let me turn to the evidence by the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association by Dr. J. E. Davis, in which he said (page 218)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The T.T.A. envisage the council as a purely advisory and/or consultative body&#x2026; There was never any thought of the council or its sub-committee carrying out detailed investigations into the working of individual schools, not only under the Department of Education, Arts and Science but also those under the provincial education departments.</block>

<p>Can the views of the Transvaal teachers be expressed more clearly than that? Here are the views of the S.A.O.U. (Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie). Mr. A. W. Retief said this in regard to the appointment of committees of inquiry&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the result of such a provision, this council will probably be established under a cloud of suspicion and in the midst of excessive agitation.</block>

<p>Why cause that suspicion, why engender that suspicion? Why not rather listen to the recommendations of the S.A.O.U.? The S.A.O.U. says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The S.A.O.U. recommends that investigation in connection with matters concerning the basic principles of education be entrusted to existing departmental machinery by the Minister concerned and that the findings be reported to the council.</block>

<p>Let me take the S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Association, an organization representing all the English-speaking teachers in the Cape Province. In their memorandum, submitted by Mr. Wahl, this organization says (page 27)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the opinion of the association these subsections should be deleted. The inspectors of schools, who are members of the Public Service of the Republic, are available to carry out any investigation which may be needed.</block>

<p>There, Sir, is your answer; the inspectors of schools are there to carry out these investigations. The S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Association goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In their present form these sub-sections would relegate the provincial departments of education to a position of inferiority.</block>

<p>Why relegate our provincial department of education to a position of inferiority through the provisions of this particular clause? The S.A.T.A. continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Directors of Education, and it might well be said the Administrators also, would be subordinate to the authority of the subcommittees of the council.</block>

<p>In other words, the powers and the dignity of the provincial education departments are being ignored by a provision such as this. So, Sir, I could continue to quote from the S.A. Akademie, from the Federale Raad van Onderwysersvereniging, from the Cape School Board, and I could quote to you, Sir, from the evidence submitted by bodies of parents, the National Council of Women and other bodies, in which they all deplore this particular provision. There is no provision in this Bill which is so unanimously condemned as this particular one. I ask the hon. the Minister why is he going ahead with this provision? Is it a case of the Potchefstroom tail trying to wag the South African dog?</p>

<p>On Clause 6,</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;shall&#x201D; in line 32, up to and including &#x201C;Finance&#x201D; in line 33; and in line 36, to omit &#x201C;so&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In other words, what I am proposing is that the members of the council, not the members of the executive committee, shall not receive salaries. It is a custom with us that members who meet only now and then and who do not have regular meetings, such, e.g., as the Citizen Graves Commission or the Historical Monuments Commission, do not receive salaries. They receive only an allowance to cover their transport and subsistence. I think it would create a wrong precedent if we were to pay a salary to these members now. You may find one of these days that the members of the Historical Monuments Commission and members of other similar bodies will also come along and ask that they should also receive salaries. Nor do I think the members expect it when they meet once or twice a year. They do not expect a fixed salary. They only want their travelling and subsistence expenses covered.*</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>If it is as the hon. member said, then I am in full agreement with him, but that is not the intention. The difficulty is this: We are now going to get a number of teachers, possibly officials and others, to serve on this body. As the hon. member knows, the ordinary allowances of the Public Service are fixed in various categories. Now you find a person who is on a certain salary scale. A head of a Department, for instance, receives much more than a ordinary official. I do not have all the scales here, but there are three categories, and now it may happen that there may, e.g., be a professor with a certain salary, or a principal of a Grade A school, with a certain salary. He then receives &#x00A3;2 10s. allowance as a member&#x2014;I think that is more or less what they receive. But now you find a member who is an ordinary assistant, but who may also be a member of the council, and the allowance of that member will be &#x00A3;1 15s. The only object here is that when the people are members of the same council they should nevertheless receive the same allowances, apart from the fact that they may receive public service allowances in various categories. It would be <i>infra dig</i> for one member of the council to receive less than another member serving on the same council. The object is merely that this should be fixed in consultation with the Minister of Finance. If the Minister of Finance refuses, the Minister of Education can do nothing. But the intention is only to see to it that there will be a reasonable allowance for them. The travelling expenses are obvious, but the subsistence allowance should be an equal allowance for them all. If I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, it means that we are going to pay these public servants according to three different scales, a high scale, a medium scale, and for an unmarried person much less. That would be wrong. I think if the hon. member understands that explanation, he will not press his amendment. Then I move my own amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 31, to omit &#x201C;referred to in section three&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;of the executive committee&#x201D;.</block>

<p>We have no objection to the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, nor to his explanation. That explanation satisfies me, for I personally know&#x2014;I am sorry I have to mention myself&#x2014;that in the years when I was serving on the Historical Monuments Commission I, for instance, received R6 per day, and then you find people in the Public Service who do not receive half of that. If it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention to make the allowances equal, then I support him fully, and I wish to express the hope that the Minister charged with the Historical Monuments Commission also will see to it that the same thing applies there, the same principle. I think it is unfair that there should be such a differentiation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I have an amendment standing in my name on page 903 of the Order Paper. It is contingent on the clause as it now stands being negatived. I believe that we have reached a stage in this Bill when the hon. the Minister should relent again and should be prepared to drop the clause as printed and to agree to the substitution thereof by the amendment which stands in my name. I am encouraged to believe that that will happen because after we had dealt with three clauses, the hon. the Minister relented and accepted an amendment to Clause 4.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, I am dealing with the clause and I am indicating that my amendment, which I have not moved yet, is a contingent one. Sir, the objections from this side of the House to the unnecessarily wide and in fact vague functions with which this council is being entrusted in terms of Clause 7, have been fully canvassed during the second reading debate of this Bill, and there is little need therefore to repeat the arguments that were advanced. I will therefore limit myself to criticizing the clause as it stands in relation to what I suggest the hon. the Minister should adopt in substitution therefor.</p>

<p>Business suspended at 6.30 p.m. and resumed at 8.5 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When business was interrupted by the dinner adjournment, I was addressing the Committee on Clause 7 of this Bill and was advancing a second good reason why the Minister should drop the clause as printed in favour of the one I have placed on the Order Paper. I repeat that the objections from this side of the House to the unnecessarily wide and very vague terms in which the function of the Council are set out in the present clause, have been fully canvassed during the debate on the second reading of the Bill and it is not necessary, therefore, to retrace all the arguments advanced on that occasion. In contrast to that very wide and vague definition of the function of the Council, I commend to the Minister the amendment which stands in my name because that amendment simplifies and clarifies the functions of the Council. If my amendment is adopted by the Minister, not only will the fears which exist in the minds of so many people associated with schools be removed, but it will also bring that degree of confidence in the Council which I believe the Minister would like to see it have.</p>

<p>Discerning witnesses gave evidence before the Select Committee. I do not propose to quote from their views again. On the whole, they were educationists of standing who were well versed in the language of education and also well up in the jargon of education. A number of them expressed concern about the wording of Clause 7 and about some of the terms used therein. There are, for instance, the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;the policy to be applied in connection with education</block>

<p>Many witnesses expressed concern about what was meant by these words. They saw &#x201C;policy&#x201D; as meaning many things but usually as a preconceived plan as to the direction in which things should develop. Furthermore, they were concerned also about the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;the broad fundamental principles of sound education&#x201D;.</block>

<p>These witnesses are men who are eminent in their own particular sphere. They found these two phrases I have quoted so vague as to be almost meaningless to them. As against this, the amendment standing in my name will bring simplicity and clarity to the clause. Every word has a clear and distinct meaning&#x2014;there need be no confusion or doubt as to what they mean. So long as Clause 7 remains as it is printed here, however, so long will there be this clouding of meaning and so long will there be doubt as to what is implied. To prove this. I have not given my owns views but have quoted those of experts.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you have indicated that it is my right to vote against the clause as it is printed and naturally I will do so. I prefer, however, to urge the Minister to drop the clause and to accept the one I have proposed. There is another small piece of evidence to show that this Bill has not been drawn up as carefully as it might have been. In line 39 the word &#x201C;advice&#x201D; is used instead of &#x201C;advise I assume it is not necessary to move an amendment to rectify that. It is, however, clearly not English. I draw attention to it because it does indicate that the Bill is not worded satisfactorily. This adds strength to my argument that the clause as printed should be dropped in its entirety in favour of the one I have on the Order Paper.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name in respect of Clause 7, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 40 and in lines 42 and 43, respectively, to omit &#x201C;through the Minister&#x201D;.</block>

<p>By this amendment I wish to convey the feelings of many organizations throughout the country, namely that throughout this entire Bill the intentions of the Minister are to take unto himself powers and authority which are unnecessarily wide and all-embracing. Reference has already been made to the right the Minister has to appoint the members of the Council, despite the fact that the bulk of the evidence given before the Select Committee was in favour of these members being appointed by interested organizations. In this clause, we have evidence of another such tendency on the part of the Minister, in that all representations any organization or person might wish to make to the Council must, in the first instance, be submitted to the Minister for transmission to the Council. After the Council has considered such representations or advice, it is obliged to convey its recommendations to the Minister in the first place. Only in that way, then, will interested bodies and organizations have the opportunity of submitting their views to the Council.</p>

<p>By stipulating this procedure, the Minister is drawing suspicion to the actual motives of the Council. He himself is being placed in an invidious position of requiring that representations and recommendations should be submitted to him in the first instance. I wish <span class="col_8443-8444" refersTo="page_1468"/>to point out that it is generally felt that this procedure is going to destroy all confidence in the Council. There is also the suspicion that the Minister might water down certain recommendations. I do not say he will do anything like that. Here, however, this procedure is being put on black and white, and you cannot blame people for being suspicious about it.</p>

<p>One of the most important objections to this clause is that it infringed the right of the provinces to determine their own policies. But here we have another infringement of those rights in that the Administrator of a province will not even be allowed to put his views to the Council directly, but has to do so through the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. I made an exhaustive investigation with a view to finding out whether this particular procedure was incorporated in any other Statute. I could not find a single instance however. Can the Minister perhaps refer to an enactment wherein a similar procedure has been incorporated? If there was justification for doing so in other enactments, then surely it was in those enactments passed earlier this Session, namely the Bill relating to the C.S.I.R. and the Bill relating to the Bureau of Standards. If the procedure which is being adopted in the Bill now being discussed is regarded as a healthy one, and favourably regarded by our legal draftsmen, then that procedure could with profit have been incorporated in the two measures I have referred to.</p>

<p>It is for the foregoing reasons that the Minister in his own interests as well as in the interest and the prestige of the Education Council, should not enforce the procedure prescribed in Clause 7 of this Bill. If he does not see fit to accept my amendment in its entirety, I should like to commend to him a procedure whereby all representations by interested bodies can be submitted to the Council direct. The recommendations by the Council on such representations can then be submitted to the Minister for his information. If he can accept this compromise, this clause might be more favourably considered by the public. I submit this to the Minister for his serious consideration.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I have two amendments to Clause 7 on the Order Paper, and of these I should like to move the second one, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;education&#x201D; 

where it occurs for the first time in line 52, up to and including &#x201C;country&#x201D; in line 54.</block>

<p>I do not move the first one, because its acceptance or rejection depends upon the acceptance or rejection of the second amendment. The functions of the council will, if my amendment is accepted, <i>inter alia</i> be to consider the broad fundamental principles of sound education for the country as a whole, but with due regard to the advisability of maintaining such diversity as circumstances may demand. Among the words which I have proposed should be deleted, there appear two verbs which would have been described by the Minister, when he was a school teacher, as verbs of action. And that is what they in fact are. If you have the power to co-ordinate and the power to adapt you must also have the ancillary power to put such co-ordination and adaptation into effect.</p>

<p>The Minister and hon. members on the other side have failed so far to give an explanation of what &#x201C;to co-ordinate&#x201D; means in the context of this Bill. What is it that is going to be co-ordinated? What is it that has to be adapted? How are they going to adapt the education system as stated in the clause? As I said, if they have these powers, they can do something with them. The case the Minister puts up is that this council will have purely advisory functions. If that is so, then I fail to see why the Minister should have any objection to accepting my amendment and to deleting the relevant words.</p>

<p>The clause suggests that there is some need for co-ordination so far as policy is concerned. It further suggests that a system has to be adapted to another system. Now, let us make no mistake about it that there are only two points of conflict in so far as policy, as well as system, is concerned, namely Natal as against the rest of the Republic. The reason for that is that in Natal there is United Party provincial control over education, whereas in <span class="col_8445-8446" refersTo="page_1469"/>the rest of the country the Nationalists are in charge of education. &#x201C;To co-ordinate policies&#x201D; can, therefore, only mean one thing, and that is that the policy which is being followed in Natal will have to be co-ordinated with that followed in the rest of the Republic. And what is the system which has to be adapted? Can anyone, in his most fanciful moments, suggest that the Natal system, i.e. the South African system, will be adapted for the rest of the Republic? Obviously not. On the contrary. The intention is to adapt the narrow Nationalist Christian national education system to Natal and not <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;as&#x201D; in line 60 to the end of sub-section (4) and to substitute &#x201C;an advisory body and none of its decisions shall have any force or effect unless it is agreed to by not less than two-thirds of the total number of its members&#x201D;,</block>

<p>This amendment means that the word &#x201C;coordinating&#x201D; will be deleted and that the provision regarding a two-thirds majority will now apply. The hon. member for Durban (North) has referred to the use to which the word &#x201C;co-ordinating&#x201D; may be put. I should like to deal with its meaning as given by the Oxford English Dictionary. That might help us to get a clearer conception of what is intended. When used transitively &#x201C;to coordinate&#x201D; means&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To make co-ordinate; to place in the same order, rank, or division; to place (things) in proper position relatively to each other and to the system of which they form parts; to act in combined order for the production of a particular result.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Co-ordination&#x201D; is defined as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The action of co-ordinating; the condition of being co-ordinated or co-ordinate.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Advisory&#x201D; is defined as &#x201C;having the attribute of advising&#x201D;. It would seem, therefore, that in this clause there is a contradiction in terms, because whereas the Council shall have no executive power or functions, it will at the same time act as an advisory and co-ordinating body.</p>

<p>In regard to that part of the amendment dealing with a two-thirds majority, I should like to say that the Minister was very eloquent <span class="col_8447-8448" refersTo="page_1470"/>in describing the high esteem in which he would regard this Council. He went so far <i>as</i> to stake his reputation on that. Therefore, I think, a decision of this advisory body should not be subject to the whim of one of its members. Here I should like, in passing, to refer to Clause 10 where the way in which business of the Council should be conducted is prescribed. In terms of that clause the Minister may make regulations in regard to the calling and conduct of meetings, the quorum for and procedure at such meetings, etc. It may very well be that these regulations could lay down that the chairman of the council may have a deliberative as well as a casting vote. Under such circumstances, it can easily happen, in order to reach a decision on a matter in regard to which there is a difference of opinion, that the chairman after already having used his deliberative vote will have to make use of his casting vote. A decision reached in that way will then be forwarded to the Minister as being the decision of the Council.</p>

<p>Yes, but I am referring only to cases where there is a majority of one. In view of the high status this Council is to enjoy, and in view of the integrity of the men and women who will be appointed to it, I think it would be as well to consider some of the evidence which was tendered by individual educationists. There were three witnesses who gave evidence in their individual capacities, namely Dr. du Toit, Prof. Malherbe and Dr. Prinsloo. It is interesting to note that these educationists do not always agree on matters affecting education. Even on the question whether the council should be an advisory council, there was a difference of opinion. One of them did not express an opinion, one was in favour of it and one was against it. Also on the question of the appointment of educationists to this body, there was a difference of opinion. Two were in favour of such appointments and one against. On the question of their appointment by the Minister, one of these witnesses did not comment, one suggested that the State President should appoint them, whilst the third was against their being appointed by the Minister. There was also a marked difference between these witnesses regarding the number of members on the council. One said that plus 12 would be a suitable number, another felt that seven was the ideal number, whilst the third favoured 18. One of these witnesses said that things would be all right until you threw a planner into the works. I suggest that all these experts who will be appointed to the council will be planners in their various ways. But they will be called upon to come to some decision and it will be to the interest of education if such decision represents the views of two-thirds of the members. This is <i>a</i> procedure which is being followed by international organizations as well as by associations and organizations right throughout the world&#x2014;even sporting bodies use such a system. In the circumstances, I would suggest that the hon. the Minister would do well to make that procedure also applicable to this council.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken, dealt with the meaning of the word &#x201C;co-ordination&#x201D;.

According to this subsection, this council shall serve exclusively &#x201C;as a co-ordinating and advisory body&#x201D;. &#x201C;Coordinating&#x201D; is not defined, whereas &#x201C;advisory&#x201D;, I take it, assumes its ordinary meaning. If &#x201C;co-ordinating&#x201D;, however, means &#x201C;advisory&#x201D; then it is tautology and there is no need for that here. The hon. member behind the Minister has shown remarkable insight and absolute brilliance when he realized that &#x201C;co-ordinating&#x201D; here does not mean &#x201C;advisory&#x201D;.

<p>What point is the hon. member trying to make?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The point I am trying to make is that all the members on the other side of the House who have spoken so far have aligned themselves behind the concept of an advisory body. It is quite clear now, not only from this sub-section (4), but from the other sub-sections, that this is not an advisory body. I deal with the next sub-section, (5). It says that the council may effect coordination between all official bodies, etc. There is a statutory power to do something to effect co-ordination, whatever &#x201C;co-ordination&#x201D; means. The Minister has given us no guidance in this matter. But whatever it means, if it has the ordinary meaning referred to by the hon. member for Berea, the dictionary meaning, it means that a system can be forced on the people concerned, and that is given further effect to in sub-section (2), where in consultation with other bodies the council shall generally co-ordinate education policy, and it goes on to say that it will also have power to adapt the education system. This is very interesting, because it is in the singular. It is to adapt the education system. So the law already sees one system of education in South Africa. It is to adapt the education system, retaining such diversity as may be demanded. I am an ordinary farmer and not a lawyer, but I say that that language is arrant nonsense. This is an entirely arbitrary and personal opinion which the council is now at liberty to express if it so desires. It means nothing else. To talk about the council co-ordinating education and <span class="col_8449-8450" refersTo="page_1471"/>adapting the educational system, while retaining such diversity as circumstances may demand&#x2014;now what does that mean? Who demands the diversity of circumstances? What circumstances can demand diversity? The thing, I say, is simply personal and arbitrary to the majority of the members of the council. There is nothing whatever to guide them. They can express their own thoughts and preconceived ideas. They can be entirely arbitrary in any decision they come to and there is nothing which can be put in their way as a barrier to their wildest flights of imagination, and they are given the specific power to co-ordinate in (5), and we take the strongest exception to that. If the Minister sticks to his object of making this body an advisory council, whoever it may be able to advise, the fact is that this clause is the one which contains the whole concept of an advisory body. It makes it a body with plenary powers, established by statute, to do something which is called coordination, and it may go to the length of insisting upon a single education system, and that is why the singular form is used in subsection (2). I want to appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment, which pinpoints the whole issue. It is quite clear that some of the sub-clausies will then be in difficulty as far as their drafting is concerned, but I ask the Minister to accept my amendment and to show that this body is to be an advisory body. They may advise whomever they will and their advice may be in the direction of co-ordination, but this clause gives them plenary power to coordinate, whether the body concerned likes it or not. The moment the clause is passed in this form, they are no longer an advisory body. I ask the Minister to stand by his previous utterances and to accept my amendment, which I now move.</p>

<p>I wish to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 56, to omit &#x201C;also endeavour to uphold and promote&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;advise in regard to methods of upholding and promoting&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The reason for this amendment is that the word &#x201C;endeavour&#x201D;, as do other words in this clause which have been referred to by hon. members on this side, connotes the taking of some positive step. That, I submit, is perfectly clear, because a council of any sort cannot endeavour to uphold and promote anything unless it is able to take some steps which will enable it to uphold or promote whatever it is that it is required to do. So I suggest that the word &#x201C;endeavour&#x201D; is quite inappropriate in regard to a council which, as we have been told repeatedly, is intended to be purely an advisory council: On the other hand, it does seem to me that there is a lot to be said in favour of the view that an advisory council should have the power to investigate and advise as to methods of promoting and upholding the prestige of the teaching profession and the persons engaged therein. That is why I do not wish to delete the subsection completely, but I wish to move the amendment which I have suggested. [Interjections.] The hon. member asks what I am endeavouring to do. I thought I had made that quite clear. While I am on my feet, I would like to deal with certain other aspects of Clause 7. The first thing I would like to do is to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). The effect of that amendment is to stipulate that the functions of the council shall be (a) to carry out research into education, and (b) to advise the Government and Provincial Administrations on matters relating to education generally.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry That being the case, I will deal with the two amendments that have been moved, particularly the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). In regard to both these amendments, the proposition which I placed before the Committee in regard to my own amendment applies equally, because the power to adapt an education system to the needs of the country and the power to co-ordinate&#x2014;both these powers require positive action to be taken, positive steps of some sort, and they are quite out of keeping with a body whose functions are advisory. If in fact this body is intended to be a purely advisory body, as has been stressed by the Minister, then in my submission those amendments should be accepted by the Minister. If in fact this body is intended to be a purely advisory body, I find it very difficult to understand why it should be necessary in Clause 7 to go to such lengths and to use so many words to say very little. I submit that a body whose functions are intended to be purely advisory has simply the function of investigating educational matters with a view to giving advice to certain persons. Surely that can be said quite simply and clearly in a few lines, without going into five sub-clauses and using a lot of words to say it. Therefore I move the amendment which I mentioned earlier and I urge the Minister to give consideration not only to that amendment but to the amendments moved by other hon. members on this side of the House.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Before replying to the individual amendments to Clause 7. I should like to say at the outset that this amazing number of amendments to Clause 7 have flabbergasted me completely. In the Report of the Select Committee I find only one single division on Clause 7. The matter was voted <span class="col_8451-8452" refersTo="page_1472"/>upon, and had it not been passed, it was proposed by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) that if the clause were negatived, he would try to move another clause in its stead. But it is surprising to see that members of the Opposition in the Select Committee did not move that amendment before the Select Committee. It is quite clear to me that since the Select Committee deliberated, hon. members have searched left and right for amendments to show the world that they really still possess some power. I wish to say the whole of this Clause 7, which is the power of this whole council, and which defines its duties&#x2014;that each of these amendments seeks to evade the object of this clause. I am very sorry about that. If I have to deal with the various amendments, I must say that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) has no hope of a negative answer being given here, and I should like to assure him at once that if that were to happen, I would certainly not accept the clause he proposes to substitute for it, because it does not cover the functions of this council.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) proposes that the words &#x201C;and generally to co-ordinate education policy with a view to adapting the education system to the needs of the country&#x201D; be deleted. My first argument against that amendment is that it is contrary to the provisions of Clause 7(4), which provides that the Council shall serve exclusively as a co-ordinating and advisory body. The main function&#x2014;and that is the main point in Clause 7&#x2014;of this Council is therefore to co-ordinate and to advise. The hon. member now proposes to divest the Council of one of its two main functions. The co-ordinating function of this Council is most essential. If this new body we are creating has to achieve anything, it is the objects envisaged in the Bill to promote, in consultation with the Department of Education, Arts and Science, the Provincial Education Departments and all the other bodies and organizations, the broad fundamental principles of sound education as a whole, as stated in the first part of sub-section (21. Take away any of these two mainstays of the Bill, the co-ordinating function, and the whole structure must collapse. I am not so much concerned about the meaning of &#x201C;coordinating&#x201D; in the ordinary sense of the word. The hon. member for Durban (North) seeks more in regard to the meaning of that word and wants to imply a lot of things, that the Minister will do a lot of snooping, with harmful effects on education, etc. Therefore I am unable to accept the amendment, which strikes at the roots of the underlying principles of this Bill. I think the hon. member and I had better agree to differ on this point.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) proposes to delete the co-ordinating function of the Council and to subject its advisory resolutions to at least a two-thirds majority. This would, without any doubt, render the Council impotent. Why? I will tell you why. I could not possibly be expected to be a party to such a catastrophe. In any case, Clause 10 makes it possible to issue regulations to govern matters of this kind, and that is the place where we should insert it. By asking for a two-thirds majority, I do not know what the hon. member is really aiming at. He has not advanced any reasons for it. It is only the old idea of a two-thirds majority, but a majority of one is what counts in a democratic county. I am sure you will get 100 per cent agreement on most of these matters. There is no logic in a two-thirds majority. A democratic majority has always been one.</p>

<p>*The two other amendments moved by the hon. members for South Coast and Musgrave are exactly similar to that of the hon. member for Berea. They seek to remove the function of co-ordination and to delete the whole subclause. I honestly do not think that the hon. member for South Coast knows precisely what he is doing by moving the deletion of (5). There are various bodies that investigate and co-ordinate. The Departments of Education of the Provinces do it, and my own Department has a department of research that does it. All that is provided here is that the Council may&#x2014;not &#x201C;shall&#x201D;&#x2014;bring about co-ordination between all official bodies doing research work in connection with education, and that it may avail itself of the services of such bodies. That is all that these words mean. I do not want this Education Council to establish its own research body again. It should make use of existing research bodies in the provinces and in the Central Government. But the hon. member wants to delete that. I insisted very strongly on this provision because to me it is an important point; we do not want to waste Government funds by establishing a new research body again. [Interjections.] The hon. member has moved that the whole of sub-clause (5) be deleted. I say that if you delete it you will be very sorry. Fortunately the hon. member for Musgrave has realized his mistake and has withdrawn his printed amendment, for it would have been recorded in the annals of this House that while the Opposition pleaded in the second reading that we should raise the status of the teaching profession and do something for them, the hon. member came along and proposed that this clause be deleted. Fortunately he has now used his brains a little and said that we should delete certain words only. [Interjection.] It was a typical case of face saving to a certain extent. He does not say that he withdraws the whole amendment. The clause now reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Council shall also endeavour to uphold and promote the prestige, etc.</block>

<p>Now the hon. member wishes to amend it to read: &#x201C;The Council shall advise in regard to methods in upholding, etc.&#x201D; That has exactly the same meaning and there is no substance to it. It is typical of the lawyer who puts the same thing in two different ways, and <span class="col_8453-8454" refersTo="page_1473"/>this attempt at face-saving will simply not succeed. The hon. member actually agrees in principle with me that the Council should endeavour to uphold and promote the prestige of the teaching profession; he does not disagree with me at all, but he merely wishes to move an amendment. Accordingly I cannot accept it and I cannot accept any of the other amendments either.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like the Minister to reply to an amendment which may perhaps improve this clause. I concede that certain words have been inserted in this new clause which are an improvement on the original Bill submitted to the Select Committee. I refer to the inclusion of the words &#x201C;with due regard to the advisability of maintaining such diversity as circumstances may demand&#x201D; and also to the inclusion of the sub-clause which states that the Council shall have no executive power or function but shall be only an advisory body. But I am afraid the original objections to and suspicions regarding this clause, taken in conjunction with Clause 5, still remain. Although certain words have been inserted in the clause, to a large extent the effect which such insertion might have had has been offset by the contradiction which is contained in Clause 5, which has already been passed by the Committee despite the amendments moved to it, and which allows the Council to have access to any school. It is difficult to conceive how a body which is allowed access can in fact be only an advisory body. It is clear that it will have functions which will go beyond advice, and in spite of the inclusion of the words in the clause that the Council shall have no executive power, it is nevertheless intended to translate into some practical measure what the Council finds on its investigation and the advice it gives to the Minister. Therefore I want to try if possible to get some limiting words on the functions of the Council and I have drafted an amendment which I hope the Minister will consider, because I believe it will do something to set at rest the suspicions and fears which have been voiced for the last two or three years by the entire English-speaking section in South Africa. This is the fear that a system of education will be imposed on them which to a large extent differs from the system they have been following, which can change the philosophy which obtains in English-language schools and the different outlook generally on education. Therefore I want to try to limit the functions of this Council by the following amendment to sub-section (1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 38 and 39, to omit &#x201C;in regard to the policy to be applied in connection with&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;on educational matters designed to raise the general standards of&#x201D;; in line 41, to omit &#x201C;any&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;such&#x201D;; and in the same line to omit &#x201C;affecting education&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The clause will then read that the Council is established to advise the Minister generally on educational matters designed to raise the general standards of education. The clause then continues as it stands, except that in line 41 the word &#x201C;any&#x201D; is substituted by the word &#x201C;such&#x201D;, and it now reads &#x201C;shall advise the Minister or any other Minister or any Administrator through the Minister in regard to such matters&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, referring to the matter of raising the general standard of education, and then the words &#x201C;affecting education&#x201D; come out as well. In other words, I am trying to limit the functions of the Council to general matters that will raise the standards of education. [Interjections.] I do not want a uniform education policy. That is what I am trying to avoid. I do not want a uniform policy &#x201C;with due regard to diversity&#x201D; imposed on the whole of South Africa. That is what I am trying to avoid, but I have every belief, as I stated in the second reading, that there are certain matters in our education system which certainly require investigation, and that a good deal is wrong with it. The standards are low and the curricula may be overloaded in certain cases, and we have a far too high percentage of first-year failures at the universities. But this does not relate to the policy of education. That is something quite different. I want a Council to go into the reasons for university failures and to find out why there is a shortage of teachers, and why the English-speaking section has not contributed its share of teachers. [Interjections.] There may be many reasons for it. There may be insufficient training colleges and the general conditions of employment may be unattractive, or that they are frightened that promotion will not come their way. All these may be reasons which prevent the English-speaking section from entering the profession and we need an investigation into it. We need an investigation into all the obvious shortcomings in our education system in South Africa.</p>

<block name="quote">The Council shall endeavour to determine in consultation with the Department of Education, Arts and Science, the provincial education departments, education bodies and organizations and persons who are concerned with education matters, the broad fundamental principles of sound education for the country as a whole, to promote co-operation generally in the field of education, and generally to co-ordinate education policy with a view to adapting the education system to the needs of the country, but with due regard to the advisability of maintaining such diversity as circumstances may demand.</block>

<p>Beautiful pedagogic language; beautiful educational language. I cannot blame the hon. member for Durban (Point) if he has no notion of what I have read here. This is the language that educationists use and that is how every educationist, English- or Afrikaans-speaking, understands this language outside this House.

<p>I should like to say only this, that the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) is substantially the same as that of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the biggest objection we have, in my view, and that is to sub-sections (4) and (5). He says the Council will only advise him. Now I wonder whether he cannot amend Section (4) to read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council shall have no executive power or functions but shall serve exclusively as an advisory body that will endeavour to effect co-ordination.</block>

<p>I still owe a reply to the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog). He sent me a little note to inquire whether my silence means that I accept his amendment. His amendment amounts to this, that he wishes to evade the responsibility of the Minister of Education; he wishes to evade the Minister&#x2019;s interest and co-operation with the others, in that they have to do these things through him. If the responsible Minister in this House is held responsible for what is entrusted to him under this Bill, I cannot accept it, for everything has to go through the Minister of Education because the accounting must take place here. It is not for <span class="col_8457-8458" refersTo="page_1475"/>the purpose of censoring it in any manner; it is only intended for that one purpose.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) it is really a very weak definition to say that one will try to co-ordinate. It is more understandable if you say it is the Council&#x2019;s function to advise and to co-ordinate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I feel that this is probably the most important clause in the Bill. This is the clause which can quite easily mean that no provincial legislation can be established in any of the provinces before that province gets the sanction of the Minister. Not only will it possibly deprive the provincial council of the right to legislate, but also at the same time it will give to this council the right only to look after the affairs of the White section of our population. I feel that if this council is going to be of any use whatsoever, it will have to bear in mind that education in South Africa has to take care of the three major groups here and not only of the White people in this country, but at the same time the interests of the Bantu and the Coloured people have to be looked after. As I said earlier on if the hon. the Minister thinks that he can divorce one section of the population from another in regard to education, he is making a very, very big mistake. It cannot work. Therefore I felt that I should move an amendment in which I would have the opportunity of allowing this advisory council to look after not only the interests of the White people but those of the Coloureds and the Bantu, and I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to voice my protest at this clause. The hon. member who sat down said that it was probably one of the most important clauses in the Bill. The position is that the whole power of provincial councils to make legislation in regard to White education is now virtually vetoed, because the ordinary method of debate in a provincial <span class="col_8461-8462" refersTo="page_1477"/>council, which is the method of debate that we have in this House, is now stultified completely. You see, this Bill we have before us at the present moment is a good case in point. Let us assume that this Bill was a draft ordinance coming before the provincial council. Now look at the amendments in regard to Clause 3 that the hon. the Minister has put on the Order Paper, two-and-a-half pages of amendments. Now that can&#x2019;t happen in regard to legislation that comes before provincial councils. What does &#x201C;prior consultation&#x201D; mean? It means that the council in effect has got to approve it. The council will have to be consulted in regard to the form in which it has to go before the provincial council. Therefore the right of hon. members to move amendments which are going to change the form in which the ordinance comes before the provincial council is ruled out. Any Administrator now dealing with a draft ordinance and who is piloting it through the provincial council, has got to say &#x201C;I cannot accept those material amendments because they have not been before the council&#x201D; in terms of this particular Bill. The whole system of legislation of our provincial councils is now done away with. In effect this clause means that a draft ordinance conceived by the Administrator of a province, goes to the Minister, from him to the council, and then after it has been finally approved of by the council it goes back to the Minister and it comes back to the Administrator concerned, and must be adopted by the provincial council in that form without material amendments, otherwise it is not the legislation in regard to which the council has been consulted. This is going to stultify the whole provincial council system to debate in an ordinary normal manner, a constitutional manner, the draft legislation that is put before them and to make amendments to it of a material character at any stage of the proceedings, which their own rules and regulations will permit. That is why we have to oppose this clause.</p>

<p>Sir, this clause deals with legislation introduced in the Senate or the House of Assembly or in a provincial council. Now in regard to the Senate and the House of Assembly the clause is unnecessary because the only person who can introduce legislation affecting White persons is the hon. the Minister himself.

<p>The hon. the Minister himself has just referred to the term &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;, and I would like the hon. the Minister to consider the substitution of the word &#x201C;concurrence&#x201D; for consultation. Now &#x201C;concurrence&#x201D; means &#x201C;agreement&#x201D;. &#x201C;Consultation&#x201D; merely means consultation between the bodies mentioned here. Does the hon. the Minister not wish rather more agreement? I hope the hon. the Minister will seriously consider this amendment of mine and I think it would be a slight improvement in respect of a clause to which I am totally opposed. In the evidence heard before the Select Committee witnesses expressed not only their real concern, but also the five Commissions referred to by the hon. the Minister in his second reading speech all came to the one conclusion, namely that the provincial powers should be in no way affected, and their legislation should be in no way affected by the powers of such a council. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if he does not agree that it is more desirable to have &#x201C;concurrence&#x201D; rather than just &#x201C;consultation&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I should just like to say that if there has to be something like an agreement, and that they should concede it, then I just cannot accept it for it is not &#x201C;in consultation&#x201D; but it is &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D;. When the Central Government of the Republic wants to introduce legislation, and the provinces reject it or say it may not do so, then surely that would be completely wrong. It would infringe the sovereign powers of Parliament. And if the provinces will not listen after consultation, and they wish to introduce their own legislation, they would still be at liberty to do so, after consultation. It says clearly &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D;. All we are contemplating in this clause is that there should be a little unity at least, so that we may know what is happening. We can do so now under the present system, we may veto legislation and we can do all the things, but that is not the object of this clause. You want a high-ranking Council that will co-ordinate properly and advise properly. That is why I cannot accept the amendment. I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>
