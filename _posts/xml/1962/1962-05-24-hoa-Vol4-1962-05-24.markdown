<heading>PERSONAL EXPLANATION</heading>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last might in the heat and emotion of debate, I made an unfortunate remark during the course of the attack made by the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson); unfortunate in the sense that a Chief Whip is expected always to be friendly and charming, like this Chief Whip who is now saying courteously that he withdraws those words unreservedly. I said that I would break the hon. member&#x2019;s neck if he repeated outside the House what he said last night. I now want to say that I have nothing against him and that I am sorry that I made that remark. I withdraw it because it did not befit me at all.</p>

<heading>GENERAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for second reading&#x2014;General Law Amendment Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Justice, upon which an amendment had been moved by Sir de Villiers Graaff, adjourned on 23 May, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when one listened to the trend of the debate in this House last night, it was wonderful to think how confused people can become despite all the advice they have at their disposal on all sides. When one thinks of this, one wonders how the country feels about legislation of this nature, and one wonders whether it is necessary to introduce legislation of this nature at this stage. What are we seeking in introducing this legislation? Mr. Speaker, I want to put these questions to the House: Are we seeking punitive measures aimed at communist activities or sabotage, or what are we seeking? If we are seeking more severe measures, why do we then not say so? Hon. members opposite will have the support of this House if they are seeking more severe measures &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2026; they will have the support of this House if they are seeking more severe measures aimed at the activities of people who are endangering the individual, the people and the country. If a person&#x2014;and it does not matter whether he is a communist or not&#x2014;does these things, he is a saboteur in any case. If he endangers the lives of people, by for example blowing up bridges or derailing trains, or no matter what he does to endanger the lives of people, he deserves the death penalty.</p>

<p>If he is endangering the security or the administration of the State, then punish him. Is that what they are seeking in this Bill, or what are we seeking? Do we want a definition of sabotage? And if we want to give that definition, why then give a definition which lends itself to the type of interpretation which has aroused the whole country?</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No. Mr. Speaker, I am asking whether it has become necessary to introduce such legislation in this House, legislation which has not only caused agitation in the country but abroad as well. It has not only caused agitation in this country, but this Bill is once again giving the whole White world an opportunity to say that this Government only wants to create a police state in this country and that is the last straw.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I ask in all fairness: Is there no other way in which we can approach this matter? Can we not make the penalties as drastic as we wish, and if people must be punished for that type of action, hon. members will have the assistance of this side of the House. Can we not crystallize <span class="col_6305-6306" refersTo="page_0399"/>the definition of sabotage in a quite simple way, without giving a definition which is so wide that everyone feels their safety threatened, whether they sympathize with Communism or not, or whether they sympathize with saboteurs or not?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in making this submission, it will be helpful to look back a little and see what happened in 1939-40.</p>

<p>Yes, I hear hon. members saying: &#x201C;Ah&#x201D;.

<p>A large proportion of members sitting opposite, and also on their front benches, were members of the Ossewa brandwag; they were officers of the O.B., and if they were as proud of that as I was, they would not go to such lengths to level allegations at me that I was an O.B. General in 1939, because I am proud of it. I shall deal with that presently. I would not know whether the hon. member for Vereeniging a member of the O.B. I do not think so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to say that I consider that this warning you have just given also applies to me. But I just want to tell the hon. member for Vereeniging, the member who made a plea here yesterday, together with many disparaging and bitter remarks, that if that is his idea of the will of the people and of bringing the White people together, then he will not be successful and he will split the people completely. He has made many distasteful allegations which I am not going to repeat. He has sown bitterness, and he then tried in a disparaging way to drive a wedge between members on this side by saying that some are good and some are not. It is so easy for us to do the same thing and it is so easy to say that we do not believe that all hon. members opposite support this measure wholeheartedly, this measure which has sown so much discord in the country, if there are other methods of achieving our objects. [Interjections.] I also heard the hon. member say that politics was a cruel thing. I accept that. The cruellest of all is the fact that he is in it. But I assume that if he is familiar with the cruelty of politics, then he certainly does not know the hearts of people. If he knew the hearts of people, he would not have spoken yesterday as he did here. He did his best to use the divisions existing amongst the White people of his country in order to drive them yet further apart and to antagonize them towards one another yet further. I still want to see the man who will rise here and say: This was a speech which brought the White peoples closer to one another, and in this way ensured that the White nation can continue to exist. I want to tell him that if this is his contribution to the building of a nation, we shall not build a White nation here. If the threat comes, the threat about which hon. members opposite speak so often and which the hon. the Minister of Defence has repeatedly mentioned, namely the Black danger which threatens from the North&#x2014;a statement by the Minister of Defence which was partly repudiated here by his Leader at a later stage&#x2014;when the day comes that the White people of this country will of necessity have to stand together, then there will not be a place for such vindictive people as he.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have said that as I want to make a comparison between the legislation the hon. the Minister of Justice has now introduced, then I must compare the period of 1939-40. Allow me just to say that during that period when the Ossewabrandwag was established&#x2014;and there are people here who should know this as well as I; there are people here who held high positions in the O.B. and who know as well as I that the O.B. was established in 1939, immediately after the &#x201C;Ossewatrek&#x201D;, as the standard-bearer of the concept of unity amongst the Afrikaners. In October 1939 it was established under Ds. Kotze of Bloemfontein. I then joined. A year before the war the O.B. was the standard-bearer of the idealism of the White nation in South Africa. That was the time when I became a general in the O.B. and they cannot frighten me with this because I am proud of it. Nor must they think that they can frighten my party or the country by saying this. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member must now come back to the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from><span class="col_6307-6308" refersTo="page_0400"/>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is how the O.B. was established. In 1940-1 it continued with its activities. [Interjections.] I now want to compare that period with this period in which we are introducing this legislation. When the hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;) opened the debate on that side of the House yesterday, he said that he was ashamed of the criticism of lawyers of the introduction of this Bill and its contents. There are also other legal opinions, and they are ashamed of the legal opinion of the hon. member. But I now put this challenge to the hon. the Minister of Justice. During recent months he has been eager to make use of the fact that we were colleagues at that time. He has repeatedly referred to the O.B. General, Moolman. I want to admit in all friendship that I am just as proud of the fact that I was an O.B. General at that time. I just want to issue this challenge to him, namely that he should reveal either here or anywhere else in public what prosecutions and convictions took place in the area which I controlled at that time, as against those which took place in the area he controlled. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The first War Measures were published during the period 1939-44 as Act No. 13 of 1940, and as far as I know, it gave no description of &#x201C;saboteurs&#x201D; or that type of organization or activity, and least of all of the O.B. In October 1940 the former Leader of the Nationalist Party, the late Dr. Malan, issued a challenge to that organization, namely the O.B., to the effect that if they did not withdraw a circular, No. 1/41, the association between the O.B. and the Nationalist Party would be broken off.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>On 2 February, 1942, the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr. Malan, read out a sworn affidavit in respect of certain sabotage committed by a citizen of this country. At that stage &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; had not yet been defined as far as the War Measures were concerned. They then came with a definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;. It was provided&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;that a person guilty of &#x201C;murder or assault with the intention of causing serious bodily harm to persons, or deliberate damage, robbery, damage to property, the possession of explosives in contravention of the law, public violence, contravention of Section 37 which deals with the Railways and Harbours regulations, as amended, or theft, or an attempt to commit such an offence, or incitement to commit such an offence, or participation in a conspiracy to commit such an offence&#x201D;, will be guilty of &#x201C;a special offence&#x201D; or of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;. We now ask ourselves whether if such a simple formula could be found during a time of war to deal with saboteurs, it is necessary to-day to have a lengthy definition such as we find in this Bill which has unfortunately been called the Sabotage Bill. Let us see what this Bill says. We first find a list of acts which will be regarded as sabotage and then Clause 21 (2) says: &#x201C;No person shall be convicted of an offence under &#x2026; &#x2018;objectively regarded &#x2019; &#x2026;&#x201D;. Then <i>inter alia</i> he must prove that he did not intend to cause financial loss to any person, or to cause feelings of hostility between the different sections of the population of the Republic. How widely can this definition be interpreted? &#x201C;To cause, encourage or further feelings of hostility between different sections of the population of the Republic.&#x201D; And if one cannot prove that one is innocent of all these things, one will be charged. Clause 21 (1) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Any person who commits any wrongful and wilful act whereby he &#x2026; obstructs, tampers with &#x2026;</block>

<p>If the newspaper reports are correct&#x2014;I assume they are&#x2014;then a deputation approached the hon. the Minister yesterday and, according to them, he was prepared to make certain concessions in the Bill.

Mr. Speaker, I maintain that the tolerance of the Government which was in power during the <span class="col_6311-6312" refersTo="page_0402"/>war period from 1939 to 1944 contributed greatly towards gaining the support of the people for the Government in the war effort. Many of South Africa&#x2019;s sons whom we did not think would participate in the war eventually became &#x201C;Rooi Lussies&#x201D; and went to defend their country.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to abide faithfully by your ruling, and not deal with the activities of the O.B., as you have ruled, but I want to remind the hon. member for East London (City) (Mr. Moolman) in all goodwill, that in future he will be known as the member who made his appearance in this Parliament, who objected to the statement that politics is cruel, and that he does not think that politics is the art of government. He will be known in history as the member who has the greatest achievements to his name in the field of romance, but who has failed the most miserably in the field of politics in South Africa. The hon. member has come here and he has said that we want to create an uproar in the country. I now want to tell him that, notwithstanding the fact that there are people who are creating an uproar in the country, leftist organizations, which he will certainly also condemn, certain parts of the Press, and certain individuals who are creating an atmosphere of bitter hostility against this Bill&#x2014;to a certain extent people are creating suspicion and misrepresentation, and this is the atmosphere which they are creating&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Justice, whom that hon. member has described as a man with a brilliant brain, has explained in a calm and dignified way, the contents, objects and the background of this Bill so effectively, so informatively and so clearly that one can really see the Bill in the correct perspective, and not in the way the hon. member has done. What has the hon. member done in this House? Notwithstanding the excellent explanation of the hon. the Minister, whose intelligence he admires so greatly, what reaction have we had to this approach by the Minister of Justice? The hon. member says that this Bill is turning South Africa into a police state. Could one hear a more criminal (misdadige) remark in this Parliament?</p>

Why do they not discuss the Bill with a view to its background and its objects, so that the public outside can form a correct judgment? They only have one object, namely to destroy the effect of this essential measure, and to obstruct the effective combating of Communism in South Africa. But while the Minister of Justice has acted in so dignified a fashion and we have had this reaction from the United Party, what reaction have we had from outside? Organizations from outside have come and established contact with the Minister. I read in to-day&#x2019;s newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not want to do what other hon. members and even lawyers have done, and analyse certain clauses and then read into these clauses things which they really do not contain, in order to destroy the effect of the Bill. I would rather discuss the Bill against its background. The hon. member for South Coast has said that we must act in a responsible way, and that we must take all responsible elements together with us in our fight against the communists. If we want to see this Bill in its correct perspective, we must consider it against the background of racial struggle or racial peace. Here we have common ground because hon. members opposite say that they are also opposed to the communists and stand for law and order, and they support racial peace. I think there is one thing in respect of which all responsible Whites and even non-Whites are absolutely agreed, namely that we must do everything in our power to establish peaceful race relations between White and non-White because nothing can have a more deadly effect on South Africa than precisely racial tension and racial conflict which can result in a racial war. The racial struggle which hon. members opposite say they do not want will result in the undermining and the destruction of the self-preservation of the White man, and it will also cause the Black man to sink back into poverty and chaos. For this reason we must not only see this Bill against the background of racial struggle, but also of racial peace which means the preservation of the Christian White race. But it will also mean more. It will also mean that the Black man can be led in a proper way by his Christian White guardian along the road towards development, independence (selfstandigwording) and a better future. Hon. members say they desire that. We do not want racial struggle, but racial peace. Why do they not consider Bill against this background? This Bill is in fact aimed at ending the racial struggle and achieving racial peace and at neutralizing the saboteurs, these trained agitators, these leftist organizations and the communist Press who contribute to bringing about racial strife in South Africa&#x2014;are hon. members opposed to our introducing a Bill to prevent this? This is precisely the praiseworthy object of this Bill, namely the elimination of racial conflict and eventually the establishment of racial peace in the interests of White and non-White. But they do not want to do that. They do not want to consider the Bill against this background, but what they will in fact do is what has been done by the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) who is now in the lobby and is no longer in any danger. Mr. Speaker, you are looking at me significantly, but I have withdrawn my words unreservedly. [Laughter.] The hon. member has said that we are advocating a doctrine of self-preservation, and he has contrasted this with a doctrine of love. But I want to ask that hon. member: Is there not also a doctrine of hatred and destruction which atheistic Communism propagates? What right does he have to consider this Bill against a background of love in order to condemn the self-preservation of the White race which we advocate? Why does he not consider the Bill against the background of this problem? Why is atheistic Communism concentrating on the destruction of the Christian White race here on the southern tip of Africa? No, he is not doing that. This small White race consists of English- and Afrikaans-speaking people, and is the anchor of Western civilization and the Christian religion. On both sides of the House we are bearers of a cultural and spiritual inheritance which we call Western civilization, and that is why we form part of the Western European world, and that is why the communists are not only launching their attacks on Western Europe and on America, but are concentrating on South Africa as well. I therefore want to say that we differed from the hon. member for South Coast as regards our form of government, but when we established a Christian republic, they all swore allegiance to that republic because they saw in it the safeguarding of democracy and our fundamental rights and the combating of Communism. When I am discussing lofty concepts, and the hon. member interrupts me the expression on that hon. member&#x2019;s face only annoys me. I repeat that we must consider this Bill against the background of the preservation and the safeguarding of the Christian White race and this means the safeguarding of our &#x201C;way of life&#x201D; about which they speak so often, our way of life, our direction in life, our Christian principles. Why do they not consider the Bill against this background, seeing that we are dealing with the saboteurs and the agitators? Do they not realize that the struggle in which we are engaged is not a struggle between political parties, but a struggle between two great irreconcilable ways of life, namely that of the communist atheist doctrine, which is in sharp <span class="col_6317-6318" refersTo="page_0405"/>contrast to our philosophy of life. Here we are introducing a Bill which will result in Communism being eradicated root and branch, and instead of their supporting us in order to safeguard the White race, that hon. member is distracting my attention and opposing the Bill in principle.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, you must call that hon. member to order, because if his policy were to be implemented, we would see the greatest possible disorder in South Africa. I now want to speak particularly to the hon. member for South Coast. He is a member who differs from us, but I am speaking on behalf of the whole House when I say that I know he has made a very important speech. He has said that we must try to take the non-Whites with us too when we fight Communism, and I therefore feel that I must discuss this Bill also against that background, namely that the communist technique is deliberately aimed at inciting the Black man and the non-White against the White man. Their devilish technique is to use the communist agitator whom we want to restrict by means of this Bill, and they do this with only one devilish object, namely, the incitement of a non-White front in order to destroy the Christian White nation and the establishment of a Bolshevist republic in South Africa. Now hon. members know that after all, and the hon. member for South Coast knows that after all. If they were to succeed in this terrible, violent revolution which will result in the realization of their great ideal, namely, the establishment of a communist dictatorship, will there be any question of democracy and the protection of fundamental rights in this country? Will there be such a thing as racial peace? I do not think anything will be left of our way of life. If they succeed in their devilish object, will anything remain of the pious talk of equality between White and non-White? Will we still hear of one man one vote, as the Liberal Party advocates? Will we still hear of a civilization test which the hon. member for Houghton advocates so loudly? Will we even hear of the National Union? No, there will be no question of it, because there is no question of it to-day, since they no longer even have a caucus. There will be no question of a federal Parliament in which White and non-White can peacefully discuss matters. There will be a rude disillusionment. There will be the subjection of the White race to a lawless, non-White violent Black r&#x00E9;gime. Yes, there will be a Black Bartholomew&#x2019;s night for the Whites. Is that what hon. members want? This legislation must be seen against that background. And the Blacks must know that when that day comes and they think they have a Black Government, the last step will come, namely, a Bolshevist dictatorship. But I want to go a little further. The hon. member for South Coast has said that we must take the non-Whites with us. Do we not think the time has come in South Africa when we must listen to the voices of certain non-Whites who are also anti-communists, he has asked? I have gone into this matter. I want to mention two examples, and I want to ask hon. members who are the Christian White guardians of the Black man, who must lead them to development and independence, whether these non-Whites do not set an example to some Whites who to-day are cooperating with the Black Sash and these leftist organizations who wish to destroy this Bill? In 1937, Dr. Dube, a member of the Native Representative Council, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are people who are tampering with the Natives in the locations and spreading communist propaganda there. There is widely distributed communist propaganda which is causing unrest amongst the Native people. There are also newspapers in the Bantu languages which are inciting the Natives to commit unlawful acts.</block>

<p>As long ago as 1937 a Native leader was pointing out the danger of this atheistic Communism and he mentioned by name the things with which the Minister wants to deal to-day, in terms of the provisions of this Bill. And what else did he say? What is the remedy? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The remedy lies in the hands of the White people. They must find out who is tampering with the Natives in the locations. It is in the industrial centres that this terrible propaganda is being spread.</block>

<p>This Native said to the Whites: Come and help us. He wanted a remedy. He said the remedy was in the hands of the White guardian and here a Minister is suiting the action to the word, and he has drawn up a Bill which he wants to use in order to deal with this incitement, with these newspapers and these people who are inciting the Natives. We are the Christian White guardians, this is what has been said to us, and what attitude must we adopt towards them? Seeing that hon. members have referred to Bantu nationalism, I want to say quite clearly to-day that we must stand together precisely on this point because if there are Natives who are moving towards self-determination, who love what is their own, who are the champions of Bantu nationalism, we as Christian White guardians must merely direct that Bantu nationalism into the right channels. We must just not allow them to be used as a Trojan horse by the communists in this country in order to destroy the White man. I say that we must see this matter against that background, and that is what the Minister wishes to do here. He wishes to act against certain organizations with fine-sounding names which are doing this devilish work in order to use these Bantu nationalists to destroy White nationalism. No, we must direct Bantu nationalism and also White nationalism into sound channels because Communism is antinational. I therefore say that it was such a <span class="col_6319-6320" refersTo="page_0406"/>terrible slogan when the United Party said at the 1938 election: &#x201C;Destroy nationalism.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we do not want to eradicate White nationalism because if we eradicate White nationalism, we shall eradicate the White race, and if we eradicate Bantu nationalism, we shall also eradicate the Black race, and that is precisely what Communism envisages. Mr. Speaker, do you think that the communists love Bantu nationalism? Let us analyse this for a moment against the background of what is happening in Africa. Are they so fond of Bantu nationalism here? Here they want to use Bantu nationalism in order to destroy the White race, in order to destroy our way of life, in order to overthrow the State and to create a new order. What are they doing in Africa? I shall tell the House. Allow me to read from the <i>Transvaler</i> a certain report which appeared in the London <i>Sunday Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Approximately 3,000 Natives from Africa are at present studying in Russia as part of a Russian plan to destroy Black nationalism in Africa within the next ten years. Thus wrote Aidan Crawley in the London <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday. In a long article Crawley said that 1,000 students were being added to this number annually. &#x201C;The main advantage which the Russians have in the future struggle against Black nationalism is the over-confidence and ignorance of the Natives.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In Africa, where one has the big African states. Communism is therefore concentrating precisely on the destruction of nationalism because nationalism is not based on hatred but on love. But Communism is a doctrine of hatred and destruction. I therefore want to deal particularly with this point which hon. members opposite have used; on the one hand they say that the position is such that we need greater powers; on the other hand they say there is peace and that we do not need these powers. Mr. Speaker, why is it absolutely essential that in a time of peace, at a time when South Africa is experiencing a comparatively peaceful period, that we should relentlessly and without pause fight Communism tooth and nail? Why? Before I answer this question I want to remind the House of this: The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred the other day to positive action and not merely negative action. It is precisely as a result of the combined positive and negative action of the National Party since it came into power in 1948 that South Africa to-day is the safest and best-run State on the whole continent of Africa. But what are the Opposition doing? They are grasping these apparently peaceful conditions as a fig leaf, as a pretence, in order to adopt a passive attitude towards Communism. That we cannot do. Communism is wily. Even in times of peace one must not trust it; one must be awake. As Gen. Smuts said, one must keep the weapons shining. One must have the trowel in one hand and the spear in the other. One must fight it tooth and nail. But in this time of peace do the Opposition want to fight it tooth and nail? Do they not know how wily Communism is? Do they not know that Communism is so clever, so cunning and so devilish in its tactics that it even uses the slogan of peace in the war against the Western democratic states and our way of life? Do they not know that? Communism is a devilish doctrine, so said Field-Marshal Smuts in the evening of his life. Communism is a spiritual disease; it is a cancer. If one does not eradicate it root and branch, if one does not pull up the whole growth by its roots, then it will so penetrate the entire State and the entire community that it can result in paralysis and in my opinion also the destruction of everything that is dear to us in our country. We must not allow ourselves to be soothed to sleep in time of peace. Communism is tough; it is obstinate. Communism always reminds me of the Greek legend of the multi-headed monster, which had the characteristic that if one chopped off one of its heads two or three others grew in its place. Communism is tough, and I am glad that the hon. the Minister of Justice has now come forward with this instrument for chopping off these heads so that we can combat Communism more effectively than we have been able to do in the past, no matter how well we did do so.</p>

<p>Communism takes on various guises. There is no other movement which takes on as many guises as the Communist Party and Communism. Even the United Party cannot keep up with them. When it suits them for practical reasons they take on all sorts of guises. Why do hon. members opposite not consider this Bill against the background of the tactics, the wiliness and the objects of unscrupulous Communism? The hon. the Minister is here amending the 1950, 1951 and 1954 Acts in order to close loopholes, which are perhaps due to the actions of an obstinate Opposition which has adopted a passive attitude towards the communists and opposed the legislation. These communists have discovered loopholes, and the Minister is now closing those loopholes. When I see the attitude adopted by the Opposition during this debate towards this Bill, then I am convinced of one thing&#x2014;and here I want to address a few friendly words to hon. members opposite: Unscrupulous agitators, saboteurs outside, organizations which want to destroy the Christian way of life, certain individuals who are furthering Communism, are in ecstasy at the moment at the fact that not only outside but in the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa there are people who are putting up such a bitter and obstinate struggle against this most effective measure which we are introducing in order to combat atheistic Communism in South Africa. I think that the communists, the trouble-makers and the anti-social communistic underminers of the State are proposing one toast after the other to-night in vodka to the United Party, the Progressive Party and <span class="col_6321-6322" refersTo="page_0407"/>the other parties. This is their parliamentary front. I can already hear them calling out: &#x201C;Long live the United Party&#x201D; because that is the attitude they have adopted here. I want to make it quite clear to-day that I am pleased and grateful that at the moment there is a National Party in power, a National Party which has always consistently opposed Communism. Hon. members opposite challenged us last night and asked where we had taken action against Communism. I do not want to bore hon. members with quotations, but they can even go back to the 1937 congress of the National Party in the Cape; at that time there were no less than 10 motions aimed at Communism; we have always opposed Communism through warnings and through effective positive and negative action. We have consistently taken action and we have a clean anti-communist record. Since coming into power we have done everything in our ability to eradicate Communism. I just want to remind the House that on the eve of the 1948 election the secretary of the Communist Party in South Africa. Moses Kotane, appealed to his own supporters: &#x201C;Comrades, White and Black, tomorrow is polling day. Vote for the United Party because if the Nationalist Party come into power they will eradicate Communism root and branch.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, that Native had a prophetic gift. We came into power, and since coming into power in 1948 we have introduced one measure after the other aimed at eradicating Communism root and branch from our fatherland. We have placed this anti-communistic legislation on the Statute Book; we have banned the <i>Guardian</i> and the Communist Party. There are so many examples which we can mention, but what have the United Party done? We have only had lip service from the United Party. I say that this is merely lip service, because here they have the opportunity to suit the action to the word, and instead of helping to combat Communism their only object is to reduce the effectiveness of this measure; to obstruct this measure. However, I do want to congratulate them as well; they have been consistent throughout; they are consistent in this weak-kneed attitude towards Communism. If their consistent attitude were to be implemented, if they had been in power, then Sam Kahn and Bunting would still sit there, then the <i>Guardian</i> would still have continued to spread the ideology of Communism amongst the Black people of this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I welcome this measure, because these trained agitators, these inciters, are appealing to all that is animal and low in mankind. White as well as non-White. If one listens on the Parade to trained agitators, then one sees that they do not appeal to what is fine and pure and noble. Oh no, the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) knows that these agitators take the platform under the guise of fundamental rights and freedom and they then let loose passions and desires which must eventually be translated into action and the destruction of the White man in our father land and everything which we have achieved.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The fluency of the hon. the Chief Whip is a continual source of wonder and admiration to all members, I think, but this afternoon he has treated us to a very long lecture on the evils and the dangers of Communism. In doing so, of course, he is preaching to the converted. I have one fault to find with his very eloquent speech and that is that he made very little reference to the Bill: we are discussing. I know that the blood of the hon. the Chief Whip is liable to boil at a: somewhat low temperature sometimes, but I think I must take the risk of joining issue with him on two points. The first is that I think, lie goes entirely wrong in his premise that if one is opposed to Communism, it goes without saying that one is also bound to support: this Bill, and that opposition to Communism means, that without any thought or consideration one is bound blindly to give one&#x2019;s approval to any measures whatever which anybody proposes to take in order to deal with Communism. That is a complete <i>non sequiter</i> and it is completely illogical. I should have thought that the hon. the Chief Whip, if he had thought about it, would have realized how wrong he was in his reasoning.</p>

<p>The second point on which I disagree with him is this: From his few references to this Bill I gather that he approves of it and that he thinks that the hon. the Minister is doing a great service to the country in introducing it in the form in which it stands now. There again I join issue with the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) because I think that it has been obvious from the start that this is a very bad Bill. I think there has been reference this afternoon to consultation between the Minister and certain trade organizations, as the result of which, according to the Chief Whip, the hon. member for Brits, the trade unions after having had time to consider the matter and hear the Minister&#x2019;s views, have changed their ideas about the Bill. Well, Sir, if that is so one can only say that if the Government is so convinced of the rectitude and the equity of this Bill, it is a pity that they rushed it to such an extent in putting it before the country and bringing it into this House, because on their own argument, if they are right, if the country had had ample time to examine and consider the Bill, if this House had had more time to consider and examine the Bill, according to them there would have been a much larger measure of agreement than there is.</p>

<p>Oh, it is that hon. member! I thought it was somebody else. We do not take any notice of his interruptions. Sir, not only has it been obvious from the beginning that this is a bad Bill but I think this debate has clearly demonstrated just how bad it is and how very weak is the case which the Government benches have put up in demanding <span class="col_6323-6324" refersTo="page_0408"/>support for it. There is a third point on which I join issue with the hon. member. He said that the Minister had introduced this Bill in a most reasonable explanatory way and in a manner which should convince anybody of the rightness of his case. I cannot agree with him. I thought that the introduction of this Bill was also very bad. The Minister&#x2019;s introduction of the Bill to me was a very strange exhibition of sabre-rattling and tub-thumping and special pleading, and certainly did nothing to convince either me or anybody on this side of the House that the unrestricted powers which he is demanding are either necessary or, what is more, that they are likely to be successful in achieving his allegedly limited objectives. But one thing has become clear in this debate from the outset, and that is that we are rapidly nearing the stage when any person who opposes Government policies, particularly race policy, either verbally or in writing, is liable to be labelled as an agitator and once you are labelled as an agitator it is becoming more and more likely that you will be dubbed a communist and will fall under the scope of the Act and of this Bill when it has been passed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are continually getting examples of the sad mental arrogance which afflicts so many hon. members on the other side of the House, and that type of remark is just one of them. Sir, this Bill has been subjected, not as the Chief Whip says, to petty-fogging criticism from this side of the House; it is being subjected to objective and critical legal examination, an examination which shows perfectly clearly how far it goes beyond the objective which the Minister says he has in introducing this legislation. We have had no reasoned reply to that analysis from the other side of the House. Typical speeches from the other side of the House have been the speeches of the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet), who treated us to another discourse on his two favourite subjects, the question of a police state and the iniquities of the English Press, and, of course, the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), who, in his wholesale way, regards any opposition to this Bill as a form of agitation. Indeed, he went so far, by implication, as to suggest that the whole of this side of the House, in opposing this Bill, were siding with communists and saboteurs.</p>

<p>But, generally speaking, the attitude of hon. members opposite seems to be simply one of resignation. Their attitude seems to be that this country is in great danger, and in such a state of danger that there is no alternative to placing these almost dictatorial powers in the hands of the Minister, unrestricted by any parliamentary or other control at all. They seem to be satisfied to sit back and to thank the Minister and to hope for the best. If they had come forward and said that they did feel that there was an urgent necessity, that they did feel that the Government should be given any power they liked to deal with any particular emergency, and that the Government should have to report back to Parliament, which is the body which is giving them that power, then I think they might have had a case. But no, Sir, they just sit back and say: &#x201C;Well, that is all there is to it; let us hope for the best; we trust the Minister to be a good Minister.&#x201D; But none of them seems to think what a commentary this Bill is, taking the Minister&#x2019;s statement at its face value, on 14 years of Nationalist Government. Armed with Acts which give the Government and this Minister power which is unheard of in any civilized country, except in times of national emergency, and then only as a temporary measure&#x2014;in spite of that, they now find it necessary to come to the House to seek further powers enlarging the already almost unrestricted powers which the Government has to restrict and repress freedom of speech, association and movement, and creating a new omnibus crime which is so widely defined that, as far as I, a mere layman, can see, an ordinary burglar can fall under it and become liable to the death penalty. Now the hon. the Minister comes along and he says that, without these powers for which he is asking, he cannot carry out his duty of maintaining law and order. In other words, he admits that, since 1950, this Government, with all the powers which it has accumulated since 1950, has failed to quell and to kill the monster for which these powers were given. The hon. the Minister said that the country is peaceful, quiet and at rest. Having said that, he proceeds to give very cogent reasons which would seem to prove exactly the contrary. He says that there are Black agitators abroad, with headquarters in London, who are organizing upheavals in this country; he says that there are White agitators&#x2014;at one stage he said &#x201C;White communist agitators&#x201D; and at another stage he said &#x201C;White agitators&#x201D;&#x2014;here at home who have to be dealt with more severely; he says that communist cells are being formed throughout the country, and we have been told, not by this Minister in his last speech, but by Cabinet Ministers, that uprisings are planned in this country for 1963. In other words, if all these things are true, the country may be quiet, but how on earth can you say that it is at rest? If these things are true, beneath this quiet surface the country must be seething with unrest; you cannot have it both ways. The most the hon. the Minister can say is, in the classic phrase, that &#x201C;order reigns in Warsaw&#x201D;, if his case is correct, and I am not in a position to say whether he is right or wrong; I do not know. I am only saying that he is not consistent in what he did say in his speech. The Minister says that this Bill has no ulterior motives, that it is a simple measure to render communists harmless and to prevent sabotage. By &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; I think he means violence aimed at upsetting the affairs of the country and possibly to <span class="col_6325-6326" refersTo="page_0409"/>upset the State. His followers accept that; they are agreed that the powers that he is asking for are wide, but they trust the Minister not to misuse them. I am not surprised that hon. members on the other side find themselves somewhat puzzled as to the position. Here they have one Minister telling them one day that the country is peaceful, quiet and at rest, and the very next day the Minister who sits next to him told us yesterday afternoon that we were fighting for our lives, so it is not surprising that hon. members on the other side, even that great brain, the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker), are puzzled as to exactly what the position is.</p>

<p>In any case, I cannot agree with hon. members on the other side on either count. I cannot agree that this Bill has no ulterior motives, and I cannot agree that we can be perfectly certain that the hon. the Minister will not make wrongful use of these powers. Let me tell the House why. The hon. the Minister at one time advocated publicly a policy which. I believe, was called Christian national socialism, which at that time was equated&#x2014;I think equated by him&#x2014;with Fascism in Italy and national socialism in Germany. I do not know whether he has changed his mind: I have never see any public statement by him saying that he no longer believes in that form of government, or I do not know whether he has simply gone underground, because it is not only communists who can go underground. Sir. In the second place I think you, Sir, were in the House when the Minister of Economic Affairs made his maiden speech in 1948. The theme of that traditionally non-controversial maiden speech was the conflict in South Africa between nationalism and liberalism. He said in that speech, which you will find in Hansard, vol. 64, col. 502&#x2014;and I recommend that speech for light reading&#x2014;that there was this conflict going on between liberalism and nationalism; that liberalism believed in the individual, with his so-called rights and liberties. He said on the one hand, nationalism believes that every person can only attain his highest freedom and fullest self-realization within the unit of the nation; on the other hand, liberalism (he said) believes in the sovereign right and freedom of the individual. He went on to say that the doctrine of liberalism, as he defined it, was almost the same as the ideal of Communism. Of course that made his speech reminiscent of a page out of &#x201C;Mein Kampf&#x201D;. But my point is that there in 1948 you had a statement, a declaration of faith, by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. I don&#x2019;t know whether he has changed his views, but since then we have had in this House and in the country a steady stream of legislation regimenting people into units of the State, restricting the discretion of the courts, even access to the courts in some cases, taking powers out of the hands of Parliament and placing them in the hands of the Executive, that is the State. And I regard this Bill as almost, not quite (because there is further legislation on the Order Paper for this Session of the same pattern), as the culmination of a long-term plan of which notice was given in this House as long ago as 1948 by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>I regard this Bill as the culmination of a long-term plan. The Minister tells us that this is not panic legislation. He says it is a cool, calculated measure which he is obliged to introduce under the circumstances. I quite believe him when he says that it is a cool and calculated measure, but I don&#x2019;t believe him when he says that he is obliged to introduce it under the present circumstances. I believe that this is a long-term plan to create&#x2014;and this Bill is only a part of that plan of course&#x2014;to create, under the guise of parliamentary democracy, the machinery for a complete totalitarian state (call it a police state if you like) in which everyone will be not a free man, but, what the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs called &#x201C;a unit of a strictly regulated state&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It won&#x2019;t do any harm to hear it again. If I thought that, by repeating it every day, it might finally convert the hon. the Minister to the errors and sins of his ways, I would be happy to do it. In other words, Sir, what is in view is a Christian national socialism, the counterpart of Fascism, and I oppose this Bill, first of all because I don&#x2019;t think it is necessary for the proper administration of this country, and I don&#x2019;t think it is necessary to maintain law and order. I believe the powers that the Government has got are so devastatingly wide at present that it should not need any further powers; and, secondly, I oppose this Bill because I believe it is part and parcel of a plan to destroy the so-called rights and liberties of man, which the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs referred to so contemptuously in his maiden speech, and because, above all, this Bill typifies a political philosophy which I loathe and detest, and which I believe in the long run will destroy our country if we go on the way they are going on at the present time.</p>

<speech by="#pelser">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PELSER</person>:</from>

<p>I really expected that we would have a better and clearer contribution from the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), a front-bencher opposite, than we had from him this afternoon in connection with this legislation. The hon. member will forgive me if I do not try to reply to the various remarks he has made. I find it extremely difficult to follow him and at this stage I should therefore in the first place prefer to confine myself to the attitudes adopted by the various parties towards this measure. I think we have reached the stage where the attitudes of the various parties have more or less been crystallized, some clearly, others not quite so clearly. I now find it noticeable that during <span class="col_6327-6328" refersTo="page_0410"/>this debate, as in all important debates which have taken place in this House, there are only two clear notes to be heard, only two clear attitudes have been set out. The one is the attitude of the Government members, a clear attitude, to the effect that they are in favour of the measure because they believe that it is in the best interests of South Africa and that they are prepared to accept all its implications, that they are prepared to accept responsibility for it, and that they are prepared to defend it here and to defend it outside in the country, whether it be in the Transvaal, the Natal, the Cape or the Free State. During this debate that attitude has once again become clearly evident.</p>

<p>Then there is a second clear note which one hears during debates of this nature, namely the attitude adopted by the liberal minded, the attitude which is represented in this House by the Progressive Party, through their only member, the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). This hon. member has spoken just as clearly. To her this measure is reprehensible from A to Z and that is why she has moved the logical motion: &#x201C;That the Bill be read this day six months.&#x201D; The hon. member for Houghton, no matter how unacceptable her attitude may be to me, compels my respect and I think it compels respect in the country outside. She is prepared to put that attitude forward in this House and she is prepared to put it outside.</p>

<p>But what of the other two parties, what of the United Party and what of its powerful election ally, the National Union? Mr. Speaker, the attitudes of these two parties have been so similar during this debate that one could hardly put a pin between them. The speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) were identical. And it was not difficult for us to prophesy that this would happen because the attitude which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout adopts is determined by the ups and downs of the results of elections contested by the United Party and the Progressive Party. After the results at Musgrave and East London City became known, a child in politics could have prophesied exactly what attitude the hon. member for Bezuidenhout would adopt in this debate. And so it happened. And as that is the position, it is not necessary for me to devote any further attention to the attitude adopted by that party.</p>

<p>I therefore confine myself to the attitude adopted by the official Opposition during this debate. The attitude adopted by the Opposition is the old, well-tried one, which they always adopt in this type of debate. But if this is an old well-tried attitude, it is also an attitude which has always failed. It is the attitude: we are in favour of this matter, we agree, we feel that it has value, but &#x2026; there are difficulties. There are difficulties and usually the difficulties are insuperable. This is precisely the same attitude as they have once again adopted on this occasion. This is the attitude which the official Opposition adopts in order to satisfy simultaneously their conservative supporters, or their supposedly conservative supporters, and their liberal supporters. This is the attitude which they adopt in order to satisfy their platteland supporters in the Free State, in the Transvaal and in the Cape on the one hand and at the same time to satisfy their Jingo supporters in Natal on the other hand. This is the attitude which they adopt in order to satisfy the conservative element in our country, and at the same time the Press which supports them and certain clergymen. This is the attitude which they adopt in order to further South Africa&#x2019;s interests, and to satisfy their own conscience on the one hand and at the same time to try to gain the goodwill of the outside world. Mr. Speaker, this is also the attitude which the United Party adopts in order to satisfy their Mitchells of South Coast, Natal, and to satisfy at the same time their Copes, Suzmans, Jan Steylers and Ray Swarts as well. This is also the attitude which they have once again been obliged in this instance to adopt in order to satisfy their Tuckers on the one hand and at the same time their Cadmans on the other hand. I find it noticeable how it is always Zululand&#x2014;if it is not Ray Swart, then it is the hon. Mr. Cadman who forces the United Party to adopt this attitude. I pity the hon. member for South Coast his Zululand members. This in the old well-tried attitude, but also the attitude which always fails. This is the attitude which is not &#x201C;Yes and which is not &#x201C;No&#x201D; either. This is the attitude of &#x201C;Ja-maar&#x201D; (yes-but). This is the attitude which the United Party has adopted in this debate. But let us examine how the United Party has tried to put its attitude during this debate. They say that they are also very anxious to maintain law and order. They say that they are just as concerned and just as worried about the security of the State. The hon. member for Natal South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has said &#x201C;the fight against Communism is not a one-party fight&#x201D;. The hon. member for Zululand in turn says &#x201C;We have as much, if not more, at stake than members on the Government side&#x201D;. He goes further and says &#x201C;The Opposition is against Communism and sabotage as much as the Government&#x201D;. This sounds all very well and it looks as though this represents support. It is encouraging. But that is not all; this is not the whole of their attitude. The tail must still come, and unfortunately the tail on these occasions always swings the dog&#x2014;and this is the tail of &#x201C;but&#x201D;. The official Opposition says: &#x201C;Yes, we should like to maintain law and order and we are bitterly opposed to saboteurs and communists, but what about access to the courts?&#x201D; And then they say again: &#x201C;We are bitterly opposed to suboteurs, but what about the great powers which the Government already has?&#x201D; And they say: &#x201C;We are bitterly opposed to Communism, but what about the freedom of the individual?&#x201D; They say: &#x201C;We are just as opposed to Communism as you and stand by you in the struggle, but what about the preparatory examinations which are now being <span class="col_6329-6330" refersTo="page_0411"/>abolished?&#x201D; They say: &#x201C;What about the discretion of the courts?&#x201D; They say: &#x201C;What about children who may be affected?&#x201D; &#x201C;What about the wide definition of sabotage?&#x201D; &#x201C;What about an unscrupulous and incapable Attorney-General?&#x201D; They say: &#x201C;What about the onus, which we feel you are placing on the accused?&#x201D; They say: &#x201C;What about the extension of the regulations under the Public Safety Act to an area where there is not a state of emergency?&#x201D; And they say: &#x201C;What about the good name of South Africa?&#x201D; And when they have reached this stage, Sir, and when they have put all the &#x201C;buts&#x201D;, then the measure has been completely emasculated and nothing is left. The hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) has made the same point. As the hon. the Minister of Information showed yesterday, this is an attitude which they adopt here, then they go outside and tell their conservative supporters: &#x201C;We were also bitterly opposed to sabotage and we were also bitterly opposed to Communism, and we were prepared to give support, but &#x2026;&#x201D;. And then they turn to their liberal supporters and say: After all you saw how we fought.</p>

<p>But, seeing that the Opposition has this vast number of buts, they will permit me too to have a few buts. They ask: &#x201C;What about the onus?&#x201D; Now I want to say: &#x201C;But&#x201D;, if you as an Opposition want to be reasonable, what then of the argument submitted by the hon. member for Smithsfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;) and the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) and by the Minister himself? But, why are they not believed and accepted? But if they do not want to accept those arguments, there still remains the &#x201C;but&#x201D; that the Opposition always has the right to move that subsection (2) of Clause 21 should be omitted. They know after all that the hon. the Minister has indicated that he will be quite prepared to accept such a proposal. It has been made clear that the onus is still on the State. The State must still as always prove that a wrongful act has been committed and that it was wilfully committed and that the person before the court is the person who committed that act. They now ask: &#x201C;But, what of these great powers?&#x201D; We are opposed to Communism and sabotage, they say, but the Minister already has such tremendous powers and you tell us that the country is quiet, calm and peaceful. But I now want to ask: But do hon. members not realize that it is precisely because of these great powers which the Minister has had and which his predecessors had and which have been taken since 1950, that South Africa is so peaceful and calm? Without these powers South Africa would have looked different to what she does to-day. I want to put a further &#x201C;but&#x201D;: But do hon. members then not realize that the Minister is in earnest, that the Minister has information and that the Minister considers it essential to take these powers in the light of information he has, and which the hon. the Opposition do not have? I say, Mr. Speaker, that hon. members say: &#x201C;But, what about the discretion of the courts?&#x201D; I now ask the hon. Opposition: But what is strange about prescribing a minimum penalty? The hon. member for Smithfield has shown so clearly that we have often prescribed a maximum penalty. And if we are allowed to prescribe a maximum penalty and no on has any objection and the courts accept it, what is strange about prescribing a minimum penalty? After all we are the legislative authority in this country. We must tell the judiciary what the laws of our land are. We must tell the judiciary in how serious a light we regard certain offences. We cannot evade our responsibilities in this way. They say: &#x201C;But what about the poor children?&#x201D; But I ask whether hon. members do not realize that a fire set alight by the hand of a child can bum just as vigorously as a fire set alight by the hand of an adult? But I also want to ask this: I shall be glad if hon. members will tell me how, if an age limit is to be laid down, the age of a Bantu child can be proved seeing that they seldom have a birth certificate? How do hon. members imagine the prosecutor is to prove that such a Bantu child has reached the relevant age? It is absolutely impossible in our country. We know the Bantu, the hon. member for South Coast knows the Bantu. If a Bantu child of 16, 17 or 18 is involved and the question of age is at issue, then it is the easiest thing in the world to call a few uncles or a grandmother who will confirm under oath that the child is younger than the relevant age. There is no way of providing it, and for this reason I believe that the Minister is obliged to omit an age limit. And he is still leaving the matter in the discretion of the court, if it is a child and the child was in-influenced to commit certain acts, not to impose the death penalty but to impose the lesser penalty. And in conclusion there is still the possibility of the penalty being commuted. Hon. members ask: But what about the extension of the regulations to an area where there is not a state of emergency? I now ask hon. members: What are we to do when we have the position such as we had in 1960 when there was a state of emergency in the Langa area and certain emergency regulations were issued, regulations relating to arrest, and the prohibition of publications, and one journalist after the other then slipped out of the Langa area and just went over the border to the magistrial district of Stellenbosch where they made statements to the Press, and no one could touch them? Do hon. members want the whole of Stellenbosch under such circumstances to be declared an emergency area?</p>

<p>But hon. members ask: What now of the good name of South Africa? I now want to ask hon. members whether they do not realize that one Sharpeville or one Langa can do South Africa&#x2019;s good name far more harm than ten acts of sabotage? Do hon. members not realize that this measure has in fact been introduced to prevent Langas, Nyangas and Sharpevilles? If hon. members are so concerned about the good name of South Africa, they should give the Minister all the powers <span class="col_6331-6332" refersTo="page_0412"/>he asks. He and his staff will ensure that there will be no more Langas and Sharpevilles, and that South Africa&#x2019;s good name abroad will be far better protected in this way than by withholding this sabotage legislation.</p>

<p>They ask: &#x201C;But what of an unscrupulous Attorney-General?&#x201D; I feel inclined to say to hon. members: But are you not ashamed of yourselves? Do hon. members not realize that our Attorneys-General are people of the highest integrity, are professional people of the highest integrity? Do they not realize that &#x201C;the spoils system&#x201D; does not apply in South Africa as it does in America? Our Attorneys-General are senior officials who are not under political pressure or influence, and I honestly do not believe that the Attorneys-General will be grateful to hon. members for the remarks they have made here. They ask us: &#x201C;What about the preparatory examination?&#x201D; They say they would also like to smother sabotage at birth, but now the preparatory examination is being abolished. What is so strange about saying that instead of having a preparatory examination, the trial should immediately take place in a Supreme Court? What is strange about this if we in fact want to ensure by these means that people do not escape one after the other during the bail period to Basutoland or Bechuanaland or Swaziland, and the next one hears of them is that they are in London and causing trouble? The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) is laughing, but it is a fact that the only way in which we can stop this properly is to take them to court immediately after arrest. That is the only way one can act. They ask: But what about the wide definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;? The hon. the Minister has made it quite clear, and he has not pulled any punches, that this is the only way in which it can be done if we wish to make the legislation effective. Here we are dealing with people who are trained to escape. And he has referred to the two safety valves which are being introduced. In the first place there is the Attorney-General who will act as a safeguard and in the second place there is the safety valve that a person can prove that it was not his intention to commit sabotage. What is really the difficulty facing hon. members?</p>

<p>So much has been said about the wide definition. The Minister of Transport has risen twice and asked the United Party: &#x201C;What do you propose?&#x201D; In every instance the reply has been that it is not their difficulty, but it is the Government&#x2019;s task to draw up the definition. They are just prepared to criticize. This reminds me of the man who said: &#x201C;I cannot lay an egg. but I can criticize it and I know whether it is bad.&#x201D; That is more or less the attitude hon. members adopt. But our difficulty is that in this case an egg must be laid. It must be laid if we wish to ensure that there are not disturbances here in South Africa which will do South Africa tremendous harm. They ask: What about the access to the courts? What about the freedom of citizens? I particularly appreciate the way in which the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) in an authoritative way showed that if citizens in any country opposed the community, certain of the privileges of citizenship were taken from them. That is exactly what is being done here. But the freedom of the citizen and access to the courts are a difficult matter when one is dealing with sabotage and Communism. Then hon. members must realize that one is sitting at the same table with the devil and if one wishes to sit at the same table with the devil, one must have a very long spoon, and this legislation is such a long spoon. But what is more: It is a fact, and we make no secret of it, that if one wants to fight the devil, then one cannot keep to the Queensberry Rules. If one wants to fight the devil, one takes strong measures and one moves away from the normal conventional legislation. This is what we are doing here and we make no apology for doing so. I personally was trained in law and have also studied the principles of the rules of law but our justification is that here we are dealing with an enemy who will use the freedom which democracy offers him in order to destroy us and that democracy. For this reason I am prepared to support this Bill. And for this reason I want to thank the hon. the Minister and the Cabinet for the moral courage they have shown in introducing this legislation and defending it in this House. We shall defend it outside on every platform. I also want to congratulate the staff of the hon. the Minister who have assisted him by supplying information regarding the difficulties being experienced and the loopholes which must be closed, and his law advisers. I say, Mr. Speaker, that I honestly feel that if the hon. the Minister and his staff are armed with this measure, he and they will be able to keep matters quiet and peaceful in South Africa.</p>

<p>There are just two things which I want to ask the hon. the Minister. I have examined this measure and it seems to me that there is one matter which it does not cover. I often go out to Sea Point over De Waal Drive, and I find it noticeable how walls, public buildings and private property are being disfigured. I want to ask the Minister whether this measure covers that, or if the Minister is certain that this measure covers that type of case.</p>

I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that a heavy penalty, an extremely heavy penalty, should be imposed for such an offence, and that we should do it in this way, namely the court should be given the power to suspend half the sentence if the walls are properly restored in public by the persons <span class="col_6333-6334" refersTo="page_0413"/>responsible. If the walls and buildings are properly restored, only half the imposed sentence will be served. But there is another question &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having said these few words I want to ask the hon. the Opposition this. There will still be a number of speakers on the Opposition side.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I will prove it to the hon. the Minister. I want to say this that Communism as we understand it, as the average person in the street understands it, is not the Communism which was the gravamen of the charge in the treason trial. For that reason the people were discharged. That is why I ask the Minister, not in a sense of ridicule but in the sense of constructive criticism, what was the effect of the judgment in the treason trial in regard to Communism? Because the gravamen there was that those people, either individually or collectively, had joined an organization on the basis of the Lenin-Marx theory and the court rejected that. You will remember, Sir, that the professor who was called by the Government to give expert evidence, was completely nullified as a result of the devastating cross-examination by Mr. Maisel. I do believe that the Minister should for the sake of clarity define Communism. I am not satisfied with the present definition. If the Minister is satisfied he must say so. I do believe that that judgment has completely destroyed the existing definition of Communism in terms of the 1950 Act. That is the point I want to make. The Minister can tell me whether I am right or wrong. He can tell me if he intends to change it, or if he does not intend to change it, then I will be satisfied. But I do believe that in the application of banning orders the Minister has used Communism not as it is legally interpreted, not as it has been interpreted by the Judges in the treason trial, but as it is interpreted by the Minister and the Government.</p>

<p>I am not concerned with the <i>Cape Times</i>; the <i>Cape Times</i> does not interest me. It does not in any way influence me in regard to what I say in this House. I say that that man was banned because in the opinion of the Minister he furthered a Communism which only exists in the minds of the Minister and the Government. Nobody knows what this so-called Communism is and it certainly does not tally with the definition in the Act. I won&#x2019;t take that point any further, Mr. Speaker, but I think it is high time that the Minister brought in a definition of Communism in conformity with the judgment in the treason trial and make Communism a little bit more understandable to the ordinary man in the street.</p>

<p>There is another aspect in this Bill which I want to deal with and in doing so I hope the Minister will accept that I want to be constructive and not destructive. I wish to deal with the juveniles which will fall under this Bill. If juveniles are charged under this Act they will have to appear before the Judge of the Supreme Court. I can find nothing in the Act which supersedes the Children&#x2019;s Act as now amended. I can find nothing in the Act which supersedes the establishment of a children&#x2019;s court and what it stands for and <span class="col_6337-6338" refersTo="page_0415"/>the procedure to be adopted when children are charged with any crime. The Minister will remember that the Act was amended in 1960.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I piloted it through this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know, that is why I think the Minister should know something about it. All the Minister is doing in this Bill is to tell the Judges that they cannot sentence a juvenile in terms of certain sections of the Criminal Procedure Act. But the Minister does not in any way supersede the Children&#x2019;s Act. I want to appeal to the Minister to amend this Bill in such a way that it will be very clear that any juvenile who is charged should be tried by the juvenile court in respect of these crimes under this Bill. If he is charged with murder to-day he is tried in the juvenile court. I do believe that where a juvenile is concerned we should continue to have a preparatory examination. You see, Sir, the position of a juvenile is very different from that of an adult. The law which deals with children who have committed crimes has been in existence for 25 years; it has stood the test of time. It has been found a good method of dealing with children. The Minister admitted that when he introduced the amending Bill in 1960. I remember what he said about it. I submit that we should not interfere with the established procedure of dealing with juveniles. If the Minister is anxious to punish a juvenile who is guilty of Communism or sabotage I say that the Minister must not allow his legal brain to be dominated by his political heart. As long as the Minister will allow his legal brain to be dominated by his political heart he will destroy a system in regard to juveniles which I believe is a good and sound system and a system which should not be interfered with. I say it is wrong for a child of tender age to have to stand before a Judge and then to be found not guilty. I am quite prepared to say that no child, White or Black, is going to commit these crimes unless he does so under coercion or unless he is forced to do so by somebody senior to him. I do not know much about the Bantu children.</p>

<p>I do not want to ask him; actually we are very friendly but the Minister will understand. I am dealing with the people in the Cape Western Province. But even in respect of the Native territories I am not prepared to accept that a juvenile will deliberately sabotage or deliberately do anything contrary to the law unless he is coerced or is under some pressure from a senior. It is wrong for a juvenile to be gaoled, because he won&#x2019;t be allowed bail; he won&#x2019;t go to a house of correction, he won&#x2019;t go to a place of safety he will be gaoled. Then he has to wait for his trial and if he is found not guilty&#x2014;as he will be in nine cases out of ten because as I have said, he would have acted under the influence of somebody else&#x2014;you can imagine what effect that will have on him, Sir. The whole purpose of the Children&#x2019;s Act and the juvenile court is to try to make decent citizens of these juveniles and not criminals. I sincerely trust that the hon. the Minister will reconsider the vicious aspects of this Bill in regard to juveniles.</p>

<p>May I, with your permission, Sir, just explain to the hon. member. Under the 1950 Act a list was compiled of all members of the Communist Party. That list is with the Department. All this Bill says is that I may publish part of that list in the <i>Gazette.</i> In other words, an active communist&#x2019;s name can be published in the <i>Gazette,</i> but it stands to reason that the other names will not be published; and I said that in my second reading speech.</p>

I submit that no Government dare ask for such powers if all is peaceful, and I believe he should take the whole House into his confidence either at a secret session or by calling in the Leaders of the Opposition and disclose why he wants these powers, because no man in his sound and sober senses will want these drastic powers for a country where everything is peaceful and quiet.</p>

<p>He obviously has not read the Bill, and evidently, because he did not understand it himself, he gave bad advice to many of the people outside who are so opposed to the Bill. He asked what Communism was and referred to Patrick Duncan and said he was not a communist. I just want to refer him to the definition of Communism in the 1950 Act, where it is set out in sub-sec. (9). [Interjections.] Therefore it is not necessary to reply to him further.</p>

<p>I want to come back, however, to what the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) said yesterday. He attacked the Minister of Information, after the latter had spoken, and accused him of deliberately omitting to read a proviso contained in the Rhodesian Act. I just want to quote from his Hansard, and then I will return to it later. The hon. member for Durban (Point) said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6343-6344" refersTo="page_0418"/>It is strange that he (the Minister of Information) used the words in Section 42, but let us take it their way. The Minister quoted Section 40, and quoted the minimum sentence of not less than five years and not more than 20 years. I say the Minister deliberately stopped at that point, because he knew the next sentence stated &#x201C;provided that if the court is of opinion that there are special circumstances in the case which justify a lesser penalty, it shall endorse those special circumstances on the record of the case and may impose a lesser penalty&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is where he stopped reading the section. Now I allege that he in his turn deliberately stopped reading there and tried to make the Minister appear ridiculous, because that section continued as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the purposes of this section the term &#x201C;special circumstances&#x201D; means special circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence itself, but does not include circumstances peculiar to the offender.</block>

<p>[Interjection.] He now wants to aver that this has nothing to do with the whole section, but it has much to do with the whole meaning of the proviso. It says here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But does not include circumstances peculiar to the offender.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Circumstances peculiar to the offender&#x201D; are his age, his position in life, his health, etc., and those are excluded, but what must be taken into consideration are the &#x201C;special circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence itself&#x201D;. If that is not taken into consideration, then the penalty is &#x201C;imprisonment for a period of not less than five years&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But it can be less.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it can be less. Section 40 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who throws or propels or prepares to throw or propel any article or thing likely to cause damage or injury at a motor vehicle or at any person in or upon such vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for a period of not less than five years and not more than 20 years.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. the Minister quoted. Now the proviso provides that if one throws a pumpkin without it resulting in a riot, the lesser sentence can be considered and the Judge can impose the lesser sentence, but not if it results, as is described in our Bill in Clause 21 (4), in causing general disruption, disturbance or disorder or to promote it. If one throws a tomato or a pumpkin in those circumstances one can be punished and receive a sentence of not less than five years. The hon. member tried to ridicule the hon. the Minister of Information, and I deplore it. [Laughter.] There is a saying that empty vessels make the most noise, and we have seen that here to-day.</p>

<p>One of the arguments against this Bill is that the Minister introduced it at a time when the country is calm and peaceful, and several speakers opposite said that it was not necessary to put that Bill on the Statute Book now. I ask myself why the country is to-day calm, quiet and peaceful. A country is only calm, quiet and peaceful if there is a good government in power, and fortunately it is the Nationalist Government which is in power. If it were the United Party, that would not have been the case. Why did they lose the election in 1948? They no longer cared for the ex-soldiers who had fought the war for them, that war which they are continually accusing us of not having participated in. After 1945 they forgot about those soldiers and did nothing for them. This Government took the necessary steps to help the ex-soldiers. But they also did nothing for the non-Whites, for the Bantu. No housing was provided for them, but this Government provided housing. Now they accuse us of being negrophilists. They did nothing for the Coloured either, except to exploit his vote.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What has this to do with the Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSE</person>:</from>

<p>I am pointing out that the country is quiet and peaceful, and that it is as a result of what was done by this Government for those people whom the United Party did not care for. They did nothing for those people, and that is why they lost the election.</p>

<p>But this legislation is necessary, not because there is peace and quiet in the country, but it has been put on the Statute Book because this Government has vision, something which the United Party never had and still does not have. I want to refer to the Australian Act. In 1950 an Act was put on the Statute Book in Australia called the Communist Party Dissolution Act. In 1950 the position in Australia was also peaceful and calm, and it still is today, and that Act still stands on the Statute Book there. What struck me about that Act is that they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas the constitution empowers the Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth &#x2026;</block>

<p>We also say that we are passing this Act to maintain that position. Then we go further and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And whereas the constitution also empowers the Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect of matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by the Constitution in the Parliament of the Commonwealth &#x2026; And whereas the <span class="col_6345-6346" refersTo="page_0419"/>Australian Communist Party also engages in activities or operations designed to bring about the overthrow or dislocation of the established system of government of Australia and the attainment of economic, industrial or political ends by force, violence, intimidation or fraudulent practices:</block>

<block name="quote">And whereas the Australian Communist Party is an integral part of the world communist revolutionary movement, which in the King&#x2019;s Dominions and elsewhere, engages in espionage and sabotage and in activities or operations of a treasonable or subversive nature, and also engages in activities or operations similar to those, or having an object similar to the object of those, referred to in the last two preceding paragraphs of this Preamble &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then they state the provisions of the Act. Is it not peculiar that in Australia, where the population consists only of English-speaking persons and there is no National Party, such an Act was also passed, and for precisely the same reasons as in our case?</p>

<p>But I want to quote further. Various organizations are banned, and in Section 7 of that Act they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person shall not knowingly&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) become, continue to be, or perform any act as an officer or member of an unlawful association.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then they continue, and in Section 9 they say that if a person continues to be a communist he can be punished. I first want to indicate what makes him a communist. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where the Governor-General is satisfied that a person is a person to whom this section applies &#x2026;</block>

<p>i.e. that he is a communist&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and that that person is engaged, or is likely to engage, in activities prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth or to the execution or maintenance of the Constitution or of the laws of the Commonwealth, the Governor-General may, by instrument published in the <i>Gazette,</i> make a declaration accordingly.</block>

<p>That is, that such a person is a communist. When such a person has been declared to be a communist, he can go to court to show cause why he should not have been declared a communist, and the Act provides that when he petitions the court &#x201C;the applicant shall begin&#x201D;, i.e. the accused person. In our case it is said that we are shifting the onus, which is not true, but there the onus was shifted so that the person who has been named must go to court and he must prove that he is not a communist.</p>

<p>But what is also peculiar is that when such an application is heard, the notice published by the Governor-General in the <i>Government Gazette</i> is accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that this person is such a person. How can he then controvert it? I have said that it is peculiar that the Australian Government also had to pass such legislation.</p>

<p>I want to come back, however, to our own Bill, and in regard to Clause 8 I just want to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister. The Minister explained to us that certain persons who are guilty of certain acts can be placed under house arrest, and he said that the person would then be granted time to go from his house to his work, and back from his work to his house, but that he would remain under house arrest until he goes to work again the next morning. But now I have this problem. What about the professional people, the advocates, attorneys and doctors? We find so many communists among them. Can this measure be applied to them? I believe that it should be improved so that it can be made applicable to them, too. Take, e.g., an attorney who is a communist and is concerned with subversive activities. He is in touch all day with his clients, who are birds of the same feather, and he can influence them when he is in touch with them, and the same applies to the doctor and the advocate. I should like to see the Minister devoting attention to such persons also, so that they may be dealt with. Then there is something I should like to have inserted in Clause 21. Say, for example, an attorney is allowed to attend to his business and he requires funds for subversive activities, and he arranges for one of his minions to steal money for party purposes, that should be regarded as sabotage. But it is not covered by the definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;. I should like the Minister to make provision for dealing with such persons also under the definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with the legal aspects of the various clauses here. We shall have sufficient opportunity for doing so in the Committee Stage. To-day, at the second reading, only the principle is relevant, and I support the principle of this Bill wholeheartedly. I cannot agree with the Opposition and with the people outside who make such a fuss and say that this Bill is so terrible. I have referred to the peace and quiet which prevails in the country, and I say that this Bill is necessary, even though that is the position. It is an unwise person who does not make arrangements for his future or his old age, and it is an unwise government which first waits until trouble arises and sabotage is committed before passing an Act. I want to refer to the fact that feelings are being swept up outside against this Bill, and I want to ask the United Party whether they agree with the persons who are inciting the people outside, and <i>inter alia,</i> with this report which appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 18 May 1962, under the headline &#x201C;Luthuli Calls for Black-White Protest&#x201D;. I find that peculiar. We know Luthuli and we know how in the past the <span class="col_6347-6348" refersTo="page_0420"/>Opposition defended Luthuli when he was confined to a certain area. Here Luthuli writes from Durban&#x2014;and I am glad that after the passing of this Bill he will no longer be able to do so, and I think that the United Party will be equally glad&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ex-Chief Albert Luthuli, the Nobel Peace Prize-winner, called last night for anti-Nationalist Black and White leaders in South Africa to form a joint committee to rouse the country against the Sabotage Bill which, he said, was a grave and most far-reaching threat to civil liberties. Mr. Luthuli suggested that the committee comprise Dr. Jan Steytler &#x2026;</block>

<p>I find it significant that he now mentions his friends. The first is Dr. Jan Steytler and the second is Paramount Chief Sabata Dalinyeba of Tembuland, Transkei. The third is the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff. The fourth is the leader of the party of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), namely ex-Chief Justice H. A. Fagan. Then he also mentions the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Hon. A. van de Sandt Centlivres; Dr. G. M. Naicker, president of the South African Indian Congress; Mr. Japie Basson, M.P.; Mr. Allan Paton; Mr. P. R. Pather, president of the Natal Indian Congress; Dr. van der Ross, of the Coloured Convention Movement; Archbishop Joost de Blank; Archbishop Denis Hurley, Catholic Archbishop of Durban; Canon Zulu; the Rev. E. Mbabane, ex-president of the African Ministers&#x2019; Federation; the Rev. S. S. Thema, the current president of the African Ministers&#x2019; Federation; Mr. Leon Levy, of the South African Congress of Trade Unions; and Mr. L. C. Scheepers, of the Trade Union Council.</block>

<p>But we know that the last-mentioned person definitely does not associate himself with those people, and that he now accepts this Bill. We know that Luthuli is the friend of these people, because I would not appeal to my enemies to support me; I appeal to my friends to stand by me. This report proves that these people all stand together and that all of them defend Communism. One cannot come to any other conclusion, because there are some of these people who are definitely pro-communist and against the Whites.</p>

<p>Much has been said in regard to the question of the onus in Clause 21. The former speaker, the hon. member for Boland, also addressed the Minister on the question of the onus of proof. I agree with the Minister that the onus is not shifted on to the accused, but that the position remains as it was in the past. The unlawful and deliberate act must still be proved. Clause 2 (2) is inserted as a defence, and if a person does not make himself guilty of the acts enumerated in Clause 21 (2), no Attorney-General will charge such a person with high treason. I wholly support this Bill, and I am glad the hon. the Minister has introduced it at this stage. This Bill is concerned with one matter only, and that is to prevent and to combat the activities of saboteurs and agitators and those who want to undermine the authority of the State. It does not concern the National Party; we need not be afraid of opposition. In the past we have always won the elections, and every time by an increased majority. This Bill deals only with agitators and those who undermine the authority of the State. Mr. Speaker, the penalty for murder is death. I am not afraid of the penalty imposed for murder, because I do not intend unlawfully taking the life of anyone. Why should any person then be afraid of this Bill if he does not intend committing the acts described in Clause 21 (1)? Why then be afraid? If a person does not intend committing those acts, then as far as he is concerned the position is as if this section is not contained in the Act. No, this Bill is only intended to prevent these crimes. It is better to place this measure on the Statute Book now than to wait until one day there is trouble in the country and then to introduce such legislation. I wholeheartedly support this Bill and I shall be glad if. the Minister will devote attention to the two points I mentioned and possibly move amendments in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I think that the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down rather typifies the approach of all hon. gentlemen who have spoken from that side of the House during this debate; at all costs avoid talking about the Bill; at all costs avoid any mention of the contents of the Bill; at all costs avoid the arguments which have been put up from this side of the House in relation to the Bill.</p>

<p>That is the clear implication of what he said. Thirdly, he tried to get the hon. the Minister of Information out of the soup, and let us face it: He really is in the soup after his performance here yesterday. He tried very hard to get him out of the soup, but unfortunately for the hon. member he cannot get him out of the soup so far as the Rhodesian legislation is concerned because the hon. the Minister of Information was absolutely wrong. The hon. member tried then to justify some of the provisions of this Bill. He did not specify them, he did not deal with them, but in an endeavour again to rescue the <span class="col_6349-6350" refersTo="page_0421"/>hon. the Minister of Information he referred to an Australian Statute.</p>

<p><i>Ultra vires</i> of the Constitution. On what other ground could it be <i>ultra vires</i>? The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) must appreciate, if he is going to come into this debate, that he must know something about what his friends have spoken about, and they have not spoken about the Bill. Sir, one of the most remarkable things about this Bill has been the manner in which everybody&#x2014;and I do not exclude the Minister here&#x2014;has avoided the contents of the Bill. The first indication that I saw of this being mentioned in Government circles was in <i>Dagbreek en Sondagnuus,</i> and that paper said that a Bill would be introduced which would define and prohibit sabotage and provide for other incidental matters.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>10 May 1962. Sir, the day this Bill was published, on Saturday, it was the headline in every newspaper; you would not find it in a little box like this in a paper like the <i>Daily News</i> which comes out in the evening. Do not let us be absurd; let us appreciate what our facts are. Sir, that is the impression that has been put out by the hon. gentleman, namely that it deals with sabotage. We find the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) saying that 95 per cent of White South Africa is in favour of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Quite right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>95 or 90 per cent of South Africa is in favour of suppressing sabotage; that is quite right but that is not the same thing as saying that 90 per cent of South Africa is in favour of this Bill.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with what the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) said. He said the amendment to the Bill satisfies the Tuckers and the Cadmans. Of course, if it is the right approach it satisfies us all. The hon. member for Klerksdorp then said something which I do not accept. He again thanked the Minister, of course, for having the moral courage to bring in this Bill. The moral courage to do what? To hang children? The moral courage to lock up people without trial for 12 days, with no reasons, and no reasons given by the hon. the Minister when he introduced this Bill; he said that it was rather a useful sort of power. The moral courage to prohibit meetings, Sir? And to prohibit meetings which, as I shall demonstrate, have no connection whatsoever with Communism?</p>

<p>Then we come to the one gentleman who I thought would deal with the Bill, the one hon. member on the Government side who is a practising advocate, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Mr. Nel). I thought he would deal with the Bill, but he did not touch it. I am sorry he is not here at the moment. I told him that I was going to reply to him but unfortunately he had to go away. He quoted the English Malicious Damage to Property Act. It is a great pity that he did not get the Act itself, because if he had he would have found that it was passed over a hundred years ago. He would have found if he had paged <span class="col_6351-6352" refersTo="page_0422"/>through the Statute Book, that two Statutes before, they repealed a number of Acts which provided for hanging for stealing, for hanging for house-breaking, for hanging for burglary, and so on. He would have found that that Bill was passed in the same year as Parliament reluctantly gave up compulsory hangings for all trivial offences, and I think that is where this Bill belongs, so far as the penalties of this Bill are concerned, a hundred years ago. The sort of approach that they had in England then demonstrates precisely what this Bill gives to us here. But I am very sorry to say that the hon. gentleman misled the House. He either did so negligently or he did so deliberately. Because if he had read that Act he would have found that it said that when you are convicted, you are to be given certain sentences at the discretion of the court. The minimum sentence of three years was in the discretion of the court because the court could sentence him to a sentence not exceeding two years if it also imposed a sentence of hard labour or what we call it compulsory labour. Every sentence of imprisonment in our courts to-day is accompanied by compulsory labour. Sir, I am very sorry to be so disappointed by the one hon. learned gentleman whom I thought would deal with the Bill.</p>

<p>Then we had the hon. the Minister of Information. The hon. the Minister talked about the great harm that our speeches are going to do to South Africa overseas. Sir, he was guilty of the worst offence of that kind that I have yet seen in this House. He, as a Minister of the State gets up here and, in a sarcastic way, with guffaws from his followers, says: &#x201C;Of course, this Rhodesian Bill is a very democratic Bill, because it applies in a colony under the British Crown.&#x201D; Does he think that is going to help us at all? The hon. the Minister of Information said that law and order was the basis of democracy. What a wonderful thought! It is not the basis of it; it is the result of it. Law and order stems from the system of government you have, and you have law and order if you have government by consultation, not if you have government by coercion; and you have it where people are satisfied, not where people are terrified.</p>

<p>Before I come to the hon. the Minister of Justice, I want to deal with the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), and I want to say that it is a great pity that when so many pens are slanting on her every word, she should seek to blunt her attack on this Bill by attacking the United Party. One of the things she said was that we had started the process by supporting the Public Safety Act. I want to say that of course we supported the Public Safety Act, and we did so because it provided that if an occasion arose when there was rioting, disorder and arson and a state of emergency had to be declared, then, of course, the Government had to have the power to deal with the situation. The hon. member for Houghton forgets that that measure was passed in the first session of that year, and she sat in this House in the second session of that year as a United Party member.</p>

<p>Sir, the most scandalous thing that has been said here in this debate was said by the hon. the Minister in an interjection to the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman). The hon. member for Zululand asked the hon. the Minister what is going to happen to people who are under house arrest; is a policeman going to stand outside their house all the time? The hon. the Minister said: &#x201C;Wait and see.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If that is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to me, I think it is a very shocking, sad reflection on the Minister&#x2019;s attitude, not only to this Bill, but to the members of this House, to the institution of Parliament, that he can tell us that he is not going to tell us here what this Bill means and how it is going to be applied. He is going to get his men behind him to vote for him blindly as though all was well, and then he is going to do what he wants, and we can see what he does then. Scandalous, Sir. The hon. the Minister made great play of the cross-examination in the Transkei. Does he not appreciate that that cross-examination and that trial would not have been necessary if the system of Bantu Authorities had not itself been so abhorrent to the Bantu people?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that if he does not take these powers we will pay the price as surely as the sun will rise. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if we take the powers without directing our attention at the same time to the root causes, then the price that we will pay will be a police state, because this thing will avalanche. If you do not deal with the root causes, and you have to take powers to deal with the situation, it will grow worse because you have not dealt with it at its source, and you will have to have more and more powers, and I am sure that hon. gentlemen over there will give it to him until they appreciate that it is too late. And then it will be too late.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, the hon. the Minister made one of the most remarkable statements in this debate. He says that the Bill does not deal with freedom of speech. A remarkable statement, Sir. What is the value of the freedom of speech without a gathering at which to speak? What is the point of a gathering if you cannot speak at it, except a social gathering, which was excluded in the original Act, and now the hon. the Minister wants to deal with that as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from><span class="col_6353-6354" refersTo="page_0423"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if I went to a prayer gathering I am sure one of my first prayers would be for the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). The hon. the Minister then said that Clause 4 deals with &#x201C;misbruikers&#x201D; only. And then he said, in relation to Clause 6, that he is going to publish the list in the <i>Gazette</i> now so that people would know who were listed communists; those were his words. Sir, the most remarkable thing of all this is that that list which is referred to does not only contain the names of members of unlawful organizations; it contains the names of members of organizations which are suspected by the Minister of being organizations which might be unlawful organizations. Merely on the suspicion of the Minister their names go on that list, and they might have been a member of such an organization 50 years or 30 years ago, it makes no difference. The hon. the Minister has been less than fair in putting forward this Bill to this House.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another one of the empty tin-cans which the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) left in this House after he had concluded his speech. The hon. member said that if the Attorney-General decides not to prosecute, then the Minister can do nothing about it. Let me lay this at rest immediately. If you look at Section 5 (4) of this Act you will see the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, subject to the laws governing the Public Service, in respect of each area for which an Attorney-General has been appointed, appoint one or more Deputy Attorneys-General, who may, subject to the control and direction of the Attorney-General concerned, do anything that may be lawfully done by the Attorney-General.</block>

<p>Then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any Attorney-General shall exercise his authority and perform his functions under this Act or under any other law subject to the control and direction of the Minister, who may reverse any decision arrived at by the Attorney-General and may himself in general or in any specific matter exercise any party of such authority and perform any such functions.</block>

<p>I hope that puts the matter at rest and I hope that when the hon. the Minister says, as he said, &#x201C;Do you think the Attorney-General would be so stupid as to charge someone for a minor offence under this sabotage clause?&#x201D; he will appreciate that it is not the Attorney-General who makes the decision; it is the Minister who makes it and if the Attorney-General makes a decision and he does not like it he simply reverses it. It is as simple as that. It is not a case of stupidity in any event; it is a question of motive; it is a question as to whether you want to put a man in the dock on trial for his life for a trivial offence and make him prove his innocence. It is a question of motive, it is a question of politics; it is not a question of exercising judicial discretion. And in any event whoever heard of one&#x2019;s rights being determinable at the discretion of an official or at the discretion of the hon. the Minister?</p>

<p>When my hon. leader was dealing with the question of reproducing speeches, he mentioned that it can affect speeches in Parliament and proceedings in court. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comment was &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be childish I want to ask the hon. the Minister to have a look at that clause. There is no way of getting around this; it provides precisely what you may and may not do. It does not exclude anyone from doing anything; and as my hon. leader pointed out this being the later Act, if it does conflict with any former Act, it repeals that Act by implication to the extent to which it says something different. The extraordinary situation that you will now find, just to demonstrate how ludicrous some of the clauses are, is this: If a prohibited person defends someone in court no one can repeat what he said. You cannot take affidavits from a prohibited person because you are then reproducing such a statement. If a banned person is your client and you are in the legal profession, you cannot take a statement from him, and even the shorthand writer in court would commit an offence if he reproduced his statement.</p>

<p>When my hon. leader dealt with the question of gatherings, he pointed out that the Minister in terms of the amendment in Clause 1 of this Bill, was taking the power even to ban social gatherings. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s retort was, &#x201C;Oh, only social gatherings for certain purposes&#x201D;&#x2014;a very interesting remark if one looks at the Bill to see what those purposes are. The purposes for which &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; is to include a social gathering now, are all circumstances where the hon. the Minister can either ban a person from going to the meeting or ban the meeting itself. Why should he want it to be for any other purpose? It was an extraordinary remark for him to have made.</p>

<p>I first thought that there was a misprint in Clause 17 when I read it; I gave the hon. the Minister and the Government the benefit of the doubt, because as that clause stands now, if the Minister is satisfied that there is one person or one organization propagating Communism or that he thinks will propagate Communism, who is &#x201C;connected with Communism&#x201D; in terms of the wording here, then he can ban any kind of meeting anywhere in South Africa. This is a most extraordinary power completely unrelated to Communism. That is one of the worst clauses in this Bill, because the hon. the Minister does not have to apply his mind at all; he could act <i>mala fide</i> if he wanted to. <span class="col_6355-6356" refersTo="page_0424"/>The hon. the Minister can now ban anything at all, completely unrelated to Communism in terms of the Bill. The Minister has not denied it. He has not said that there is a misprint. He did indicate that there was a misprint so far as the minimum penalty of three years is concerned. I hoped that he will tell us that this was also a misprint, but I am afraid that he is not going to say so. Cannot the Minister indicate to us now whether there is a misprint? There is no reply. Very well, I think it is under this clause that the Minister hopes to ban all the meetings on the Parade. I am glad to see the hon. the Minister nod, because then it seems to me that my argument is confirmed, because the hon. the Minister cannot <i>bona fide</i> say that all meetings that will ever be held on the Parade in the future will, in his opinion, be likely to further the object of Communism. Obviously he cannot say that because he does not know who is going to meet. I am satisfied that I can say now that this clause gives the hon. the Minister the power to deal with all gatherings, to ban any gathering, whether it is connected with Communism or whether it is not.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if I thought that the problems of this country were equated in any way to Rhodesia&#x2019;s and this Government was in power in Rhodesia then, Sir, I promise you I would leave it.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the Rhodesian legislation, and much has been said about legislation during the war. I want to say this that the legislation during the war was such that the crime of sabotage under those war measures related to either explosives being used, or it related to the subversion of the state or the derailment of trains, something which is popularly known as sabotage&#x201D;. Where do we find this here? But I want to say something else, that the whole approach even in wartime was quite different. Far from wanting to ban all gatherings in Johannesburg, in the place where the most people can gather, and in Cape Town in the only place where so many people can come together&#x2014;far from doing that, under the wartime regulations there were provisions making it an offence with a minimum sentence for anyone to try and break up a lawful meeting. That was the approach of the then Government even in war time. The hon. the Minister is having difficulties controlling this country, controlling the legitimate grievances of a lot of people in this country, and the hon. the Minister is going to destroy now altogether any means that anyone might have to voice his grievances. My hon. Leader said that the Minister was sitting on the safety valve. The approach of the Minister reminded me of the old farmer who had a young wife and a young foreman. He came in one day and found them in compromizing circumstances on a couch. He did not know what to do and eventually found the solution: He destroyed the couch. That is precisely what this hon. Minister is doing. The hon. the Minister is not interested in the rights of citizens. The right of gathering is the most important of those rights because around it hinge all the other rights, the right of association, the rights of speech, and all the other freedoms which we normally associate with the individual.</p>

<p>Clause 8 was the clause the hon. Minister did not deal with. The contents of this clause which my hon. Leader referred to as giving him the power to inflict civil death, were not referred to by the hon. Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<p>Your Leader referred to all the clauses as civil death clauses.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister did not refer to one of them, as far as I recollect, and under this clause the hon. the Minister can suspend <i>habeas corpus,</i> he can prevent people from seeing their legal advisers, something which happened during the emergency, I might say, Sir, and which I deprecated very much. He can stop people seeing their legal advisers under that clause. He can, under that clause, prevent people from having access to the courts. He can prevent them from doing any act. Will the hon. the Minister indicate to us what precisely he has in mind when the term is used &#x201C;doing any act&#x201D;? Is he going to prevent for instance people who practise the law from having clients of a certain race? He will have the power to do it under this clause. Will he do the same in the case of doctors? He is now given that power, Mr. Speaker. What the hon. the Minister and what hon. gentlemen over there don&#x2019;t appreciate is that democracy, if I can give two equations, can be stated thus: &#x201C;democracy equals the freedom of the individual&#x201D;. If you don&#x2019;t have real freedom of the individual, then you don&#x2019;t have real democracy, and where you have complete absence of the freedom of the individual, you have an absence of democracy. Naturally the freedom of the individual has to be curtailed in certain ways, but it is that fine delicate balance that must be maintained, and this Government is in great danger of putting the balance so far over that we no longer can equat our personal freedoms to a democratic institution in which they are exercised. The hon. the Minister must give this House, and the hon. gentleman who sits on that side of the House, should demand from the hon. the Minister, that he should give the House an explanation as to why he brings in Clause 17, <span class="col_6357-6358" refersTo="page_0425"/>the 12 days detention clause. This is a serious matter, surely, that at the whim, at the instance of the Minister, or a senior official, a man can be detained without trial for 12 days at a time, which can go on and on. Surely that is a most serious matter that any man should be deprived of his liberty when he has not been convicted of any offence, that he can be kept in a police cell for twelve days at a time! Does that not worry the hon. gentleman who sits on the other side of the House.</p>

<p>There you have it. &#x201C;Not at all&#x201D;. I want to deal with another matter, and that is the question of the <i>Gazette</i>, of putting notices in the <i>Gazette.</i> I asked a question the other day, Sir, and it was obvious that in Durban, Bloemfontein and Windhoek, there are no depots of <i>Government Gazettes.</i> If you are not a subscriber, how on earth are you going to know whether you have not been banned yourself? In Cape Town it takes three days for a <i>Gazette</i> to come down. A lot can happen in three days: If you are banned, and you do something you should not do, you can then find yourself compelled to stay in prison for one year, because the courts won&#x2019;t have any option, in the circumstances. Is the hon. Minister going to provide any alternative for the abolition of preparatory examinations? It is an extraordinary thing, Sir, to go to trial for your life and the first time that you know what the evidence is, is when the crown witnesses step into the witness-box. Is the hon. the Minister going to provide any alternative procedure? You see again that so far as juveniles are concerned, no longer can the courts suspend the sentence except from the end of a rope.

The hon. the Minister had the audacity to suggest that the accused is lucky to have the ability under sub-clause (2) of Clause 21 to get out of this. To get out of what? If you accuse a man or a child of a criminal offence, you can now call it &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; and put him in the witness-box and tell him, once you have put him in the dock and have arranged for a trivial offence, that if he does not go into the witness-box he will go to gaol for five years, and he might be hanged, once you have called it &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D;. That is what this amounts to. You accuse him of a trivial offence, and then you say: If you don&#x2019;t go into the witness-box, you will go to gaol for five years. The court has not got any option, that has been taken away from them. In a nutshell that is what it amounts to. What a wonderful gift this is that hon. the Minister is giving to the accused.</p>

<p>Then we come to these words &#x201C;objectively regarded&#x201D;. That is what he has got to prove. When he is forced into the witness-box, then he has got to prove that &#x201C;objectively regarded&#x201D; he did not have any of those intentions mentioned in sub-clause (2). Does the hon. the Minister appreciate what &#x201C;objectively regarded&#x201D; means? It does not mean that it proves that he had the intention. It does not mean that he proves that in fact he had the intention. It means, and I quote from a well-known case&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;It is not necessary for the Crown to prove that he had any want of good faith. It is for him to establish that he had reasonable grounds for his belief&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It amounts to this that whether he did or did not honestly believe, did not honestly intend something, if the Judge feels that he, in the position of the accused, would have felt differently, or he sitting up in his lofty tower unconnected with this, would think that if he were doing what the accused was doing, he would have a different intention, then he will be convicted. In other words he can be convicted without having the required intention.</p>

<p>I have only a few more minutes. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that he is the Minister of Justice. I want to remind him that if he brings in provisions like Clause 21, he brings in a provision which is an inquisition, not a trial in any sense of the word in a court of law as we have always known it in this country. But he is not the Minister of inquisition, he is the Minister of Justice, and I hope the hon. the Minister will remember that. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that he has created a very good impression amongst the legal profession because he has gone away from the ways of his predecessors and he has promised to see the profession right, and the profession appreciates that very much. But I don&#x2019;t think it helps very much for the hon. the Minister now to tie completely the hands of the profession and the hands of the Bench when he introduced a new crime like that.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) must learn once and for all that he no longer makes an impression in this House with his feigned indignation, that he makes still less of an impression on us when he comes with his feigned legal knowledge. He usually enters this House with a book under his arm and he seldom sits here without having a legal book on his bench. He has built up a whole library around his bench, but I do not see him really making much use of it. If he made use of it, he would surely talk more sense than the nonsense he has spoken here this afternoon. By the same token I say that his impetuous, impudent behaviour no longer makes any impression on this House, and least of all his feigned knowledge. <i>Inter alia</i> he made the following nonsensical statement this afternoon: This Bill will even make a criminal of a shorthand writer who takes evidence from a named person in court. That is nonsense. It is not even necessary to answer it because any lawyer will regard it as nonsense. Even the lawyers on his own side have said that this is really the worse nonsense they have ever heard. I do not think the House will expect me to reply. He has also made the nonsensical statement that an advocate will not be able to take a statement from a named person when he defends him. Surely he does not expect one to answer this nonsensical argument either. I think it is below the dignity of anyone with a little legal knowledge to answer such arguments. The hon. member says that all foreign legislation dealing with this matter &#x201C;is related to sabotage&#x201D; and acts dangerous to the State. The same supposedly applies to the War Regulations but not to this legislation. But it seems really as though the hon. member has never read this Bill, because it is after all clear from Clause 21 that we are only dealing with acts which are dangerous to the State and not with other acts.</p>

<p>The hon. member has referred to Clause 8 and said that the hon. the Minister never mentioned Clause 8, but that his hon. Leader mentioned Clause 8. I wrote down what the hon. the Minister said about Clause 8. He specifically mentioned Clause 8 (a) and Clause 8 (b), and he said that Clause 8 (b) gave the Minister the opportunity to issue a warning. He mentioned that clause specifically, but the hon. member states that the Minister &#x201C;did not refer to Clause 8&#x201D;. We had to listen to such nonsense, to such ridiculous arguments for 40 minutes. The hon. member has said for example, with great indignation, that a man can be detained for 12 days and that he cannot be granted bail. Does the hon. member not know that the conditions with which we are dealing here represent a state of emergency? Does he not know that when acts dangerous to the State are committed in certain countries, those countries have legislation which does not allow bail at all? Does the hon. member not know that? Let him please use the legal books he has around him a little, and let him use his commonsense a little, and then he will realize this. He says for example that he, coming from Durban&#x2014;I did not think that all the people in Durban are stupid, but if I am to believe him then all the people in Durban are stupid, because the hon. member has tried to tell us that people living in Durban do not get the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and has asked: How will they know that someone is a named person? Does he not know that under the Act every named person is notified personally by letter by the Minister that he has been named under the Act? Does he not know that the <i>Government Gazette</i> and this particular clause only relate to the list of persons who have been named and not to personal, individual cases? Has he not read the Bill? I do not want to waste any more time on the hon. member because I do not think it is worth wasting one&#x2019;s energy on such a person. I think it is high time that the hon. member should abandon this pompousness of his and that he should learn Afrikaans so that he can understand what hon. members on this side of the House are saying&#x2014;then he may learn something. He has continually referred to hon. members on this side of the House and said &#x201C;they don&#x2019;t seem to appreciate&#x201D;. I want to tell him that we on this side of the House have a better understanding of the position than he has, and it is high time that he should use his commonsense and that he should not come forward with his pompousness and feigned wordly wisdom. He is no longer in the &#x201C;Other Place&#x201D;; nor is he any longer in the warm place, but if he continues like this he will soon finish up in the warm place here. He thinks that because the English Press, the English newspapers, allow him to write a few articles, he is a terribly &#x201C;bright boy&#x201D;. Allow me to tell him that we do not regard him as a &#x201C;bright boy&#x201D;. We think he is a big fool (gek).</p>

<p><span class="col_6361-6362" refersTo="page_0427"/>This debate has been going on for some days and during the course of this debate much has been said about the fact that this measure is of a drastic nature, that the individual is being deprived of his liberties, that South Africa is becoming a police state. And much more. But during this whole debate in the course of which so much has been said about the failings of the Bill, very little attention has been given to the actual principles embodied in this Bill. I think it is therefore advisable that I should once again deal with the actual principles of this Bill. This Bill embodies three principles. The first is the restriction of the freedom of movement of persons who are communists.</p>

<p>Where is that said?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The next principle is the withdrawing of propaganda media from those persons who are communists. The third is the principle of the punishing of acts committed by saboteurs.</p>

<p>The first two principles relating to persons who are communists, are in my submission part of our preventative law. Mr. Speaker, there is a difference between preventative law and punitive law. There are apparently hon. members who do not appreciate the difference between these two types of law, because they have spoken at great length about the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; as though the rule of law must always apply and as though the rule of law is the all important thing. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) already showed yesterday that no-one can really give a definition of this rule of law and that &#x201C;the rule of law is an unruly horse&#x201D;. It suits itself to the person using it and acquires the meaning which he attaches to it. I now want to refer to a decision given by Lord Atkinson in 1917 in the case of Rex v. Halliday which went to the House of Lords on appeal and in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Preventative justice, as it is styled, which consists in restraining a man from committing a crime he may commit but has not yet committed, or doing some act injurious to members of the community which he may do but has not yet done, is no new thing in the laws of England.</block>

<p>I am quoting this because we are always being accused of not upholding the so-called &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. The attitude is adopted that we must first make each act punishable. We must not take preventative action against a person who may commit such an action. One must first define the act and make it punishable, but one may not take preventative measures. I am now quoting this decision to show clearly that this is something which is well-known in British Law. Lord Atkinson for instance gave as an example a case which he took from the year 1360, and he gave a whole series of examples of this type of &#x201C;preventative justice Regarding the principle he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The suffering is inflicted for something much more important than the person&#x2019;s liberty or convenience, viz., for securing the public safety and defence of the realm.</block>

<p>This is the law of England, the mother of the so-called &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; and hon. members persist in making a fuss about the liberties of the individual as though that is the supreme law in all cases, a law which is even above the law of the State. That is why they are making such a fuss about a police state. If they would remember that there is a preventative law and that it has existed for centuries in Roman Dutch Law as well, as English Law, and that it is a well-known principle in both legal systems, they would not need to make such a fuss about this legislation.</p>

<p>In this regard the Opposition are also opposed to two principles of the measure. They say in the first place that the restriction of the freedom of movement of persons who are communists is a terrible thing. They argue as though this principle is of general application. In their arguments they have spoken as though this legislation will affect every person on the street. Mr. Speaker, my submission is that that is not the position, that this legislation will not affect every person on the street. It does not affect every citizen of South Africa. It affects the communists solely and exclusively. I want to try to show that this is in fact the position. It has this limited effect in that it will only affect the communists or persons who further objects of Communism.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, when the Minister considers that a person is furthering the objects of Communism. He can therefore not take any citizen and say: &#x201C;You are now a communist.&#x201D; He must have reason for thinking that he is furthering Communism, and in terms of the decisions of our courts such a person can ask for the reasons why he has been named and the Minister must give him the reasons. He must also hear the other side before he takes such a decision. We have already had various decisions in our courts on this point. Let us turn to Clause 8. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the name of any person appears on any list in the custody of the officer referred to in Section 8 &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, it refers to listed and named communists. And then the clause goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or the Minister is satisfied that any person &#x2026;</block>

<p>and then we have the paragraph which deals with the furthering of the objects of Communism. Then only can he be placed under house arrest. This clause therefore does not affect, as is being claimed, every citizen in the country. That is not the position at all. <span class="col_6363-6364" refersTo="page_0428"/>We can also turn to Clause 7. This gives the Minister the right to prohibit a gathering. At the end of that clause the following unequivocal requirement is also laid down&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If he is satisfied that any activities of any person or organization are furthering or may further the achievement of any of the objects of Communism in the Republic.</block>

<p>During the debate I asked the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) to give us just one case where the Act has been used in the past to deal with someone who is not a communist or who was not furthering Communism. She then gave two cases. She mentioned the case of the banning of the Coloured Peoples Convention. In the first place that Convention was banned under the Riotous Assemblies Act. That is the case she has mentioned. The second case she has mentioned is that of Patrick Duncan. Patrick Duncan does not call himself a communist, but have you ever met a communist who says he is a communist? As I know the communist, he will never admit that he is a communist. What has Patrick Duncan done? He has said that he is a liberal and he says that he is bitterly opposed to Communism.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to link up with what I was saying before the supper adjournment, I just want to repeat that I said that this Bill contained three principles. Two of these are of a preventative nature and the third is of a punitive nature. The first two which are of a preventative nature, are only aimed at communists, as I have said. And I can now tell the House that I have examined every clause in this Bill, and there is not one clause which does not relate to the communists only. I have asked hon. members opposite to give me an example of where the Suppression of Communism Act has been applied to a person who is not a communist. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) then mentioned the case of Patrick Duncan. I should now like to read from the Act what is the definition of a communist. The Act defines a communist as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A communist means a person who admits that he is a communist or who is deemed to be a communist on the ground that he is furthering the achievement of any of the objects of Communism or any act or omission which is calculated to further the achievement of any such object.</block>

<p>We all know that Patrick Duncan has not admitted that he is a communist. He therefore does not fall under the first category. But he is certainly a person who is furthering the objects of Communism. He is apparently the editor or owner of a newspaper, and in that newspaper he is outbidding the communists. He is outbidding them in this sense that he is telling the non-Whites that we must get rid of our present constitutional system, even if violence must be used. That is one of the objects of Communism, namely to get rid of the present system of government by means of violence. He is therefore outbidding the communists and for that reason he is also a person who is a danger to the State, and that is why he can be named under this Act as a person who is furthering Communism.</p>

<p>To come back to the measure now before us, I have said that there is not one provision which does not relate to communists alone, or persons who are furthering the objects of Communism. I want to point out that Communism is even defined in the American legislation which deals with this matter. One of the things which they say the communists do&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is the denial of fundamental rights such as the freedom of speech, freedom of the Press and of assembly and of religious worship.</block>

<p>And then they say that this leads to &#x201C;control of the people who fear terrorism and brutality&#x201D;. That is the description contained in the American legislation. I now find it most tragic that while we are dealing with a measure which only relates to Communism and people who wish to achieve the objects of Communism in South Africa, there are people in our country who can even hold prayer meetings for guidance against the measure we are discussing here. Allow me to read to the House a report which appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> last night. This is what one of the clergymen has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We stand in the shadow in this cathedral &#x2026;</block>

<p>And this is about 100 yards from here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of legislation that could make these words I speak a serious offence.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not know what words the priest has used which can be a &#x201C;serious offence&#x201D; but I do know that he was grossly misleading that congregation. He went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It could be conceived as treason to doubt publicly the wisdom of our legislators and to question with conviction the things they are doing among us.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, it is a mockery of religion for a man to be able to tell such lies from the pulpit. It was the Dean of Cape Town who made these statements. A priest who went on to the pulpit and told such falsehoods. We are here dealing with Communism, with people who negate religion. I say it is a mockery of religion for a clergyman to express himself in this way. If he had a religion. It would <span class="col_6365-6366" refersTo="page_0429"/>perhaps only be the communists who would deprive him of that religion. There is still freedom for every citizen of South Africa. But the communist will be deprived of his freedom. There is still freedom of speech in South Africa. But the communist will be deprived of his freedom of speech. There is also freedom of movement for every citizen in South Africa, but the communist is being deprived of his freedom of movement. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I now come to the next characteristic of this preventative law&#x2014;of the two principles which are of a preventative nature. It is that preventative law can never be applied by the courts, but must always be applied administratively. I now want to read once again from the American legislation because America is held up to us as the country which is the greatest and best democracy in the Western world. What is being done in America in order to meet a similar position? I read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever in the case of any organization the Attorney-General has reason to believe that such organization is a communist political organization or a communist front organization &#x2026;</block>

<p>he must then place that organization on the list. It then goes on to say that the Attorney-General &#x201C;will institute a full and complete investigation&#x201D;. It is the Attorney-General who does this. It is not the House of Representatives or the courts who do so, but an administrative person, the &#x201C;Attorney-General&#x201D;. Every time the &#x201C;Attorney-General&#x201D; is emphasized. The next paragraph says: &#x201C;If, upon an investigation referred to in Clause 1, the Attorney-General determines that the organization is a communist political organization.&#x201D; According to the same Act, the Attorney-General then issues the order that a person is a communist, or he declares the particular organization to be a communist organization. But throughout this Act reference is continually made to the &#x201C;Attorney-General that is to say the administrative person who takes the necessary action. It is very interesting that they have the same system as us, that the Attorney-General, that is to say the administration or the Department of Justice must keep a list of organizations and a list of communists. They then say further that the Attorney-General must demand a proper account of all the moneys received by such an organization. Then &#x201C;in the case of communist political organizations the name and last known address of each individual. This is exactly what the Minister is asking in this legislation. And then &#x201C;it shall be the duty of each organization registered &#x2026; to file with the Attorney-General &#x2026;&#x201D;. And then the forms are prescribed, but this is done by the Attorney-General. These provisions cover the actions of such organizations and their members. We find this theme running throughout this United States legislation. I am only mentioning this, Mr. Speaker, to show that this type of legislation can only be applied administratively, and it is being applied administratively by the greatest democracy we have and which is also the best democracy, according to hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>Then this argument has also been submitted, namely the criticism that this measure is of such a drastic nature. Taking the late Gen. Smuts&#x2019; definition of Communism as a basis, I maintain that any measure which aims at Communism must be of a drastic nature. Allow me just to read what Gen. Smuts has said about Communism&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What makes the new technique of the communists so dangerous is the political disguise under which it advances. War is an open affair, easily recognized for the horrid thing it is. Its new substitute is insidious, secret, working under cover and camouflage.</block>

<p>In the light of these words of Gen. Smuts, I maintain that one cannot take any other action against Communism than drastic action because Communism claims to be innocent while it is actually very dangerous; it always presents itself under the guise of democracy. Acts which are normally minor offences acquire a completely different meaning and content when they are committed in the name of Communism. Allow me to illustrate this allegation with reference to Clause 21. Let us assume that a person damages an electric wire. If it is a normal offence, such a person can be charged under the ordinary town regulations. Or say a person blocks a road: then in the case of an ordinary offence action can be taken under the Road Ordinance. Or if he damages water pipes, he can be charged under the town regulations but if he does so in order to further Communism, this act acquires a different content and meaning. They always act under an innocent guise, while the act has a very much deeper meaning. I therefore say, Mr. Speaker, that this measure must be drastic, because we are here dealing with people who are dangerous to the State.</p>

<p>I then come to the third principle, namely that embodied in the sabotage clause, that is to say Clause 21. Here sabotage is now being defined for the first time as a substantive offence. I say for the first time because even in time of war the definition which applied was not that of an offence of sabotage. These were other ordinary offences with heavier penalties made applicable to them. The definition of offences against the State, such as high treason, sedition, riot and public violence date from as long ago as the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Our definition of the offences of high treason, of violence, of sedition and of public disturbance are so obsolete that we cannot take effective action against this modern technique of the communists. A new offence must be created so that we can counter their technique. I even want to urge the hon. the Minister that he should codify all these offences against the State and have them properly defined anew next year, with a view to the development <span class="col_6367-6368" refersTo="page_0430"/>which has taken place since the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Seeing that the Minister is now trying to define sabotage as a new substantive offence, I want to point out that I spoke to a German friend yesterday in this building. He has just come from Germany: I asked him: How do you act in these cases against Communism? He then said that after the last war they drew up new legislation, and introduced a new definition, and that they took drastic action and that they acted administratively. In this regard we have had the criticism with reference to the definition of this offence that it is too wide and comprehensive. I now want to deal with this criticism, particularly as regards the onus, which according to hon. members opposite has been transferred to the accused. This Clause 21 consists of two parts. Sub-section (1) defines the offence. Then we have sub-section (2) which gives the accused a certain defence. It is quite wrong to speak of the onus being placed on the accused in this case. Seeing that the offence is defined in sub-section (1), the State has to prove everything; the State has to prove that the acts were committed; the State has to prove those acts were committed wrongfully. The State has to prove that such acts were committed wilfully. The State has to prove that the act has had the consequences dangerous to the State which are prohibited. The State must prove all this. The State must prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. There is no doubt about that. But we then come to the provisions of sub-section (2) which hon. members regard as transferring the onus to the accused. That is not the position at all. Sub-section (2) provides the accused with a special defence. When an accused is charged ordinarly with an offence, he can plead and submit the normal defence that he did not commit the offence or that he did not do so wilfully or wrongfully. But in this particular case he is being given a special defence, just as he has a special defence in the case of what we call autrofois acquit or autrofois convict; that is to say, that he has already been accused before of that offence and that he has been found not guilty or guilty. He pleads that as a special defence. So in this case this sub-section (2) gives the accused a special defence. That is what it is and this is not a case where a new onus has been placed on the accused. It gives him a special defence which he does not have in the case of an ordinary offence. The hon. members of the Opposition should be grateful to the Minister for giving the accused this special defence. He did not need to do so. He could have said: This is the offence and the State can prove it. But he has given the accused a special defence, something for which they should really be grateful, if they are so concerned about the fate of the accused in these particular matters. If they are not satisfied with that, let them ask the Minister to withdraw this special defence. This the hon. the Minister will surely do with the greatest of pleasure.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of Clause 21 which I want to emphasize, namely that the weapon used by Communism is never the open, hot war, as the late General Smuts correctly remarked. The aspect of this measure which I went to emphasize is that we are taking action against the fifth columnists, the saboteurs. I want to say at once that all saboteurs are not communists. Nor do we allege that in this legislation. Nowhere is it alleged that every one who is a saboteur is a communist. This particular clause does not say either that one has to be a communist before one is a saboteur and before one can be charged Every saboteur can be brought to court, but we know that most saboteurs are precisely the communists. The Opposition maintain that they have urged throughout that communists should be taken to Court. I want to quote what the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has said in respect of this matter. He has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The main alternative proposal which we made is that any person in respect of whom it can be proved that he has tried to further Communism in South Africa, should be arraigned before the courts, and if it is proved that he was in fact furthering Communism, that man should be found guilty of an offence which is equal in all respects to the offence of high treason.</block>

<p>I now say that one of the activities of the communist&#x2014;not all his other activities but one of them&#x2014;for which he can be arraigned before the courts&#x2014;is sabotage, and how strongly should the hon. Opposition not advocate this measure, because it is in fact carrying out that part of their policy, because part of the activities of the communist are now being made liable to punishment in the courts, and he can now be taken to court and punished by the court itself. I do not say that the Government subscribes completely to the standpoint of the Opposition because, as I have said, preventative law can only be implemented by administrative measures.</p>

<p>I want to deal with two other minor matters. The first is that a charge of sabotage can only be instituted on the authority of or by the Attorney-General himself. The point which this legislation makes and which differs from our ordinary law is this. The Attorney-General has a general authority to charge persons in accordance with his discretion. He can act in any case as he wishes, and any person who acts on his behalf has a general authority. In accordance with that general authority he can act in any case as he thinks fit. But in this particular case the public prosecutor can only act if he has a special authority. That is the difference between the existing law and what is envisaged under this legislation. There must be a special authority in terms of which the Attorney-General or his representative can act. This is being done as a further special protection of the accused. It is to give the accused further protection and no one else, and it is also a fact for which the Opposition should <span class="col_6369-6370" refersTo="page_0431"/>be grateful, if they are concerned about the position of the accused. The other point is that there will be no preparatory examination. That is of course not the position. This Bill does not contain such a provision, but hon. members have adopted the attitude that there will be no preparatory examinations in cases of sabotage. The Attorney-General can order that there should be a preparatory examination; otherwise there will not be one. But it is not eliminated. It still remains part of the procedure which should be followed.</p>

<p>As regards sabotage, the offence which is now being created, I want to deal with the special defence to which I have already referred. This special defence is represented by the fact that the person has already been found guilty of an offence. He has committed the offence, but his special defence is simply that he did not commit that offence with the intention that it should be dangerous to the State. That is the whole meaning of that second provision and if he can prove this, he can be found guilty of a lesser offence, but not by that court. He cannot be punished by that court for a lesser offence. He must be charged again in the ordinary courts and then he can be punished. To say that this is legislation which will result in innocent children being hanged, is simply going too far and is simply being said to arouse feelings. The saboteurs who are used are mostly immature persons, boys who are impetuous and we know that youth is impetuous. It will be the boy of from 14 to 18 years of age who will be used for these purposes, and one cannot say that they cannot be sentenced to death because then they will be used as instruments for sabotage purposes without being liable to the death penalty. The death penalty must also be applicable to them in order to be effective.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I am very sorry about the behaviour of the Opposition. In past weeks and months there has been an atmosphere in this House which had been quite different to that of other years, an atmosphere under which a measure of friendship had grown up between the two sides of the House once again. But since this measure has been discussed, and as a result of the agitation which has been launched in an irresponsible fashion, they have not rendered us a service in this House and least of all the country outside. We are seeing all the consequences and I attributed this solely to the irresponsible behaviour of the Opposition. I hold the Opposition responsible for every blow struck outside this House because of their irresponsible behaviour here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) gave us a full display of his legal learning in replying to the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). Sir, I have always regretted that I did not have the legal training of a lawyer, but having heard the hon. member for Heilbron I thank God that I am not a lawyer, I go further. I thank merciful Providence that he is not my legal adviser.

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not answering questions at the moment and break my trend of thought. It brought the picture to my mind; after the Lord Mayor&#x2019;s Show&#x2014;the dustcart. Sir, he mentioned Mr. Patrick Duncan, whom I think is a foolish young man with a chip on his shoulder. I disagree with his views and everything he stands for, but I have known him all his life. His wife was the daughter of one of my oldest friends, in my undergraduate days. She was married at my home and I gave her away at her marriage. So I know the whole family, and if there is one thing which Patrick Duncan is not, it is a Communist; he is strongly anti-Communist, but all the steps that have been taken against him are based on the Suppression of Communism Act. That shows the dangers of giving powers to Ministers such as this. What is to prevent him from declaring anybody as a Communist, including me? When he replies to the debate, I want to ask him what I have to do to prove that I am not a Communist if he wants to deem me a communist to-morrow? Then the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) said the reason why the returned soldiers voted against us in 1948 was because we did nothing for them on their return. I was Divisional Chairman of the Civilian Reemployment Board which was created by Gen. Smuts very early in the war to put ex-servicemen smoothly back into civil life, and as such I saw all the plans made by all the other Allied Governments, and in no single case did any other Government do as much as we did for our ex-servicemen. In fact, we spent R120,000,000 on them.</p>

<p>With submission, Sir, not on this subject. The point is that if these statements are made, surely I must be allowed to reply to them. But I will drop the <span class="col_6371-6372" refersTo="page_0432"/>matter. I want to reply to what was said by the Minister, and I think you will agree, Sir, if I do so that I am on the Bill. I want to make this statement because I do not think anybody else has done so. The hon. Minister gratuitously dragged Judge Fagan&#x2019;s name into the debate and said that we distrusted them. Of course this is untrue. On 2 September 1939, Judge Fagan stood by Gen. Hertzog and fought Gen. Smuts tooth and nail in regard to the war. During the whole time he was in the House he fought us, but the moment he went out of politics in 1943, who appointed him a Judge? General Smuts and the United Party Government. But I want to go further. I, as Minister of Native Affairs in those days, recommended to General Smuts that he be appointed Chairman of what came to be called the Fagan Commission, and we had such confidence in him that we, the United Party, accepted a large portion of the recommendations of that Commission as our Native policy. [Interjections.] Great play was made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. I. A. F. Nel) about meetings in Hyde Park. He told us that such meetings had to have the permission of the King, as it was his park. Of course nobody had ever had to get permission to hold a meeting in Hyde Park, and what a great safety valve it is! I remember as a young man being impressed when there was a republican on a soapbox and was telling the crowd that they must march to Buckingham Palace to chuck the King out. When he finished his speech and the people were milling around, the policeman on point duty said: &#x201C;Those who are for marching to Buckingham Palace, please form up on the left and go out at Hyde Park corner gate and along Constitution Hill.&#x201D; Of course, had it happened to-day under this Minister, we would have called out the police, the army, the navy, the air force and the local fire brigade plus the Salvation Army for good measure to keep order.</p>

<p>I am going to obey you, Sir, but the point is this; I prepared myself to reply to statements made here which are untrue, and therefore I think I am justified in putting the record straight, but I will obey you and I will drop the subject. Sir, the clauses of this Bill have been fully thrashed out by the lawyers on our side. They have pointed out all the evils and the points we think are unjust and the things we object to have been exposed; and our objections have been ventilated in full, and it is all on record. As I said before, I am no lawyer, so I will not attempt to deal with the legal arguments, because that would merely be repetitious. I want to deal with the psychological side and the effect it can have on the people in this country. I want to probe the effects this Bill will have on the country; the fears, hatreds and resentments this Bill will create on the one hand; and the increases of arrogance, intransigence of contempt for their views of others it will create. My view is that the evil of frustration resentment and feeling of being compelled to bow their head in face of force it will create is just as bad for the people living and working together in the country as is the desire to hold down by force the legitimate opinions of others. [Interjections.] No, I cannot answer questions, because I have only a limited time and I do not want to lose the thread of my argument. Moreover, I do not want to hurt the feelings of that hon. member by giving a crashing reply to the bird-brained questions he is likely to put up to me. Sir, those hon. members who have read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, as I have done twice, will realize the terrible results that unbridled power can have on men who wield it as this Bill gives this Minister. It shows how their basic characters can deteriorate, so that eventually they think that the only right is might. Men who started as quite humane individuals slowly lost all sense of right and wrong through the increase of powers put into their hands. Sir, I will not repeat Lord Acton&#x2019;s remark about power because it has become a clich&#x00E9;; but the fact is that it is as true to-day as it was when Lord Acton, made that statement years ago. The wielding of great power over others affects character, and it turns quite reasonable people into bullies. Sir, all of us in this House loathe slavery, but my objection to slavery is not so much the way the slave was treated in many cases, but the disastrous effect it had on the character of the master of those slaves who had such power over human beings. It often destroyed his character.</p>

<p>My objection to this Bill is that it gives unnecessary and absolute power to one man, and secondly the impact it will be on public opinion abroad once this Bill is put into force. Sir, this Bill plays straight into the hands of our enemies. It will be misreported and misrepresented and distorted, and there is no means of controverting it because basically that is what the Bill is. We cannot afford to create more enemies or to go without friends, or to lose the few friends we still have. Great powerful countries like Russia and America, or smaller powers like Britain and France, cannot do without allies or friends, so how can we hope to do so, and this Bill plays straight into the hands of our enemies.</p>

<p>I am pointing out the general bad effect of this Bill on the country as a whole, which I think I am entitled to do in a second reading debate. The hon. gentleman is so frightened that he asks me foolish questions like this to divert me. In the autumn of my life I have only one real love and pride, and that is South Africa, and anyone who besmirches the name of South Africa, as this Bill does, will be opposed to me. I used to go abroad on holiday every two years&#x2014;Now I haven&#x2019;t been out of Africa for eight years, and why? Because if I get overseas I find that I have to defend this Government.

But the world is beginning to understand the difficulties of South Africa. The behaviour in certain states to the north of us has started to swing public opinion in our favour. For the first time South Africa is starting to come up for air. A short time ago reasonable people overseas had begun to understand our unique problems. But every single time that happens, this lack of understanding of world opinion on the part of hon. members opposite, coupled with the crass stupidity of this Government, leads them to commit some foolish action, and once more it plays straight into the hands of our enemies.

People who are sure of themselves are not always trying to pose as tough guys.

Behold and tremble.&#x201D; For heaven&#x2019;s sake, leave that to the might-mouse characters, and not to Ministers in the Republic. This Bill is an example, in my opinion, of this attitude of showing everybody where they get off. This exhibitionism seems to affect every Minister of Justice in turn. I know of one who is a very kindly, Christian gentleman at heart, but a photograph was taken of him with the cat-o&#x2019;-nine-tails in his hand, and that unfortunate picture went right round the world, not only the communist world but the civilized world.</p>

<p>Very well Sir. This Bill is designed to make everyone realize that they must watch their step, and it puts fear into the hearts of everyone. You can make people conform physically, but not mentally, and that is the danger, because for every action there is an equal reaction. Sir, the Minister can take a bull by the horns, but can he hold it down all night or forever? Sooner or later he must direct his attention to something else, and then the bull will get its chance. That is the position to-day. I was going to make another point, but in obedience to your ruling, Sir, I will drop it. As a member of the late Government of General Smuts during the war, I saw something about sabotage.</p>

<p>Much more dangerous conditions existed then than exist to-day. The Minister tells us that the country is tranquil. No one would suggest that it was tranquil in those days. In fact, there was turmoil and danger. Both psychological and physical sabotage was committed, things like Afrikaans newspapers telling the public about bloodstained uniforms arriving by the trainload; that Smuts was keeping casualties away from the next-of-kin and yet they now say that the English Press is sabotaging the country but was the Nationalist Press not creating alarm and despondency amongst soldiers&#x2019; relatives? What happened in those days? The lives of our leaders and our soldiers were endangered. When Gen. Smuts had to go North, we cabinet Ministers asked him not even to tell us, for security reasons, when he was going, but next day Zeesen broadcast the hour and date of his departure. But with all that we never did anything as drastic as is being done in this Bill to handle sabotage. We even had leaders of the Opposition in those days asking Hitler to give them their Republic, but with all this danger and turmoil in time of war we kept our heads, whereas this Government has made it clear that they are losing theirs. Even in time of peace they lose their heads and panic. They remind me of this old song &#x201C;cold feet I knew besides the Shalimar&#x201D;. Under our emergency regulations in the last war, certain penalties were specified for certain offences, but people knew exactly what they would be tried for and what would happen to them if they did certain things, and the crown in those days had to prove that a man was guilty, and in spite of all the stringent laws we had not a single man executed, but then we had a strong Government which kept its head and did not panic or lose their heads. Sir, the Minister has tried to strike fear into the heart of the public by telling them about the horrors of Communism, and therefore Communism must get short shrift. Sir, he knows that we on this side of the House abhor and loathe Communism. We hate the Communist agitator just as much as we want sabotage dealt with ruthlessly.</p>

<p>Now I want to end where I started. We hate Communism and what it stands for. We have been in the forefront against Communism in peace-time, and we will be in the forefront against Communism when the hot war starts, if any communists try to tackle South Africa, but our hatred of Communism is only equalled by our love for South Africa, and we do not want to see any legislation such as this go through to give South Africa a bad name. There are legal minds on this side of the House which have shown quite clearly that the Government has all the powers at the moment to deal adequately with Communism and sabotage. Then what is the necessity for this Bill? It is part the legislation of this Government which has driven Communism underground, and to a large extent it is the Government&#x2019;s policy which has prepared the ground on which the seed of Communism has germinated and grown. Should Communism ever rule the world, and over-run South Africa, the few Communists that the hon. the Minister has on his list might get the Order of Lenin, Fourth Class; but the Order of Lenin, First Class, will go to the Government because they have provided the medium on which the foul germ of Communism can breed and flourish. In short there opposite sit the people who by their policies have caused Communism to flourish and therefore they are saboteurs of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member must not try to escape. He first said that the powers were available. I then asked the hon. member whether he was satisfied with the powers and he replied that he was satisfied. He is now satisfied with the laws enacted by the National Party Government, but whenever the National Party Government asks for powers of this nature, he is not satisfied. He has just told us: Let the dust settle; give the country a chance to settle down. That is why he is sitting on that side of the House, because he does not want to tackle the problems of the country. That is the very reason why hon. members lost the election in 1948 and since then have always gone backwards, namely because they do not want to face the problems of the country; they want the dust to settle and they do not want to do anything to meet these problems.</p>

<p>I should like to comment more specifically at a later stage on what hon. members have said here, particularly as regards the legal problems. For the moment I think it is as well, in reading this Bill, that we should see it against the background of Communism, because this whole Bill is intended to counter Communism. This Bill has 22 clauses, and apart from Clause 21 the others deal more or less exclusively with Communism. Although Clause 21 deals specifically with sabotage, it is after all clear to us on this side of the House as well as to hon. members opposite, judging by the opinions they have expressed about Communism, that even in the case of sabotage we expect in the light of circumstances that it will be very closely linked with Communism. For this reason it will be as well if for a moment we analyse Communism and our attitude as well as their attitude towards it, and then thereafter ask whether it is necessary and desirable to give the Minister and the Government special powers to meet this threatening danger. We know that the world struggle over human rights, and the right of self-determination was actually aimed at colonialism, but this cry and this struggle against colonialism have given Communism and Russia a wonderful opportunity to extend their ideology. Particularly in Africa it has developed into a competition between the East and the West, and the circumstances prevailing in Africa particularly to a large extent favour Russia with her ideology. In Africa, with her immature peoples, there is a fertile field for that ideology. It is the easiest prey for Communism to be found anywhere in the world, and in the same way here in South Africa where we have a large number of politically undeveloped people, we find that the soil is very fertile for the spreading of that theory. I must admit that the theoretic doctrine of Communism does not have so great an attraction for the Natives of Africa, but what is in their favour is the fact that they flourish where chaos can be created, and it is the easiest thing in the world to create confusion and chaos amongst the undeveloped peoples. It is for this reason that we in the first place must prevent them being given the opportunity to create confusion and chaos because this is part of the tactics of the Communist. In South Africa the struggle of Communism is not so much aimed at the apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa. Oh no, Communism is aimed at the White man in South Africa, as well as elsewhere in Africa, As a result one would have expected the West to be inclined to defend the White man in Africa, particularly seeing that there is such a numerical disparity, but unfortunately we do not find that to be the position. We do not find this because there is a competition in Africa, for political and economic reasons, and hon. members must realize that we are in the position to-day that we must face this danger alone. As a result of world circumstances we cannot expect much assistance from other countries in the world in our struggle against Communism. We must realize that we in South Africa in effect stand alone against that danger, and it is for this reason that the time <span class="col_6379-6380" refersTo="page_0436"/>has come when we should rather throw off the political yoke for a while and judge objectively and decide what is best and what we must do to meet this danger. Communist propaganda is being spread recklessly throughout the world, and they are thereby removing all racial distinctions and identity, they are bringing about revolution and by so doing establishing a world state. The undeveloped peoples of the world and particularly of Africa, as I have said, are excellent prey for Communism, and we stand alone in this struggle. The United Party, the Opposition, have on occasion expressed themselves very strongly against Communism. The hon. member who has just spoken has expressed himself just as strongly again to-night, but his predecessors particularly did so as well. They are opposed in principle to Communism; they have told us that on various occasions. The hon. member for Green Point has said: We hate Communism; we despise the communists as much as anyone else. But how can we reconcile this attitude of theirs with the attitude which they have adopted in this House towards this Bill?</p>

<p>They rise here and say: &#x201C;We are opposed to the communists&#x201D;, but when we tell them: &#x201C;Come and be our brothers in arms and let us co-operate to fight that danger&#x201D;, they refuse to do so. Hon. members opposite know what developments there have been in this country hitherto, and they must know that the people of South Africa want this legislation. If that were not so, the Government would not have become ever stronger since 1950 and have gone from strength to strength. They must realize to-night that they have had a card hung around their necks, to the effect that they have fought in support of Communism in South Africa. That is the only inference that can be made outside from the attitude adopted by members on that side of the House. That card will be hung around their necks; it is ready to be hung around their necks. Who are their comrades; who are the people for whom they are fighting to-day? These are the friends, the supporters and the advocates of Communism. That is why I can understand that the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) originally wanted to act differently to the way he is now acting.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>In the past the United Party said that we were going too far. They said that we were violating human rights and that we were destroying democracy. I now want to put this question to-night: Let us assume that there is a measure of truth in that allegation which they have levelled at us, namely that human rights are being violated and that democracy is being destroyed. Then I want to ask them whether for the sake of this old doctrine we must see South Africa or any other country of the world being undermined and subverted by elements who know no rules and whom we simply cannot fight by using these old doctrines of which they are now speaking? If one is going to fight a man who knows no rules, then one cannot use kid gloves. One cannot fight with bare fists against a man who is prepared to hit one with a chopper. That is the position in which we find ourselves to-day as regards the communists. These people have no conscience; they know no rules by which they fight and we must so arrange matters that we can fight and that we will have the best chance of winning against this dangerous enemy. Their previous leader, the late General Smuts, expressed himself strongly against Communism. I once again want to refer hon. members to what a member of their party has said, just to show how strongly they feel about Communism. It is precisely for this reason that I cannot reconcile what they say with what they are doing. I want to refer them to what was said in this House by the hon. Senator Jordan, the previous member for Rondebosch, in 1950. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A communist is someone who bites the hand that feeds him with carefully poisoned fangs. A communist is someone whose aim is with hostile communist premeditation to endanger the safety and the independence of the State and to replace it, if he can, with the dictatorship of the proletariat.</block>

<p>I have no fault to find with this statement; I associate myself with the remarks of the hon. Senator. But I assume that hon. members opposite also associate themselves with these remarks, and if they do so, they cannot adopt the attitude to-night which they have adopted this whole week. According to the remarks made by the hon. Senator Communism is actually equivalent to high treason. Their actions are not in line with their statements. I have said that a communist has no conscience and knows no rules. We must find means whereby we can fight effectively against this type of vicious underhand method which we find to-day amongst the ranks of Communism, not only in South Africa, but throughout the world. Hon. members have spoken of human rights. Human rights? Is it right to grant a communist human rights? He has no claim to human rights. A communist in South Africa must be destroyed at the outset; it does not matter what methods are used, no matter how barbaric my methods, as long as I succeed in smothering Communism in South Africa at birth. I grant him no human rights, and I am prepared to fight him without rules.</p>

<p>I should like to discuss the most important clause, namely the sabotage clause, as hon. members have named it. I am referring to Clause 21. We have had a great deal of discussion in this House on that clause, and I should now like to submit a legal argument; <span class="col_6381-6382" refersTo="page_0437"/>I particularly want the hon. member for Germiston (District) to listen to this. I am certain that he will comment on it. I have an idea that he and I speak more or less the same language when we discuss these matters. I should like to take a great deal further the argument which the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) raised here for the first time, namely that the allegation which has been made in this House hitherto to the effect that the onus is being shifted under Clause 21 is completely incorrect in the popular sense of the word. Hon. members may interpret it is this way, but according to the normal interpretation of the removal of the onus it is not correct. I should like to try to prove this submission. Under sub-section (1) of Clause 21 the Crown has to prove that an act has been committed which endangers the safety of the State or of the public&#x2014;there are a series of sub-sections&#x2014;or law and order, to put it briefly. In the first place the State has to prove that an act has been committed. In the second place the State has to prove that a wrongful or an unlawful act has been committed, and in the third place the State has to prove that that act was committed wilfully. This act must be equivalent to an attempt to damage those things which are referred to in sub-section (1). I should like to make it quite clear, and I should like hon. members to repudiate my submission if they are able to do so. After sub-section (1) has been complied with, there is an offence <i>per se,</i> namely that after the State has proved that an act has been committed, that it was a wrongful act and that it was committed wilfully, then it is an offence. Sub-section (1) does not provide, as is done in normal circumstances, that anything will be accepted as being for the accused to repudiate. I should like to refer briefly to sections which make provision for the transferring of the onus in the popular sense of the word. Section 9 of Act 10 of 1940 dealing with fisheries provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever any boat has been used in connection with any offence under this Act, any person who was the skipper of such boat at the time when the offence was committed shall be deemed to be guilty of such offence, unless he proves that he did not commit such offence.</block>

<p>In other words, if such circumstances are found to exist, then the other circumstances are accepted as being proved, and then there is an onus on the accused to refute this assumption. In sub-section (1) of Clause 21 nothing is assumed at all. The proving of all the essential requirements of an offence rests on the shoulders of the State and there is nothing which is simply accepted. I want to give another example of the ordinary method of shifting the onus. We find this in Section 170 of the Water Act. Here it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who, without lawful right or authority, the proof whereof shall lie upon him&#x2014;interferes with water &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x201C;Any person who without lawful right or authority&#x201D;. It is essential that this act should be committed without lawful right or authority, but it is stated specifically that the State need not prove this; the State accepts that the person concerned does not have any lawful right or authority, and it rests on the accused to prove that he does in fact have such lawful right or authority. Mr. Speaker, sabotage, as defined in Clause I and which, as I have said, is an offence <i>per se,</i> an offence in the sense for which provision is made in the Rhodesian legislation&#x2014;damaging property, arson, etc., etc.&#x2014;has a peculiar characteristic. We know that here we are providing for a very serious offence. We realize that the offence for which we are making provision and which differs from the offences to which reference is made in the Rhodesian law, which hon. members apparently prefer, has a peculiar characteristic; it has this characteristic that there is a psychological intention in the mind of the accused to harm the State, to create disorder or public disorder. The person who commits the act has a particular psychological characteristic. Apart from this, we want to make it a serious offence, and that is why we are introducing sub-section (2) which actually gives the accused an opportunity when he is charged under subsection (1) to get out of his difficulties more easily than he could otherwise have done. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition hit the nail on the head very well. He said: &#x201C;The minimum penalty of five years and the possibility of the death sentence for doing certain acts which might be of minor importance in the absence of specific motives, and embarrassing the accused by placing the onus on him to prove the absence of that specific motive &#x2026;&#x201D; I think that I am quoting more or less correctly what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said. I read the last sentence again: &#x201C;And embarrassing the accused by placing the onus on him to prove the absence of that special motive.&#x201D; But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows after all full well that in no criminal offence is it the responsibility of the State to prove motive. He now wants to create the impression by the allegation he has made that a responsibility rests on the State to prove motive; now the State is not doing so and the State is placing the onus on the accused to prove the absence of motive. I think the lawyers in this House are aware of the circumstances, but just for the sake of other hon. members, I want to read what Gardiner and Lansdown have to say about motive&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A motive is that within the mind which moves the will to a particular process; that which induces a person to direct his will towards the attainment of a particular result.</block>

<p>I want to tell hon. members that if they read sub-section (2) of Clause 21, they will see that that is exactly what is meant there. In sub-section (2) provision is made, as the <span class="col_6383-6384" refersTo="page_0438"/>Leader of the Opposition has correctly said, for the motive, for the object which was in the mind of the accused. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An unlawful act cannot be excused on the ground that it was committed under the influence of a good motive or a reasonable belief that the conduct is morally justifiable, nor can a man disprove the presumption that he intended the natural consequences of his act by showing that the motive of his conduct was unassociated with the result thereof.</block>

<p>In other words, it does not matter to the court what the motive underlying the act was. Here it is being made clear that it is not necessary for the State to prove motive. If it was an unlawful act, if the man did not have the right to commit that act and if it is proved that he did in fact commit it, and that it was he who did so, he is guilty of an offence. What his object was, has nothing to do with the whole matter. It is quite wrong to say that here we have a transferring of the onus from the State to the accused. As I have said, in sub-section (2) of Clause 21 the motives which may possibly be envisaged and also the motives which must be present for the purposes of sabotage, which we want to regard as a very important offence, are set out clearly. As we see sabotage, it is very clearly related to high treason. If hon. members will look for example at the definition of high treason they will find that high treason is defined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">High treason is committed by those who with hostile premeditation disturb, harm or endanger the independence or security of the State, or who attempt to make active preparations to achieve this object.</block>

<p>I think hon. members will agree with me that sabotage, in the sense that we see it and in the sense for which we are making provision, is very closely related to high treason, particularly when one keeps in mind the state of mind of the accused or the psychological background in the mind of the accused, with reference to sub-section (2). It is for this reason that we regard sabotage as a serious offence. Hon. members opposite have raised very strong objections to the fact that there is supposedly a transferring of the onus. I assume that by this they mean that the onus should have rested on the State to prove what was actually the motive or the intention of the accused. But what did hon. members want to do in 1950? They were prepared to regard any communistic action as high treason in 1950. They were prepared to go further; they were prepared to say: We place the entire onus on the accused. Now hon. members come and they make a terrible fuss because in the first instance there is supposedly such a removal of the onus and that it is such a terrible thing to do. May I just read to hon. members what Senator Jordan said at that time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In proper circumstances and under proper proof to the satisfaction of a Judge of the Supreme Court I would hang him.</block>

<p>Here he is referring to a communist. This is what they said in 1950&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are hon. members opposite squeamish about the death sentence if it were imposed by a Judge in circumstances which a Judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa felt to be proper and felt to be a warranted sentence? We know the answer. It is not that they are squeamish; of course not, but it is not Communism only that this Bill aims at. It is not Communism only with which this Government is concerned. This Government aims at the destruction of democracy itself.</block>

<p>This is the old story which they sold in 1950. This is the old record which is being played once again to-night, the same old record. But let us leave that. I do not want to enlarge on that. I think there is sufficient proof in this country that democracy has not been interfered with in the least since 1950, but that the 1950 Act had only one object, namely to protect them as well as us against the danger of Communism. That was why I read this extract, and I now want to read a little more from the speech by Col. Jordan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Government aims at the destruction of the democracy, and it is for that reason that they rejected &#x2026;</block>

<p>and now hon. members must listen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it is for that reason that they rejected a proposal, the very serious and brave proposal made by the Opposition on the Select Committee to define Communism as a crime of high treason and to treat it as such. Could we have gone much further than we did? In fact we did. As the hon. Acting Leader has said, we went even further than that. In a crime of the gravity of high treason, we shifted the onus of proof, from the Crown to the accused.</block>

<p>These were the proposals made by hon. members opposite in 1950. How can hon. members expect us and the country to take any notice of them? In 1950 they wanted to regard Communism as high treason and to place all the onus on the accused. Now they are coming and making a big fuss.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? I want to ask the hon. member whether it is not the position that in the legislation which the United Party proposed on the Select Committee at that time, in 1950, the suppression of &#x201C;Communism&#x201D; was in fact carefully defined.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>That may be so, but that has nothing to do with my argument at the <span class="col_6385-6386" refersTo="page_0439"/>moment. I repeat, and I want to refute this idea once and for all: Sub-section (1) provides for an offence of sabotage and subsection (2) of Clause 21 does not embody a removal of the onus; it is merely an opportunity which is being given because we realize that this must be regarded as a serious offence and because we realize that it is subject to heavy penalties. That is why we want to make special provision so that innocent people will not be found guilty. For this purpose sub-section (2) is being inserted in the legislation and further provision is being made in Clause 21. I therefore say that the onus to prove absence of motive only must be seen as a safeguard for the accused.</p>

<p>But I should like to refer to further subsections of Clause 21. In Clause 21 there is provision that there will not be a preparatory examination. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has referred to the fact that there will not be a preparatory examination, and he has raised very serious objections to this. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said that we are now depriving the accused of the right to know in advance what the charge is and what the details of the charge against him are. But with respect to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, I want to say that that is certainly not the object of a preparatory examination. The object of a preparatory examination is not to give the accused an opportunity to better prepare his case. The object of a preparatory examination is <i>inter alia</i> the following as can once again be seen from Gardiner and Lansdown&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The purpose of the preparatory examination is that in a case which by reason of its magnitude and/or of the previous criminal history of the accused appears to the public prosecutor to be one which ought not to be summarily dealt with under the magistrate&#x2019;s jurisdiction; there shall be recorded all such relevant facts as will enable the Attorney-General to decide as to the manner in which the case shall be dealt with &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is one of the objects of a preparatory examination.</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, but that comes later. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and if it might be dealt with in the magistrate&#x2019;s court under ordinary or increased jurisdiction, or whether it is one proper for trial before a court of the regional division or in a superior court.</block>

<p>That is the object of a preparatory examination, and the fact that the accused derives any benefit from it is merely incidental; it just happens to be so. It is a privilege, not a right, which the accused has. But I should like to agree with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that this is a very important point, and I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that I realize that in the case of a preparatory examination there are great advantages to the accused because the accused then gets all the evidence that will be led against him later in the higher court and that when the matter is referred directly to the higher court, he does not have the opportunity to obtain these details. Later in Clause 21, that is to say in sub-section (3) (e), provision is made that the procedure of the magistrates&#x2019; courts will be applicable in the case of a trial in the Supreme Court without a preparatory examination. I think I can say without hesitation that it is the desire of all of us, and certainly the desire of the Minister as well, that we do not want to punish innocent people. I should like to see&#x2014;this can perhaps be done administratively&#x2014;that better provision should be made and better opportunities created to acquaint the accused with the actual charge. In the case of a magistrate&#x2019;s court hearing, as it will be in terms of this clause, a charge is made and the defence is entitled to ask for certain details, but it has been our experience that the details are often very meagre, and not nearly as complete as the position in civil cases. As a result of the fact that there will be no preparatory examination, I am aware of the fact that the accused can be harmed thereby. This is not a right which he can claim; it is merely incidentally so, and I think it would be a good thing if perhaps administrative provision could be made for the accused to obtain more information regarding the factual position in respect of the charge facing him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? Is his idea that he should be given facts or that he should only obtain information regarding what the charge is?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not think that we can think of the evidence being made available to him. But I think that what we can try to do is to place him in the same position, in the same circumstances as one finds in a civil case, in other words, where one can obtain more details regarding the factual allegations. But in any case, in civil cases we are after all not entitled to evidence; we can only ask the other side for the factual position.</p>

<p>I want to conclude and in conclusion I want to say that the circumstances which we are creating here differ completely from those for which provision is made in the Rhodesian legislation. We are doing more or less the same thing in a different way, but I make bold to say that the way in which we are doing it here, although it is perhaps a long definition of an offence, is far more effective than what has been done in Rhodesia. In Rhodesia they are also trying to make sabotage an offence and to punish it accordingly, but sabotage is connected with an ordinary offence for which a man can be fined 5s. or &#x00A3;1 or &#x00A3;5, and a heavy penalty is imposed on that offence. We do not want to do that. We want to distinguish between sabotage where the particular psychological <span class="col_6387-6388" refersTo="page_0440"/>characteristic is present from the ordinary offence when the same type of offence is committed. I think that this will be far more effective than the Rhodesian legislation and I think that for this reason we can be grateful for this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) should have considered the attitude of the United Party since 1948 in greater detail before making the speech which he has just made. It must be quite obvious to any impartial listener that the hon. member on the one hand made out a case in his own mind for saying that the United Party is not against Communism, and then on the other hand he made out a case to indicate that what the United Party wanted to do was more severe than what the Government does. I think the hon. member has got to make up his mind. Those who have been in this House since 1948 and before that will know full well&#x2014;and I think if we want anybody to give evidence in that regard, I could call on the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) who was a member of the Opposition in those days, and he also said during this debate, that he is perfectly satisfied that there is nobody in the Opposition benches who is in favour of Communism. So it is quite clear that a lot of what the hon. member for Ceres had to say was intended for those outside. It was not a serious contribution, for no one could take the hon. member for Ceres seriously if he intended to convey in a serious way that the Opposition of the day is in favour of Communism.</p>

<p>Now we come to the question of what is in this Bill, that has nothing whatsoever to do with Communism. Let us deal with that for a moment. The hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E.

I am going to reply to that presently, but before I do so, I think it is important that we should consider those thousands and thousands of workers in South Africa who are not communists, but who can fall foul of Clause 21, the sabotage clause. They have nothing whatsoever to do with Communism, but they can fall foul of this clause. I think it is well that this case should be put. I only regret that I am not a lawyer. It is quite possible that some of the points that I am going to make the Minister will be able to destroy from a legal point of view, but I want to put it to the hon. the Minister also that there are thousands and thousands of workers in South Africa who are not lawyers and their problem is to know whether they are doing right or wrong in supporting their trade union if that trade union were to indicate that it is desirable to have a strike.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>For the benefit of the hon. the Minister who has interjected, I want to say that the Minister is not the only one who had an interview with those people. I also had an opportunity of talking to them, after they had seen the Minister, and I will deal with the contention that he has the support of these people presently. Don&#x2019;t let us be misled by what has appeared in the Press, and don&#x2019;t let the hon. the Minister believe that because he has spoken to some leaders whom this Government were very much prepared to condemn I think only recently, because then the hon. Deputy Minister of Labour said &#x201C;Who are these people?&#x201D; when they objected to the amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act. The Deputy Minister then said that one need not take any notice of them. These are the same people referred to by the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Brits. So don&#x2019;t let the Minister of Justice indicate that he knows what all the workers in the Republic think in regard to their future activities in terms of this Bill. I want to make that quite clear. It is not what the hon. the Minister has promised the trade union movement that I am concerned about, but what is in this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>You see, I did not go to the Press to make a statement about what happened after I have seen them.</p>

<p>You see, Mr. Speaker, I want to put the case to the Minister step by step because I do not wish to create a wrong impression, and I think that the fact that the Deputy Minister of Labour is here is going to be of assistance too. I am only sorry that the Minister of Transport is not here because he comes into this thing as well. I want to try and put the case to the Minister so that the Minister when he replies can indicate quite clearly and exactly what it is that he had in mind when he introduced Clause 21. The first thing is that I think we have got to do&#x2014;we have got no option&#x2014;is to go through some processes that happens in ordinary everyday trade unionism when there has been a request for an increase in wages&#x2014;I take that as an example. I think, Mr. Speaker, you will allow me to develop that point because it is important in relation to Clause 21 of this Bill. The first thing that happens, and here the workers come into the picture, is that they have got to be members of the trade union movement, they have to be present at a branch meeting where they ask their delegates to put forward a resolution to an annual conference for an increase in their wages. Now I relate this to something which must be fresh in the memory of all members of this House. As recently as two months ago there was what I referred to as a strike by members of the artisan group in the South African Railways. Those artisans had met and had put forward a normal request for an improvement in their grading and wages. This had gone to their conference and from their conference it had gone to the Minister of Transport. The Minister of Transport had turned down their request, and they then had received from their workers the necessary mandate to take further action.</p>

<p>Now that strike is something that is defined in the Industrial Conciliation Act, and I want to read this portion so that hon. members will realize that when you think in terms of the sabotage clause and you think in terms of what a strike means there are points of similarity. So you will get to understand why I say that the workers will not be in a position to know whether they are doing right or doing wrong if they are in future, as this Bill is now, asked to take part, to give their support to a strike action. The definition of a &#x201C;strike&#x201D; reads this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Strike&#x201D; means anyone or more of the following acts or omissions by anybody or number of persons who are or have been employed either by the same employer or by different employers&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the refusal or failure by them to continue to work (whether the discontinuance is complete or partial) or to resume their work or to accept re-employment or to comply with the terms or conditions of employment applicable to them, or the retardation by them of the progress of work, or the obstruction by them of work; or</li>

<li>(b) the breach or termination by them of their contracts of employment,

<p>if&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) that refusal, failure, retardation, obstruction, breach or termination is in pursuance of any combination, agreement or understanding between them, whether expressed or not; and</li>

<li>(ii) the purpose of that refusal, failure, retardation, obstruction, breach or termination is to induce or compel any person by whom they or any other persons are or have been employed&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(aa) to agree to or to comply with any demands or proposals concerning terms or conditions of employment or other matters made by or on behalf of them or any other person who are or have been employed; or</li>

<li>(bb) to refrain from giving effect to any intention to change terms or conditions of employment, or if such a change has been made, to restore the terms of conditions to those which existed before the change was made;</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>that is the definition of &#x201C;strike&#x201D; and I think the hon. the Minister will agree that with that very wide definition of what a &#x201C;strike&#x201D; is, if we have got to a point that negotiations have broken down with the employers and strike action has taken place (and here I want to refer the hon. the Minister to what was said by the hon. Minister of Transport in relation to the activities which in terms of this definition of &#x201C;strike&#x201D; were being conducted by the artisans) in the form of their go-slow strike, or work to manual strike. The Minister of Transport said that he was satisfied that those workers were guilty of an illegal act, that in terms <span class="col_6391-6392" refersTo="page_0442"/>of existing laws they were acting unlawfully. Then we come to the Bill before us now and we find in Clause 21&#x2014;&#x201C;any person who commits any wrongful and wilful act &#x2026; Now I want to say at once that I do not know what legal provision the hon. the Minister of Transport had in mind when he said that the existing laws do make it impossible for transport workers to strike. The point I want to make is simply that the Minister of Transport considered that that strike or the threat of strike by railwaymen was an illegal act. That was his contention in terms of the existing laws. Therefore, if that is so&#x2014;and it is for the Minister of Transport to convince the Minister of Justice of the ground for his allegations, which I assume are well-founded&#x2014;then in terms of this Clause 21 any person or persons &#x201C;who commit any wrongful and wilful act&#x201D; can fall under this Bill. Because it would be a wrongful and wilful act if they took strike action knowing it to be wrong. The Minister of Transport says that it would be an illegal act. Now they take that action in furtherance of their claims for an improvement in wages or whatever it may be. What happens then? They may in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act be found guilty of some crime or other. They may be guilty of breaching the provisions of that Act. But now this Bill goes a step further and, as I understand it&#x2014;I am speaking subject to correction&#x2014;the strike action that has been decided upon by these members acting in the belief that their action is not illegal, that they are entitled to strike, acting on that belief, then coming to this Bill, where are we? But perhaps I should first deal further with the Industrial Conciliation Act and put the position as it would appear to any person who reads the Act as I have done. The &#x201C;work to manual&#x201D; was the name given to the &#x201C;go-slow strike&#x201D; which was instituted, and in the Industrial Conciliation Act we get these words &#x201C;the retardation of the progress of work&#x201D;, if &#x201C;the purpose of such retardation is to induce or compel &#x2026;&#x201D; the Minister to agree to an increase in wages. That is what they have done. And when I turn to Clause 21, I find&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), any person who commits any wrongful or wilful act &#x2026; endangers the free movement of any traffic on land or at sea or in the air &#x2026;</block>

<p>I am not accusing anyone. If that is the effect of this Bill, then that is what I wanted the Minister to say, and that is what I want the workers to know. That is precisely what I am getting at. That person will be guilty of sabotage unless he can prove, &#x201C;objectively regarded&#x201D;, that such strike action was not committed with the intent to cause or promote general dislocation, disturbance or disorder. Now what happened in regard to that go-slow strike, or that &#x201C;work to manual&#x201D;? Was there not general dislocation? Was there no disturbance? Was there not disorder? What have we got then? We have got these people who believed in terms of the existing law, as far as they were concerned, that although the Minister of Transport said that they were committing an illegal act, they thought they were entitled to strike action. Now under this Bill such people can be found guilty of sabotage.</p>

<p>You see, Mr. Speaker, I do not want the trade union movement to be protected against myself; I do not want them to be protected against anyone. I want them to be protected by the law, not what the Minister thinks the law means, not the assurances <span class="col_6393-6394" refersTo="page_0443"/>which the Minister gives to them. I say that the law should make it abundantly clear that the ordinary, normal trade union activities of trade unions in the Republic will not fall foul of sabotage. I want to ask the Minister another question. In terms of Clause 21 when does an illegal strike become sabotage? The Minister may say it can never happen, that you can have an illegal or a legal strike which can bring about all of the things which Clause 21 deals with and that will not be sabotage. I hope that before the Minister replies to this debate, one of his colleagues will get up and say what the amendment is which the Minister is going to introduce at the Committee stage to safeguard the interests of the trade union movement, so that we will have an opportunity before the second reading is passed of understanding what the Minister is getting at. Why can&#x2019;t we go a step further and say to the Minister: Withdraw this Bill so that we will know what you have in mind in regard to the trade union movement before you ask us to vote for the second reading.

<p>Let the Minister of Information tell me what this proposed amendment is. I will take the matter a step further.

<p>That was exactly what I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>That was what the Minister told them. But what is the Minister going to do about those trade unions which have been taken under the wing of the Trade Union Council? You see, Sir, we have had an appeal from the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) supported by the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) that it should be the objective of this Government and of this Opposition to get as many of the non-Europeans, the Bantu particularly, to come on to our side in this fight against Communism. I think I can say that is the wish of the Minister also that he would like to see as many Bantu supporting the Government and the Opposition in this fight against Communism. I ask the Minister this straightforward question: Does he want the Bantu generally to support us in our fight against Communism?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Of course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Now the Minister will know that at a recent conference the T.U.C. decided that in the interests of the trade union movement and to enable them to give a helping hand to the Bantu trade unions who are not recognized in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, of getting properly organized and accepting a responsible part in the trade union movement, they would allow them to affiliate with their organization. I want to ask the Minister this: If he gives complete protection to the trade union movement by excluding all those which are registered in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, will he also exclude the Bantu trade unions which are affiliated to the T.U.C.? I say to him, Sir, that he will put the T.U.C. in an impossible position if they have to report that they were able to secure their own protection but they could not secure the protection of those Bantu trade unions which are affiliated to them. If the Minister is serious and if he wishes to combat Communism then he should do everything he possibly can to give as many of the Bantu trade unions as possible on to our side in our fight against Communism. That should be his objective. I say to him that it will not be sufficient to introduce an amendment which will safeguard all the registered trade unions <span class="col_6395-6396" refersTo="page_0444"/>in terms of the I.C. Act. Because as the Minister knows no Bantu trade union can be registered in terms of the I.C. Act. If his amendment will have the effect of protecting the existing registered trade unions in terms of the I.C. Act but offers no protection to those Bantu trade unions which are endeavouring to further the Western way of life in South Africa, he is asking for trouble because he will be drawing no distinction between Bantu trade unions that are endeavouring to achieve what we all try to achieve in terms of the trade union movement and that is peace and negotiation rather than disruption. He will be drawing no distinction between those trade unions and those who come under the domination of communists and that type of person. There must be a distinction. The Minister has referred to <i>bona fide</i> trade unions. I am not an authority on the question of existing Bantu trade unions, but I know from what I have been told that there are genuine Bantu trade union movements.</p>

I say the test of my sincerity is in the fact that the Minister has indicated that Clause 21, as it is, is a danger to the trade union movement. That is why I say to him: Is it fair to this Opposition that he should introduce an amendment at the Committee Stage rather than tell us what it is now?

<p>During this debate we have now had very clear proof that the United Party without wishing to do so have now become one of the main advocates of Communism. I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that this was not originally their intention. They thought matters would take a different course. But they have gradually landed themselves in this position. One of the clearest proofs is in fact the egg-dance performed by the previous speaker with which he tried by some manner of means to escape and to adopt such an attitude that they could justify themselves in the eyes of the world and eventually be accepted as people who are not really communistically inclined.</p>

<p>This Bill with which we are dealing here is aimed at all sabotage, as one of the previous speakers has also indicated. Sabotage wishes to undermine all the authority of the State, and to do this it wishes to damage and destroy all existing institutions in order eventually to reach the stage where it can undermine the State itself.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said, this Bill is aimed at all sabotage. We know there is no source of sabotage which is so threatening and organized on such a great and comprehensive scale as world Communism which is trying to gain control over the whole world and South Africa as well and is trying to undermine the authority of the State. When one is dealing with Communism, then one can understand why it is becoming such a tremendous threat, such a tremendous source of sabotage, because the communist does not care what he does. His whole nature is to commit sabotage. I shall read here from what Dr. Schwarz has said. He is the executive director of the Christian anti-communist movement and as an authority on Communism he gave evidence before the Committee on un-American Activities. On that occasion he revealed the true character of Communism when he said <i>inter alia</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inherent within the theory of Communism is the greatest program of murder, slaughter and insanity conceivable.</block>

<p>He went on and further defined this doctrine by referring to its moral looseness and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every act that contributes to the communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peaceful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a peaceful grave. When the Chinese communists murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful and within their framework of ideology whatever helps their conquest is peaceful, good and true.</block>

<p>That is the real character of Communism. I therefore say that this Communism is also one of the most important sources of sabotage which one can envisage because its whole essence is nothing but an attempt at large-scale sabotage in order to achieve its objects of world domination. When we go further, we can say that one can almost not understand why it is that clergymen&#x2014;I am not even referring to the United Party&#x2014;and churches can be so short-sighted as to give their blessing to that movement, by holding protest meetings, arranging prayer meetings, singing hymns and holding big demonstrations at this time when this Bill is before us, as though there is a <span class="col_6401-6402" refersTo="page_0447"/>tremendous threat to our freedom of conscience. Allow me to say, Mr. Speaker, that when we learn to know Communism, then we can say in the first place that Communism is completely unscrupulous. As these quotations which I have read to the House show, they have no moral standards. Furthermore Communism has no moral code. For the communist there is only one principle and that is that the end justifies the means. Because it adopts this basic premise, Communism will lend itself to the worst forms of sabotage and it will justify itself before the tribunal of its own conscience because is suits it to do so. If it can undermine the State, if it can harm the State with all the institutions we have here which must protect our citizens and further their welfare, then it would like to do so and as far as the communists are concerned, it is simply a question that they are justified in doing so because the end justifies the means. That is why we can understand that the greatest threat to all our possessions comes from this quarter. It is this movement which represents the greatest threat to the human values, to the citizens of this State. The South African Psychological Society recently drew up a very interesting paper which dealt with the diabolical means used by the communists to change the personality of a person by using their so-called &#x201C;brainwashing&#x201D; system whereby they can destroy those things which are sacred to the individual, and give him a completely new character. This is a tremendous threat with which we are dealing. This a movement which does not hesitate to use old people or young people, important or insignificant people, as long as it can achieve its objects. When we deal with the immoral code of the communists, then we can understand why this is the position, because its whol philosophy of life is purely materialistic. Dr. Schwarz whom I have quoted stated this very clearly. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The second law of Communism is that man is a material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in terms of chemistry and physics. Man has no soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the species Home sapiens, and subject to modification, adaption and transformation by the applied, established laws of animal husbandry.</block>

<p>Here we have a clear exposition of the materialistic philosophy of life which underlies this movement which is committing sabotage on such a large scale in our country. If we continue, then we can say that this movement, if it is so materialistically inclined, can naturally not uphold any spiritual values; then it cannot have any spiritual values; because it is the great enemy of all idealism; whether it be in the educational or political field or in any other field, Communism would oppose ideals. We can therefore say that this movement is the greatest enemy of all the spiritual values which any State regards as valuable. It is precisely all these values which the sabotage process must first destroy. They must first sabotage the spiritual values before they can sabotage the State because the State rests on these values. It is the foundations on which it is based; it is the principles by which an orderly community is maintained. Once one has undermined these spiritual values of the State, then it is very easy to give the State the final death blow by means of a large-scale sabotage campaign. The most important things will already have been destroyed.</p>

<p>For this reason it is also possible to understand why there are people who are trying to undermine the spiritual resources of the State. A deep study which scientists have made of the methods of sabotage used by the communists has revealed that the first object on which they concentrate is the promotion of moral decline; in other words, they first try to destroy those things which the churches are always protecting. And it is not always the communists themselves who take the lead, but wherever they can encourage a movement which can result in moral decline, they do not hesitate to do so. They do their utmost to initiate and to encourage such a movement because if they can undermine the morality of a State they have after all gained control over one of the most important sources of strength namely, the discipline which places inhibitions on mankind and which would prevent him from doing harm to the property of others. This is what they want to undermine and destroy. Another method used by the communists is to undermine all forms of social and family discipline. They achieve this object through the use of key men in the right places who make it their aim to further this type of undermining. That is why we know that the communist attaches very little value to the intimate domestic life, and that it is their object to undermine the family ties in this country as well, because if they can destroy the family then the State can be sabotaged far more easily. All literature written by non-communistic sceptics is encouraged and praised by the communist key men. Any work which is published, is praised, so long as it is just written by a non-communist sceptic who is sceptical towards the State and is moving in the direction of subversion. In this way every movement which is critical or sceptical what is conservative, is encouraged. All anti-colonial and pro-coloured movements are encouraged by the communists. We also find that they try to undermine all sources of spiritual life in the community. The main source of spiritual life in any Christian community is after all the Christian Church. That is why I am surprised that at this time the spiritual leaders are acting in so unwise a fashion. The movement which we want to combat by means of this Bill is precisely the movement which is attacking this bulwark of spiritual values. This movement is also aimed at the Church and at all forms of religion. Prof. Schwarz from whose article I have already quoted has also said that of the laws of Communism&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6403-6404" refersTo="page_0448"/>The first one is that there is no God. They are proudly and unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and every value that originated with God. They deny moral law; they deny absolute standards of truth and righteousness; a civilized code of moral and ethical values is destroyed so that they can be free to erect in their place new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.</block>

<p>We can therefore say that this movement is undermining one of the most important spiritual institutions in the community. Over the ruins which they wish to create in this way, they want to strike at the State by sabotage and this they can then also do effectively. They do not believe in the Bible. They reject the Church as an institution and they do not attach any value to the message of the Church. Every Church, and every church building, must be destroyed. This we saw during the disturbances we had a year ago namely that church buildings and school buildings were the first to be destroyed. Churches and schools are institutions which cultivate and propagate spiritual values and that is why they must be destroyed. That is why it is their object to destroy these buildings.</p>

<p>In this morning&#x2019;s newspaper we read about a crowd of more than 6,000 people who participated in a procession in Johannesburg. It is said that they sung spiritual songs and prayed. But I doubt whether there was a truly Christian element in that crowd and I shall tell the House why I doubt it. It is not the nature of the Church to protest in such a way. As a matter of fact, it is foreign to the Christian Church as I know it. If hon. members will read the <i>Pretoria News</i> for Monday they will see that it contains a photograph of St. Alban&#x2019;s Cathedral in Pretoria while a prayer meeting was taking place. This prayer meeting was arranged in order to protest and to pray against this legislation. But when one examines the mighty cathedral and one counts the people one can see on the photograph, one can come to no other conclusion but that there were only 40 or 50 people in that great cathedral. Why? Because the majority in the Christian Church disapprove and are opposed to these protests. The conscience of the Christian Church is most sensitive as regards a matter which threatens the Church and its message. I maintain that if there were really any danger in this legislation to the Church, the Christian Church would not have hesitated to call upon its resources as a whole. They would have held one great and powerful demonstration, but not on the streets of Johannesburg, but here outside this Parliament. And nowhere would they have a more sympathetic reception that here. This Government has repeatedly shown that it will do its duty as regards the mission of the Church and will do nothing which will harm the Church and its message in any way. When we examine the so-called crowd of 6,000, we can in the first place eliminate the hangers-on. Then the communists can be removed, and we shall find that the crowd will become ever smaller until eventually we shall only have a small group who are prejudiced because they cannot think for themselves. They must first be led by so-called clergymen who often under the guise of religion propagate one of the most dangerous movements in this world. It is these clergymen who are misleading their street followers.</p>

<p>There is only one test which we can use and that is the Christian test which is embodied in the text &#x201C;A tree is judged by its fruits&#x201D;. During the past 12 years this Government has proved that it is the guardian of all these things which are sacred to the Church and other institutions in the community and to the community itself. The Government has proved this. The fruit has been yielded because order has been maintained. It has been our endeavour to allow everyone in this multiracial community of ours to come to his rights. The Government has kept to the highest moral yardstick of &#x201C;do unto others as you would have them do unto you&#x201D;. We therefore say that it is deplorable that attempts are being made by a small group of dangerous clergymen to mislead the people and to incite them to hold protests and that they are doing so under the guise of a religious protest.</p>

<p>Communism is a philosophy of lies. It reveals itself through its propaganda; it has its key men, and it is active everywhere. It is also this type of propaganda which we are seeing in the streets to-day as well as in the newspapers and elsewhere. Everywhere we hear the echo of this propaganda which has as its eventual object sabotage of an unprecedented kind. Communism is a cowardly movement. It does not mind misusing our youth. We have heard many protests from hon. members opposite in this regard. It has been alleged that under this legislation young people of 14 or 16 years of age will be hanged, or this or that will be done to them. As a matter of fact, every possibility has been conjured up. I now want to tell them that the right-minded young person is someone who has sufficient character not to allow himself to be misused by these elements. And we believe this is true of the overwhelming majority of the youth of our country. Furthermore it is precisely the inexperienced person who will be protected by this legislation. He will no longer be able to make himself available for misuse by the communists because then he will be punished. If he as a young person has sufficient intelligence to implement the plans of Communism, then he deserves nothing better than to be dealt with in the proposed manner. Young people after all are not let loose to-day if they commit offences, and if we do not close this loophole as well, then I can give the House the assurance that it is precisely the young people whom the communists will seek out. It is the young person whom the communist will use to destroy churches and schools and to sabotage the State on a large scale. We therefore applaud the fact that the young person is also being <span class="col_6405-6406" refersTo="page_0449"/>brought under this legislation so that he can realize his duty.</p>

<p>I have said that Communism is a cowardly movement. It is not prepared to show its true colours, but is very fond of hiding under another name. That is why it changes its name whenever it suits its purposes to do so. That is why we are also glad that this legislation is flexible enough so that action can be taken against all the various nuances of communist propaganda which will still be seen in this country if legislation is not adopted aimed at restricting it. We can give the world outside and the spiritual guardians of the people, the assurance that this legislation will not restrict freedom. It is not aimed at freedom, but at lawlessness which wants to undermine and sabotage the State. I think that the United Party already bitterly regret to-night the attitude which they have adopted from the outset. Nevertheless I believe that the United Party are also opposed to Communism, but why then are they acting in this way? They are acting in this way because they are afraid that if they do not do so the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party will gain the support of those people who are marching in the streets and going around with torches. It is with this fact in mind that the United Party have realized that they are after all the official Opposition. That is why all protests must go through the United Party as representing the correct channel. They do not want anyone else to outdo them and it is for that reason that they find themselves in such a difficult position to-night. The future will show that the United Party by resorting to this type of action have done themselves more harm than anything they have done in the past.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>We have reached a very sad state of affairs under this Government, when the hon. member for Kimberley (South) can make an un-Christian attack on this side of the House and declare us to be the champions of Communism. At the outset I should like to say that this General Laws Amendment Bill is a Godless piece of legislation. The Bill which is before us here to-night, is a Godless piece of legislation and that despite everything which the hon. member for Kimberley (South) has said. Perhaps he did not read the Bill. As a matter of fact, that appears to be the case because had he read it, he would have realized that under it he himself could be declared a communist. Clause 8 of the Bill, for instance, makes a man a communist when he advocates any of the objects of Communism. I know that he and the communists are at one as regards the respect of the laws of animal husbandry. So even on a simple issue such as that, he might become a communist and be declared as such under this legislation. Another possibility is and one which the hon. member did not seem to be aware of, is the possibility of he himself being guilty of sabotage. There are provisions in this Bill which I doubt whether the hon. member will be able to escape all his life. Clause 21, for instance, stipulates that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), any person who commits any wrongful and wilful act whereby he injures, damages, destroys, renders useless or unserviceable, puts out of action, obstructs, tampers with, pollutes, contaminates, or endangers &#x2026; (g) any property, whether movable or immovable of any other person or of the State &#x2026;</block>

<p>Last year, Sir, my car was badly damaged by another member of Parliament. He did not even report it. But I am certain that under this Bill he would have been guilty of and committed to prison for five years without the judge having any option in the matter. Whatever the hon. member said about the punishment which people who are guilty of communistic acts merits, may I am sure also be applied to himself if the regulations are carried out as envisaged here. As a matter of fact, any innocent person may merit prosecution under this Bill. Does the hon. member for Kimberley (South), who is Christian, really advocate a measure of this nature? Even a murderer, I think, elicits sympathy in the hearts of members of Parliament, and any who advocate such severe punishment to those who commits sabotage and other acts in terms of this Bill, I think also un-Christian. The hon. member is also un-Christian when he accuses those who take part in public processions as being un-Christian.</p>

<p>I, for my part, think that the numerous public protests which this Bill has called forth, is against despotism and highlight the extent to which the people cherish freedom. I hope that members on the Government side will respect that. This Bill is not only an anti-sabotage Bill, but it is also an intimidation measure. As such it will never be permanently tolerated by the people. Our war measures were temporary measures whilst this Bill is a permanent piece of legislation. I have no doubt that this Bill, when placed on the Statute Book, will be the writing on the wall for the Nationalist Party. When the Government tampers with the liberty of the people, then it is looking for trouble. Just the mention of the Statue of Liberty in America stirs our deepest sentiments. The history of our people has been one of a fight for freedom as opposed to despotism. Our entire history has been a succession of fights and stuggles against despotism. That can be said of the earliest Dutch pioneers. They were the first to fight against despotism. I hope that we have not come back now to the days of Adam Tas in this country, but when one looks at this legislation it makes one shudder. Then we have the French Huguenots. [Interjections.] Unfortunately the hon. member for Cradock cannot claim Huguenot descent; so I do not expect him to know what the Huguenots suffered and sacrificed, and of their great achievements in this country. That all came to pass as a result <span class="col_6407-6408" refersTo="page_0450"/>of their fight for freedom and liberty. Such can also be said of the 1820-settlers. They have had a similar history and so have the Voortrekkers, and the Republics. These made the greatest sacrifices for individual liberty and freedom of speech, expression and from interference in their lives by despots. We know what was gained for liberty by those struggles. We know also what the outcome was of restrictions. One of the great fruits of restriction which we have in this country to-day is the Afrikaans language. The people fought against the repression of their language and so the Afrikaans language was born. That is an example we should all remember, and be thankful for.</p>

<p>I think it is unreasonable for members on the Government side to try and compare this Bill with war time legislation or with legislation which applies in countries like Rhodesia.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. member can then be exonerated from that accusation. But is he then insinuating that the Nationalist Party and the Fifth Columnists were wrong at that time because they opposed that legislation? I too say that the definition of sabotage is too wide. The regulation of the jurisdiction of our courts is undemocratic. In this debate, I think there has been a tragic incapacity on the part of members on the Government side to understand the Opposition&#x2019;s point of view. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) even went so far as to accuse us of being the champions of Communism. They cannot understand protests; they cannot comprehend the meaning of protest meetings because they do not regard them as democratic demonstrations. Instead, they view public opposition as sabotaging propaganda. Freedom of expression is threatened even when freedom of expression does not endanger the safety of others. This Bill regiments. It is designed to regiment our way of life and I am afraid that this Government by passing this measure, may be guilty of incitement as well.</p>

No Government can expect restrictive legislation like this to endure. I do hope, therefore, that when we come to the Committee Stage of this Bill, the Minister will see his way clear to amend the Bill so as to enable him to administer it, because I doubt whether he can administer it as it is now framed.

<p>Well, I can criticize some of the clauses of the Bill in order to satisfy the Minister. I know that we will be able to discuss the details of the various clauses during the Committee Stage. Then we will have our real clash with the Minister, i.e. when we go through the Bill clause by clause. At the present moment I do not want to be involved in the wilderness of powers which the Minister is seeking by means of this Bill as a whole.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>There is a wilderness of powers encompassed within this Bill. The Minister might even find it difficult to explain what &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; means in terms of Clause 4. I notice that a magistrate will also have power to say what is a legitimate gathering, but then only on instructions from the Minister. Why magistrates are being brought into the Bill, therefore, I do not know. I am also nervous in regard to the provisions relating to the registration of newspapers. I am nervous of damage which might be done thereby to the expression of public opinion. I have not yet found the Government unable to deal with papers having an undermining influence or being communistically inclined. As a matter of fact, the Government has succeeded in the past to close down on quite a number of such newspapers. We have great respect for freedom of speech and expression. We know that Lord Charles Somerset tried to suppress freedom of expression and freedom of speech. But what happened to him as a result of that? It brought about his downfall. That is what can happen with this Minister also and I should like to warn him about it. He should be very careful how he restricts public expression of opinion. After all, it is only the newspapers which can really reflect public opinion. If they do not comply with his requirements, I am sure the Minister already has all the powers necessary to enable him to shut down any paper guilty of communistic propaganda or of propagating sabotage in any way whatever. You know, Mr. Speaker, under this Bill, as I read it, even a meeting of the Nationalist Party could be disallowed.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it might be a very good thing. There are powers in the Bill under which the Nationalist Party could be forbidden to hold meetings. I am quite sure that would be a very good thing, and perhaps the Minister will do it if in the Committee Stage we impress upon him the advantages of closing down some of the meetings of the Nationalist Party. Perhaps he will then consent to use some of the powers granted to him in Clause 7. That is why I told the hon. the Minister that if he would amend the Bill to please me, I certainly would accept the Bill for myself. The Minister did not ask me to speak for the Party. He asked me whether I would accept it. I cannot speak for the Party. Each member has his own opinion, but the hon. Minister honoured me by asking me whether I would accept this measure if he amends certain clauses in the Bill. But, Mr. Speaker, I am not so opposed to the Nationalist Party that I would like to close down any of their meetings. However vociferous the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) is and however hard he hits, I respect him and I enjoy his contributions in this House. I would be the last person to ban a meeting at which the hon. member for Brits was to be the chief speaker. Mr. Speaker, I think only in the Committee Stage can we thresh out what the term &#x201C;communist&#x201D; means and what is indicated by the &#x201C;objects of Communism&#x201D;. For instance, the hon. member for Kimberley (South) may be guilty of communistic activities because some of his principles and objects in life may coincide with the principles and objects of Communism. It is presently stated here &#x201C;any of the objects of Communism&#x201D;. Surely one of the objects of Communism would not be to convert the hon. Minister of Lands to Communism.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley (South) would attack me as agitating for Communism because I am criticizing this more or less simple Bill&#x2014;a simple Bill, but which is so involved that it would take a great deal of explanation by the hon. Minister to tell us in the Committee Stage how it would be applied. Take the powers the hon. the Minister sought in regard to serving a notice on a named person. The Bill empowers the Minister to publish in the <i>Government Gazette</i> that such notice has been served, and when that is published in the <i>Gazette</i> it is accepted as legal, even though the person concerned may not even subscribe to the <i>Government Gazette.</i> I think the Minister of Lands will have to read the <i>Government Gazette</i> more frequently now than he reads the <i>Burger,</i> because one does not know what may be published in the <i>Gazette.</i> I think the Government Printer and the Government are going to have large profits from the increased sale of the <i>Gazette,</i> because almost everyone will now have to buy the <i>Gazette.</i> [Interjections.] Hon. members will find out from the Bill and from the explanatory memorandum, which has watered down the intentions of this Bill very considerably. Nevertheless it is stated in the explanatory memorandum that the Minister may publish in the <i>Gazette</i> that notice has been given to a person, and by virtue of publication in the <i>Gazette</i> it then becomes a legal notice to that person. Publication means that a notice has been served on the person concerned. Now I defy the hon. the Minister to carry that out. I have enough respect for our judiciary to declare that. I defy the hon. Minister to prosecute any person under this particular provision of the Bill. It is a fact that the Minister knows this provision. exists I think this provision is quite absurd, that from the date of publication&#x2014;that is before the individual can even purchase the <i>Gazette</i>&#x2014;he will be regarded as having been notified. That is actually stated in the Bill. The individual can then commit an offence without even knowing that his name has been listed. That is provided for in this Bill. A man can commit an offence and be guilty without knowing that his name has been gazetted. As I have said before, how many members on the other side read the <i>Gazette</i>? I have also pointed out that we have a clause in regard to Communism that anyone who commits an act which causes damage to a car or anything of that nature, and is declared guilty of sabotage, is subject to five years imprisonment.</p>

<p>Speaking in general, Mr. Speaker, I have read this Bill, I have tried to study it and I have read it more meticuously than members on the opposite side, and yet I have been accused of not knowing its terms. The more I read it the more difficult I find this legislation to understand, and also more unreasonable. You know, Mr. Speaker, we always regard <span class="col_6411-6412" refersTo="page_0452"/>law as common sense. When people say to me: You know you can be declared guilty even if you are ignorant of the law, than I have replied to them: Well, if you are ignorant of the law, just use your common sense.</p>

<speech by="#niemand">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEMAND</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) has said that under this legislation any innocent person can be prosecuted. The same speeches as hon. members of the Opposition have made to-night were also made in 1950 when the Suppression of Communism Act was passed by this House. Mr. Speaker, is not the very object of this legislation precisely to protect the general public against the agitators, the communists and the people who sabotage, and to deal with them? According to the argument of the hon. member for Albany the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter) is being accused of being un-Christian because he supports this legislation. If we must be called unchristian because we want to protect the general public, then the hon. member for Albany must do so. Then he went on to say that this Bill &#x201C;will never be tolerated by the people&#x201D;. The 1950 Act has now been tolerated for 12 years by the public of this country, and the same will apply to this legislation. But I shall come back to that later. Furthermore the hon. member says that he does not like demonstrations being banned. I want to ask him whether he liked the demonstrations which were held at Langa and Sharpeville, whether he would like to see similar demonstrations held once again in South Africa. I ask him whether he wants to see Gkosana marching through the streets of Cape Town again.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I want to make a few remarks with reference to the speech made by the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. Van der Byl) to-day. He has said that during the past 18 months there have been signs of improvement, that there was a new attitude towards South Africa and an improved understanding of South Africa in the world. I want to agree with him in that regard, and I want to ask him why it is that a new attitude is developing towards South Africa in the world, and why the world is beginning to understand South Africa and her problems? Is the main reason not precisely the fact that there is a good Government in power? Is the main reason not that this Government is one of the few in the world which has expressed itself as being unequivocally opposed to Communism and has closed the Russian embassy in this country? Is it not the determination of this Government to deal with people who try to disturb law and order in this country; and is it not the determination of this Government to put them in their place, which has created confidence in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the behaviour of this responsible Government in our country has resulted in investors and people throughout the world having the utmost confidence in South Africa. I want to say further that the world to-day sees that the racial policy of the Government of the day is also fair to all the racial groups. The world is beginning to realize that to-day, and that is why the world is beginning to adopt a new attitude towards us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point has further said that in England he had to defend our policy. I then said: &#x201C;Hear, hear&#x201D; because I have found many English-speaking people in my own constituency who have told me how uninformed the people in England are regarding conditions in South Africa. I have found in the case of many of these English-speaking people that although they are United Party supporters they have defended South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member says he does so as well. It is a fine thing when that is done. But what is the cause of this distorted picture of South Africa which we find abroad? It is the English Press which is responsible for this. Publicity is given to anything which can do South Africa harm overseas. The representatives of the Press think of their own pockets. I ask the House at whose expense they are doing so? They are trying to fill their own pockets at the expense of our fatherland, South Africa; the price is the good name of South Africa, and there Press representatives do not care what they say about our country. If they can be pulled up, I personally will appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am certain that many United Party members sitting in this House are also opposed to the actions and false reports spread by the English Press. But the time has come when they will have to show positively that they are opposed to it. I am also certain that the United Party, since the start of this debate, have bitterly regretted the fact that they have agitated against the legislation. One only hopes that the time will come when they will see how wrong they are in the attitude they have adopted here.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, has the time not come in South Africa and in the world for us to realize that we are living in different times. We are living in a world in which a revolution is taking place to-day. Many changes have come <span class="col_6413-6414" refersTo="page_0453"/>about in the world. We have had many new discoveries in the world. There have been developments in the economic and political fields, and the world must also adjust itself to the new problems which have arisen. Similarly there are new problems facing us in respect of legislation aimed at maintaining law and order in a country. It has been found that the old methods of combating disorder are inadequate and for that reason it is necessary that new measures be taken to deal adequately with the offences being committed to-day. We must have new measures to deal effectively in the future with these offences which cannot be combated to-day. But when a Government introduces legislation, it does not do so lightly. It must be able to render account to the voters of the country. If we are doing such a tremendous injustice as the United Party Opposition are claiming, then we shall after all fall into disfavour with the public, the people who elected this Government. Then I think the United Party will be glad that we have done such a foolish thing. But this Government is responsible for order and the security of our country. It is responsible for the maintenance of order in this country, but, Mr. Speaker, it is also responsible for the security of every race in this country, not only of the Whites but other racial groups as well. When I say that, I am thinking of a document which I have received to-day from the Transvaal Indian Congress. It is an impudent and insolent document which has been sent to me, and <i>inter alia</i> they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The main object of the Bill is not to outlaw sabotage as such, under the smoke-screen of Communism and treason you are trying to mislead the country and the world about the real intention.</block>

<p>It is signed by Nathie and Naidoo. They say that this Bill will affect them greatly. Are these people who wrote this letter then saboteurs? Because the legislation which is being introduced, is not aimed at a specific group of people. The legislation is being introduced in order to deal with saboteurs. If they say that this Bill will affect them greatly, and are thereby implying that they are saboteurs, then I hope that they will in fact be dealt with effectively. One is surprised that people can be so irresponsible, when one thinks of the fact that a few years ago the Zulus in Durban beat them with knobkieries, and this Government then protected them in a very responsible way. It is the Government&#x2019;s duty to protect every citizen of this country, and it will continue to do so in future as well.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, the legislation which we are adopting is being described as fascistic and totalitarian, and it is said that we are turning this country into a police state. Let them say that. But this Government, with all the measures it has taken, is regarded by the voters as the Government which has done best for South Africa, and the voters have shown this unequivocally on every occasion at the polling booths. It is a pity that the United Party have adopted the attitude here which they have adopted, and have not listened to the wise counsel which some of their supporters have given, not to oppose the legislation but only to oppose certain of the clauses. But, Mr. Speaker, the political intuition of the United Party suits us. If they continue with the type of speech certain of their members are making here, then it costs them a few thousand votes every time such a speech is made, and those people will vote for the National Party when we hold another election. It is the position that the liberal element within the United Party has once again triumphed. Speeches have been made by hon. members of the Opposition, <i>inter alia,</i> by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), which create the impression that all the people in South Africa are bound in chains. That is the picture which is being sent abroad by the English Press. Another hon. member has said that this is the &#x201C;Childrens&#x2019; Hanging Bill&#x201D;.

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) has dealt with the hon. member for Wynberg. Last year the hon. member said here: &#x201C;Nats almost preparing for civil war.&#x201D; Allow me first to point this out. Last year under the leadership of communists and agitators a big conference was held in Pietermaritzburg. This conference was held by the so-called All-in African people. At that meeting they demanded that a national conviction should be held in this country to be attended by chosen representatives, on a basis of equality, of all races and colours in this country, and that this conference should be held before 31 May. They further demanded that that convention should have sovereign powers. At that conference <span class="col_6415-6416" refersTo="page_0454"/>they would draw up a multi-racial constitution. The implications were that the present Government, which has been elected in a legal manner, should surrender, because this multi-racial constitution which would have been drawn up by the national convention, would obviously have been dominated by the Bantu of this country because they are in the majority. When it was demanded of this Government that it should surrender, what was the attitude of the United Party in this regard? I want to refer to what the hon. member for Wynberg said in this regard. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While Dr. Verwoerd stays in power and rules with a rod of iron, we should not be surprised if the iron enters into the soul of his African fellow-citizens and causes them to think with their spears. But they have not. They had a congress at Maritz-burg, and I understand they have asked for a conference of all peoples of South Africa to draft a multi-racial constitution.

<speech by="#niemand">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEMAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is what the hon. member for Wynberg said on 4 May 1961, in Claremont, according to the <i>Cape Times.</i> This conference which was held in Pietermaritzburg under the leadership of a group of agitators and which demanded that the Government of the day should surrender, was described by a front bencher of the United Party as making a very peaceful request to the Government and it is further described as a very constitutional request. He subscribes to it entirely. Mr. Speaker, it is a pity that there are also people on that side of the House who are so irresponsible as to make such statements. With such irresponsible submissions as he has made will he really welcome the destruction of the White man here on the southern tip of Africa? And then the Leader of the Opposition tells us that the federal plan is the solution. Mr. Speaker, where does the federal plan come into the picture when his front benchers advocate that this Government should surrender when they support such action, and when they want us to have a multi-racial constitution and to accept one man one vote? Where does his federation then come into the picture? There will be no federation because the Bantu will govern the country.</p>

<p>The Opposition have made various allegations which I should like to refute briefly. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said that the Government is admitting by this legislation that it cannot govern without taking the most extreme action. It is not necessary to prove, as the Minister has already done, that at the moment unusual circumstances exist. He has pointed out that on 15 December sabotage was committed at eight places on the same day and at the same time; that one of the witnesses in connection with these incidents has disappeared. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this legislation is being introduced because at the moment there is no machinery to deal effectively with such acts, and the Department of Justice feels that there should be legislation so that the saboteurs can be dealt with rapidly and effectively? That is the reason why this legislation has been introduced, and I maintain that if it is the position that witnesses are simply disappearing and that sabotage has been committed at eight places on the same night on an organized basis, then we must be careful because we are playing with fire if we do not take the situation into account and if we do not take positive steps to deal with it and to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Opposition have said that this legislation is trying to combat Communism by negative means. They say that the Government is trying to combat Communism in a negative way. Where is there better proof than this very legislation that we want to combat Communism by positive means? All the measures we have taken in the past have been positively aimed at eradicating Communism. They contend that Communism should be thoroughly investigated. Have we not combated Communism by the most effective means under the r&#x00E9;gime of the National Party Government? The Opposition have alleged that the standard of living of our people is so low that Communism will flourish precisely in our country. Is it not true that the standard of living of our people, of all the races of our country, is higher and better than it has ever been under any previous Government? It is precisely as a result of the economic measures taken by this Government that South Africa to-day offers the least fertile soil for Communism anywhere in Africa. We are combating it. We are making it difficult for the communist to live and to exist here. That is why I welcome so whole-heartedly this measure which the Minister has now introduced in order to combat the communists. We are not dealing here with an enemy which one can tackle with bare hands. It must be hit hard, and this is the only way to do so. The allegation has been made that we call Black nationalism Communism. How far from the truth is that not? Is it not the position that we allow and grant every national group the right to live in this country and that we are offering the Bantu in their homelands the opportunity to develop and to be able to hold responsible positions? It is quite untrue to allege that we say that Black nationalism is Communism.</p>

<p>Furthermore attacks have been made on our judiciary, on the Judges who are supposedly incapable of hearing these cases, and the Attorney-General who is &#x201C;unscrupulous&#x201D;. Suddenly our courts are now incapable of doing the work which they have been doing all these years. I want to express my full confidence in the judiciary of this country. Opposition members have said that we are <span class="col_6417-6418" refersTo="page_0455"/>now restricting the freedom of the individual. That is devoid of all truth. Is it not precisely the position that we wish to protect 99.9 per cent of the public, and wish to take action precisely against that .01 per cent who are saboteurs? We are opposed to violence. We do not want to see it develop in this country, and the actions of this Government have created full confidence in South Africa. It is for this reason that the outside world is expressing confidence in South Africa, namely because positive steps are being taken to eradicate Communism. When Meadowlands and other large housing schemes were erected for the Bantu, the greatest possible agitation was set afoot, and it was said that the worst possible injustice was being done to those people and that the rights of the individual were being interfered with. The Press of the world were called to take photographs in order to show the world this great injustice, but what are those people saying to-day? They all admit to-day that this was the greatest effort made by this Government to do something good as regards the housing of the non-Whites.</p>

<p>This legislation is being introduced precisely to close the loopholes in the present legislation. Once we have adopted this Bill, I want to say that if there are still loopholes, the Minister must submit the matter to this House as soon as possible so that we can close them, so that we can deal with the Communists. We do not want to see a repetition in this country of Sharpeville and Langa. We want to see peace. That is why I hold it against the Opposition that they are opposing a Bill which envisages peace. They prefer to have a position such as that which prevailed at Langa and Sharpeville.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that I must not say such a thing, but if they oppose this legislation, then it must show the world that they are opposed to the combating of Communism. When Sam Kahn who said he was a communist was removed from the House, they were opposed to that as well. What else can the public outside say except that they are trying to further Communism; it is actions that count. The communistic danger is very great and we are making matters as difficult for it as possible, but it is to be found throughout the world, and its object is the overthrow of governments by violence. This Government has been elected by legal and proper means, and I am not in favour of a Government being overthrown by violence. If there are signs of unrest and of attempts to overthrow the Government by violence, strong action must be taken. Communism does not recognize any God or any law. If one joins the communist party, one may not have any religion. That is why it is so important that we in this country, seeing that we believe in freedom of religion, should restrict these people who do not want to allow any religion here. The communists want to control and dominate the whole world. The policy of the communist is deplorable and repulsive, and we cannot take strong enough action to combat and to eradicate them. They are trying to implement their policy by eloquently advocating peaceful co-existence. In Africa they have made the word &#x201C;colonialism&#x201D; an epithet, and everything bad is linked with it. In this way they are trying to gain ground. Since 1917 32,000 Russian orthodox churches and 20,000 mosques have been destroyed in Russia. Religion has been destroyed there, and that is why we must eradicate the communists root and branch. We cannot allow them to continue sabotaging us under our very noses. As long as this Government is in power, it will not allow such irresponsible acts to be committed under its nose in order to further Communism. We shall not hesitate to pass legislation aimed at eradicating Communism root and branch.</p>

<p>I listened most carefully to the hon. member for Pietersburg (Mr. Niemand) wandering from the Indians in Durban to the churches destroyed in Russia and the convention that was held in Pietermaritzburg, with some abuse of the hon. member for Wynberg, and the only subject he left alone was this Bill we are discussing. It was the same with the speaker just before him, the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Mr. W. L. D. M. Venter). He preached a sermon about the evils of Communism, but he never touched on the Bill. I took some notes of what he said. I do not want to allude to the legal people here, because they have been dealt with. I can only say that even an ordinary layman like me could see that their speeches were wide off the mark. Then there was the speech of the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter). He started off most beautifully by telling us that politics was the art of government and he went on to compliment the Minister on the wonderful exposition he gave in his second reading speech, but the hon. Minister had also left the Bill severely alone. In reply to the questions we put to him, the Minister said that we must wait and see, leaving us with the impression that he had not read the Bill.</p>

<p>I will come to the Bill. The hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) said, &#x201C;Hierdie wetsontwerp wyk af van die konvensionele wetgewing&#x201D;, and ended up by asking for consolidation of all these laws because he said it was &#x201C;impossible for the ordinary man to follow these laws&#x201D;. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller), who has had a legal training, said that legislation of this nature must be introduced even though the &#x201C;method adopted was barbaric&#x201D;. Having listened to all this, I start wondering, particularly when I remember that one hon. member said that this Bill was &#x201C;Buigsaam genoeg&#x201D;. <span class="col_6419-6420" refersTo="page_0456"/>The hon. member for Pietersburg spoke about saboteurs and agitators and everything else except the Bill. Now I as an ordinary layman will try to look at the Bill. [Laughter.] Sir, that is an expression used in a court of law, but if the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) is so ignorant as not to know it, I will call myself a laywoman. I find that the short title calls this Bill The General Law Amendment Bill, but when I look at the long title it says it amends the Suppression of Communism Act of 1950. Before I read anything further, I remember that that particular Act was amended in 1951, in 1954, 1956 and 1961, and we also had the Public Safety Act and the Riotous Assemblies Act, and most of them were amended, too.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>What is wrong is that none of the hon. members opposite know what it is all about. That is why their speeches never touched on the Bill. Then I come to Clause I of the Bill, which bans social meetings and organizations, and social meetings and <i>ad hoc</i> meetings can now be banned whereas previously under the old Act it had to be proved that there was a common purpose before these meetings could be banned. In other words, this gives much wider powers. I come to Clause 2. [Interjection.] Does the hon. member for Standerton expect me to teach him everything? He has shown his ignorance so often in this House that I would hate him to ask me to define every single word in the clause. I am going to touch on the points on which I desire to touch and I will not be taught by anyone. [Interjection.] The hon. the Minister of Information got such a dressing-down in the House last night that I would be quiet if I were in his shoes. In Clause 2 an organization can be banned that has been established for the purpose of carrying directly or indirectly on the activities of an unlawful organization. This goes so wide that one wonders what will escape the banning. Then in Clause 3 the Minister can prohibit any particular gathering. This is where one begins to see what the Leader of the Opposition called the &#x201C;civil death&#x201D; that could be administered. Clause 4 says that any group of persons can be listed as well as an individual, and that is why the trade unions were concerned for their safety. But the point I wish to make in regard to these four clauses is that this Bill is so involved, so web like that the ordinary man or woman cannot understand it, and they would not know what is lawful or unlawful. As I go into the Bill further, I will confess to you, Sir, that I do not know, and I am sure the ordinary person who has had no legal training will not know, what is lawful or unlawful, and we are dealing with ordinary men and women. I will come presently to the fact of how much explanation the ordinary man and woman can expect because I must take into consideration that the lawyers here on the Government side do not even know.</p>

<p>I know of one lawyer who was proved a liar last night. When I say that this law is so wide that the ordinary person does not know whether he will fall under it, then I think of the next clause, Clause 5, which deals with the banning of newspapers, and then I think of the simple way in which Rhodesia dealt with this difficulty. I do not wish to say that newspapers should never be banned, or that there are no newspapers which have been banned but which appeared under a different name the next day, but we should look at what Rhodesia did. The Southern Rhodesian law says that &#x201C;if a banning order is served on a newspaper it will have effect on all subsequent issues of such publications, and not only in respect of any publication under that name, but also with respect to any publication under any other name if the publishing thereof is in any respect a continuation of the publication which was banned&#x201D;.</p>

<p>You can only spell. Then we come to Clause 6, the famous clause in which the list can be published in the <i>Gazette</i> and any name appearing in any extract from such list can be published. Now I want to come to a point which has not been touched on before, and that is that the <i>Government Gazette</i> will become in this country and under this Government a best-seller. I wonder how many ordinary people have access to the <i>Government Gazette.</i> I know that the legal offices and the magistrates&#x2019; courts get it, and you can buy it in some bookshops in Cape Town, but in the whole of Natal you cannot buy it, and if you want it you have to write to the Government Printer in Pretoria. But there are provisions in this Bill which make a banning legal as from the date of publication, and even if you write for it to Pretoria it may take a week before you get it, if I know the Department of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs at all.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether a person has to order the <i>Government Gazette</i> from Pretoria to know whether he has committed sabotage or not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>That is not the point. I will prove later that this Bill is so wide that you can do a great many things which are not sabotage and still fall into the net of this Bill. Most of the things mentioned here have nothing to do with sabotage. In Clause 10 a new offence is created where a person changes his address and fails to <span class="col_6421-6422" refersTo="page_0457"/>notify the police. Later on it says, in another clause, that a person must afford proof of having notified his change of address. A person now has to notify his change of address and furnish proof that he has done so. I say that the ordinary person may go to the post office and write a letter to say that he has changed his address, and register the letter and he gets a registration slip as proof of having notified his change of address. But if that person lands in court he will find that he has no proof, because that little slip is only proof of a letter having been posted, and knowing the Department of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs as I do, it could have been lost or mislaid, and sometimes it only turns up two or three months afterwards, and sometimes never at all. In Clause 10 (e) it is an offence to publish or disseminate any speech of a banned person. I want to know what happens to those Members of Parliament who are continually quoting these things. Is Parliament exempt from this clause? What ordinary member of the public knows anything about this? How many members over there are clear in their own minds as to whether Parliament is really exempt? How many of them have thought about it? I am sure they have not even read the clause and they do not have a clue. Even if it is true that Parliament is exempt, our constituents will be sure that we are not exempt and they will sit there waiting, some of them with glee, for their Member of Parliament to get into trouble. That raises another question. Who is going to nab those hon. members who say the wrong things in this House? Will Mr. Speaker keep a list of the sayings they have quoted, and is the Serjeant-at-Arms going to arrest them? This Bill is so nebulous that it is simply not true, and that is the trouble. You cannot quote the things said by a person who has been banned. I understood the Minister to say that he will not publish the complete lists of banned persons, but if the Minister publishes the complete list of banned people, it means that people will have to get those <i>Government Gazettes</i> and study and memorize those names. I had a most interesting experience to-day. I got a cutting from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 22 May, in which there is an article written by Mr. Patrick Duncan, and he talks about this Bill and says that one of the formidable powers given to the Government by the Bill is to place any of its opponents, if it chooses, under house arrest and to forbid them to say anything for publication. And he goes on to say that therefore he issues <i>A</i> warning to people like Sir de Villiers Graaff, Dr. D&#x2019;s and Mr. Paul Sauer. He says it is known that they are not neo-Nazis, but if they permit a law like this to go (through, their fate will be similar to that of the German Nazis 20 years ago. What is even more interesting is that I find even to-day&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> quoting Mr. Patrick Duncan. [Interjections.] I think this is the first time the Minister of Information has scored a point in this House and I must congratulate him, but I am afraid it will be a long time before he scores a point again. The <i>Burger</i> writes a whole leading article about Mr. Patrick Duncan&#x2014;</p>

But, Sir, what is going to happen to the booksellers; what is going to happen to ordinary publications? Who is going to do the reading to find out that something was not quoted of a person who ten years ago was, or ten years from now, will become a communist? You see how difficult it is. Sir. You see how difficult it is going to be for the ordinary person who has a library to make sure that they do not have in their possession a book which contains something that may fall foul of this law, in case they should lend that book to some other person.</p>

<p>It refers to promoting the objects of Communism. What does that mean to the ordinary <span class="col_6423-6424" refersTo="page_0458"/>person? Let me take an example.

But I now come to the things that I may not do and the things that the Crown or the State has to do The State has to do all or certain things set out in Clause 21 before you can be found guilty. It sets out what the State has to prove. The state has to prove that I committed a wrongful and wilful act, and then the clause sets out the various things that have to be proved by the State. There are seven things which the State has to prove. But then I turn to Clause 21 (2), and there I find the things that I have to prove. I find that there are ten of these things, ten things that I have to prove before I can prove that I am not guilty. Amongst those things are&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(f) to cause serious bodily injury to or seriously endanger the safety of any person.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) referred to a motor-car of his that was damaged here outside Parliament.

<p>Before I close my final argument, I want to touch upon two things which have been said here. It was said by the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller), I think, that in the Bill which we put before Parliament in the minority report, we put the onus on the accused. Let me quote that clause&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who or organization which on or after the date of commencement of this Act, propagates the principles of promotes the spread of Communism, shall be deemed to be guilty of high treason and shall, on an indictment alleging that he or it has propagated the principles or promoted the spread of Communism, be convicted of high treason unless he or it proves his or its innocence.</block>

<p>And then he could be hanged.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>That is the clause that has been quoted here, but the position is not as the hon. member said. Under this clause the defence is subjective. The person so accused can go into the witness-box and say, &#x201C;It was not my intention to do anything against the State&#x201D;. It is subjective. The accused must declare what his ideas were and what his objects were when he committed certain acts, and the accused is the only person who knows what he intended to do. If he explains what he intended to do, the Judge will naturally accept his explanation But in this new Bill the whole thing is regarded objectively; it is the other way round; it is what the Judge thinks that person had in his mind when he did this, that or the other thing. The Judge would say to himself, &#x201C;What would I do if I were in the place of the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze)&#x201D;, who is behaving so badly; &#x201C;would I behave as he behaves or would I behave myself a little better?&#x201D; It is for the Judge to judge; it is an objective judgment. It is said here that the indictment shall allege that he or it has propagated the principles or promoted the spread of Communism. Those are the words that are used. But what do these words mean?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6425-6426" refersTo="page_0459"/>&#x201C;Propagate&#x201D; means to spread from person to person or from place to place &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is an active act which had to be proved against the accused&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and to promote, to effect, to advocate, to further the growth or the advancement of the objects of Communism.</block>

<p>So again it was a positive thing. But, Sir, there is another accusation laid at the door of the United Party, and that is that in our War Measures Act we also made the death penalty compulsory for a person under the age of 18 years if he did certain things.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>The clause reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When a special High Court has convicted an accused who is under the age of 18 years, the court shall not be obliged to impose upon him any penalty prescribed by these regulations but it may deal with him as if it were a court constituted in accordance with the provisions of Section 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>What was Section 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act? It laid down the ordinary criminal procedure to be followed in the case of a juvenile. You see, Sir, how different the true story is.</p>

<p>I come back to the position of the layman under this Bill. As I have said, very few members on the other side, according to my judgment, have read this Bill. The few lawyers who have read it have been at logger-heads, as I have just proved. The ordinary man and the ordinary woman have to get their legal information from the legal people of South Africa. We have a population of more than 3,000,000 Whites, apart from the millions of non-Whites, but I am referring to the White people now. In 1957&#x2014;these are the latest figures that I could find&#x2014;there were 391 practising advocates and 3,230 attorneys, making a total of 3,626 lawyers who have to disseminate all this intricate knowledge contained in this measure to the laymen in this country, and, as I have pointed out, it is even beyond the grasp of the ordinary Nationalist member over there. These 3,626 lawyers have to desseminate a knowledge of what is contained in this Bill to 3,500,000 White people in this country, not to mention the non-White population. Sir, the hon. the Minister, when we put questions to him from this side, kept on saying &#x201C;Wait and see&#x201D;, and I think it is clear from that that the hon. the Minister himself has not read the Bill very carefully. It was perfectly clear to-night when the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) was speaking that he had not consulted the Minister of Labour about this Bill, but it was also very clear indeed when the members of the Bar Council came down to see him. According to their statement which appears in to-night&#x2019;s paper, it is very clear indeed that the Minister misunderstood the position. I say again that this is a piece of legislation which the ordinary layman will not understand. They do not know when and where and how it is going to draw them into its net and I say it is a thoroughly undesirable piece of legislation.</p>

But one thing she cannot accuse me of is my not having read the Bill, because even if I had not, at least I heard it here, because she read out the Bill, clause by clause, without succeeding in throwing any light on the subject. She also pointed out something else to us. I do not believe it will be necessary, after this long debate, for us further to consider the Bill in Committee, because the hon. member for Drakensberg has already fully dealt with the whole matter in Committee, clause by clause.</p>

<p>The hon. members on that side are now afraid that I am exposing them. I say it is this announcement made by the UN Committee&#x2019;s chairman that is making them so uneasy and so desperate, because the Opposition know that they will never be able to get into power with the support of the people here in South Africa, and they have always hoped that some miracle at UN would bring them into power here. That is why they are so afraid when there is peace and tranquillity in South Africa But they fear something else as well; they know that this Bill we are dealing with is an anti-communistic measure, and they are afraid that the Nationalist Government will be aclaimed by the West for introducing such legislation. That is why they look for something sinister behind this Bill. The hon. members for Zululand (Mr. Cadman), Wynberg (Mr. Russell) and Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) all insinuated that this measure was not directed at our bringing the communists to book, but was aimed at our political opponents. Why should we employ such devious means in order to overcome our political opponents? We have long since settled accounts with our political opponents in South Africa. They have suffered one defeat after another since 1948, each time with a greater and more overwhelming majority. Despite that the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) said that we do not rule &#x201C;by consent&#x201D;, but that we achieved these victories &#x201C;by coercion&#x201D;. Never has there been so much &#x201C;consent&#x201D; behind a ruling party in South Africa as there is behind this Nationalist Government. We have to-day 105 members in this House, and the laws we pass are framed with the knowledge and with the blessing of the people of South Africa, and that applies to this Bill as well. We have completely crushed the Opposition; the United Party is finished; the Progressive Party is as stillborn a party as the National Union. The hon. member for Houghton also said, <i>inter alia,</i> that this measure should be called &#x201C;The Intimidation law&#x201D; Let me tell her this: You cannot intimidate any person or party that is already dead. We find no pleasure in kicking a dead dog. This Bill is not aimed at our political opponents, as alleged by that side of the House. It is directed solely at those who by unconstitutional methods seek to take over the government of South Africa, those who intend using unconstitutional means in committing sabotage and in paralysing South Africa so as to able to get into power. In other words, this Bill is aimed solely at the communists and their ilk, their confederates. Our opponents know that very well; they need only refer to the Act of 1950, to the debate of 1950; they need only consider all the prognostications they made at that time, and ask themselves how many of those predictions came true, in order to convince themselves that not one of those things came about, and just as they talked nonsense at that time, so have they done nothing else in this debate but talk nonsense. The whole agitation against this measure is nothing else but a blind; it <span class="col_6429-6430" refersTo="page_0461"/>has absolutely nothing to do with the Bill. The rallies and the protest marches are in the first place merely intended as demonstrations to give the UNO Committee presently in South Africa the impression that things are in a very bad way in South Africa under the Nationalist Government. That is what they have up their sleeve with this agitation. It is a party-political agitation to stir up the outside world against South Africa through the medium of our visitors who are here as representatives of UN. It is being waged, amongst others, by political agitators in sacerdotal dress who do not hestitate to desecrate prayer and the House of God to achieve their ends.</p>

They know they will never get into power, but it is an attempt on the part of the Progressive Party to steal a march on the United Party, and the United Party will not allow it. So now they trot along together and run behind as long as the horse holds out. Who is busy at the moment leading the freedom rallies? There is Jan Steytler in Johannesburg, there is Ray Swart in Durban, there is a progressive here and a progressive there, and the old United Party horse tries to run along behind.

<p>I say that they are trying to steal a march on each other and they do not care what happens to South Africa. Just take note of the irresponsible things that are being said in this debate. I would like to refer to what the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) said. He said: &#x201C;This Bill shows a complete disregard for the individual rights of the people and it metes out punishment which bears the stamp of the Nazi jackboot&#x201D; And the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), whom I must call honourable just because the Rules of the House demand it: &#x201C;I call it &#x2018;The Hanging of Children&#x2019;s Bill And then the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman): &#x201C;This is a Nazi Bill. It is designed to camouflage dictatorship behind a fa&#x00E7;ade of democracy Those are the expressions they use, a Nazi state, a police state. They had a lot to say about democracy. We are now creating a police state. This Bill of ours is one which only dictators would introduce. But not one of those hon. members had the courage, when the hon. member for Houghton rose to move the only amendment which really gives expression to opposition against the Bill, to second that amendment. But they contend that this Bill will destroy democracy. Yet not one of them had the courage to stand up to second the amendment. And then they pose as the great apostles of democracy! When the Opposition talks about democracy, to them it simply means the right of the Opposition to rule over the Government. Then that is democracy in South Africa. That is all that they understand by democracy. As long as the Opposition is the United Party, and the Government is the National Party, they will continue to play that game. But we contemptuously reject that attitude of theirs. We say we shall govern according to the mandate given by the people of South Africa; we shall govern here and make such laws as the people have instructed us to make, and we shall not ask the Opposition whether we have the right to make those laws. We shall continue to carry out the will of the people.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, here comes the &#x201C;gevrekte Verenigde Party That is the choice expression we have just heard from the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. <span class="col_6431-6432" refersTo="page_0462"/>van Niekerk). The hon. member for Boksburg has put the 64,000 dollar question: &#x201C;Waarom hierdie wetsontwerp? And in the course of my remarks I wish to discuss that question and I intend to give the hon. member for Boksburg a reply to that question. The hon. member thinks we are afraid that the West will accept this South African Government. Well, I hope they will. I think of the words of Mr. Winston Churchill &#x201C;Let us go forward together&#x201D;. If we can find a road that will take us to the West, to acceptance by the powers of the West, I shall be very glad indeed. Now I don&#x2019;t think that the hon. member after he has praised this Bill should tell us that he is a confirmed democrat, because a democrat could certainly not praise a Bill of this kind.</p>

<p>I enter this debate, Mr. Speaker, as a layman with a feeling of trepidation, and I feel also with some becoming modesty. I am not a learned legal man; I am a layman; and I think I am justified in protesting to the hon. the Minister for introducing the Bill in the manner he has introduced it. The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) has expressed the difficulty that all laymen have in following this Bill. It is a series of amending Bills. It is a lawyer&#x2019;s holiday. I think the very least the hon. the Minister could have done was to have given us a separate Bill on Sabotage, and then perhaps the other amending clauses could have remained together. That is my first complaint. I tried very hard to understand the details of this Bill, its implications, and to make a study of it.</p>

<p>I have tried to make a study of the Bill by reading the speech of the hon. the Minister when he introduced the Bill and by reading the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I think those two speeches give one an opportunity to understand what it is all about. Mr. Speaker, I know it is very difficult for you to control this debate because there is a tendency amongst us all to drift away from the clauses and the strictly legal side of the Bill, but I was very encouraged this afternoon in listening to the speech of the hon. Chief Whip of the Government side, because in a 40-minute speech he never came within sight of the Bill. Not only did he not discuss the clauses of the Bill, but he never came near the principle of the Bill.</p>

<p>I will withdraw that, Sir. Then I can only say that he did not know what he was talking about. And if I may proceed further on the same lines, Mr. Speaker, I was also encouraged by the speech I heard this afternoon, a very fine speech, by the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser). The speech by the hon. member for Klerksdorp dwelt on the different policies and different outlooks of the two parties, the Government Party and the Opposition Party. He said that we were a party of &#x201C;Maars&#x201D; &#x201C;Buts&#x201D;. He said that we had to please the Mitchells. In our speeches we pleased both of the Mitchells. He said that the United Party had difficulty in satisfying its members in the urban areas and its members in the rural areas. I have not noticed that in this debate. Whatever the complaints may have been in the past, I have not noticed it to-day. I should like to say to the hon. member for Klerksdorp that he himself in this debate was able to tell us that he could praise this Bill. I say that the Government party has been trying to reconcile in this debate two points of view, the one mentioned by the hon. member for Boksburg, the democratic outlook, and the other the authoritarian outlook, the totalitarian outlook, call it what you will&#x2014;&#x201C;authoritarian&#x201D; is the word I like. It is obviously an authoritarian Bill, and they have been trying to reconcile these two points of view. Well, Sir, I wish to say that I am conditioned in understanding the implications of this Bill. I have been reading two very interesting books. We have been referred to what the United Party said during the war years. I am taking an authority who was well-informed, and I want to quote, perhaps at some length, from what he had to say, because from this I get the background I want. It is first-hand evidence. I am quoting from Dr. D. F. Malan &#x201C;Afrikaner Volkseenheid&#x201D;, and I quote from Chapter 31 &#x201C;Vreemde Ideologie&#x00EB;&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Suid-Afrikaanse volk was seker nooit sterker onder die invloed van vreemde ideologie&#x00EB; as gedurende die tydperk tussen die opkoms van Hitler in Duitsland en sy val en selfmoord in 1945 nie. Die grond was daarvoor vrugbaar. Daar was oorlog en die uitslag was vir geruime tyd heeltemal on-seker. Agter die milit&#x00EA;re mag aan die Duitse kant was daar die mag van &#x2019;n idee, nl. di&#x00E9; van &#x2019;n sterk regering gegrond op strenge volks dissipline en daarom in staat om alle euwels te oorwin en uit te roei.</block>

<block name="quote">Mag was die geheim, en die uitoefening daarvan, desnoods met geweld, was die middel. Die Nasionaal-sosialisme was die geloof. Die demokrasie of volksregering in enige vorm was beskou as swakheid, en daarom uit die bose. Hitler se Duitsland was in sekere bepaalde kringe in Suid-Afrika die ideaal, en organisasies met daardie doel-wit voor o&#x00EB; het ontstaan, almal ook in die verwagting dat die Duitse Nasionaal-sosialistiese regering die oorlog sou wen, en in Suid-Afrika dan minstens ook die toon sou kom aangee. So het onder andere ontstaan, in getroue navolging van die Duitse <span class="col_6433-6434" refersTo="page_0463"/>model, verskillende organisasies, o.a. die Steyn-Vorster-groep in Transvaal, die Ossewa-Brandwag, die Nuwe Orde, die Gryshemde, en ander hempbewegings van minder belang. Almal was Nasionaal-sosialisties van aard met &#x2019;n min of meer Suid-Afrikaanse kleur, maar met Duitsland as die bron van hul inspirasie. Hulle het geteer op die Afrikaner se republikeinse vryheids-gedagte, en het die demokrasie verwerp as &#x2019;n euwel. Die stryd was dan ook hoofsaaklik gerig teen die politieke partywese en meer besonderlik nog teen die Nasionale Party.</block>

I have been reading this wonderful book &#x201C;The Rise and Fall of the Third German Reich&#x201D;. Now I am not going to say that this is a Nazi Bill, but I do say that we are moving perilously in the same direction. We are moving forward from one totalitarian Bill to another. If we go back to the 1950 Bill, the Communist Bill, and compare it with what we have to-day, we find we have moved a very, very long way indeed. Mr. Speaker, I want to put this question honestly to my friends on the other side: Is it true that the criticism we have made of this Bill, reveals, as one of the best papers in this country, the <i>Burger,</i> seems to imply in its articles, that it does not matter whether these are protests or not, that it will all blow away. Nobody will be concerned about it; they will accept it as the system in South Africa; and that this is merely a temporary movement?</p>

He is a member of the Liberal Party and he was imprisoned for about three months last year. If the Government had power to do that without any trial, they have very great powers without these additional powers. Then there was Professor Matthews, who had been a professor of a university. He was also imprisoned for a very long period. I know the Government felt that anybody who expressed liberal views should be put in gaol.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members have maintained that the powers existing now are insufficient to maintain law and order, and I say that the powers the Government has had have been sufficient.</p>

<p>I am coming to the next point. The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) said that everybody in South Africa, non-Whites and English-speaking people as well, welcomed the Bill. I don&#x2019;t know what authority he has for saying that. You may find a handful of English-speaking people who welcome this Bill. I can assure you that the people I meet, the people I know, do not welcome this Bill.</p>

<p>I now come to one or two of the clauses of the Bill. I want to point out that it is a Bill on certain principles, communist principles. In this debate when we find that speeches become difficult, we say &#x201C;come back to the Bill&#x201D;. That means that we have to discuss the clauses, which we should discuss in Committee. That is what it amounts to. What I have been saying and what hon. members here have been discussing are the background and the reasons for the Bill. That is in order at the second reading. I want to deal with Clause 5, which I think is a most unfortunate one. It is the clause dealing with newspapers. I think this clause is ill-advised. The Bill says that a newspaper must pay a deposit of not more than R20,000 to the Minister of the Interior before being registered. This means that the hon. the Minister can ask any newspaper to deposit R20,000 and make a free loan to the Government.</p>

<p>That may be, but you may have another Minister who may say that another paper which is not communistic but may be a United Party paper, or any other paper, should forfeit its deposit.

<p>But what is the interpretation of Communism to-day? It says &#x201C;any of the aims of Communism&#x201D;. Now there are people who have been communists and who regarded the communist movement as a socialist movement as preached by Karl Marx in the 19th century. I think they were wrong, but there are people who would hold that point of view, and it is unreasonable for any member, like the hon. member for Standerton, to impute motives to people. I say that there are many people to-day who say &#x201C;I am labeled a communist, but I have never had a communist outlook&#x201D;. I will give you one example, Patrick Duncan. Patrick Duncan a communist?</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not holding a brief for anybody, but we know that it is the last thing in the world of politics to describe Patrick Duncan as a communist. You may say that he can be described as a negrophilist. You may say that he supports African nationalism. That is possible. I cannot subscribe to the view that any man who is a nationalist is a communist, and I think the hon. the Minister is confusing the two. No, I think that R20,000 should come out of the Bill. It should never have been in the Bill. That is one clause. I am now, what they call, coming back to the Bill. I come to Clause 1. Like all the others it describes gatherings. It says &#x201C;any gathering, concourse or procession&#x201D;&#x2026; except in such cases as the Minister or a magistrate may expressly authorize at any time. In other words it introduces more authority for the Minister. He feels that he has not got sufficient authority at present. I think he has more than sufficient at present to carry on. We come to another clause. This time it is Clause 3, &#x201C;prohibition to attend any particular gathering &#x2026;&#x201D; except in such cases as may be expressly authorized by the Minister. Again, the authority rests with the Minister to say what can be published, where the man can hold a meeting, etc. Too much power vests in the Minister without any appeal. Now I come to Clause 7. &#x201C;The Minister may prohibit the assembly as defined in the Riotous Assemblies Act except in such cases as he may specify or authorize or a gathering of a particular nature if he is satisfied that the activities of any person or organization is furthering or may further the achievement of any of the aims of Communism.&#x201D; Surely, Sir, that is too vague. Surely the Minister should not have the power to say: &#x201C;This meeting you are going to have or this gathering or whatever you are going to do, may further the aims of Communism.&#x201D; He does not know. It may; there is that possibility. I do not think that power should ever be placed in the hands of any man, least of all the Minister.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I am quoting from my notes and the Bill. I want to say that if there is to be any hope for us in South Africa, if we are to make any attempt to deal with the difficult situation here to-day, we cannot possibly deal with it by giving increased powers every year, or every two or three years to the Minister. We can deal with the situation in this country to-day by calling out the troops, calling out the police. There comes an end to that. There has come an end to that in every democratic State. We are after all only 20 per cent of the population. We cannot go on doing this forever and the 20 per cent of the population are not united on this question. Half of the White people of this country do not agree with what the Government is doing. Hon. members on my left tell me that the people are agreed. They agreed in Germany&#x2014;Thyssen agreed, Krupp agreed, big businessmen and big industrialists agreed but they regretted it. They found afterwards that they had agreed to a party that seized power and reduced them to servants of the State instead of being independent people as they had been. I do not think there is any doubt as to what should happen to this Bill. I think the agitation in the country is completely justified. I do not know why hon. members and their newspapers try to intimidate people who are associated with these protest movements. Surely people still have the right to protest; surely the Black Sash has the right to protest? Why not? Is it not a free country? Why should a gang of hooligans in Johannesburg be permitted to break up these people&#x2019;s demonstrations? I think it is a disgrace to this country, and I think it is a disgrace to any Government that permits it. There was a war to end a war. What we will have some day will be a law to end laws. It will not be necessary to have a Bill then. The Minister is getting nearer and nearer to a dictatorship. That was how it came about in Germany. This is how it is coming about in our country. The steps which are being taken here were also taken in Germany: firstly increased power, then big industrialists faced with intimidation, then people were forbidden to demonstrate in any way. Hon. members say that some of the English-speaking people agree with them! Ninety per cent of the Germans followed Hitler! They followed Hitler to the grave he had dug for them. That was the end. This Government is going along the same path. It has not reached the same end yet. Unless they retrace their steps, they will land this country in the same difficulty. Hon. members know that. Where in the world are we accepted? When they vote at UNO, we get one vote.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir. I have said the hon. member for Kensington must be very careful before he makes remarks of that nature. We are here in a House of Assembly as the chosen representatives of the people&#x2014;both the members on the Government side as well as the members on the Opposition side. He must be careful because we do not only remember what the United Party said during the war years, but what the United Party did during the war years. Now in discussing this Bill we should rather not uncover the laws of the United Party. The hon. member has quoted from a book by the late Dr. D. F. Malan. The hon. member made that quotation out of a very small extract of a book which had no relation whatsoever to the whole spirit of that book, not only because it suited his political purpose to-night, but also because in the heart of that hon. member and in the heart of the party to which he belongs they despise the whole way of life and thinking, the life and struggle of Dr. D. F. Malan. He has tried to show that the National Party is based and founded on what he has quoted. No, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Kensington is wrong in his quotation and in his thinking. He has always been wrong; that is why he is sitting where he sits. The National Party is based on the foundation which was laid by the late General J. B. M. Hertzog at De Wild in 1912 when he said &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;. This immediately brings me to this Bill which is based on the principle of &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;. Not only the welfare of the Nationally-inclined or the Afrikaans-speaking section, but of the White and the non-White, the Coloured and the Indian, of all racial groups in South Africa, is put first in this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member has referred disparagingly to the provision in the Bill that R20,000 must be deposited by a newspaper which may possibly spread communist propaganda.

I want to thank the hon. the Minister of Justice for having the courage of his convictions and introducing this Bill.

<p>That is a sore point, Sir. I say, Mr. Speaker, that the United Party have become the patron of the revolutionary concept in South Africa while this Bill is seeking the protection of democracy. I repeat that every peace-loving citizen of the Republic of South Africa will actually be grateful to the Minister of Justice for the timeous introduction of this Bill. Here we are dealing with this contradiction that members of the Opposition are rising one after the other and saying that in principle they support this Bill; they say that they are also opposed to Communism and that they are opposed to sabotage and saboteurs in South Africa. But they are putting up this tremendous fight in the House of Assembly against this Bill.</p>

<p>This Bill is being introduced because since the National Party took office in 1948, legislative measures have already been adopted in order to combat Communism and revolutionary ideas in South Africa but despite that fact, cunning elements in South Africa are always looking for loopholes. Do you know, Sir, I want to say to-night that while we are holding this debate in the House of Assembly, the supreme legislative organ of South Africa, dark forces outside this House are already seeking loopholes in this measure in order to further Communism in South Africa. That is the company in which the United Party find themselves as a result of the attitude they have adopted during this debate, that is to say they find themselves in the company of dark forces which are continually seeking loopholes, and not with the object of under-mining the National Party, but to undermine destroy and vilify the country in which we all live.

<p>I am now discussing Sam Kahn who sat on the other side of the House. When the Suppression of Communism Act was introduced, the Opposition said that he was not a communist, but just simply a Cape liberal. Sam Kahn then rose and said he was a communist. The United Party however, refused to regard him as such. I therefore, say that the Opposition would not recognize a communist if they saw one, at any rate not until he had done South <span class="col_6447-6448" refersTo="page_0470"/>Africa so much harm and damage that it could no longer be remedied. We are here dealing with a very serious matter. We are giving South Africa legislation with which to clamp down on Communism, to clamp down on saboteurs, to combat the hostile Press which is spreading poison amongst those population groups in South Africa who have not yet reached full maturity, and to put an end to this position. But while the National Party is giving South Africa this protective measure, the Opposition are affording protection to these elements which I have mentioned.</p>

The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) in his own inimitable and colourful way, merely associated the names of the two Mitchells, only for the sake of rhetorical effect. It has, however, been used by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, as well as by the <i>Burger,</i> for the purpose of showing that there is disunity in the United Party as regards its attitude to this measure. There is, however, no such disunity at all. We stand 100 per cent united, and the hon. member for Germiston (District), the hon. member for South Coast and others whose names have been mentioned, are completely united in their attitude to this Bill, and which is also the attitude of the United Party as a whole.</p>

<p>What did the hon. the Minister of Justice then do? After saying that, he went on to build up a panic mentality in the minds of the people, trying to justify the immediate introduction of this Bill. Hon. members opposite cannot deny that that is the purpose of this Bill. The Minister wants the best of both worlds; because on the one hand he says that the country is calm and peaceful, but then goes on to build up a state of fear in the minds of the public. This Bill has been brought in, in order to embarrass the United Party, because the Government thought the United Party would be afraid to face the moral issues involved in the Bill. The Government thought that the United Party would worry only about the possible loss of political support. It has, therefore, come as a shock to them to see that we are taking a stand on what we regard as being morally right, on what is in the interests of the country and its people. Posterity will prove how correct the stand of the United Party has been. The conception of this Bill is morally wrong, and what is morally wrong can never be politically right. That is why we are not prepared to support it.</p>

<p>It has been shown right throughout history that Communism only succeeds where poverty exists. On the other hand, there is no Communism where people are prosperous and happy. If we have to judge the state of our people in terms of this Bill, then we would have to judge them as being an unhappy people, living in an unhappy land. Instead of bringing in legislation of this nature, why not bring in legislation which will have the effect of cementing the two White sections of the people? Why do they not bring in legislation to do away with single-medium education in this country?</p>

<p>The timing of this Bill, Sir, has been most unfortunate. If there was any consideration for the welfare of South Africa in the mind of the Government, it would not have brought this Bill in at a time when two members of UNO are visiting this country! Our intention is to give them a good and favourable image of South Africa, but is this the way in which that can be achieved? On the contrary, we indicate to them that we are divided; we show to them people in protest marches. No, Sir, the timing has been entirely incorrect like it is with about every measure this Government introduces, thereby giving South Africa a bad name in the outside world. What is the ultimate effect of this Bill going to be? Its effect will be that it will drive movements such as those the Minister is endeavouring to combat, underground and then we will not know, as we did in the past, what is going on. Has the hon. Minister ever listened to the crowd in Hyde Park in London? I believe he has. Has he noticed that the people of Great Britain, or any other visitor for that matter, enjoy absolute freedom of speech to express themselves in whatever manner they choose? They can even attack the principle of the Crown! But why are they allowed to do that? The Government allows that for one reason only, namely to give the people an opportunity of expressing their views in public so that the Government can know what the people think. We can in future never be in that position under the terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>We speak here of opposing Communism and the principle of Socialism. May I remind hon. members that it was no other than the <span class="col_6451-6452" refersTo="page_0472"/>hon. the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who introduced two motions into this House not so long ago, in which the principle of Socialism was supported in so far as its application to the gold mines and banks were concerned.</p>

<p>I have as little reason to withdraw that as the S.A.B.C. is likely to make a withdrawal of a statement it made last night or this morning concerning the interview which the Law Council had with the Minister of Justice. The S.A.B.C. stated that the Law Council at its interview with the Minister indicated that it would support the Bill. This statement has, however, now been denied by the chairman of the Law Council. Will the hon. the Minister also ask the S.A.B.C. to withdraw the statement, and to make an apology to the Law Council? If we are going to get the non-Europeans of this country on our side to work with us, as hon. members on the other side have said is happening, it is necessary that we give some positive indication to them that we do want them on our side, and not on the side of the communists. We have to create a Bantu nationalism in this country that will be prepared to work with White nationalism. If we are not going to work up a sincere Bantu nationalism, as opposed to Bantu racialism, then we are indeed in for bad times. The warning we want to sound, Sir, is that the authoritarian powers which the Government is taking under this Bill, are going to have no other effect than to work up racialism of the Bantu against the White people of this country. That is something which we must avoid at all costs. We must also avoid a lack of confidence in the thinking of the Bantu, thereby helping them to drift to Islamism instead of keeping them within the fold of the Christian churches. Unless there is a better approach by the White people, we are going to find that the Bantu will drift away to Islam.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging said that &#x201C;the Government had all the powers to combat Communism which appeared in the open&#x201D;, and that this Bill was necessary for one reason only, namely in order to fight Communism which had gone underground.

Mr. Speaker, if the hon. the Minister maintains and is honest in his convictions, that freedom of speech is not destroyed in this Bill, then why did he go so far and immediately ban meetings on the Parade at Cape Town and on the steps of the City Hall in Johannesburg? The two statements are irreconcilable. Either there is freedom, and it is not necessary to ban meetings, or there is no freedom and you have to ban meetings. You cannot have it both ways.

Three times as many immigrants are brought into Australia in one month, as we are bringing into South Africa in one year. That is due to the loss of confidence which has been brought about in this country as a result of legislation of this nature.</p>

<p>What about the powers the Minister already has, and which I maintain, and we on this side maintained throughout this debate and tried to convince the Minister, are great enough and wide enough to control and to contain any dangers of Communism in this country? If we had the position that this was legislation of a temporary nature to deal with an emergency at the moment, and if we thought that legislation of this nature had to be made available to the Minister, then it might have been understandable. But this is now to become a permanent feature of our legislation, and it is going to be enforced in terms of this Bill. It is no good the Minister of Justice telling us that he will administer it in a reasonable way. I believe he will, as long as he is Minister of Justice.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>It was interesting to see how hon. members opposite tried during the past two days to pretend that they are opposed to Communism and that they are opposed to sabotage. Now I should like to say at once that hon. members opposite have never yet tried to fight Communism; they have never been opposed to it; they have always been opposed to all legislation from this side whereby we wished to combat Communism. They have always been on the side of the communists in the past, and whatever they have done was calculated to try to further Communism. Now I see that the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) over there sits glaring at me, but if he will listen to me, I shall tell him a little of the history of his own party. When the Suppression of Communism Act was before this House in 1950, the attitude of the present hon. Leader of the Opposition was that it was not necessary to combat Communism. Now I should like to quote from a speech he made in this House. He said this in the House in 1950&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister has said that Communism is a snake and he intends to destroy it before it can strike. It seems to me that in the condition which will be created as a result of the introduction of this law, snakes will thrive, and what he will destroy will be a lot of very useful earthworms.</block>

<p>And then the hon. Leader continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Party&#x2019;s attitude is that we have gone too far. Now I think the position is this. On the one side we have a law which transgresses against all the principles of freedom and justice upon which our democracy is founded.</block>

<p>Then the hon. Leader goes further and in fact used an attitude that an overseas newspaper in Canada adopted as the basis for the attitude of his party. He quoted it to the House and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be found that the communist problem can be contained by applying the laws already on the statute book.</block>

<p>Just what they are saying to-day. They are saying to-day also that the laws we have on our Statute Book already are good enough and we need not pass further laws. Then he continues and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Laws which protect the rights of honest men&#x2026; if a lack of police resources prevents their proper application, then these resources should be strengthened, but to swing to measures of repression would be neither good sense nor good democracy. It would in effect do exactly what the communists would like to see done.</block>

<p>And then I read that when this Act was before the House, the following persons voted against the second reading. That is to say, they voted against the principle of the Suppression of Communism Bill. I find the following names of persons who are still sitting on the opposite side: Mr. Gay, Sir de Villiers Graaff, Mr. Higgerty, Hopewell, Mitchell, S. J. M. Steyn, Maj. van der Byl, Mr. Warren and Mr. Waterson. That was the attitude of the Party opposite at that time. But, Mr. Speaker, when the Report of the Select Committee on the Suppression of Communism Bill was before this House, Dr. C. F. Steyn, a frontbencher of the United Party, had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6455-6456" refersTo="page_0474"/>We realize that we have thrown in our lot with the Western Powers and that we must take every step to support our Western allies. On the other hand we must be very careful not to do anything in this country which would in any way embarrass our allies overseas.</block>

<p>In other words, the attitude is that we should allow the communists because we must not embarrass our communist allies overseas. And then Dr. Steyn moved an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this matter I propose to move an amendment and it may be advisable to read it to the House at this stage. I move&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">To add at the end &#x201C;subject to the following conditions, that paragraphs 2, 4, 6 and 7 of the Committee&#x2019;s findings be rejected and (2) that no action be taken by the Minister of Justice in terms of Section 5 of the Suppression of Communism Act, as amended, in regard to both Mr. Kahn and Mr. Carneson.</block>

<p>In this case the Select Committee had decided on the future of Mr. Kahn and Mr. Carneson, and here is an amendment proposed by the Opposition that no action should be taken to restrict these two arch-communists in South Africa.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I shall return to the time when they were still in power and governed the country. At that time they not only pampered the communists, but as fast as the communists were rounded up by the police, they were being released from prison by the Minister of Justice and the United Party of that time. Now I should like to quote from the book &#x201C;Time longer than Rope&#x201D; by Edward Roux. He writes as follows on Dr. Steyn&#x2019;s antics at that time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Justice, Dr. Colin Steyn, responded suitably to this change-over on the part of the communists. Two White communists, Dr. Max Joffe, and his brother Louis who had spent many months in an internment camp, were released in September 1941. The communists were able to carry on their agitation for the repeal of the pass laws.</block>

<p>They were permitted at that time to sabotage the laws of the land. He proceeds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The intervention of Dr. Colin Steyn usually secured his release. This was the experience of Moses Kotane, Secretary of the Communist Party.</block>

<p>Even Moses Kotane, Mr. Speaker, was released by Dr. Colin Steyn of the United Party Government of the time, to continue his subversive activities in South Africa. He proceeds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He had gone to Bloemfontein to support candidate of the party during the Native Representative Council election campaign in November 1942. Communist protests against the arrest of the &#x201C;leader of the Party whose whole energies are bent towards the successful prosecution of the war against the Axis enemies&#x201D; were successful and Kotane was released.</block>

<p>In 1951, when the Suppression of Communism Act was amended in this House, the then Minister of Justice explained how Sam Kahn was busy evading the provisions of the Act. The hon. Minister at the time said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No one blames these people for appealing to the courts in order to protect certain rights to which they believed they were entitled. It is clear, however, that these applications before the court were based on technical points only, their only object being to adopt delaying tactics.</block>

<p>Now I should like to adopt the view that hon. members opposite now also are making objections, and are putting up all kinds of trivial arguments, which are really also calculated to give the communists an opportunity in their great pattern to continue their delaying tactics. For a portion of this legislation before us seeks, indeed, to close the loopholes. But to this Mr. Lawrence said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I dislike his politics (that is Sam Kahn&#x2019;s politics) but I regard this Bill as an anti-Kahn Bill. It is a vicious Bill because it was introduced into this House in pursuance of a vendetta against one member of the House.</block>

<p>That is why, he says, he is opposed to that Act. Thus members opposite continued their offensive during those years also. Dr. Colin Steyn of the time had the following to say when that matter was before Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would ask that that principle be applied here. Here we have a member of Parliament who was elected as a communist quite openly and who took his seat here as a communist. Are we going to allow it that this legislation removes him from his seat and deny him the right to represent his constituents.</block>

<p>In other words, Mr. Speaker, they have always adopted the attitude that if a communist can secure representation here and can state his case here, he should be protected. In this connection I should also like to quote what was said further by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). He said the following in this debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think there were reasons, with which I shall deal later. But so far the Committee was unanimous in coming to the conclusion that Mr. Kahn had been a member of the Communist Party of South Africa, and by <span class="col_6457-6458" refersTo="page_0475"/>finding that, if the House endorses that conclusion, the Minister is placed in a position that he can take action.</block>

<p>He goes further and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They found Mr. Kahn was a communist in terms of Section 1 of the Act.</block>

<p>Now we should remember that the man who said this shortly afterwards voted against the same Act and voted against this communist being subjected to restraint. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We found that before promulgation of the Act, he (Kahn) had professed to be a communist.</block>

<p>In other words, the United Party conceded that he was a communist.</p>

<block name="quote">They found that before promulgation of the Act he had been active in furthering the objects of Communism and that both before and after promulgation of the Act both of them advocated, defended and encouraged acts of omission which were calculated to further the achievement of the objects of Communism, as defined in Section 1 of the Act.</block>

<p>Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Kahn admitted that he had been a member of the Communist Party of South Africa while that party was in existence.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having read these things to you, I think we can legitimately say here that hon. members opposite in the past not only assisted Communism here, but that they have always secretly in their hearts been in favour of Communism. They need no longer get up in this House and try to create the impression that they are opposed to Communism, and that they are against all forms of sabotage also. I should like now to proceed to the next point. If we were to listen to what hon. members opposite have said during the past two days in this debate, then we have to come to the involuntary conclusion that the saboteur is a person who in fact should be protected, and to whom a very great injustice is done when he is brought to book. They have carried on here to show how violent this Act is, how in-just the law is, and how inequitable it is as against the persons the Act is dealing with. But if we take the Bill itself, we might perhaps take another look at Clause 21, to see with whom we are dealing. For they are the people who are regarded by hon. members opposite as the people who are being treated so unjustly and unfairly in a democratic country. If we look at Clause 21, we see that sabotage is an act that is committed by any person, and which is intentionally and unlawfully committed against the health and safety of the public. Sabotage means the sabotaging of law and order. Sabotage, in terms of this Bill, means that the water supplies of the country are polluted and contaminated and that the lives on persons, White and non-White, are endangered. Sabotage means that power stations may be blown up, bridges may be destroyed, hospitals may be blown up, that radio communications may be destroyed, that property of the State may be destroyed and damaged in all kinds of ways. These are the acts that, according to hon. members opposite, should not be restrained by law. If hon. members opposite are opposed to this legislation, the consequence of their attitude is that they are giving protection to all persons who commit these types of acts. The only conclusion we can draw is that if a person commits these acts, they are not against him, they do not wish to do anything to stop him doing so, and they will not permit the Government to protect lives and property against those acts that are committed. In other words then, they are in favour of the commission of these acts without the guilty party being brought to book. But hon. members opposite say they are opposed to Communism. I have already indicated that we do not believe they are against Communism. They have never been against Communism, but because it suits them, they are now indicating that they are opposed to Communism and sabotage. If then they are against Communism, one can accept, if they are opposed to this legislation, that they say that existing legislation is adequate to cope with sabotage. Let us now concede that existing legislation is adequate to combat sabotage and that therefore they will differentiate, in regard to this Bill before us, between the clauses containing new provisions and the provisions containing the old provisions. For, Mr. Speaker, in this Bill there definitely are new clauses that are being introduced because we regard them as necessary to give the Government an opportunity to combat sabotage thoroughly. But we should remember that a part of this Bill really seeks to amend existing legislation. Hon. members opposite have told us that existing legislation is adequate to combat sabotage. But now it has in practice become quite clear that there are certain loopholes, that there are certain opportunities for the communists to evade this legislation. And, as with all legislation, it is only when it is applied in practice that it is discovered what weak spots there are in the law. So all laws have originated from a small law that is continually amended. For people who have to deal with this law, and who are affected by this law, are persons who do all in their power and who with the best advice at their disposal, thoroughly examine legislation to see how they can discover the loopholes in it. For that reason we have to accept that this Suppression of Communism Act of 1950 also is one that contains its defects. If hon. members opposite were to say now that they are opposed to Communism and sabotage, and that they are in favour of the application of existing legislation, and that they now wish to be the foster-parents with us for existing legislation, then <span class="col_6459-6460" refersTo="page_0476"/>surely I am entitled also to draw the inference that hon. members will agree that this part of the Bill that does not contain new provisions, but is merely overhauling the old provisions, will be supported by them. Surely then we have the right to expect hon. members opposite also to be fair, in order to overhaul a law, which as they say we should use and which is good enough, in so far as there may be defects in it. If hon. members are not prepared to help us in regard to all the points where we desire to overhaul existing legislation, we may draw the legitimate inference that they refuse to permit us to use any legislation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us now examine the Bill itself, and then we find it deals with the following matters. In the first instance there is an extension of powers. According to this Bill a person who has been charged under the Act and convicted, has to report to the police. Secondly: Such a person may not change his employment without reporting to the police. Thirdly: His statements may not be published by anybody. Fourthly: It gives the power to restrict throwers of bombs; to restrict their movements. Fifthly: Sabotage is defined in this Bill for the first time. Those, Mr. Speaker, are then in the first instance the main provisions that comprise the new provisions of this Bill. But in the second instance this Bill contains a number of provisions which, as I have said, hon. members opposite surely will not mind supporting, for they are the people who have said that existing legislation is adequate, and they are satisfied that existing legislation be used. But this existing legislation that has to be applied, as they say, contains certain defects and loopholes. Hon. members opposite surely will not mind weaknesses being removed from this Act which they wish to use. Will the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), who is now sitting and staring at me so, reply to this question and say whether he agrees?</p>

<p>Are you prepared to do so? Mr. Speaker, I could have known that no hon. members opposite will accept no new legislation trying to rectify the defects in the old legislation which they so keenly want. They do not intend to do so&#x2014;not the new provisions, nor the overhauling of the old provisions.</p>

<p>I have already told the House that this Bill now before us, <i>inter alia,</i> also seeks to overhaul existing legislation, and now I should like to take the Bill itself and page through it from the beginning. [Interjections.] Clause 1 deals with the holding of gatherings. It concerns the abuse of meetings. It has also been stated by the hon. the Minister here, that when the old Act was passed, gatherings were defined with a view to making it comprehensive enough to stop communists from abusing gatherings. I say the meaning that should be added to the Act is the meaning that it should be comprehensive enough to stop a communist from attending a gathering. But the matter was tested and in Rex v. Kahn the Judges attached a further meaning to the intention of the Act. The court limited the meaning of the Act, namely that the gathering, or the people attending a gathering, should have a common purpose, and they interpreted it as being a gathering where people meet to achieve something with a common purpose. With this new connotation that has been added to Section 1, the operation of the Act was rendered impossible, for it is very clear that if this connotation is given to the Act, there is hardly a gathering a communist cannot attend. Indeed, from the evidence in this case, it was very clear that Mr. Brian Bunting, a person who was excluded, continued his subversive activities, and I should like to read from the law report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On 10 July 1954, the appellant attended a party given by Mr. and Mrs. Bunting at their private residence at Clifton near Cape Town. He and a number of other persons had been invited to the party by the Buntings, and the total number who attended amounted to approximately 60 persons. Some of the guests were invited verbally. Others received a written invitation.</block>

<p>It is very clear that when they were prohibited from holding a gathering under this Act, they began to hold house parties in order to continue their subversive activities. The invitation they issued read as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">You are invited to a party to be held at Sonia and Brian&#x2019;s home on Saturday, 10 July 1954 at 8.15 p.m. Dancing and refreshments.</block>

<p>Then the evidence continues that on this occasion they in fact abused this so-called dance party in order to hold a meeting. What this Bill seeks to do is to prevent people from evading the law, and Clause 1 provides that a gathering includes all gatherings that persons who are listed may not attend. [Interjections.] Because the definition of a gathering is therefore rectified in Clause 1, it is possible under Clause 3 to provide that nobody may attend a gathering if he is a listed communist, and it is put beyond all doubt. Now I should like to tell hon. members this. While they also wish to be foster-parents to the Act to combat sabotage and Communism, are they then prepared to support this Bill? For if they are not prepared to do so, they are intentionally supporting the idea that a communist should be able to find a loophole under Clause 1.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Can it not be combated now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from><span class="col_6461-6462" refersTo="page_0477"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks a very stupid question. I have said the Act intends that it should be combated, but in practice gatherings are construed in such a way that it is causing difficulty, and do you know, Sir, who the judges were who gave this judgment? Two of the judges who gave this judgment were Judge Fagan and Judge Centlivres. No one knows where it comes from too. But that is not all. Permit me to refer to Clause 2. There it is provided that unlawful gatherings of organizations will be combated. This clause deals with the declaring unlawful of communist organizations. The old Act gives the State President the power to declare organizations unlawful. In order to do that, there has to be an extensive inquiry, and it may continue for months, and then a report must be made to the Minister. From the very nature of things it takes time, and it does not merely take time in the normal way, but the inquiry normally lasts a long time because you are dealing with a client who wants to delay the inquiry as much as possible. In practice then it does come about that the communist organization in the course of this inquiry, pops up in another form. The Minister has mentioned an example of what has happened in Rhodesia that if a party is banned, it continues to exist under another name. But now the State President may declare an organization unlawful if he is satisfied that it is merely the continuation of an organization that has already been banned. You will understand, Sir, that if the law says that an organization may be declared unlawful after such a lengthy inquiry, it is the easiest thing in the world for the same persons to pop up immediately thereafter in the form of another organization. We have the same example here. Communists who have been listed, are continuing their activities under the guise of the Congress of Democrats. Now I once again ask hon. members opposite, while they are adopting the attitude that the old laws are adequate, I say here we simply have an overhaul of the old legislation to close a loophole, are they now prepared to help us overhaul those old laws? No, hon. members will vote against the Bill, for they have never intended helping to combat Communism effectively.</p>

<p>The same goes for Clause 4. That also is an overhaul of existing legislation. It deals with the prohibition of listed persons from being officials of organizations. The notices have to be served directly on the persons. It is the practice of these people to belong to a large number of organizations. Now you will appreciate that if the persons belong to a whole series of organizations&#x2014;and we know it is part of the tactics of Communism not to have only one organization but many of them&#x2014;I say there are many of those organizations that are being caressed by those hon. members opposite. They belong to a large number of organizations and that means that a list will have to be compiled and has to be served on the persons, and if there are a couple of hundred, it means that much administrative work has to be done to serve all the notices. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#acting_speaker">

<p>Order! The hon. member for Sea Point must please keep quiet now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>So it means that the listed persons now will receive their notices in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and should it happen that that person is prohibited from being an official of a series of these organizations, it means that if further organizations emerge, it will no longer be necessary to search for all of them and serve notices upon them. It is enough only to publish the names in the <i>Gazette.</i> I do not call this clause a new principle either, but an administrative overhaul. Even this clause, to which no reasonable person can object, will not be supported by those hon. members.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with the appearance of newspapers under new names. In terms of the Newspaper and Imprint Act, which is being amended here, a newspaper proprietor may register a whole series of names, and if it were to happen that he is prohibited from publishing a newspaper under one name, as in the case of the <i>Guardian,</i> he can easily use another name tomorrow. Now two things are being done here. In the first place, a deposit is required from all suspect persons. The Minister of Justice is not the person who in the first place will be dealing with the registration of newspapers, but the Minister of the Interior will be, but he shall have to consult the Minister of Justice, and in all cases where there is reason to believe that a newspaper will have to be banned, the Minister may require a deposit. I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), who expressed his appreciation to the Minister for the neat manner in which he uses this deterrent. The only objection I personally have, is that I should like to see the Minister not stopping him at a first conviction, but requiring a further deposit of R20,000, and he could as well let it run to R100,000, so that if the money is to be confiscated, it will be well worth while. But that is only my view. In any event this clause should serve as an adequate deterrent to prevent any person with suspicious motives from beginning the publication of a newspaper. But what is important, is that the Minister forces these newspaper proprietors who register a number of names, to publish forthwith, otherwise the reserve newspaper names will lapse after 30 days.</p>

<p>So we can go on with all the clauses. It was not really my intention to explain the clauses, for the Minister has already done so and it can also be done at the Committee Stage. But the point I wish to make is that this Act in the first place contains an overhaul of the existing laws, and secondly it introduces certain new ideas. Now my point is this: I can understand when those hon. members tell me that they do not want any new legislation, and that they will stand or fall by the old legislation. But if they stand by the old legislation, and also wish to appropriate it, this side is entitled at least to hear from them whether they will support this <span class="col_6463-6464" refersTo="page_0478"/>portion of the legislation we want to overhaul, but I know they will not do so.

Like other speakers opposite, he got very close to saying that we on this side defend Communism. The position is that I do not think the Government really understands what Communism actually is.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that we are determined to ensure the maintenance of law and order, and why we oppose this Bill is that it affects the rights of the individual. The hon. member for Boksburg said that all the protest marches we hear about outside and all the uproar that is going on at present was brought on by political agitators, but what about all the services held in churches? When people go to the churches they go to pray that the Government will be guided along the right path. It is also said that the uproar is intended to impress the members of the UN Committee, but I am quite sure that the agitation going on outside is not intended to impress them, but I am just wondering what they are thinking of it. [Interjections.] A Bill of this nature, introduced into this House, coupled with the statements by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Defence increasing the size of our army, what impression does that create in the outside world? What is happening in this country? Are we living in a state of perpetual emergency? This Bill, we are told, is aimed at Communism, but this Bill can be aimed at anyone, and at all the political parties. The Minister has the power under this Bill to suppress any organization and to stop any meeting under the guise of Communism. The Coloured people recently tried to get together to air their views, but they were refused permission to hold that meeting under the Suppression of Communism Act, and they were forced to hold their meeting elsewhere. That gives you an idea of what can really happen. The Minister has already told us that when the Bill becomes law it is his intention to stop meetings on the Parade and on the steps of the City Hall in Johannesburg. It has also been asked what the U.P. has done to combat Communism. I say that the U.P. has always believed in the freedom of the individual, and under this Bill it is possible surreptitiously to have a person named as a communist. They then lose their liberty. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) spoke about the effect on the trade unions. I wonder whether hon. members really know what effect this Bill will have on trade unions? Our trade unions have been free from Communism, but they have always had the fear of intimidation. They never know when the police will walk into their offices and search through their records and their homes, and they may be detained as well, and can be held for 12 days without any reason being given. The hon. member for Heilbron has told us about the anti-Communist laws in America. If the Minister really wants to combat Communism, why does he not adopt the method they have in the U.S.A. and set up a tribunal, and summons suspected persons to appear in front of that tribunal, take evidence with the right to cross-examine, and if they are guilty take action against them. In America these hearings are televised and millions of people can actually witness the examination of suspected communists. But here a person is named and he has no right of appeal. He can only write to the Minister. They cannot go to court about it. I appeal to the Minister of Justice that if he wants to suppress Communism, let us go the right way about it and let us deal with the matter through the courts, where these people can be examined under oath. [Interjections.] The House treats this matter lightly. Members opposite treat it as a joke, but it is a matter of grave concern to the country. The public outside are not stirred up by agitators. The public outside returned every one of us to this House, and are not happy with the position in this country to-day.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>What you see outside is the stirring up of the conscience of the public, and you cannot ignore it and you cannot keep it down, not even under this Bill. They will have their say. You will stop them on the City Hall steps and on the Parade, but they will still have their say. We on this side are not here to defend Communism, but to defend the rights of the individual, and people of all parties. In terms of this Bill, it could be said that a person who propounds the theory of one man one vote, is stirring up the feelings in the country and might be declared a communist, and it would be possible under this Bill to ban a party like the Progressive Party or the Liberal Party, and if we are in power, under this Bill we could decide that the Nationalist Party was a danger to the country and we could ban it. We must consider this matter very seriously.</p>

<p>I would also like to refer to the timing of this Bill. The Minister gave notice of it on Friday, the 11th, and it was published on the Saturday, and 12 days afterwards we had it in front of this House. That is a very short time. If the Minister is sincere in his attempt to combat Communism and to have the support of this side of the House, one would have thought that he would have published the Bill a month or six weeks earlier and then referred it to a Select Committee; if the Government <span class="col_6465-6466" refersTo="page_0479"/>is sincere in the amendments they are making they should be sincere enough to say that their Bill bears the closest examination, and refer it to a Select Committee, let the people who want to give evidence come forward. We have had the Law Society and the trade unions approaching the Government, and other bodies as well. But the public in general should have the full right to come to the Government and state their views. When the rights of the individual are to be affected, the Government of the day should give that individual every opportunity to put his views; we have the necessary machinery here and the Government should use it. The Government has not given due notice of this Bill so that the public could be consulted. One wonders why? What is the background of this Bill? Is this measure designed to bolster up the machinery for the coming election in the Transkeian Territory? Is it to get the machinery ready for the day when the Bantu have been put on the rolls and a general election is held there? Is it to control the position where three or four candidates may come forward, wishing to address meetings in the various Native townships? Is this Bill going to be used against those individuals? I think the hon. the Minister should tell us.</p>

<p>Then I come to the sabotage clause. [Interjection.] I thought that would arouse the interest of hon. members. They have been very interested in this clause. Sir, hon. members from this side of the House have pointed out the dangers of this particular clause and its very wide scope. We say here in our amendment that this Bill deprives citizens of the protection of the courts, that it creates a new crime and defines it so widely that it can endanger the lives and liberties of people who are innocent of any intention to subvert the State. The Minister in charge of the Bill has admitted indirectly that it is possible he might amend this particular clause. I personally do not think that there has been any real sabotage in this country. At any rate, the Minister has not told us anything about it. We have had a few people trying to destroy post offices, but we know of an occasion when we had real sabotage in this country. There was a time when we saw the cutting of telephone lines, attempts to wreck trains, the blowing up of post offices, the molesting of soldiers who were going back to camp, etc.</p>

<p>This clause, as I say, is very wide in its scope; it can affect everybody in this country of ours. Furthermore, it is possible for a youngster of 15 or 16 to be sent to the gallows for committing an offence under this particular Bill. [Laughter.] Hon. members laugh but I do not think they realize the real seriousness of the position. I would say to the Minister in charge of the Bill that the way to cure Communism is not by force. I wish the Government would learn from what has happened in the rest of the world, what has happened in North Africa and in Cyprus. You can never cure anything by force. What the Government should do is to alter their present policies, because that is where the real trouble lies. Guns and bayonets cure nothing. What the Government has to do to eradicate Communism is to improve the standard of living of the people. It is like a disease, and medical people will tell you that if you want to cure disease give the people better housing and better living conditions. That is the way in which you cure people who become ill because of overcrowded and bad conditions. Why do you not have Communism in the United States to the extent that you have it in the rest of the world? You find in Italy to-day, where Communism was rife, that because of the rise in the standard of living Communism is on its way out. That is the only way in which you can deal with Communism.</p>

<p>Is your contention that we should not have a law against Communism?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>No, I agree that we should have a law against Communism but it should be against Communism and it should not be a law that can affect the freedom of every individual. The law should never be used to affect the freedom of the individual who is not guilty of Communism. The only way in which you can find out whether a person is guilty of Communism is to bring him before a proper tribunal where he can be thoroughly cross-examined. If you find that he is guilty, then deal with him, but do not simply name a person as a communist without giving him the right of appeal. Sir, we can learn in this country of ours from the United States. The Western nations realize which way Africa is going to-day, and how do you think they are going to keep Communism out of Africa? Not by sending in troops. They are going to send in food; they are going to try to raise the standard of living of the African people. That is the way they are going to do it. If we do not do that, then you will have the biggest Communist State in the world on this Continent of ours. All over the world, wherever Communism has penetrated into a country, the only cure has been to raise the people&#x2019;s standard of living and to improve conditions; to give people freedom; but the moment you enact laws such as this Bill you simply breed Communism. This Bill is nothing else but first-class fertilizer for Communism. I would appeal to the Minister and to this House to treat this Bill with all the seriousness that it deserves. It affects the lives of people who have no say. [Interjection.] It is all very well for the hon. member to murmur but he himself may find himself in that position one day, where he will have no say in the government of the country and where he will have no court to appeal to, where he could be detained for 12 days and could do nothing about it. They would not <span class="col_6467-6468" refersTo="page_0480"/>even have to explain why they have detained him.</p>

<p>This side of the House will vote against any measure that affects the freedom of the individual without the right to a proper trial and that is why we oppose this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) pointed out to the other side of the House in a very nice way that here they have an opportunity to say precisely what their attitude is in respect of the combating of Communism in general. The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) had a golden opportunity therefore to tell this House precisely how he views the existing legislation to combat Communism, but instead of doing so he asked us &#x201C;What is Communism?&#x201D; In the first place it is perfectly clear from his speech that he does not know how this legislation will function and, secondly, that he is not familiar with the underlying principles of the Communist Party. In the third place the hon. member also indicated to us that he had certain objections to the way in which Communism was being combated at present. He suggests&#x2014;and I think he was speaking on behalf of his party&#x2014;that where a person is suspected of communist activities the inquiry which is instituted should be shown on television so that the public can see how the accused person is interrogated. I do not think I misunderstood the hon. member. There is only one inference that can be drawn from that, and that is that that side of the House wants to treat these people as gently as possible; that they have no real intention of coping with this evil in all seriousness. But the hon. member for Salt River went on to ask what the outside world would say about this legislation. He once again indulged in the scaremongering to which we have become so accustomed. But we want to set the hon. member&#x2019;s mind completely at rest: Whatever is said in the outside world, there will always be thinking persons abroad who will realize that South Africa has a Government which does not hesitate to take powers to protect the security of this southern tip of Africa. The hon. member also indicated that he would have preferred this Bill to be referred to a Select Committee first before being discussed in this House. But they had that opportunity in 1950, and did they make use of it then? No, they did not make proper use of it. What right has the hon. member to ask for that opportunity again to-day? The hon. member goes on to allege that there has been no sabotage here. It seems to me that the hon. member is not familiar with what precisely is happening here, or else he probably does not regard it as a serious matter, and if that is so, then we are entitled to draw the logical conclusion that the hon. member does not deprecate it, because why should he deprecate something if in his opinion it is not serious? No, now that the hon. member has spoken it is clearer to us than ever before what the intention of the United Party is in respect of the combating of Communism. Sir, I shall reply later on in the course of my speech to the other questions put by him. In the first place I want to say that it is the duty of this Government to govern this country. The electorate placed the responsibility of governing this country and of passing legislation and of amending legislation to adapt it to the needs of this country, upon the shoulders of this Government. I want to give the electorate the assurance that we are going to fulfil those expectations. This Government has an obligation to discharge, and whatever happens as far as the Opposition is concerned, we on this side will continue to carry out the mandate of the electorate down to the last detail. It is perfectly clear&#x2014;and it has become even clearer in the course of this debate&#x2014;that the Opposition accepts no co-responsibility. Surely it is only to be expected that a decent Opposition, which presents itself to the electorate as the alternative Government, will accept co-responsibility in respect of matters of national importance. But that is by no means the case. The fact of the matter is that this Government accepts that responsibility, and it is necessary therefore to provide the necessary machinery to maintain effective government in this country; and that is why we have a measure here before us which has been introduced and explained to us by the hon. the Minister of Justice. The hon. the Minister has told us that there are certain problems which have to be dealt with and that the existing legislation is not effective to cope with those problems. He has told us that the two main issues which form the contents of this Bill and that we have to take into account here are that we must combat Communism and, in conjunction with that, acts of sabotage.</p>

<p>Let us make a brief analysis of the character of the Communist Party and its doctrines. What methods are used by the Communist Party to achieve its aims? Secondly, what proof is there that there are certain activities going on to achieve these aims within the Republic? In order to indicate this briefly it is necessary to quote a few paragraphs from the Constitution of the Communist Party from the &#x201C;Communist Manifesto&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The task of the Party is to utilize these minor everyday needs as a starting point from which to lead the working class to the revolutionary struggle for power. By organizing mass action upon which all branches of Party agitation and propaganda, including Parliamentary activity, must be concentrated. This mass action includes: strikes; a combination of strikes and demonstrations; a combination of strikes and armed demonstration; and finally, the general strike conjointly with armed insurrection against the State. The latter form of struggle, which is the supreme form, must be conducted according to the rules of war.</block>

<p>In those cases where the aforementioned <span class="col_6469-6470" refersTo="page_0481"/>methods do not work effectively, or where the time is not entirely ripe perhaps, which is perhaps the case here in the Republic, it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the revolutionary tide is not rising, the Communist Party must advance partial slogans and demands that correspond to the everyday needs of the toilers, and combine them with the fundamental tasks of the Communist International.</block>

<p>Then it goes on to say in a further paragraph what the Party&#x2019;s aims are in respect of states where the colonial system applies (and the Republic is regarded as one of those states)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the struggle against colonial oppression, the Communist Parties in the colonies must advance partial demands that correspond to the special circumstances prevailing in each country such as: complete equality for all nations and races; abolition of all privileges for foreigners; the right of association for workers and peasants; reduction of the working day; prohibition of child labour; prohibition of usuary and of all transactions entailing bondage; reduction and abolition of rents; reduction of taxation; refusal to pay taxes, etc.</block>

<p>There we have the basic ideas which are also in evidence in this country. But the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Communist Party is the formation of various &#x201C;front organizations&#x201D;. When Lenin&#x2019;s Bolshevists experienced opposition in undermining the government, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is necessary to be able to withstand all this, to agree to any and every sacrifice and even if need be to resort to all sorts of devices. This is the point, to resort to all sorts of devices, maneouvres and illegal methods, evasion and subterfuge in order to penetrate into the trade unions, to remain in them to carry on communistic work at all costs.</block>

<p>As time went on this statement came to form the basis for the subversion of the authority of the State by the communists and strongly came to the fore after World War II with the formation of Front Organizations. This proposition was confirmed once again when the following appeared in the influential communist newspaper <i>Trud</i> on 4 November 1950&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bolshevik Party has had to change its tactics, its methods of combat to shift from legal to illegal forms, to compromise, to make agreements with other parties, other movements, to dodge, to retreat in order to advance more successfully later. Lenin teaches the Communist Party skilfully to utilize his diversified tactical forms.</block>

<p>In the Republic of South Africa these tactics have been employed on a large scale through infiltration into existing organizations and the formation of new Front Organizations, the most well-known of which are (1) the South African Peace Council, which is affiliated with the World Peace Council; (2) the South African Congress of Trade Unions, which is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions, (3) Society for Peace and Friendship with Soviet Union, and (4) South African Congress of Democrats, and others. An analysis of the activities of these Front Organizations in the Republic and in the rest of the world reveal, firstly, that Front Organizations are organizations which are called into being to serve as instruments for the Communist Party, but here in the Republic that fact is concealed. Secondly, they are Front Organizations in this sense that their true objects and aims are concealed behind the mask of social ideas which are usually acceptable to most &#x201C;Progressives In the third place their real object is to promote Soviet Communism in various ways. Their main task is to spread propaganda. Lastly, these Front Organizations are the recruiting agencies for the Communist Party, and they serve as a cloak for people who are secretly communists and as cloaks for the party itself where it has been banned. I do not think there is any doubt that those signs of infiltration and of concealment within various organizations and of the discord which is sown there, are very clearly discernible here in the Republic. I want to try to prove therefore that in those circumstances it has become essential, and that this is the opportune moment, to introduce this Bill. In the first place then the aim of Communism is to overthrow the existing order. After all, it is a well-known fact that one of the methods used by Communism is to break down the existing order. We recently had the much-discussed treason trial in South Africa. All the evidence that was given there indicated that there had been an organized attempt to take over the Government of this country. In the second place we had this encouragement of lawlessness. It was alleged that Bantu leaders who are communist-inspired had launched a campaign to induce the Bantu to bum their reference books. There we had evidence of lawlessness, which constituted a challenge to the Government. In the third place, we have this insistence on a share in the government of our country. Enormous pressure is being brought to bear upon us from outside by Whites and non-Whites to accept the concept of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. Furthermore, we have had these organized explosions. The hon. the Minister of Justice made it perfectly clear to us recently that those explosions were not just casual explosions; it was not a question of a few isolated individuals deciding, because of their hostility towards or their dissatisfaction with the State, that they would damage certain properties. It was a carefully planned organization; it was planned by some person who had the necessary technical knowledge and who trained other persons to take a hand in those explosions. It is also clear to us, because of the fact that those explosions took place in various centres and at the same time <span class="col_6471-6472" refersTo="page_0482"/>throughout the country, that it was in fact carefully organized. Just recently, for example, we had the attacks which were made here in Cape Town; we had the alleged bomb planting at the Roeland Street Gaol; we had the cases of arson in the Cape Town City Hall; a little while ago we had the blowing up of the power station at Port Elizabeth. Those are incidents which we cannot ignore. But apart from that, Mr. Speaker, I also want to give you a picture of what is happening beyond our borders. Just look at the chaos that prevails at present in the northern states which are our neighbours and in the North-Africa states. Is it not this same pattern which is already rearing its head to a lesser extent in this country that has completely gained the upper-hand in those states? Bearing this in mind, when we see all these things happening around us&#x2014;and I cannot believe that the Opposition does not notice it, and we are entitled therefore to say that they do notice it just as we do but that as far as they are concerned, according to the hon. member for Salt River, it is not very serious, it is not &#x201C;real sabotage we can simply close our eyes to it. That is why we say that they are not in earnest. I think we are entitled to put this question to them: At what stage would the Opposition like the Minister to come forward with this measure? At what stage would they want the Minister to take adequate powers to combat this sabotage and these other deeds which I have outlined here and which, as I have shown, are clearly linked up with the communist doctrine? No, we get no reply. We are told in vague terms that the existing legislation is sufficient to cope with the situation. Let us look at the Bill before us. The Opposition contends that its terms are far too wide, that it is altogether unreasonable, that it will place a stigma on our country, and that we will experience various disadvantages because of this so-called drastic legislation. No, that is not the position. The hon. the Minister has stated in the clearest possible terms that the existing legislation is not adequate to enable us to deal with those persons who take steps against our country in the way that I have just indicated. Those forces of evil must be broken.</p>

<p>May I put a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member is incapable of putting any question that will be a contribution to this debate; I should prefer therefore not to reply to his questions. [Interjection.] When the hon. member has finished blowing off steam we can carry on again. Just as it becomes necessary from time to time to amend legislation in order to adapt it to changed circumstances, so it also becomes necessary on the negative side. Sir, these lawbreakers, whose activities we want to combat, make a careful study of the existing legislation and they regulate matters in such a way that they succeed in circumventing the law. That is why it is absolutely essential to effect the necessary amendments so that we can cope with the changed situation that faces us to-day. We say therefore that these powers which are being taken by the Minister are absolutely essential.</p>

<p>But let me deal briefly with the so-called cruel powers which the Minister is taking here. And I want to look at this matter as a layman in an entirely practical way. The hon. member said a moment ago that we need legal advice in order to be able to understand this matter. I as a layman can understand it. I want to put it to you, Sir, that the Minister can take various steps against law-breakers and alleged communists. In the first place, when the Minister has reason to believe that a person is guilty of a contravention or that he is behaving in a suspicious way, the Minister has the right under this legislation to cause a warning to be issued to him through a magistrate, who is authorized to do so in terms of the provisions of this measure. We say that such a warning is no precedent in our legislation. The position is that where it became clear to the police in the implementation of the old Liquor Act that a person was contravening the Act, a warning was issued to him and if he did not heed the warning he was prosecuted. Our experience was that that warning served a very useful purpose. That provision in this Bill is one that must be welcomed therefore. When such a person refuses to heed the warning then, of course, it is necessary for the Minister, on good grounds, to take further steps.</p>

<p>When such a lawbreaker refuses to heed the warning which has been issued to him in terms of this measure, the Minister has the right to name such a person and once he has been named steps will be taken against him. The third step then is to place restrictions on the actions of such a person. The fourth is that if such a person refuses to heed the warning, he can be confined to a certain area, and eventually he can be confined to a certain place under certain very strict conditions. I see no cruelty in it. As a matter of fact, in the case of persons who may eventually get away from these foreign influences &#x2026;</p>

<p>On a point of order, may I ask whether it is in order for hon. members opposite to carry on a continuous conversation in such a way that we cannot hear what the speaker is saying? May I say that I think it is in the interests of order in this House that that conversation should cease.</p>

<from><span class="col_6473-6474" refersTo="page_0483"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I submit that no innocent person is going to suffer because of the powers which the Minister proposes to take here. I am thinking now of the steps which are within his own discretion, not those cases which are referred to the courts. We say therefore that hon. members are completely wide of the mark when they contend that innocent people will have to suffer as the result of the passing of this measure.</p>

<p>The impression is created on the other side of the House that the Minister will be able to name any person he likes or to confine him to a certain place or to restrict his movements. But surely that is not the position. Hon. members ought to know that the Minister must have reasonable grounds for his belief and he can only have reasonable grounds when evidence is placed before him. We also know that there are people in the Police Force who give special attention to these matters from day to day. These are people who for years have made a study of these particular offences in this country, and I find it strange that hon. members on the other side should refer in such a derogatory way to the powers and the sense of responsibility of the police, who will place their information at the disposal of the Minister. Then there is also a further provision; we know that any person who is named or who feels that he is being inconvenienced, illegitimately, may go to the courts in terms of the existing legislation and require the Minister to produce the necessary proof in those cases where he has been given the right to take such steps against him. There is no question of the Minister&#x2019;s being able to do just what he pleases. That is the impression which is being created by the other side of the House, and it is an entirely erroneous impression. We maintain that the Minister can and will only act on reliable evidence which is placed at his disposal by the police.</p>

<p>In the last place let me come to the so-called sabotage clause&#x2014;I refer to Clause 21&#x2014;and the discretionary power vested in the courts. There is absolutely nothing that can be left out of the existing definition. We find that one member on the other side says that it is too wide while the other says that he cannot understand it. Surely that is inconsistent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy-chairman">

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>The aim of the communist, in the first place, is to concentrate on private property. That is why it is necessary to make provision in the definition for the protection of private property, because as soon as he can interfere with private property, he starts his process of disruption and agitation against the State. In that way he can undermine the State and, as I have already indicated, systematically begin to exercise control over the State, if not in this way then by force.</p>

<p>As far as the penal provisions are concerned, it has been admitted that for treason and sabotage the maximum penalty is the death sentence. But that does not mean to say that that penalty will be imposed in every case. We have had numerous cases of high treason, and the death sentence has actually been imposed in very few of those cases. There is a minimum penalty. But this is an indication as to how strongly we feel about this matter; we want to make it clear that a person must not be able to get away easily with a light sentence. But hon. members on the other side are the last people who should talk about maximum and minimum penalties. We submit that in terms of the emergency regulations the death sentence was obligatory in cases of high treason. There it was provided that the court shall impose the death penalty, but in terms of the present legislation the court may do so. There is no question therefore of limiting the discretion of the courts. The Opposition comes along with the old story that there was a war on when their emergency regulations were in force. That is a hackneyed argument and it has been replied to effectively by hon. members on this side who have pointed out that some years after the conclusion of peace there were still people in the internment camps and that people were still being tried in terms of the emergency regulations after the war.</p>

<p>The United Party is perfectly entitled to take a stand in respect of this matter; that is a right that we do not want to deny them for a moment and one that we would like to retain in a democratic country. The United Party is also entitled in this struggle to choose their own weapons and to choose their own comrades in arms. One knows a tree by its fruit, and the individual is judged by his friends. In the same way the United Party will be judged by its friends, and because that is so, it will be recorded in the annals of the history of our country that when the National Party and this Government were involved in a life-and-death struggle against the feared doctrine of Communism, the most formidable enemy of democracy, the United Party tried to obstruct the Government. These powers are being asked for timeously by the Minister and they will be given to him. With those powers at our disposal we shall succeed in retaining for those who come after us the heritage left to us by our forefathers.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Groblersdal (Mr. M. J. H. Bekker) has made a very fine political speech. I think that, as far as this Bill is concerned, the political implications, from the Government&#x2019;s point of view, are regarded by him as being of much more importance than the actual contents of this Bill. The hon. member for Groblersdal concluded by saying that it would be recorded in the annals of the political history of South Africa that, when this Government sought to combat sabotage and Communism in South Africa, the United Party was not prepared to assist the Government. One of the other hon. <span class="col_6475-6476" refersTo="page_0484"/>members said that we, the United Party, were complaining that this legislation was very wide in its terms. But is that not an admission which the Minister himself made in the course of his speech? He himself admitted that Clause 21 particularly was very wide in its terms. We say that this legislation is not necessary in order to combat sabotage in South Africa. Let me read out to the hon. member for Groblersdal what his own Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the past when sabotage took place and the person concerned was charged with malicious damage to property, people generally asked: &#x201C;Why do you charge him with malicious damage to property and not with sabotage? I think it is high time we called a spade a spade and did the same thing in the Statute Book of South Africa.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is what the Minister himself said when he introduced this Bill. In other words, the Minister admitted that it was possible to combat sabotage under the laws which already appear on our Statute Book. The hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) has again gone back to 1950 to indicate what the attitude of the United Party was in those days. But let me read out to the hon. member the motion which was moved by the United Party in this House at that time, in 1950, when the Suppression of Communism Bill was under discussion. In 1950 Mr. Strauss moved as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;that&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;This House, whilst convinced of the necessity of combating Communism by legislation, declines to pass the second reading of the Bill because, in seeking to combat communist totalitarianism it creates a Fascist despotism in that it clothes the Executive with unnecessarily wide and despotic powers, fails to provide for full and effective access to the courts, and makes intolerable inroads upon the freedom of the citizen, including the power to violate the sanctity of his home&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Why did the hon. member not quote that? That is the amendment which the United Party moved at that time. But let me read out what a prominent member of the United Party said in that debate. This was on 14 June 1950 (Hansard, Col. 9008)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, my objection to this Bill and to this measure is that the crime is not defined but that it is left to the arbitrary will of the Minister to decide whether a crime is being committed and what that crime is. But I want to mention the other common aspect&#x2026;.</block>

<p>And then he goes on to make the accusation that the United Party stands for equality between White and Black. And then he says this (Col. 9009)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On a previous occasion I said that this legislation was the most Hitler-like measure of the most Hitler-like Government being &#x201C;Dongesed&#x201D; through this House in the most Hitler-like manner. This is the type of legislation which, together with the other legislation like that concerning the group areas and the pass law, gives us an indication of the master pattern of the present Nationalist Party policy as announced and explained by them particularly during the war years. Every piece of this legislation fits into that pattern like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle; every piece of this legislation is used by them to forge a weapon, not to be used now but to be used when &#x201C;Der Tag&#x201D; comes. Its purpose is not only to combat Communism.</block>

<p>This is the point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Its purpose is not only to combat Communism. It says in this Bill that a black list is being kept. That is nothing new. Already during the war we heard that they would draw up a black list and that the day of reckoning would come, and that when that day came they would settle accounts, not only with the communists and the liberalists, but that they who are so fond of democracy would also settle accounts with what they regard as the un-national and anti-national elements in the life of our nation. That is their aim. That is what they are driving at.</block>

<p>This was said in 1950 by the then hon. member for Gardens, the present member for Beaufort West (Dr. Jonker). The attitude of the United Party at that time could be put in no better words.</p>

We still adhere to that policy, but the hon. member for Fort Beaufort was so afraid of the black list which was kept by hon. members on the Government side that he himself crossed the floor of the House so that his name could be deleted from that list.</p>

<p>They are not comparable cases at all. All it does prove is that the party which has been consistent in its attitude in respect of Communism sits on this side of the House, with the exception of the hon. member for Beaufort West and the hon. the Minister of Information.</p>

<p>But, in the course of this debate, another matter has been touched upon, which, I think, cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed. I want to come back to what the hon. member for Edenvale (Mr. G. H. van Wyk) said in the course of this debate. He says that communists are infiltrating into the ranks of the United Party. I want to put this question to the hon. member: If the position is that communists are infiltrating into the ranks of the United Party, have they been so unsuccessful then in combating Communism that there are communists sitting in this House to-day? And if there has been no such infiltration, then the hon. member was talking arrant nonsense. The hon. the Minister must tell us whether he agrees with the hon. member for Edenvale, and then we want to know who the members on this side of the House are who are regarded by the Minister or his party as communists. And if this legislation is not intended to deal with us, but only with communists, then surely I was right in saying, as I did at the beginning, that this legislation is nothing but political propaganda.

<p>The hon. the Minister said in his speech that there were ways and means of combating sabotage in South Africa. If that is so, and it is not their intention to put this side of the House behind bars, for whom are these very wide powers intended then? If they are not intended for us, then this legislation can only be designed to make political propaganda outside, and the question that then arises is why that propaganda is being made to-day. Why is an attempt being made to keep together the ranks of the Nationalist Party? We had an election only last year and the Government was returned to Parliament with a big majority. Why is this legislation being introduced then? There must be some political reason for it, and the obvious political reason is that the hon. the Minister and his party are using this legislation to distract attention from the implications and the complications that will arise from their Bantustan policy. They have been asked repeatedly, a question which has been repeated by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore): &#x201C;Why this legislation?&#x201D; Why this legislation when they already have powers at their disposal to act? But we have not had a single reply to that question. I have read through the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech. He told us of the difficulties that they had in the Transkei; he referred to Attorney Swarts. But I thought that we were soon going to be rid of these people. This legislation is not intended for them therefore. After all, they are going to become independent states.</p>

<p><span class="col_6479-6480" refersTo="page_0486"/>Then I come to Clause 21, &#x201C;Any person who commits any wrongful and wilful act whereby he &#x2026;&#x201D; and then there follows a series of seven points.

<p>I believe that this clause of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s opens the door much wider. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to listen to this: &#x201C;(e) To further or encourage the achievement of any political aim, including the bringing about of any social or economic change in the Republic.&#x201D; To further or encourage. In other words, if a person asks for a change in our political system (and has the Minister not done this himself in the past?) he can be charged under this Bill. The Minister&#x2019;s own party did so in the past. I have before me &#x201C;The Road to a New South Africa&#x201D;, which the Nationalist Party issued in 1948, and in which they asked for large-scale changes in South Africa. Let me read it out to the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In key industries such as the gold mines, the supply of electricity, the iron and steel and certain other base metal industries, the processing of wool, the fishing industry, the manufacture of fuel, etc., the State must have the direction and supervision by means of its own representatives on boards of directors or through corporations or some allied method.</block>

<p>That was their own policy in 1948. Listen to this, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Profits will be divided by the State amongst workers, the shareholders and the owners according to a pre-arranged but not necessarily a uniform scale.</block>

<p>The worst form of socialism. Listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All medical, nursing and hospital services must be placed under the supervision and control of the Department of Public Health, thereby putting an end to the present state of lack of co-ordination, confusion and neglect inherent in the multiplicity of authorities.</block>

<p>That is what they said in 1948. Listen to point No. 1 of their aims&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The gradual introduction of a 48-hour week.</block>

<p>That is also a political aim&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister himself admitted in his speech that there were many offences which, technically speaking, could be regarded as abotage. The Minister now says that he must commit an offence in order to achieve that purpose. I know that. He must commit an offence against the State. Reference is made here to &#x201C;the maintenance of law and order&#x201D;. Let us assume that a serious disturbance takes place in a Native area and that just prior to that a person had been advocating a change in the form of government&#x2014;which we ought to have&#x2014;could he not be dealt with then under this clause? Is he not asking for a change in &#x201C;the political system&#x201D;? Or is he not asking for changed conditions? We were told in this House by the hon. the Minister of Community Development earlier this year that any member who asked that the Coloureds be put back on the common roll would be harming the relations between White and Black. And here it is stated &#x201C;to cause, encourage or to promote hostility between the various population groups of the Republic. Surely then the Sabra people are also encouraging hostility between White and Black when they talk about giving direct representation to the Coloureds in Parliament, or when the <i>Burger</i> says that they are not against it. I have shown the Minister now how widely this clause is framed. In their 1948 policy they wanted to go even further.</p>

<block name="quote">An adequate holiday with travelling and other concessions.</block>

<p>They were advocating a change. That is precisely the point that I want to make to the hon. the Minister. Is there any member in this House who can say that he has never sinned against one of the ten points which are <span class="col_6481-6482" refersTo="page_0487"/>mentioned in Clause 21 (1)? Neither the hon. the Minister nor the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare can say that. After all. he has also advocated changes, has he not? At some time or other we have all advocated changes in the political system. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is to-day advocating the establishment of independent states in South Africa. Surely that would bring about a change in our social structure. In other words, in making provision for these ten points in this Bill, this Government is preventing legitimate criticism of the Government. The hon. the Minister himself says that this clause is very wide; he says that he needs these powers. But does the hon. the Minister realize how far his clause goes? As the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) has said, the layman will not be able to understand this type of clause, and the outcome of it will be that the legitimate criticism, which this Government deserves, will not be levelled against it.</p>

<p>The object of this legislation is to go and make political propaganda in the country. That is the reason why they have come forward with this measure. We on this side of the House are prepared to state our attitude to the electorate. We shall give the public our reasons. There is no United Party supporter or leader in the country who was prepared to believe, when we voted against the Suppression of Communism Bill, that the United Party was in favour of Communism. Of course they will not fall for these political tactics on the part of hon. members on the other side. No, as an Opposition we have to adopt a responsible attitude, and that is the attitude that we are adopting. Our attitude is to protect the freedom, the basic rights and the individual freedoms of the individual. That is the best guarantee of creating the best impression of your country abroad. Has the hon. the Minister considered what sort of impression he is creating with this legislation? He tells us that everything in the garden is rosy, that this is a country of peace; he says, &#x201C;You must buy shares&#x201D;. That is the advice which he gave the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). Sir, it is not the propaganda that is being made about this Bill that is harming this country; it is the clauses of this Bill which give the wrong image of South Africa. The hon. the Minister is not interested in that, however. No, he is interested in this little bit of political ammunition which will keep the Nationalist Party busy during the recess. That is the only thing in which he is interested. The hon. the Minister and his Government are not in the least interested in whether we can improve South Africa&#x2019;s reputation overseas, he is not interested whether he is increasing our prestige or not, in whether we can attract more capital to South Africa or whether this will make more friends for us. This is one of the last nails in the coffin of the good name of South Africa overseas. This is the sort of thing that is exploited against us; it is not the English-language Press in South Africa which is deliberately harming South Africa&#x2019;s reputation overseas. How can anybody make mischief against South Africa unless he is able to quote this example? And <span class="col_6483-6484" refersTo="page_0488"/>yet the Minister tells us that he is preserving peace in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not believe that this legislation will do this country any good. What it will do is to prevent anybody who has legitimate criticism from voicing that criticism. No, those good South Africans are to be prevented from offering criticism. [Interjections.] This sort of legislation is designed to deter them. And it will deter people, that I know. That is what the Minister and his Government want to achieve; they want to prevent people from criticizing this Government too much. They want to seal the lips of the Anton Ruperts and of the Sabra people, who are good South Africans. That is what they are after. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am surprised at the sense of irresponsibility of the two points&#x2014;that of Sea Point and Durban (Point). When the hon. member who has just resumed his seat was speaking, a fear fell away from us. When we heard there was going to be a night sitting, we were afraid that we would be without a clown that could cheer up the sitting for us. But the hon. member has fortunately filled that vacancy in his speech. His whole approach in respect of the legislation itself was a complete misunderstanding. As a result of that all his arguments of course are a total misconception. The hon. member is afraid that this legislation will be bad propaganda for South Africa overseas. He must forget that. He should remember that we here on the southern tip of Africa are the only bastion of the Christian and the Western civilization. The more strongly therefore we deal with Communism here on the southern tip, the better we shall secure this southern tip of Africa against Communism, and how better will be the light in which the Western countries will regard us. I should like to remind the hon. member of an article Mr. Phillip Crowe recently wrote in the <i>U.S. News and World Report.</i> This is what the hon. gentleman wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The majority of the 40-odd nations between Cairo and Cape Town are either neutral or subject to communistic influence and, in case of war, few&#x2014;if any&#x2014;of them would support the West. South Africa, on the other hand, has backed her convictions in two World Wars, the Korean War and the Berlin airlift, and shows no indications of lapsing into non-alignment to-day.</block>

<p>It is very clear that some of our friends&#x2014;and I believe Mr. Phillip Crowe is one of our friends&#x2014;take our strong actions here against Communism for the very purpose of defending our cause and to make our cause stronger in what surely is the strongest power in the world to-day, namely, the United States of America. That applies for all the Western countries.</p>

<p>Even before this legislation was introduced, before the contents of it were known, an atmosphere was created by a section of the Press in this country to arouse opposition to this legislation. Who is it that first lodged this protest? We find it is those bodies, such as the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, the Black Sash, South African Congress of Democrats and a large part of the Press. We miss one organization, but we hope it will be resuscitated again. Mr. Albie Sachs last night at Sea Point expressed the hope that the Torch Commando will be revived in a greater and a stronger form, for he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nationalists had only once been scared of being put out of power and that was in the days of the Torch Commando.</block>

<p>I really would like to invite that friend to revive this Torch Commando again. I almost want to give a guarantee on behalf of the Minister that we shall permit the Torch Commando to go on unmolested. These leftist organizations that started this movement of protest against this legislation, also used this opportunity to launch an attack on the policy of apartheid of the Government. They forget that it is this very apartheid policy that has made the National Party and the Government strong. It is this very apartheid policy which is being accepted by the electorate to an increasing degree. It is this very apartheid policy of the Government which is also being accepted to an increasing extent by the non-Whites and the Bantu as the solution to their own problems. They see in that policy the means whereby they will be able to live peacefully together with the Whites in South Africa.</p>

<p>It has been proved time and time again that the hon. the Prime Minister and all the National Party speakers asked the electorate for that mandate before that election, and it was granted with a greater majority than ever before. That proof has been given, and I cannot go into it again. Now who are these protesting groups? Of course the Liberal Party is a party that advocates complete equality in this country. The Progressive Party is very close to that, but here and there there is a qualification of education, etc., but in the final result they are aiming at the same object. The Black Sash and the African Congress of Democrats are completely leftist organizations. We find also that the Press assisting in this protest is the organ of the leftist organizations and the leftist organizations again are the henchmen of that Press. It is a peculiar thing that all these organizations that have piloted this protest against this legislation, consider that a policy of equality will be the best method of combating the communistic menace, a policy of making concessions. Those are the very organizations all of which are steering in the direction of the overthrow of the existing order in South Africa. Those are the very organizations that wish to bring about a revolution in South Africa whether constitutionally <span class="col_6485-6486" refersTo="page_0489"/>or unconstitutionally. They wish to establish a state of affairs where the Whites will be the political minority in this country, where the White, as the political minority, will have no rights. He will simply have no say in the affairs of this country. Surely that is obvious. We know all these organizations as the sworn friends and the champions of these enemies of the existing political order in South Africa. Those are the organizations and those are the people who are the henchmen of Communism in South Africa. We know that Communism seeks to achieve its object in a sly and covert manner. Who then are those persons? Permit me to mention only a few of them&#x2014;and remember they are people who are being defended by that side of the House, and are being praised by them as being great anticommunists. People like Patrick Duncan, Albert Luthuli, Nelson Mandela, etc. Who are they? Let me tell you. At the time of the treason trial this very Luthuli&#x2014;the great hero of freedom of hon. members opposite&#x2014;used the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whatever franchise concessions the Government might make, the A.N.C. will still continue to agitate for universal franchise. On the question of universal franchise there can be no compromise.</block>

<p>Mr. Luthuli of course was the President-General of the A.N.C. at the time, an organization which, before it was banned, was known for striving to achieve the objects of Communism. The organization had exactly the same objects that the Communist Party had. We know also that this Mr. Luthuli was sentenced by the Court to a fine of R200 or six months&#x2019; imprisonment, suspended for three years, because he burnt his identity book in the campaign of passive resistance to incite the Bantu to disobedience. That now is the hero of freedom and the great friend of hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>That hon. member is now running away from the point of view of his own party. There are members opposite who are conservative. We know them to be such. But they do not realize that they are only the bait that has to catch the crawfish. They simply serve as bait to bring as many conservatives as possible into their camp, and to keep them there. But let me come to Nelson Mandela now. Who is he? Hon. members will possibly recall the conference that was held at Pietermaritzburg last year, when total equality was demanded. It was also demanded then that a national convention be held. Mandela was the leader of this conference. He is the man who made the demands; he is the man who was a fugitive.</p>

<p>These organizations have become the political homes of those people who had to get out of the banned Communist Party. They could not go anywhere else than to find a home in these organizations. What is the Congress of Democrats&#x2014;that is to say, one of these organizations? It is the organization that takes the lead in all these resistance movements. Luthuli very na&#x00EF;vely denied that this organization had become the substitute for the Communist Party. I have here an article that appeared in the <i>Burger</i> last year, and which sheds an interesting light on the history of this organization. The article is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The banned Communist Party in South Africa has after many years once again reared its head to support the contemplated stay-at-home strikes and demonstrations at the end of the month. The special division of the police on the Rand know of a roneoed pamphlet, a message to the workers of South Africa of the Communist Party, that was secretly distributed at certain factories last week. In this pamphlet workers are asked to support the resolution adopted at Pietermaritzburg recently, to join the joint action on 29 and 30 May if a National Convention cannot be held before that time. In a leader, the weekly <i>New Age</i>&#x2014;</block>

<p>i.e. the mouthpiece of the Congress of Democrats&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">asks. &#x2026; Do you want civil war? Do you want to see the terrible violence that has prevailed during recent years in territories such as Algeria, the Congo, Angola and Kenya? In the meantime the Action Committee under the leadership of the Democrats has issued a statement in which support is asked for its peaceful strike at the end of May. The secretary who is in hiding somewhere, namely Nelson Mandela, leader of the resistance movement of 1952, has according to reports rung a few of the Rand newspapers. According to Mandela the Action Committee is carrying on with its plans to arrange processions and meetings on 29, 30 and 31 May. No violence is being contemplated. Mandela, an attorney, was an accused in the Treason Trial and formerly Transvaal chairman of the banned A.N.C.</block>

<p>Now who are these people who participated in this movement? They are the South African Indian Congress, the South African Coloured People&#x2019;s Congress, the South African Congress of Democrats, the South African Congress of Trade Unions and the A.N.C. until it was banned. There were leftist organizations that were organizing protest movements and strikes with a view to overthrowing peace and order in South Africa. They are the people. Does the hon. member for North-East Rand approve of the deeds of those people? Are the objects of these organizations not the same as those aimed at by the Communist Party? They are <span class="col_6487-6488" refersTo="page_0490"/>actually nothing but a continuation of the Communist Party. These organizations are doing everything that the Communist Party wished to do and also did before it was banned. Therefore they are nothing but the faithful tools of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>We also find that the Press from time to time gave the greatest publicity to these activities. For instance, Luthuli was represented as a great hero, and that as a result of the manner in which he was presented by the English Press to the public and to the world, that is to say, as the great hero and the peacemaker, he received the Nobel prize. But what was always suppressed was the subversive role he had played in South Africa. It was always suppressed that he undertook activities here in this country that were nothing but communist activities.</p>

<p>He himself denies that he is a communist, yet he is doing their work. We find from time to time that messages appear in certain Johannesburg English newspapers from Mandela, and that while he is engaged on his diabolical underground work. While he was a fugitive from the police, certain English newspapers placed themselves at his disposal, and through them he then published his messages. Can we allow that? Can we permit these undermining activities to be continued? It is not the National Party only that alleges that the Communist Party uses so-called innocent organizations and persons who are not communists, to propagate and achieve its objects. In the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 14 April 1960 there appeared an article written by the military correspondent of the <i>Argus.</i> The heading was &#x201C;Kremlin&#x2019;s No. 3 plan&#x201D;, and he had the following to say <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the reason for the critical concern shown by Britain, the United States and other Western countries, especially those with maritime interests, in the present situation in South Africa. The meddling interference of cranks is only the froth on the surface of world opinion. A feature of all U.S.S.R. plans since the Berlin incident is her care to ensure that their own forces do not become directly involved. Russian advisers and technicians are their backstage, but the work is done by the indigenous people under national leaders, trained and indoctrinated in the Soviet Union. Thus her operations have the semblence of emergent nationalism or of oppressed colonial peoples fighting for their freedom and rights.</block>

<p>That is what the military correspondent of the <i>Argus</i> said. So he is also seeing these things. That is precisely how we see it also. So he sees the same dangers in the methods of Communism that we see. But where we are now combating those methods, we find that our Opposition here are fighting it vigorously. It is very clear that Communism is a dangerous and unscrupulous enemy of South Africa. But let us ask ourselves what is the role of the United Party in this picture? We have found that protests have been set going in this country. The United Party did not have any part of that. They rather left it to the Liberal Party and to the Progressive Party, who in their turn try to foment dissatisfaction in an artificial manner. The Black Sash also is being used to parade, and to stand at attention at the flame of freedom, as they call it. The United Party stayed behind and did not participate in that. They have done nothing at all. Why not? Because there are a large number of supporters in that party who disapprove of these protest movements. But they then acted as the parliamentary front of these leftist organizations and they are now playing that role. Why do they do so? Because they have been forced to do so, and that for various reasons. Many of the ladies standing outside this building are members of the United Party. So they cannot participate outside, but they have to state their case inside; here they have to act as their parliamentary front for it is their supporters standing outside. The United Party dare not accept this legislation because by doing so they may drive their own supporters into the arms of the Progressive Party, and the Progressive Party is sitting waiting with open arms for these people. So why ate the Progressive Party waning? Because the leftist elements see an opportunity to achieve their objects within the United Party, although it might take longer. But there are other reasons too why the United Party has to play the role of the parliamentary front of the leftist organizations. There is a nucleus of leftists in that party. Yesterday for instance we listened to a speech by the hon. member for Wynberg. We have already listened to several speeches by the hon. member for Wynberg in which the national convention to which I have previously referred was praised as a harmless movement to whose requests attention should be given. But there is a leftist group in the United Party itself and therefore they may not drive away those people. They are caught in the trap of their own deeds. They have to pay lip service to their supporters outside that are conservatively disposed. Where is the strength and potential of the United Party. From where can they get their reinforcements? Surely not from the National Party, for everything the National Party stands for is against the principles of the United Party. So the United Party can derive its strength only from <span class="col_6489-6490" refersTo="page_0491"/>the leftists in the country. They can only try to canvass support from the Progressive Party, from the Liberal Party, from the Congress of Democrats, and other leftist organizations that are the greatest enemies of the National Party, and not only of the National Party, but of South Africa. That then also accounts for the actions of hon. members opposite in regard to this Bill. We find that Mr. Cope, in an article in the <i>Cape Times,</i> has put the policy of the Progressive Party, namely that this Bill is an evil thing and must not be passed. In the place of that he put racial co-operation, racial integration and confluence, in other words, the granting of more rights to the non-Whites in South Africa. That is therefore his solution for the communist menace in South Africa. The hon. member for Durban (North) a week later in the same column stated the policy of the United Party. In that column he at the same time objected that Mr. Cope had attacked them. What is the solution of the United Party as seen by the hon. member for Durban (North)? Both parties see a danger in the &#x201C;baasskap apartheid&#x201D; of the National Party. The hon. member for Durban (North) suggests that the urban Bantu should receive greater political rights. In other words, it is exactly the same solution that the Progressive Party offers. If you do that, they say, you will ward off the communist danger.</p>

<p>Do hon. members of the United Party and of the Progressive think they will satisfy the agitators with this solution? Surely they know that these agitators want something else, and that is not even equality but non-White &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;. Surely that is very clear. Surely they can see what is happening in other parts of Africa. They can see surely how the policy of concessions is operating there. Even if the optimistic members of the party opposite believe that that is the solution to our problems, their party will disappear sooner than they themselves think.</p>

<p>When I listened to the hon. member for Winburg (Mr. Sadie) and heard what his approach was to democratic rights, I remembered that Oscar Wilde also had a shot at describing democracy. Had that gentleman been here to read this Bill and to listen to the comments on it from members opposite, he surely would have adapted his description in the following way. He would then have described democracy as being&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The bludgeoning of the people, by the Government for the party.</block>

<p>So many references to past records have been made and produced that I am sure I will be permitted to quote a past record as well in order to bring the problem, with which we are ostensibly concerned, into its proper perspective. I want to quote from the findings of a Judicial Commission which was appointed in 1922 to inquire into the civil riots and disturbances which took place on the Rand during that time. At the head of what was regarded as an armed uprising in this country was a Council of Action. The findings of the commission were these&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The warring elements on the Rand amongst the Council of Action, the Labour Party, the Nationalists and the communists &#x2026; were united in one object which was to overthrow the Government of this country.</block>

<p>I quote this in order to bring the problem with which we are dealing into a proper perspective, and I need not say what side of the House formed the Government of that day. I should like to come back now to the position as we find it in the Bill which is before us. From the long title of the Bill, it is quite obvious that it is designed to add to and to amplify five major Acts of Parliament&#x2014;all measures of a contentious nature, all passed or revised and amended during the lifetime of the present Government and all giving the executive wide and arbitrary powers to curb the freedom of the individual and to control the activities of the community at any given time, regardless of whether the country is in a state of emergency or whether it is in a state of quietness, calm and peace as the hon. the Minister himself has described it. An unanswerable case has been made from this side of the House, that these five Acts as well as at least three others, give the Government more than ample power to prohibit seditious gatherings, to secure the safety of the State and to punish anyone who might be engaged in any type of subversive activities&#x2014;real, potential or even remotely potential. If the Government is unable to maintain law and order and to secure the safety of the State armed with all that mass of legislative power, then its duty, in my opinion, is perfectly clear. The duty of the Government under those circumstances is not to come to Parliament for still more powers but simply to move out and to stay out, before the destiny which they fear overtakes us.</p>

<p>But instead of taking that courageous step, the Government comes to Parliament once more with another measure which has been described as a &#x201C;vicious&#x201D; measure. It certainly is a measure born of political fear and racial intolerance. I listened to the hon. Minister, when he introduced this Bill, very carefully. He chose to lay great stress on what he called &#x201C;communist plotting&#x201D;, either here in our midst or elsewhere, against South Africa. I need not comment on the evidence which he placed before us, because so much of it came from Press communications and Press information which the hon. the Minister himself scorned. But I say that I do fear his judgment in the matter. I say this because he chose to couple together in one category and almost in one breath the names which he mentioned, and secondly because he chose to couple this wide and vague definition of sabotage with an equally wide and vague definition of Communism. Any lawyer knows that the <span class="col_6491-6492" refersTo="page_0492"/>road to political justice is a hazardous one for the client and a slippery one for the lawyers. That is an aspect of the Bill with which I will deal later. I also fear this hon. Minister&#x2019;s judgment in the matter for other reasons: Having listened to the contributions by members opposite, little doubt can be left in anybody&#x2019;s mind that it is not so much the safety of the State as it is the safety of the Government which is the real purpose of this Bill. Finally, Sir, I am also reminded of the now notorious Treason Trial and the Government&#x2019;s vain efforts to establish a communist plot at that time. It was not because the Government did not have enough power or enough time or enough money that it failed as badly as it did. I have the authority of the court to say that it failed because the Government did not have the evidence, and it never had a case of communist plotting. Therefore, Sir, before I come to deal with the general ambit of the Bill itself, I want to make one additional point. To have a proper perspective or proper sense of proportion is at any time one of the most valuable gifts a man, or a government, can possess. For this Government to have possessed a proper sense of proportion at this time, would have been a rare gift indeed and could easily have changed the history of this country. Because with such a sense of proportion this Government would have known how to govern and how to meet opposition in political affairs in such a way as to avoid such subversive or revolutionary situations arising, as it fears is going to be the case. It is because this Government has become mortally afraid of criticism or opposition of almost any kind, that it is now quite willing to forfeit the benefits that would accrue from a moderate and conciliatory approach to racial matters. By closing the door to representation of the masses in this Parliament, the Government also closed the door to lawful criticism, and therefore it is now obliged to treat virtually all criticism as being either anti-government or subversive or revolutionary. That is the reason why we have this stringent legislation before us to-day.</p>

<p>Sir, admittedly it has been South Africa&#x2019;s fate to record in its relatively short history a number of revolutionary situations, but one important lesson which is to be learnt from the past is this: Always a proper sense of proportion has prevailed in those responsible at the time for the conduct of the affairs of the country. If this hon. Minister would cast his mind back to the 1940s, he will know what I mean, for he knows that because in the past we have always had in our public life men with a sense of proportion, no rigidity of arbitrary rule, no severity of punishment to restrain political excesses or even political disruptions endured for any lengthy period. Such measures have always in the past been a passing phase in the conduct of our affairs and in the administration of justice in this country. Moreover, Sir, the hon. gentleman also knows that never before has such rigidity and severity obtained and been used, except in exceptional circumstances when there have been acts of rebellion, civil disruptions, or in times of war. And those rigid rules have always ended at the first opportunity after the emergency for which they had been created, had ended. But it is obvious that that sense of proportion is no longer to prevail and that rigidity of rule is now to appear not only permanently on our Statute Book. But it is to appear at a time which this hon. gentleman himself has called quiet and calm, but which members on his side of the House have rather described as being a &#x201C;hot peace&#x201D; and &#x201C;hot calm&#x201D;. I cannot describe it any other way. That seems to me to be the substitute for &#x201C;cold war&#x201D;. It is the only variant I can see to &#x201C;cold war&#x201D;. But the tragedy is that these restrictions, this rigidity of rule and the restrictions on the exercise of judicial discretion, are now being perpetuated instead of being there merely as temporary measures. I therefore ask this question: Can anyone still doubt that we are here concerned with a r&#x00E9;gime in which the rigidity of rule and the strong hand of authority are seen as a necessary and indispensable political virtues? Whether I agree with it or not, that is the reason why a leading newspaper in this country recently described the framing of this Bill and its introduction into this House as this Minister&#x2019;s &#x201C;fantastic bid for power&#x201D;,</p>

<p>But be that as it may, the tragedy of the occasion is that in presenting this Bill to Parliament, this Minister has demonstrated that he is prepared to cast a sense of proportion out of the window; and still more tragically I feel he is prepared even to cast a sense of justice out of the window.</p>

<p>It has been stressed, and I need not deal with it again, that not only are the provisions of this Bill drastic, even drastic in the extreme, but they are also an admission of failure on the part of this Government to provide this country with good government, sound government and safe government, clothed as it is with the extraordinary powers it has. This Bill is to my mind a demonstration by the Government of strength because of that failure, and to appease its followers. It also accounts for why the hon. the Minister was at some pains at a Press interview to say that the Bill was designed to close loopholes in existing legislation. It is quite true that the Minister reduced that during the debate here, by claiming that it was no more than the plugging of holes in an empty powder-keg. But I say that it a very lame excuse indeed to ask Parliament for additional arbitrary powers to restrain freedom without trial, to curb the Press and to tamper with the independence of the courts of law. Although this Bill has been introduced by the Minister of Justice, I think we must face the fact that it has very little to do with the principles of justice. As has been illustrated by this side of the House, it has very much to do with arbitrary and even capricious executive powers. It also creates a new political offence called sabotage.</p>

<p>The subtle distinction which the hon. Minister tried to draw in a recent debate between <span class="col_6493-6494" refersTo="page_0493"/>a political offence and an offence of a political character really cuts no ice. He knows it, and I think it was a subtle distinction he tried to draw for the moment, because it is only a distinction without anw difference at all. All you need to do in this Bill, Sir, is to scratch any provisions of the Bill and you will find a political offence, an offence which hon. members opposite have convinced me is an offence more because it is against the Government than because it is against the State. It seems to me, therefore, that even the Minister is out of date with his quotation. It is not a question of the safety of the State, but of the safety of the Government, being now the highest law of the land. The reason for that is not far to seek. We are dealing here with a party which puts its own safety first and foremost and which regards the police and even the courts as instruments to secure the safety of the Government.</p>

<p>At a recent Press interview the hon. the Minister chose to say that the wide powers he was taking in this Bill &#x201C;are essential for the maintenance of order and democracy&#x201D;. What a travesty this makes of the maintenance of order when the Bill itself ignores the courts and even hamstrings them. And what a strange sort of democracy this is which has to be maintained by despotism, coercion and political justice, rather than by the principles of natural justice. I say, Sir, that lawyers know that the road to political justice is a very hazardous one for the client and certainly a very slippery one for the lawyer. In this Bill are fully a dozen new executive powers. There are some which have been mentioned by members on this side of the House, which not only restrain the freedom of the individual without trial, but also penalizes him without any sort of trial and without even giving him an opportunity to defend himself. There is also a further provision which is a drastic one, namely that it makes an arbitrary confiscation of private property possible, without any form of recourse to the courts. Those points have already been made, Mr. Speaker, and I do not wish to enlarge on them. Therefore, in view of all this, it may sound rather pointless and even pious on my part and in this climate to speak up for the principles of justice and to maintain, firstly, that no one. not even the Government, can be a Judge in his own cause; and secondly, that everyone is presumed innocent until proved guilty in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of law.</p>

<p>Let me be quite emphatic about the matter: To me the principles of justice are eternal in every circumstance, even in the circumstances in which we try to deal with them in this House to-day. To me it is therefore monstrous that at a time which the Minister himself describes as being quiet, calm and peaceful, anyone entrusted with the portfolio of Justice should be clothed with powers drastic enough to detain a person capriciously and arbitrarily for an indefinite period, or maybe even for the rest of his days. I say, therefore, that it is wrong for this Minister to have powers imposed upon him of a type so drastic that he can bring about either house detention or other detention, and that he can also include in that order a prohibition &#x201C;against communicating with any person or receiving any visitors or performing any act&#x201D;. Sir, I say it is monstrous to have those powers without any limitation at all as to period! This is simply to return to the cruelties of the former century. You see, Sir, nowhere in these provisions is there any limitation as to time. Not only is there no appeal to a court of law, but there is not even any provision for executive review of the situation. I know the hon. Minister will tell me that he imposes these restrictions for a period&#x2014;say five years. But he is not obliged to do that. He might do that out of a sense of justice, but he is not obliged to do it, and that is something that did not even prevail during wartime. The hon. the Minister might criticize what happened during the war, but he knows perfectly well that tribunals were set up, of review and appeal, in cases of that nature.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister asks me whether I call that a tribunal. We were then in a state of war. Does he call this human&#x2014;in a state of peace&#x2014;with no provision at all as to period, no provision for judicial review and not even executive review? It is true the Minister has taken powers in the Bill to remove people&#x2019;s names from the list. It is an arbitrary and capricious power. It is not one that any authority will or can see in the light of day at any time. Those are capricious powers, to which I hope the Minister will give consideration in his reply. Let me further illustrate by means of a further quotation from the past, how far back we have gone into a former century. A great South African, writing in 1880. which, according to him, was also a period for a moderate and a conciliatory course to be followed in human affairs in South Africa, and in which there was also a great lesson to be learned from the past, had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is worse than useless to cover up our sores and to refuse to probe them to the bottom if we wish to find the remedy. For years we have had the same sort of thing. First it was Kreli who was the arch conspirator; then it was Cetewayo who was the trouble in South African peace, and now it is the Basutos&#x2026;.</block>

<p>And then he goes on to make this rather telling statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Anything and everything is blamed except misgovernment and mismanagement; and until we get out of this fashion of hunting about for traitors and have the courage to confess our errors, there will be little hope for better understanding in the future.</block>

<p><span class="col_6495-6496" refersTo="page_0494"/>I am quoting the words, Sir, of John X. Merriman from the &#x201C;Merriman Papers&#x201D;, which are recorded by the Van Riebeeck Society in Vol. 41. Seeing that these are quotations from John X. Merriman, may I suggest that somebody on the Government side should suggest to the John X. Merriman Branch of the Nationalist Party in Johannesburg that this would be a very apt quotation to include in its next edition of the <i>South African Patriot.</i> Sir, substitute current names for those I have mentioned&#x2014;I do not want to add them&#x2014;and a truer analysis of the present situation could not be found.</p>

<p>Therefore, when considering this Bill, I want to make it perfectly clear that to condemn the measure is not to support Communism or sabotage or subversive activities in any way. I say that because the simple facts are these: If this Government had the courage to confess its errors, there would be no need for a Bill of this nature. [Interjections.] Sir, that is a very clear indication of the point I have already made, of what the political virtues are in the r&#x00E9;gime as we see it to-day. We on this side of the House have repeatedly made it clear that we stand for the maintenance of law and order. But any effort such as this to enforce order regardless of elementary justice is entirely a different matter. The point has been made by hon. members, but I think it needs to be made again, that no community will give support to agitating, to intimidation, to violence or to destruction of property, unless there exists some real grievance which needs to be remedied. What is needed in South Africa to-day are wise political concessions from above if we are to avoid revolution from below. It has also been stated that it is not the harsh arm of the law or severity of punishment which is the remedy for just grievances. As I said at the outset, it is good government and a proper sense of proportion that avoid revolutionary situations from developing for their own ends. Therefore, I would ask the Minister and his Government to give heed to history in that regard instead of asking Parliament to add to the tangled mass of statutory political offences already on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>That brings me to that part of the Bill which purports (and I quote from the long title) &#x201C;to define and prohibit sabotage&#x201D;. The dictionary meaning of the word &#x201C;define&#x201D; is &#x201C;to state the precise nature of the thing or the precise meaning of the word&#x201D;. This clause, of course, does neither. It prescribes what is called an offence of sabotage in the vaguest possible terms. Not only does it open the door to delators&#x2014;that is to those persons who, to suit their own ends, give information to the Government in secret&#x2014;but it places even the most law-abiding citizen in jeopardy. I say that firstly because it contains this mass of verbiage which completely befogs the interpretation of the clause and leaves the ordinary man quite helpless.</p>

<p>To work one&#x2019;s way through, I am almost tempted to say to hack one&#x2019;s way through this forest of words calls for more than a team of lawyers. It also calls for a team of lumberjacks as far as I can see. [Interjections.] I think we will need both teams to reach what is a correct interpretation. Even the hon. the Minister has failed in his interpretation of this clause. I say that even a simple trespass on to someone&#x2019;s land can involve the unwitting trespasser in a charge of sabotage. I use this example purposely because the Minister laid great stress on the words &#x201C;wrongful and wilful&#x201D; in Clause 21. In fact, he waxed almost dramatic in the way he described how a person, before he came to the court, would have evidence so clear and so strong against him as to leave the impression that the fellow would even be found guilty before he got into court. For that reason the Minister considered sub-clause (2) to be a beneficial concession to the accused. But I just want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that his own interpretation is correct. The crime in Clause 21 falls roughly under three heads. The first is any person who commits any wrongful or wilful act whereby he injures, damages, etc., any of the various things which are enumerated in the first part of the clause. The second is any person who is associated with such an act, and I concede it must be done wrongfully and wilfully, either by aiding or conspiring or abetting, etc. The third head under which a person can be convicted is this: Any person who, in contravention of any law, possesses any explosives, firearms or weapons, or enters upon or is on any land&#x2026;. In other words &#x201C;wilful&#x201D; does not qualify any such contravention at all. The wrongful aspect is no more than a contravention of a statutory provision, and wilfulness has nothing to do with that last part of the offence of sabotage. That is why I purposely used the instance I have mentioned, that even to trespass on someone&#x2019;s land can involve the unwitting trespasser in a charge of sabotage. I know it will not happen, but one uses the example to test the law. I have used it hear to test the Minister&#x2019;s interpretation and I hope he will look at it, because if I am wrong he knows I will concede it. But I think Homer himself has nodded there.</p>

<p>The Minister even waxed dramatic about this word &#x201C;wilful&#x201D;, but &#x201C;wilful&#x201D; has no part at all in the last provision of this clause. That is the only reading I can <span class="col_6497-6498" refersTo="page_0495"/>give to this clause as it now stands. I know the answer will come that it will not happen. But that is not good enough. It must not happen, but it would by monstrous if it could remotely happen because of the kind of legislation passed by this House. I am reminded that it is said that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance on the part of the lawmaker. It seems to me this is a case where vigilance is very necessary. The other point which was made was that the Attorney-General would never prosecute in such circumstances. That I think is an invasion by the lawmaker into the domain of the courts, because it seems to me quite tragic that the Minister should try to make a virtue of the Attorney-General doing his duty. I have trust in that officer and I know he will do his duty. He will be concerned here with a capital charge, and it matters not whether the law provides that he shall himself deal with the matter or not, he knows his duty. But do not let us make a virtue of his duty and say that because he will do his duty we can frame the legislation in this clumsy way. I say the law-maker is invading the domain of the courts, since the courts are the guardians of the law.</p>

<p>It failed, but it failed on that side of the House as much as or more than on this side. Two wrongs do not make a right. The other aspect where this is also an invasion by the law-maker into the domain of the court is the provision which deals with juveniles. It invades the domain of the courts in this way, that it has always been a principle of our law that the courts have special duties in regard to minors. Now I would not have brought the discussions the Minister has had with the Bar Council into this debate except for the fact that the Minister himself mentioned it, but I hope the Minister will tell the House the nature of the representations made to him, and the nature of the concessions he agreed to consider.

And I am reminded of this, that on two occasions in the past this Minister, on reconsideration, has let his sense of justice prevail. He did that in regard to the Children&#x2019;s Bill about two years ago, and also in regard to another Bill. When I speak to the Minister in this way, I speak to him not merely as man to man, but as one who has the interests of the administration of justice at heart as much as he has. I therefore ask him to reconsider both these provisions, the provision in regard to preparatory examinations, which places an unnecessary and onerous burden on the official &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) began with the statement that the existing laws are adequate to combat Communism, but then he immediately went further to mention the instance of the treason trial which, as he put it, was a failure, and according to him was a failure because a proper case had not been made out. But by that he really only underlined that that very trial again proved and emphasized that our laws are not adapted in these modern times to the methods devised by Communism in order to achieve its objects. We find that admission also from none other than the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) when he wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The creation of the offence of sabotage can in itself not be attacked in principle because sabotage has been developed as a new technique in recent years, but its definition is tremendously wide.</block>

<p>I read that in the <i>Cape Times</i> of Monday, the 14th. No less a person than he has admitted that we are dealing with new developments and new methods of a world movement for which new measures have to be taken to combat it effectively. That is why I should like to say this to the Opposition, that they have given me the impression and convinced me that they have convinced themselves fully that they have made out a good case, that they virtually congratulate one another with their sound arguments. But I wish to say to them <span class="col_6499-6500" refersTo="page_0496"/>that the electorate outside, the people of South Africa, will not permit themselves to be misled by the smokescreen of juridical arguments and all kinds of trivialities we have had here. The people outside make a very simple summary of this discussion that is going on here, and that is that the Assembly is now discussing a law to combat Communism and that the United Party and the entire Opposition are acting as opponents of that law, in other words, are acting as the champions and mouthpieces of Communism. That is the conclusion of the man in the street from the discussions here, and history has taught us that the man in the street has a very sound judgment, and in the long run it will appear that his sound judgment was correct in this matter too. I can say that even hon. members opposite are oppressed by the realization that they have sided with Communism, for the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) has already asked: Why are you shooting at us? He pointedly asked: Does the Minister have us in mind, to apply the law to us? Well, I must say the hon. member has gone to sleep now fortunately, but he did not really give us the impression that he was quite <i>compos mentis.</i> But in his irresponsible rambling he did say that, and thereby he intimated that they are feeling that they now are so near to those people that they really are afraid that the law may also be applied to them. That is the impression this discussion leaves, and when the newspapers have stopped writing and the processions have come to a halt, this impression will continue, that the Assembly in the Republic of South Africa dwelt for a week on a law that was aimed at putting into operation more drastic measures to combat Communism, and the United Party opposed those measures. As always in the past, they were the people who were on the wrong side at every positive step, every step forward on the road of South Africa, on every occasion when determined and forceful action had to be taken against the enemy of South Africa. We have established a Republic in South Africa, and what lives in our thoughts and in the thoughts and the memories of the electorate, is that the United Party opposed that loftiest milestone in the history of South Africa, and I think hon. members opposite have already bitterly regretted that their party, under the leadership of their leader, ever decided to adopt that point of view. We have come to another very important Government measure, namely the measure that gives independence and freedom and eventual self-government to the Transkei, and those hon. members again told the world that they are not going to accord to the Bantu of the Transkei that right to govern themselves. think they were sorry afterwards, for they not only revealed themselves to the Bantu, but to the world also. And now, in our fight with the communists, in our honest attempts to combat this mighty world menace and to safeguard South Africa timeously against the forces of Communism, they are once again the most vigorous opponents of this measure. And so history will record it against them, that they have opposed and fought this measure for the cause of Communism. For what else does it amount to? The hon. member for Germiston (District) and the Leader of the Opposition stated it thus: We are opposed to Communism and sabotage. They admit it is a good law, and then they came along with all kinds of juridical arguments to divert attention from me principle of the Bill, from the essence of the Bill, and I say to them that South Africa will not forget their actions in this respect, even if we were not to remind South Africa of it again.</p>

<p>Much has been done during recent years in the Western world to understand the essence of Communism, its objects and modes of operations, and to take steps to combat Communism. From various sides many works appeared and reports have been brought out, and I wish to mention only a few of those things that have been written about Communism. I am thinking of Chambers&#x2019; summary of Communism and its objects. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most simply it is a militant and semi-military faith engaged in a war, now open, now concealed, against all others. The outcome of this war will probably decide what the next phase of human life will look like. What Communism has done is to make the morality of war its permanent single standard by which it always lives and acts.</block>

<p>And that is exactly what Communism is. For Communism the war continues, and in this phase of world history they are continuing the war under the guise of peace. To produce another witness, there is a report that has been produced in America by the Foreign Policy Research Institute, and they have said this in connection with the work and the activities of Communism&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is in train to-day a development without parallel in history, a war which has as its objective the overthrow of all parliamentary governments of the world and their replacement by communist dictatorship, centrally controlled in Moscow&#x2026;. A peace offensive in Moscow, a cultural conference in Warsaw, a strike in France, the invasion of Korea by fully equipped troops&#x2014;all are instruments of one war&#x2026;. Yet even now the West as a whole seems sublimely unaware that there are phases of war other than military action.</block>

<p>And that is the problem of the West, and it is the blindness of hon. members opposite, that they cannot see that Communism&#x2019;s fight for world conquest continues, in spite of the fact that there is no large-scale military action. And so Communism conquered Cuba, and so Communism is to-night engaged in getting more countries in the East under its domination. That war is going on inexorably, and Communism does not intend to have itself deterred by people who are scared and faint-hearted. Indeed, this is precisely what researchers have found, that Communism can only be stopped where governments of countries have the <span class="col_6501-6502" refersTo="page_0497"/>courage to take drastic steps. Communism could never succeed in conquering Turkey, in spite of the fact that Turkey lies at the gateway to Russia. But the Turks are armed to the teeth. They have committed themselves to the struggle against Communism, at all costs and to the last drop of blood. That is why Communism is no match for Turkey. There are other parts of the world that can be conquered more easily, and that is where the governments and the leaders of the countries are asleep. We are in fact in the middle of the Third World War. Communism has arrived at the realization that it can conquer the world much more easily when the world is asleep. And it is clear that in South Africa they have also progressed a good deal, and I should like to say why that is so.</p>

<p>The communists have gained ground in South Africa because they have persuaded many influential people to say there is peace, and have moved many influential people to declare themselves willing to conclude an alliance with them and to say there is no serious menace. We see it in these times in the actions of a great number of church leaders in South Africa. As recently as this week, Tuesday, there was a conference of representatives of six Christian Churches in South Africa, the Roman Catholics, the Anglicans, the Congregationalists, the Methodists, the Baptists and also the Presbyterians&#x2014;yes, to my regret, the Presbyterians also, for they are people who have always shown a sense of reality. Those people passed a resolution in regard to this Sabotage Bill and they condemn it because that Bill &#x201C;contains an implied principle that evil should be overcome by evil&#x201D;. That is their serious objection. They cannot approve this Bill, for we are vanquishing evil with evil. Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing I have always been surprised at, then it is the inconsistency of these English ecclesiasts. It is a fine idea they are stating, that a person should not try to conquer evil with evil. The Bible&#x2019;s idea is that you should conquer evil with good. I am prepared to agree with them that you should not conquer evil with evil, but I ask myself where were those people and where were their protests in the days when Britain and South Africa were allies to conquer Nazism? Where were their protests at that time, and where were their principles at that time? No, there was nothing then. When you embrace Communism to fight Nazism, you do not hold conferences. Then it is a different matter. But when the Government of the Republic of South Africa takes action against communists with a fairly drastic Bill, and strong measures against sabotage, they say no, now the matter is serious, for they are fighting evil with evil and that is un-Christian. One may ask the question: Where were those people&#x2019;s protests in Rhodesia, where all their churches were represented, when Rhodesia passed a sabotage Act which is more drastic than this one?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>It has not been mentioned here and no proof has been adduced that it is not so. It has been shown only that those measures are more drastic than the one before us now. Sir, recently there was sabotage in South Africa, and if we were to give them a chance, there will be more. The fact I wish to stress is the tremendous inconsistency of people who expect us to look to them and that South Africa should accept their guidance. But we cannot accept their guidance for their basic premise is wrong. For there are other principles they disregard without more ado. There is the principle that the sword has been given to the authorities, and that it is their task and duty to maintain order and peace in a country. That is a Biblical principle too, that it is the responsibility of the State to see to it that the person and the property of the citizen and the country are protected. What becomes of that principle if we give the communists in our country <i>carte blanche</i> to simply take all possible means to overthrow the existing order and destroy that which has been built up and achieved through the years, and even to destroy the basic things, religion and the cultural possessions of the nation, and to lead and to bind to slavery? When one looks at the actions of these English church leaders, you are not surprised that somebody has to rise in the House and express his disappointment that some of those people are representatives of his church. But I am convinced that those people may represent themselves, but certainly not all the members of the churches on whose behalf they are trying to speak.</p>

<p>Then we wish to say to those ecclesiasts who are so quick to talk when South Africa is concerned, and when it comes to action by the Government, which is a National Government, that we know them from our history, and that they really are ecclesiasts that are being driven by a political motive and not by religious motives. They take the lead in an anti-Government demonstration because it is a National Government, and they are trying to justify their actions with so-called Biblical principles. That is why we reject that pious exhibition as that of people who wish to engage in politics under the guise of religion, as has been done so frequently in our history.</p>

<p>I say Communism has made much progress in South Africa because they were able to succeed in using responsible people, Christians, as henchmen to do their dirty work&#x2014;Christians who are paving the way for Communism that eventually ousts and destroys Christianity. [Interjections.] Yes, I know it hurts, and that is why the hon. member wants to stifle it by saying it is nonsense, but judging from what we have heard there are many people over there who are incapable of distinguishing between sense and nonsense.</p>

<p>I have said that Communism has not only succeeded in tricking certain Chritian leaders <span class="col_6503-6504" refersTo="page_0498"/>into joining their campaign and into using them to pave the way for them, but they have also harnessed responsible politicians in South Africa to serve and defend their cause. It has been asked from that side why the Government tries to combat Communism with negative measures only. But that is not so. If we look back over the past years, and note the enormous housing programme that has been carried out for our less-privileged people, non-White as well as White, was it not a positive measure to clean up the slum areas, the breeding grounds of Communism? Has a tremendous lot not been achieved in this respect? Is it not a person such as Mr. Carpio, the representative of UNO, who said that: Why are thousands of such houses not being built in a city such as New York? Let hon. members opposite get up and tell us that was a negative measure. It is a positive act of faith and evidence of the Christian attitude to life of the Whites in South Africa, and that includes hon. members opposite, that we are granting those people more than just the slum, the pondokkies and the tin huts, and that we provide them with proper housing which creates better living room and better domestic conditions, where there may be happiness and peace and rest for them also. There is another positive step the Government has already taken. I am thinking of the development of the Bantu homelands and the self-government for the Transkei. Is that not a brilliant, positive step? Hon. members opposite want to suggest that we are scared of Black nationalism. We have never been afraid of nationalism, for we ourselves are Nationalist, and we are no more scared of Bantu nationalism than of our own nationalism. [Interjections.] When I look at those hon. members, I may ask them: Where has your SAP-ism led you, for see what you look like, and look where you are standing to-day, on the side of the communist as his champion.</p>

<p>I am not saying the hon. members are communists but their whole argument is in favour of the protection of Communism. The Government must not take these measures. What does it all amount to? They can ask that of any man outside. They can ask the little newspaper vendor outside and he will tell them. It is the inference he will draw. [Interjections.] There is only one conclusion one can draw, and that is the correct one, and hon. members opposite will not be able to free themselves of that. But I say the Government has taken positive steps to combat Communism in South Africa and prevent it, and I am convinced that as the Bantu homelands develop, and as self-government in the Transkei and in other Bantu homelands develops, Communism will fade among the Bantu, for it is a positive measure that will definitely exterminate Communism. This Bill is another measure. It is a drastic measure, but experience has taught us that you cannot tackle Communism with velvet gloves. Communism is fighting a fierce battle with no other morality than the morality of war, and they will use every weapon. They will use good, well-meaning Christians as agents and henchmen to further their cause. They will use Bantu nationalists if they can. They will harness all possible aggrieved people to further their cause, until they are in a position to take over the Government, and then they will govern South Africa according to the pattern of Communism. This is the point I should like to make to the House, that the communists have progressed far in South Africa, in the sense that they have taken so many responsible and even Christian leaders with them and persuaded them to act as champions for them, although it may be indirectly, and that they can even harness the United Party, for they do not have a parliamentary representative: but they have succeeded in binding the United Party as it were hands and feet to serve their cause.</p>

<p>The hon. member should search his own heart, and if he has a clear conscience he need not have any sense of guilt. Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has reminded me very much of a certain Jewish Crown Prince in these days. That Crown Prince had to face certain proposals to reform taxation on the occasion of his succession to the throne. When the matter came before him, he first consulted his elders and they spoke very nicely to him and said to him: &#x201C;Look, the matter is serious and you have to be very careful what you do.&#x201D; He did not feel quite satisfied because he was desirous of doing something great. So he went to consult his young people, his friends. He asked them: &#x201C;What do you say I should do?&#x201D; Their advice to him was this: If you wish to make a name for yourself, you have to hit hard, you must climb in, you must not flinch, you must not have yourself intimidated by the elders; show that you are a man.&#x201D; He then showed that he was a man and the next day ten of the 12 parts of his kingdom deserted him. It seems to me that is how it is with the United Party now; this is how it has gone with them during the past week. They consulted the elders, and the advice of the elders was: &#x201C;Careful, please&#x201D;. The young men were then consulted and they said: &#x201C;Climb in; act now&#x201D;. I am afraid the consequences for the crown prince of the United Party will be as disastrous as that for the Crown Prince of Israel. He will lose ten of the 12 parts of his kingdom. We do not know how many of those parts will go to the Progressives, but I think a considerable part will come to the National Party.</p>

<p>There is another question I should like to ask hon. members opposite, and that is: What do you think is the reaction of industrialists in South Africa in relation to this attitude of the United Party? Here I am thinking of <span class="col_6505-6506" refersTo="page_0499"/>people who are members of the United Party, people who risked their money to support the United Party, people who invested millions of pounds in South Africa in factories and all kinds of industries, people who can lose everything by sabotage and violence from militant Communism.</p>

In Clause 1 a &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; means any gathering, concourse or procession, and it includes a gathering of people, whether they have a common purpose or not, and under that clause the Minister has full power to ban any church service if a person whom he has banned as a communist attends that church service. The attack of the hon. member who has just sat down on the English-speaking churches gives full weight to the anxiety of the English-speaking churches in this country who are perturbed lest the steps taken against the communists will be taken against all those who do not think as the Government does. That attitude has been evidenced by speaker after speaker in the course of this debate. Speaker after speaker has suggested that anyone who does not support the Nationalist Party is a communist or communist-inspired or communist-inclined. That is the implication of the interjection made by the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) just now. He has left the Chamber now but he made that interjection. When irresponsible statements are made by irresponsible members on the Government side and those statements are not repudiated by the responsible Minister, can one be surprised at the anxiety of the responsible church bodies, who are wondering when their turn is going to come next?</p>

<p>One of the difficult parts of this measure as far as administration is concerned, deals with the way in which a person can be sentenced to a minimum sentence of five years&#x2019; imprisonment. A notice may appear in the <i>Gazette</i> with regard to the banning of a certain book. As hon. members know, the circulation of the <i>Gazette</i> is very small indeed. A book may be banned and a notice to that effect may appear in the <i>Gazette;</i> the accused person is not aware of the fact that that book has been banned, and yet he can be sent to gaol. The other day a question was put to the Minister of the Interior asking how many copies of the weekly <i>Government Gazette</i> and each weekly <i>Government Gazette Extraordinary</i> were printed and approximately what percentage of copies were distributed. The reply was that the number of copies printed weekly in the case of the <i>Government Gazette</i> was 13,000 and 15,600 in the case of the <i>Government Gazette Extraordinary.</i> When one considers the population of this country, one realizes the small circulation of the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Many innocent people may be caught under this Act for distributing a book which has been banned without their knowledge because they have not seen the <i>Gazette.</i> This measure makes life hard for booksellers and publishers. If they unwittingly publish a book which contains an extract from a speech made 20 years ago by a banned person they commit an offence. A person quoting a speech made 20 years ago may commit an offence under this measure. Sir, that has nothing to do with politics; it has nothing to do with sabotage. A member may quote in this House, with the approval of the Speaker, from a banned book, but if that same member later on quotes from Hansard a reference to a banned book, he could make himself guilty of an offence under this measure.</p>

<p>I think it is high time that responsible members on the Government side paid serious attention to our opposition to this Bill. The powers provided for in this measure are far too wide to be given to any Government or to any Minister. How can we expect every publisher to follow every <i>Gazette</i> and to examine every list of banned books to make sure that books published by him will not contain any quotation from a book which has been banned? I submit that that is wholly unreasonable and wholly undesirable. Sir, we have heard accusations from the other side of the House that the United Party is supporting the communists in opposing this Bill. To make such an accusation is to trifle with the sincerity and with the integrity of members on this side of the House. Under this Bill, if you are banned under Clause 2, you cannot make representations to be taken off the list. The recipient of a notice under Clause 4, which inserts a new Section 5 <i>ter,</i> cannot apply to the Minister to be taken off the list. As I say, this measure provides for powers which are far too wide and it is quite unjust &#x2026;</p>

The hon. the Leader of the Opposition quite <span class="col_6509-6510" refersTo="page_0501"/>rightly referred to this Bill as Civil Death.

<p>It is no good the Chief Whip trying to get out of the difficulty in that way. He makes an interjection and he is proved wrong; he is then put right by the hon. member for Smithfield and then he tries to clear himself by making further interjections. When we come to Clause 5 we find that the Minister has the right to discriminate in favour of a journal which favours the Government and against a journal which opposes the Government by requiring the latter to make a deposit. We cannot lose sight of the fact that the Minister may even ban existing papers, but new newspapers are liable to this deposit or this fine. Sir, when one has regard to the interest of Government members and to the interest of members of the Cabinet in newspapers, is it surprising that people outside are perturbed, because any paper which does not support the Government&#x2019;s point of view may be banned. It is quite clear from interjections that we have heard in this debate that anyone who opposes the Nationalist Party is an enemy, that anyone who opposes this Bill is a communist or a protector of communists. That has been said time after time in the course of this debate. It has been made abundantly clear by way of interjections and in the course of speeches in this debate that the attitude of the Government side is that anyone who speaks against this Bill is a protector of communists.</p>

<p>&#x2026; to prohibit gatherings or types or classes of gatherings if he is satisfied that the activities of one person or one organization are furthering or may further the objects of Communism. As it stands, under this clause, the Minister can prohibit any gathering at all because he is already satisfied that there is a person in the Republic whom he thinks is promoting the object of Communism. It depends entirely on the Minister&#x2019;s opinion. What we are concerned about in this Bill is that the courts are excluded under most of the provisions of this Bill and where the courts are excluded it is for the Minister to express his opinion and there is no appeal against that opinion. This Bill virtually gives dictatorial powers to the Minister; it virtually gives him life and death powers, and we are completely justified therefore in opposing this Bill. There is no protection in the courts against the decision of the Minister. The Minister is all-powerful in this matter. Our objections are not based solely upon the provisions of the Bill as such but what is behind the provisions of this Bill, namely that the Minister virtually has despotic powers. This Minister has despotic powers. He and he alone can decide. Under those circumstances, Mr. Speaker, we are not prepared to support this Bill. We are not prepared to give this Minister unbridled powers, not only this Minister personally, but any Minister on the Government side, and for that matter I would not give any Minister in any Parliament powers as far-reaching as these, as extensive as these. It is totally unsound to give to any Minister virtually the power of life and death over individuals, without reference to the courts, powers to ban meetings, powers to prohibit the publication of papers, powers to close down newspapers, powers to fix arbitrarily what those newspapers shall pay and where to deposit those amounts, having regard to the interests which members of the Cabinet have in the newspaper world, powers to ban gatherings of all sorts, communist and non-communist gatherings, powers to define persons, no matter what their associations, as persons have communist leanings, powers to ban church meetings and church gatherings, powers to take little children of 14 and 15 years of age and treat them the same as adults. Any Bill which goes as far as that and gives such wide and arbitrary powers to a Minister is of such a nature that it can only be repudiated by all responsible citizens in this country.</p>

<p>I repeat that such action is reprehensible. Secondly, the hon. member knows that it is not the Minister who will impose the sentence. The courts are specifically recognized. The courts alone decide what the penalty will be, not the Minister. But the way in which the hon. member for Pinetown represented the position you would think that the Minister had the right to decide on life or death simply by decree. The hon. member says that Parliament is no longer a Parliament when members hurl personal insults about. Where was the hon. member when the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) made himself guilty last night of indulging in the worst form of personal insults and personal untruths imaginable in this Parliament? No, the hon. member should not put up that defence. The hon. member for Pinetown says in this House that the Minister can ban any organization, but he omits to refer to the crucial point in this clause. He conveniently omits to mention the motive of that organization, the reason why that organization has been established, namely, that the organization has been established with the object of acting illegally. I maintain that the communists use various methods and we must bear that in mind. They employ the method of organizing strikes, of sowing chaos, the method of sowing suspicion, they spread untruths in order to sow agitation and discontent. Those are the methods which the communists employ and when you ban Communism those communists and communist elements look for public agents, public agents which wittingly and unwittingly assist them, public agents which they can use in a veiled way. That is what we should guard against. Those public agents are abused. As I have said certain organizations allow themselves to be used by Communism, some knowingly and others unknowingly. I wish to give examples to show how that has already been going on in South Africa for a long time. I really wish to say that not only should we congratulate the Minister on this Bill but I want to know why these provisions were not introduced years ago in the Suppression of Communism Act? The reason is, of course, that Communism, as an ideology, is continually looking for loopholes in all the legislation in all those countries where Communism is being suppressed. Hence you have to introduce amending legislation to strangle Communism from time to time because they employ methods which have proved successful throughout the world to find loopholes. I want to say to hon. members of the Opposition that they cannot talk with us when it comes to Communism. They complain about our saying that because they do not support this legislation they want to protect Communism and sabotage. But in essence that is true. Was it not that party who said &#x201C;No, you are not a communist&#x201D;, when somebody got up in this House and said &#x201C;I am a communist&#x201D;? What right have they, therefore, to talk to us about Communism? They refuse to admit that a person is a communist even when he publicly declares himself to be one. In order to create the impression in the world outside that they were against Communism they came along and said: &#x201C;If we pass a law against Communism we will hang somebody or shoot him who makes himself guilty of Communism.&#x201D; But when somebody admits that he is a communist, they say to him &#x201C;No, you are not a communist, continue with your agitation, continue besmirching this country, continue with your efforts to sabotage and to undermine it&#x201D;. That is the crux of the matter. It is the United Party who is continually acting in that negative way. Knowing that the voters of South Africa expect Communism to be suppressed, knowing that the voters of South Africa demand it of this Parliament to maintain and to protect our democratic form of government they want to make the world outside and South Africa believe that they are opposed to Communism and sabotage. But just as they said to that person at the time: &#x201C;No, you are not a communist&#x201D; they are carrying on in the same way and, as was quoted only a few days ago, the Whip of the United Party said &#x201C;We can no longer overthrow this Government by employing democratic means, we must negotiate it from outside in another way. There must be a shock.&#x201D; That shock is the shock of sabotage, the revolutionary shock which the communists are employing throughout the world. When we passed the Suppression of Communism Act we already knew that speechs were made like the following extract which I want to quote from one of them&#x2014;.</p>

<p>The time has arrived for the non-Whites to enter Parliament and to say to the members of the Herrenvolk &#x201C;Out, scoundrels&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6515-6516" refersTo="page_0504"/>The 9,000,000 Natives of South Africa have a golden opportunity to take over the government of the country. Within 24 hours we will be able to find a Prime Minister as well as the Ministers within our own ranks to govern South Africa.</block>

<p>That was said in 1948 by Bonar Richards on 30 March at Woodstock. Because we had that sort of agitation the Government of the day decided that it was necessary to pass legislation against Communism, but that kind of agitation went underground and those kind of agitators found public agents. I wish to give you an example, Sir. I have here an election manifesto of the Liberal Party and I wish to quote one example from it to indicate what public agents are used. There is a photograph of a person on horseback with a whip in his hand supervising a number of men cultivating the soil. Those men are Natives. Then you have the following sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then there are farm labour gaols. Let us not hedge about. Recruiting for farm labour is a form of forced labour tantamount to slavery, and farms only in totalitarian countries. Cash wages of convict farm labour are as low in some areas as 11s. 4d. per month.</block>

<p>This article, communistically inspired, is sent into the world as an example of labour conditions in South Africa. This photo is similar to those taken by people like Margaret Burke White of young Native girls behind barbed wire, a barbed wire fence which was erected to safeguard them and to prevent them from running into the road and from being killed by motor-cars on the main roads, and those photos are then used as representing barbed wire camps in South Africa in order to suppress the people of South Africa. I maintain that that is a communist method of creating agitation which is still being employed in South Africa since the Suppression of Communism Act has been in operation. It is a communist method of creating agitation in order to incite the world against South Africa and to oppose us in every possible sort of way. It is Communism which is practiced in this country and used in the world outside for that purpose. I repeat that that has been happening since we have passed the Suppression of Communism Act. You see that in a newspaper like <i>Time</i> and others. Those are the same people who plead for freedom in South Africa, who print and publish whatever they want to and then the United Party puts up this pious fight and protects that sort of action. In this fight which they are putting up this party wants to make it possible for all agitators in South Africa and in the world outside, to continue with their communistic propaganda in the Press and to continue with this propaganda by means of Press reports and statements to the Press as those by Luthuli when he is under house arrest in a certain area. In putting up this fight that party wants to make it impossible for us to suppress Communism properly. They want all of them to use all those methods. I am justified in asking whether the United Party is not one of those public agents which are used by the communists. Here I have a notice inviting the public to come and to listen to two people. It says &#x201C;Have you heard what what we have to say? whether you have heard it or not you will have the opportunity of listening to our national president, Sailor Malan, who, together with Sir de Villiers Graaff of the United Party, will address a meeting at 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 June.&#x201D; They are coupled together and they are introduced from the same platform as two big leaders. These same people, this same Torch Commando, are again agitating. These same people have sent a circular letter into the country together with certain brochures and I want to read the circular letter of 13 May 1952&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since the National Chairman of the Torch Commando has already made public reference to &#x201C;a day of protest&#x201D;, I assume that the matter is even now occupying your attention. I hope our pamphlet will have the effect of hastening your deliberations and persuading you that there are large numbers of ex-volunteers and others waiting to give you their vigorous support.</block>

<p>Those are the same people who are invited to appear on the platform with Sir de Villiers Graaff, the Leader of the Opposition. I received the brochure in which the &#x201C;day of protest&#x201D; is announced. Let us see how Communism is coupled with that. I just want to give you a few examples, Sir. They start with the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The movement is at its beginnings. Yet none can see its end. Already the volunteers are reckoned in thousands, firing a flame of national independence and liberation in the minds and spirits of our African, Indian and Coloured citizens.</block>

<p>The hon. member says that was 11 years ago. That was why I said at the beginning of my speech that had we known 11 years ago what methods the communists used we would immediately have incorporated all these clauses in the Suppression of Communism Act so as to prevent Communism, after it had been <span class="col_6517-6518" refersTo="page_0505"/>suppressed, from suddenly using public agents in a veiled manner.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>We have waited for such a long period because you do not come forward with entire legislation when the first loopholes are discovered. Let us honestly admit that this is a drastic Bill. Your legislation is drastic only to the extent that the agitation piles up and increases. What did these people want to do? I am again quoting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a campaign to defy certain specific unjust laws.</block>

<p>In other words, South Africa as a whole, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu, together with the Torch Commando and together with the United Party are called upon to break and to ignore the laws. The first method employed by Communism is to ignore laws, to represent laws which Parliament has passed in a democratic way, as illegal, unreasonable and unjust laws. That is not all they do. The grossest lies are spread in the course of this agitation campaign. Just listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But for the non-European peoples the meaning of the term &#x201C;unjust laws&#x201D; lies much deeper. At its roots lies the fundamental injustice that these laws are made by a Parliament in which the non-White citizens have no voice and in which their viewpoint is not considered. The term expresses not mere dissatisfaction with the laws; it expresses the conviction that a law proclaimed &#x201C;unjust&#x201D; violates the very essence of justice, of decency, of democracy and of civil liberties.</block>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct. The worst form of agitation which you can have in South Africa is to suggest that your own laws which you yourself have helped to place on the Statute Book are unreasonable and unjust and undemocratic. In other words, hon. members of the United Party have for 11 years been co-responsible of sabotaging the laws of South Africa by means of agitation. I think the time has arrived that a stop be put to that. Let me give an example. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) is not here at the moment, but I give this example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are the stock limitation laws, forcibly depriving impoverished peasant farmers of the only wealth they have&#x2014;cattle.</block>

<p>The Bantu regard cattle as their wealth and here they are being told that their wealth is being stolen from them in South Africa. If that is not sabotaging human relations, if that is not sabotaging discipline, if that is not sabotaging the respect which the Bantu have always had for the honesty of the White man, if that is not sabotaging the soil conservation methods which are applied, then I do not know what sabotage is.</p>

<p>I said at the beginning of my speech that Communism not only indulged in agitation but in lies as well. Listen to this, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But for years the voters have voted, heedless of their duty to justice and liberty, blind to the needs of the 9,000,000 vote less non-Europeans, often ignorant of the laws of their own country, because those laws do not operate against White skins.</block>

<p>A pamphlet is sent round the country and distributed among 9,000,000 Bantu and in it they are told that these laws are only directed against them and not against the White. Is there one law in South Africa which differentiates between White and non-White when action is taken under it? There is not such a law. The law dealing with theft, the law dealing with murder, the law dealing with rape, the law dealing with assault, all those laws are applied irrespective of the colour of the person. They are applicable to everyone in our country. But in causing this agitation the United Party together with their allies find it convenient to try to make them believe that these laws are not for the White man, that the White man can do just as he pleased, in order to sow this seething, smouldering dissatisfaction. They are only for the Bantu. That is sabotage of human relations in its worst form.</p>

<p>I can go on giving one example after the other. I repeat that Sailor Malan and Sir de Villiers Graaff were invited together to address the meeting; and it was the Torch Commando who recommended this D-day. In this same pamphlet they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was no longer time to wait for the voters to make a stand, for the sands of South African democracy were running out. Voting itself and elections and free speech and assembly were under Malan&#x2019;s attack.</block>

<p>I repeat that after the Suppression of Communism Act had been passed. Communism, in keeping with its clever world-wide practice, surreptitiously looked for public agents to continue to sow chaos, to continue to propagate <span class="col_6519-6520" refersTo="page_0506"/>their ideology; Communism is founded on the principle of overthrowing governments by way of revolution, and if ever there has been a veiled attempt to overthrow South African democracy and the South African Government in a revolutionary way, it is this sort of propaganda, these sort of reprehensible lies which are spread throughout the country. This same organization distributed a second pamphlet called &#x201C;Action Stations I want you to note how subtly this pamphlet is worded, Sir. The following is the sort of thing which will be prohibited under this Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The beginnings are far back in our history, in the development of virulent racial agitation, in the creeds of baasskap and master-races, in the prostitution of democracy in the name of apartheid, in the desecration of patriotism in the name of a vicious, narrow and exclusive &#x201C;purified nationalism&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the coming together of the United Party, the Labour Party and the Torch Commando, a move has been made in the right direction. The United Democratic Front united these three above the barriers of party differences.</block>

<p>The United Democratic Front brought those three together. What does the United Democratic Front ask these three to do? And the United Party are guilty of having done that. It asks this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; for the single common aim of defeating the Government&#x2019;s headlong rush to dictatorship.</block>

<p>The Democratic Front brought this piebald crowd together in order to overthrow this Government and in which way, Sir? Listen to the way. This is the sort of pamphlet which hon. members wish to be continued to be spread in South Africa. They say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The moment for action is here. We must consider carefully, without panic or bravado, what that action is to be. That action must do two things: It must unite the widest possible sections of the South African people&#x2014;employer and employee, labourer and artisan, housewife and clerk, farmhand and teacher. It must make it clear for all our people, for our Government and for the world to see that here, in this action, is the South African people united in hostility to no one save the fascists in the seat of power.</block>

<p>We are represented as fascists and how?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And it must be an unmistakable demonstration to the Government that power in South Africa belongs not to the Nationalist Party caucus, but to the South African people.</block>

<p>What do they say further?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These needs are met in only one way&#x2014;by the organizing of a nation-wide stoppage of work, a stay-away from work of employees and employers alike in commerce, in industry, in agriculture; a nation-wide protest day when the people will demonstrate practically their ability to paralyse the country rather than submit to dictatorship.</block>

<p>How must they do that?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And if it is to be effective, non-European workers must participate. They will do so because they, above all South Africans, have felt most harshly the harsh Nationalist Government acts of repression.</block>

<p>They are calling upon South Africa to strike in order to paralyse this country completely. We have seen from the history of this country that the Sharpevilles and the Langas are born from such propaganda encouraging strikes, from those propaganda methods. That propaganda to encourage strikes which the United Party is spreading under the wing of the Democratic United Front has led to murder and death. From that propaganda which encourages strikes the bombs are born which are thrown into city halls and other places. I repeat that if the United Party does not know it, the time has arrived for them to wake up. They should realize that they are one of the public agents which Communism is using in South Africa. This whole fight which they are putting up against this Bill definitely proves that they are one of those public agents. A few moments ago the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) said that if this Bill were passed it would no longer be possible to distribute this type of pamphlet in the country, it would no longer be possible to quote it. Do hon. members of the Opposition still wish this sort of propaganda, this kind of untruths and this type of lies to be sent out into the country under their veiled protection, veiled under their wing? That is what those hon. members are doing. It cannot be refuted that the United Party is coupled to that Democratic Front. It cannot be refuted that the United Party is guilty of it that they are protecting that kind of agitation. They dare not say that they are not responsible for Sharpeville; they dare not say that they are not responsible for Langa. If you listen to the kind of hysterical speech which we had from the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) who said &#x201C;We will march if we lose the referendum&#x201D; I ask once again: Is this not agitation which can develop into ordinary sabotage?</p>

Langa and Sharpeville are the results of the propaganda which has been spread by the front into which the United Party has been drawn. I have proved chapter and verse how the United Party because of the propaganda material which they used at the last election, are forged into a firm unit to overthrow this Government. If they cannot do so on the strength of votes then in some other way. Has any member of the United Party ever risen to his feet and dissociated himself from the Democratic Front? Has any member of the United Party ever risen to his feet and dissociated himself from the irresponsibilities of the Black Sash? Oh no.

<p>There has been one thought running through my mind the whole night: That it takes all sorts to make a world. For example, it takes the sort of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) who has spent 40 valuable minutes denigrating the official Opposition in this House of Assembly of the Republic of South Africa. That is one sort of human being that we have. He has been aided and abetted by unceasing and incessant attacks by fellow-citizens of the Republic of South Africa. On the other hand, another citizen of another Republic, the Republic of the United States of America, has been in orbit round the earth and has probably already successfully completed a very important mission, which may be of great service to humanity. There you have the difference between heaven and earth. I would like the hon. member for Wakkerstroom to ponder this&#x2014;that it may be possible&#x2014;although barely possible?&#x2014;that a gentleman by the name of Malcolm Scott Carpenter has yesterday rendered a greater service to humanity than the hon. member for Wakkerstroom. It may be arguable, but I would like him to think about it. To the extent that I thought I could reply to his speech, I intended to take notes. And <span class="col_6523-6524" refersTo="page_0508"/>quite honestly, Sir, I sat here with my pencil poised, but I failed to take a single note&#x2014;although I am perfectly wide awake; because what he said&#x2014;and I say this without any reflection on the Chair&#x2014;has been said literally <i>ad nauseam</i> in my hearing. The reply has been given over and over again to the allegation that the United Party consists of a bunch of communists. The only thing that still has to be done forthrightly, without any reservation, is to point a finger straight at every individual member here and to say &#x201C;You are a communist&#x201D; or &#x201C;You are not a communist Except for that, Sir, everything has been thrown at us, by everyone, from the Minister downwards or upwards, depending on how you want to move.

<p>No, you may not. I am sorry, Sir, I should have welcomed you, but I did not know you had arrived. Now, Sir, there is in this rather difficult situation one very faint ray of hope, as I see it. I may have misconstrued the position completely, but I found that ray of hope in the original statement which the hon. Minister made when he introduced the second reading of this Bill. The statement which I regard as the ray of hope came when he said this: &#x201C;This Bill is not a panic measure; it is a reasoned, cool and calculated measure which I would have preferred not to introduce.&#x201D; I stress &#x201C;which I would have preferred not to introduce&#x201D;, and therefore, I think that somewhere deep down in the Minister&#x2019;s conscience there is a certain reluctance about this very Bill which he had to introduce, unless he said that with his tongue in his cheek. But if he said it in all seriousness&#x2014;and he appeared to be serious&#x2014;then there is just the outside chance that the Minister says in effect, &#x201C;If I could see another approach to this problem, another way of settling this issue, of eliminating this difficulty, I would have preferred to take it&#x201D;. He may still be of that opinion, Sir. Therefore I take the liberty&#x2014;and I say this with very great deference&#x2014;to show him that there is in fact another way, another course which has been chartered for him by very important and eminent people in the public life of South Africa.

<p>Mr. Speaker, knowing the &#x201C;affection&#x201D; with which the hon. the Minister regards the former Chief Justice, I will not annoy him by quoting that gentleman. Some years ago there was a measure called the Aliens Affairs Bill introduced in this House of Assembly. It was introduced by the then Minister of Justice. I am not going to read the text of the Bill. In moving that the Bill be read a second time, the Minister at the time, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Bill is necessary in order to enable the Government to act upon any recommendations which may be made by the commission recently appointed, to examine the cases of enemy aliens which the Government thinks should, in the interests of national security, be deported from South Africa.</block>

<p>The essence of the Bill was that a commission should be appointed to inquire into the merit or otherwise of deporting any aliens, not citizens of South Africa, but any aliens, after a world war which up to this day has been and is still regarded as the greatest war in the history of the world. And therefore, Sir, I think the hon. the Minister of Justice will agree that in those circumstances, that Bill pales into insignificance by comparison with a measure which he himself has admitted is drastic.

The hon. the Minister has, in effect, said over and over again&#x2014;if I close my eyes I can still hear him say it&#x2014;&#x201C;I take as my text: &#x2018;the safety of the State is the highest law.&#x2019;&#x201D; I remember that. The Minister must remember that he set the tone for the entire argument of the Government side when he said&#x2014;and it was repeated almost like a parrot-cry&#x2014;&#x201C;the safety of the State is the highest law&#x201D;. Don&#x2019;t let him try to suggest that the United Party dealt with this matter in a special way. They thought at the time that the safety of the State was the highest law, and so they had to introduce a Bill.</p>

<p>Don&#x2019;t give me that red herring. I have already stated there was a certain job of work which the State had to do, so it introduced a Bill. This particular Bill pales into insignificance in regard to its provisions when compared with the Bill which the present Minister introduced the other day. Now this was what Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said (Hansard, 10 June 1946, Col. 9820)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I make bold to say that no clause of this nature has been passed in any legislature which conforms to democratic principle. I want to challenge the Minister to give me one example, even during war-time, of a clause of this nature. It would have been a blot on our Statute Book even during wartime. In peace-time there are no terms which can describe the nature of what we are asked to perpetrate here this evening. It is an eternal shame to this legislature if it passes a measure of this kind and gives the power to the Minister, to unfettered, so unqualified, as to elevate a man to the rank of a combined Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin all rolled into one. That is what the Minister is asking here, and I want to say to this Minister: We have heard a lot from him about Nazism, but I want to remind him of the words of Marcus Aurelius: &#x201C;The best way of avenging thyself is not to do likewise.&#x201D; What he is doing in this Bill is to imitate.</block>

<p>Then there was an interjection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Imitate who?</block>

<p>The gentleman should have said &#x201C;whom&#x201D;, but he said &#x201C;imitate who?&#x201D; and then Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nazis, as you call them.</block>

<p>He was not finished with this Bill, Sir. He made another speech in this connection which I would again like the hon. the Minister of Justice to take to heart. He said (col. 10216)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to support the eloquent plea that has been made by the hon. Leader of the Opposition. We are nearing the end of a tragic episode in the history of this House.</block>

<p>How true those words are this morning, Sir. I could not have written a better speech myself. I never write them, but I can make a reasonably good speech. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are nearing the end of a tragic episode in the history of this House&#x2014;the history of this particular Session&#x2014;and I would be failing in my duty if I did not rise to make use of this opportunity to register my protest against what I consider to be a blot on the fair name of South Africa. We object to this unpalatable and unacceptable measure, not only on the broad humanitarian reasons which have been put before this House so eloquently by the Leader of the Opposition, but also on further grounds which I wish to put before this House. The issue is, after all, a straightforward issue, a plain issue, and we feel in the first place that this Bill is unacceptable because it confers autocratic powers on the Minister, on the Executive&#x2014;power which no democratic government has yet thought fit to arrogate to itself. I challenged the Minister in charge at the Committee Stage to quote me one other country which honours democratic principles which has thought it necessary to introduce a measure of this nature. I repeat that challenge. The power that is here being given to the Minister is not only the power to be the final arbiter whether a subject is guilty of certain overt acts, but also whether he ever harboured intentions of carrying out such acts. The Minister, in terms of this measure, becomes &#x2026;</block>

<p>This was quoted the other day by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if I remember correctly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the grand inquisitor, the Great Pooh Bah, both Lord Chief Justice and Lord High Executioner.</block>

<p>And, Sir, I will add he even becomes the Mikado, if you know that particular Gilbert and Sullivan opera. There is a lot more; of course I cannot read the whole speech. [Interjections.] This is a very good speech; you must listen to this. I heard a lot worse made in this House during the course of this night. Then Dr. D&#x00F6;nges went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is one reason why this Bill is unpalatable and unacceptable to us. There is <span class="col_6527-6528" refersTo="page_0510"/>a further reason, and that is that this Bill deprives the subject of the elementary right to invoke the aid of the courts against the possible despotism of the Executive. It is nothing else than a negation of the rule of law.</block>

<p>I do not want to digress, but we have had contemptuous references from hon. members of the Government to the rule of law. We are always complaining about the rule of law, they say; now listen to Dr. D&#x00F6;nges&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is nothing else than a negation of the rule of law which has been the comer stone of the rights of the individual and the liberty of the subject. It runs counter to every principle of justice and has no justification, either in principle or in precedent &#x2026;</block>

<p>And guess what he says here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; except in totalitarian states. It is opposed to the precedents which I have quoted here at an earlier stage&#x2026;.</block>

<p>There is a lot more that I could quote. But this is enough at this stage to convince the Minister of Justice that there are other ways of looking at the Bill than the way in which he looks at the Bill which he hopes will solve a certain problem which we have in South Africa. Surely if what I have said, and what others have said before me or may say after me, does not commend itself to the hon. the Minister, somebody who stands high in his regard, politically and otherwise, might have something good to say to influence his decision as to whether or not he will press this Bill to its logical conclusion. There is still time. It is no use, Sir, trying to convince anybody outside this House that, whenever anybody objects to legislation like this, he is a communist. Because, if that is true, then the hon. the Minister of Finance in his day was a communist. If it is true of us to-day&#x2014;let us understand this very clearly&#x2014;it was equally true of the then hon. member of the House of Assembly, now the Minister of Finance. You cannot lightly dismiss such things as the right of the individual to appeal to the courts. You cannot scorn the rule of law. I am not a lawyer. Sir; I am only a sea-lawyer. The lawyer sits over there, and he knows better than I the importance of the rule of law.</p>

<p>Well, all I can say is, that applies also to Hansard, because nothing can &#x201C;lure back or cancel half a line&#x201D; of what is written there. It may be that the moving finger is only a revolving tape, but whatever is enshrined in Hansard is there for all time. Newcomers like myself can then come here to read it, and ponder over it. I have another speech here which was delivered in connection with a <span class="col_6529-6530" refersTo="page_0511"/>fairly innocuous measure. But first of all I should like to refer to the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 4 February 1941 (No. 20 of 1941) subsequently referred to as the Emergency Regulations and, in fact, called the National Security Regulations. There are 54 of these regulations dealing with matters such as subversive statements and their definition; the circulation of subversive statements; unlawful associations; interference with lawful gatherings &#x2026; I wonder whether the hon. the Minister modelled his clause in this Bill on this regulation. As a matter of fact, there is a suspicious similarity. These regulations further deal with &#x201C;prohibition of unauthorized drilling&#x201D;&#x2014;and I wonder what the hon. Minister knows about unauthorized drilling! I come now to the penalties attached to an offence under these regulations. Once again I should like to ask hon. members to note the similarity and at the same time the words of difference between these provisions and those in the Bill with which we are dealing now. At any rate, the penalties attached to all those things I have mentioned were laid down in regulation No. 41 whereof paragraph (1) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person convicted of an offence under these regulations shall be liable to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;200 or in default of payment to imprisonment not exceeding one year, or such imprisonment without the option of a fine or both such fine and such imprisonment &#x2026;</block>

<p>A magistrate&#x2019;s court is empowered to impose these prescribed penalties. Penalties connected with the use of explosives were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Imprisonment for a period of not less than five years unless it be proved that the person convicted had no intention &#x2026;</block>

<p>It will be noted that a term of imprisonment of only five years was prescribed, and that there was no mention of hanging! What is more, an explosion caused by the discharge of a firearm or by the setting off of fireworks was excluded from this regulation. I should like the hon. the Minister to take note of that, namely that in 1941, when you let off fireworks or even fired a pistol, you were not deemed to have caused an explosion. But what is going to happen under this Bill if you fire a firearm or set off fireworks in 1962?</p>

<p>But was there not a war on in 1941?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member is perfactly right. There was a war on, but I would not have dreamt of making mention of that because the moment I did that, hon. members opposite would have accused us of always talking about the war! Then they want to know what the subject under discussion has to do with it. Now, let me return to my Hansard record. These regulations, which were innocuous compared with the present Bill, were greeted with a great deal of indignation, and in the course of a debate of a no-confidence motion, i.e. on 5 February 1941, a certain gentleman who has risen to an important position in this land, namely the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is recorded as having said the following (Col. 2250) after there had been an outburst of &#x201C;laughter</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, hon. members may laugh, but the Government is afraid, and that is the reason why fresh regulations were issued yesterday. Those regulations clearly show the scare, the nervousness on the part of the Government. They are a sign of it. They are afraid of criticism, and they are scared of Zeesen. Everything is undermined. The words &#x201C;undermining&#x201D;, &#x201C;subversive&#x201D; are becoming a joke in South Africa. One cannot go to a meeting and say &#x201C;booh&#x201D;, but it is regarded as undermining, and one may be sent to gaol or one may have to pay a fine.</block>

<p>Now, is that not dreadful? One could not even say &#x201C;booh&#x201D;, and that during the greatest war the world has known, and in which South Africa was involved for better or for worse. Then the only penalty for an explosion under certain circumstances was a term of imprisonment for one year! But Dr. Malan even had a choicer expression about this innocuous piece of legislation. In Col. 2658 of Hansard of 6&#x002F;7 February 1941, he is reported as having said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot better describe the emergency regulations than by saying that it is the qualification of the judicial procedure of Tchaka.</block>

<p>Now I should like to ask the hon. the Minisster: Who is he prepared to listen to? I am sure he is not prepared to listen to me. I am quite certain of that. As a matter of fact, up to now he has given no indication that he is prepared to listen to anyone in this House. I should like him to tell me whether he is prepared to listen to one of the outstanding leaders this country has ever had, namely the late Dr. D. F. Malan? Is he prepared to listen to two of his colleagues, i.e. the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs? I have already quoted what these two colleagues of his have said.</p>

<p>Let us then go back to 1939, and see what another important leader of the Nationalist Party said in another context. In 1939 the world was considered to be in a very serious condition. It was a sick world, and it was being pushed into a threatening war.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I may be a sick man, but the last doctor I would go to is a doctor in Randfontein! At any rate I would like to quote from speeches made in the House of Assembly on 21 March 1939 when the <span class="col_6531-6532" refersTo="page_0512"/>Government was headed by General J. B. M. Hertzog. I should like members to note what was said on that occasion, especially by General Hertzog himself. Now if it can be said that a Government under General Hertzog was a sick Government there is no possibility of us ever having a sane Government in South Africa, because General Hertzog was a great architect of his party and the greatest Nationalist Prime Minister South Africa has ever had. However, in March 1939 there were people who were very worried about the world situation, and rightly so, because by September the world was at war, and we were in it too. There was a highly respected member of the House at that time whose name, even to this day, stands high in the estimation of all who knew him, irrespective of political differences. The man I am referring to is the late Dr. N. J. van der Merwe. Who is there in this House to-day who does not know of Dr. N. J. van der Merwe? I have sometimes formed the impression that there are certain members in this House who know less of the history of their own party than they do of Communism. They have been telling us about Communism for so long and they have virtually set themselves up as a voluntary Public Relations Organization for the Communist International. To return to Dr. van der Merwe&#x2014;according to Hansard, Col. 2100 of 21 March 1939, Dr. van der Merwe moved the following motion under the heading &#x201C;Democratic Liberties of the Nation&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">That this House views with concern the manner in which the Government is systematically violating and undermining the democratic liberties of the nation, <i>inter alia</i>, by means of its policy of muzzling, dismissing and terrorizing, and wishes to express its strongest disapproval thereof.</block>

<p>Further in his speech he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are not only concerned with dangers to democracy from outside, but there is a threat to democracy in our midst as well. We are not only dealing with a threat such as the one of which we read in the papers on the part of a Hitler or a Mussolini, but one of the greatest dangers which threaten democracy in our country is from within, when we have a Government of a democratic country which is gradually being obsessed with a desire to dominate, and although it retains the form of a democracy there is in reality gradually coming into existence in our country a dictatorship from within. Another danger from within is this, that the practices arise within a democracy especially encouraged by people who want to take care that they do not lose office in a democratic country, practices which gnaw like a cancer at the entrails of democracy it-self and which cause corruption inside the democracy, which in itself must eventually end in the death of democracy.</block>

<p>Towards the end of his speech he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When a party is set on crushing any independent public opinion by terrorism and persecution, how does that method differ from what we hear from overseas &#x2026;</block>

<p>Where are all these people who were telling us about the methods of the Communist Party and its blueprints? I want them to listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in what does it differ from what we hear from countries like Italy, Germany and Russia where no other party than the Government Party is tolerated? They are the symptoms of a dictatorship like those of Facism which allow of no other party; they are the symptoms of a dictatorship of Communism which does not allow of any other party either and which uses those methods to crush any opposition party. That is the direction in which the Government of South Africa is going, and it is because of the existence of these facts that we are obliged to introduce this motion to-day. We ask: What will it lead to if we want to hold the ideals of liberty high in South Africa, and we allow that kind of thing?</block>

<p>This was an eminent member of our Parliament speaking, and therefore I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to remember what he, i.e. the Minister, said when he introduced the Bill we are dealing with now, namely &#x201C;I would have preferred not to have introduced it&#x201D;. The conclusion I have come to is that on a reconsideration of the matter in the light of what the hon. the Minister has himself referred to as &#x201C;objective regard&#x201D; and in the light of the established opinions, not those of to-day&#x2019;s Opposition, but of very eminent people in our history, we can deal with this problem of Communism without this Bill becoming necessary at all. I should like to remind hon. members on the other side that the thread which ran consistently through all their speeches was the statement that the Government was being consistent in producing this legislation. In fact, the hon. member for Standerton used a very extraordinary phrase when he said that this legislation was in accordance with the &#x201C;historical pattern&#x201D; of our country. Moreover, we have listened to the most strenuous efforts by members from the other side to convince us that everything which was now being done was part and parcel of the traditional policy of South Africa. Is the genuine tradition now going to be scorned whenever it is convenient to do so? Government members have repeatedly told us&#x2014;as a matter of fact they have done so too often&#x2014;that we should be consistent. &#x201C;Wees konsekwent&#x201D; are the words they have repeatedly used in their references to this side of the House. They have alleged that we are not consistent or logical, but that we change our policy and our attitudes. But is it not perfectly true to say the same thing in regard to members on the other side, especially in the light of what was said in 1939? And I could have quoted much more from Hansard than I did in fact quote. As a matter of fact, <span class="col_6533-6534" refersTo="page_0513"/>I have been studying Hansard for the past ten days. I could go back further in the history of South Africa and quote examples to show that whenever there was legislation of this nature, i.e. legislation which sought to restrict the liberties of the individual and to undermine the very democracy which those who advocated the legislation pretended to protect, there was in fact a consistent and reasonable and reasoned opposition to it. If that was traditional, how dare hon. members come now and accuse us, when we say that we oppose this legislation because we have carefully considered it and come to the conclusion that it will cause trouble, and accuse us of being communists? How does Communism come into the matter, except in the form of a red rag to the bull? Because the Western world is against Communism, it seems to me that hon. members have come to the conclusion that to shout &#x201C;Communism&#x201D; is sufficient to cause everybody to start rushing to their side. Well, I should like to tell the hon. the Minister, as well as other members on the Government side, that the United Party is not going to be scared by them merely because they try to allege that our opposition to this Bill makes us fellow-travellers or communists. We are better democrats than any member who sat on that side during this debate. This is also borne out by Hansard, which contains a record of all that has been said in Parliament, and the entire tradition of this country proves that this is true; that no matter how much you may scorn it, the rule of law will prevail one day, and in the very near future, simply because the people have throughout the history of democracy preferred the rule of law to the rule of hyprocisy.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot do much more than to refer to the remarks made by the previous speaker at the commencement of his speech, namely that he had not made a single note of what the speaker before him had said, and to say that, unlike him, I in fact did make a few notes of what he had to say. One of the first conclusions he arrived at was that we on this side had acused the United Party of being a communistic party. I want to tell the hon. member that no such accusation was ever made by any speaker on this side of the House. The accusation which was made, in fact, is that the United Party acts as the protectors of the communists and that in consequence they associate with subversive organizations. That proposition was also proved time after time by speakers on this side of the House. In fact, I do not think there are any hon. members opposite who will deny that that is so.</p>

<p>The rest of Africa, and in fact the whole world, is to-day involved in a struggle, and we here are involved in a struggle with the continued existence of our White civilization. In certain parts of Africa, White civilization has already been destroyed, with deleterious results, to a certain extent, to the non-Whites themselves, but particularly to the Whites because they had to leave their homes and in many cases lost their lives. In other areas in Africa this struggle is still continuing. In this regard I think particularly of Algeria and Kenya, and that position is fast developing in Northern Rhodesia. Without wishing to be pessimistic, I want to say that I think the chances that White civilization will be preserved in those areas are very slender indeed. On the other hand, however, our position here in the southern point of Africa is quite different. For example, we have no other place to which we can flee. Therefore we shall have to fight to the last. The question I want to pose is: Who incites those nationalistic uprisings in the other African countries? My reply to that is that it is mainly the communists; and they do so with a very selfish object and with motives which are hidden behind fine-sounding words and slogans such as, for example, human rights, one man, one vote, etc. The communist-orientated, self-appointed leaders in these Black states have launched a deliberate campaign to eliminate the Whites from Africa. The object of the communists is not only to destroy our statutory laws, but also our culture and our religion. And who are the bearers of culture and the spreaders of the gospel in Africa? The Whites. That is why the whole campaign is aimed at the Whites in Africa, and therefore they must be swept away in order to enable the communists to attain their objects.</p>

<p>The clear object of the Bill now under discussion is to make it possible for the Government to take action against Communism. We must remember that the communists cast covetous eyes at South Africa as being a desirable Naboth&#x2019;s vineyard because of its riches and its strategic situation. Consequently it is necessary to pass this Bill in order to enable us to act against communists and saboteurs. During the past 12 years various measures have been placed on the Statute Book by this Government. The United Party now says that the powers contained in those measures are sufficient to enable the Government to take effective steps against sabotage. They forget, however, that when those measures were put on the Statute Book the United Party bitterly opposed them. The same language we have heard in this debate we also heard then. Nevertheless the United Party contends that the existing measures are sufficient to combat Communism and sabotage. In fact, that is one of their main arguments for saying that this Bill is unnecessary. In spite of the fact that when the other measures were passed, they made the same wild predictions in regard to a police state, the curtailment of the freedoms of the individual, etc. They <span class="col_6535-6536" refersTo="page_0514"/>admit to-day that those measures were in fact necessary and in the interest of the country. The United Party is always at least ten years behind the times. At this stage they therefore still do not realize that it is necessary to close the loopholes in the existing legislation in order to enable the Government to take effective action. I also have some objection to this Bill, and that is that it does not go far enough. I feel that if somebody is a communist, we should not wait until he has already committed sabotage before taking action against him, but that action should be taken immediately. I personally would like to see every person in this country who is a communist eradicated completely.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall do my best, but it will be difficult because I have already had to throw away half my notes because the points I noted down have already been mentioned here. But I shall do my best to use new arguments in regard to the necessity for combating this unholy and diabolic propaganda of the communists. One point which I feel has not been emphasized here is that an ex-communist can continue making his propaganda by means of the Press, and that this Bill gives us the power to stop it. The people of South Africa are sick and tired of the way our country is vilified abroad by the communists and their agents, who are depicted as heroes by the Press. The Government has the necessary powers to deal with known communists, and they need powers also to deal with the other communists, and with the agents who use others to try to upset the Government, and who commit arson and murder. I want to say clearly that this Bill will safeguard us in this life-and-death struggle for the preservation of White civilization. This Bill aims at rendering Communism harmless, and to deprive it of its mediums of propaganda, and to deal with saboteurs. That is its object. But what I find shocking is the speeches and the standpoint of certain hon. members opposite who are acting here as the protectors of the communists.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to continue to say why I think that the United Party in the past gave their approval, to some extent, to those deeds. I want to remind hon. members of the time when a certain member sat in this House, and that the United Party pleaded that he should remain here. I am referring to Sam Kahn. And now I just want to tell you who this Sam Kahn is. I quote from Hansard of 15 June 1950, where Mr. Kahn said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The other criticism of the Communist Party voiced by the hon. the Minister is the invalid criticism that he does not like our (the communists) programme. We stand for absolute racial equality and peace in South Africa. We stand for a system of socialism.</block>

<p>This Mr. Kahn frankly admitted that he was a communist and the hon. members opposite opposed us when we wanted to eject him from this House. Mr. Kahn went further, and in col. 9106 he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am told by the hon. member there that this is my last speech. This is not my last speech. My words will be imperishable. They will be remembered in South Africa. Millions of communists have been suppressed, have been tortured and killed through the long march of history. But remember that to-day Communism is the social doctrine and political philosopy under which 850,000,000 are living, covering one-third of the earth&#x2019;s surface.</block>

<p>Then an hon. member asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What are you hoping for?</block>

<p>And Mr. Kahn replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am hoping for nothing except the end of this Government, and that will be the combined task of the South African people, composed as it is of White, Black, English, Afrikaner, Indian, Malay, Coloured, African, Christian and non-believer&#x2014;all these will be forced together into indissoluble unity by this Government.</block>

<p><span class="col_6537-6538" refersTo="page_0515"/>Mr. Speaker, I said that the United Party were the protectors of the communists.

<p>I can give a clear reply to that question, because in the words I am now going to quote Sam Kahn himself admitted in this House that he was a communist. I quote from Hansard of 15 June 1950&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The other criticism voiced by the Minister of the Communist Party is invalid because it does not like our programme. We stand for absolute racial equality and for peace in South Africa. We stand for a system of socialism.</block>

<p>I think that is sufficient reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question. But I want to continue. When Mr. Sam Kahn appeared before the Select Committee in 1952 he frankly admitted that he was a communist, and after that report was submitted to this House and they had pleaded for him, he went still further and said that he was a Russian communist. I really think it is a shame that the United Party with that black record it has should come here today and adopt the same course they adopted in those years. I had hoped that in the meantime they had improved. The matter was put unequivocally by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins), and no one can deny it, as to what their associations are with these subversive activities and what this connecting link is. There is an unbroken chain of similar propaganda from the communists right through the liberalistic splinter groups to the United Party. I find that shocking, and therefore I say it is no use coming to this House and piously making long speeches. That will not count. Deeds count. We have to look at the deeds of that party, and to-day the United Party is bidding against the Progressive Party in opposing this Bill. I even believe that they know that this legislation is essential for the preservation of our White civilization in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by expressing a final thought, namely that the people of South Africa expect us to ensure that there will be peace, quiet and harmony in South Africa, harmony between the Whites and the non-Whites. We have already made much progress in this respect. I am not going to repeat what was said by former speakers on this side, who clearly indicated what has already been done for the non-Whites in South Africa. That is why there is peace and quiet here. That is why we have no demonstrations, riots or strikes, because these people now realize for the first time that there is a Government which does something for them also. For the first time they now have the opportunity to develop. It is quite clear to me that these people realize who their friends are. Now I say that it is our duty, and the public expects it of us, and this Government, during the past 14 years, has set up a record which is sufficient guarantee that they will do these things. For that reason the public outside also expressed its confidence in the Government and its satisfaction with the record of this Government. The public has confidence in this Government. And now I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to take action against these wrongdoers, against these saboteurs, and against the communist newspapers which besmirch the good name of South Africa in the outside world. I ask that they should be completely eradicated. The people of South Africa are grateful to the Minister.</p>

<p>That hon. member knows very well what his history is in regard to agitation. It is quite obvious that the tactics will be the same as they were when they used the &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; in the past to win elections. We must agree that those tactics were effective, but now they want to add fuel to the flames of racialism, and they will bring about so-called &#x201C;kommunistiese gevaar&#x201D; in order to rally votes behind them by pointing to the great danger which lies ahead in regard to Communism. But let me remind this hon. House that it was in 1950 that the Suppression of Communism Act was passed, and yet we hear in the introduction of a Bill of this nature the hon. Minister saying that the activities of Communism are continuing and that is why drastic action must be taken, and why these wide and severe provision must be passed by this House. For a period of 12 years with that Act on the Statute Book they still admit that Communism is active in South Africa; in other words, they admit that the Act has been a failure, as was predicted by this side of the House when we discussed that Act in 1950.</p>

<p>So I think, Mr. Speaker, it must be clearly understood, and indeed many members on this side of the House have rebutted that accusation made against us that we are the friends and protectors of communistically inclined persons.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, there are certain other matters I would like to deal with. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) (Mr. Sclhebosch), who has just resumed his seat, said that deeds count. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, as a young member listening to the debate in this House and the speeches which have fallen from the lips of hon. members opposite, I feel their pleas for national unity are purely lip service. Take the speech of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) which was completely devoid of tolerance. I believe that in the interests of the future of South Africa it is the Government party which should show tolerance, because without that tolerance we shall never achieve national unity. I submit that part of that tolerance is to be able to allow people to put forward their points of view which they believe to be in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Chief Whip. The Chief Whip has referred to Communism, but with the wide field this Bill covers and from the speeches we have heard from them, it would seem that they intend going further than that, because when they find people who are opposed to the doctrines of the Nationalist Party and the Government, they label them as communists. Therefore one can only assume that it is a step in the direction of silencing voices opposed to the Government. We have often heard attacks made in this House that members on this side are un-South African. I submit that we on this side have the interests and future of South Africa at heart, and we would like to see South Africa develop as a peaceful country on democratic lines. And when we see the introduction of a Bill of this nature, it is our duty to voice our protest and to vote against it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the whole pattern of this Bill, and in particular one aspect which I want to discuss, the principle of treating juveniles as adults, is one of the most repugnant principles involved in the Bill. I wish to indicate that during the course of this debate, as far as we are concerned, and I am sure a vast number of people outside, no case has been made out for the introduction of this Bill in regard to adults, let alone in regard to juveniles. We have that principle in the Bill, which the Minister incidentally failed to mention when introducing the second reading. He failed to give any justification for making provision in the Bill to treat juveniles as adults for the purposes of the Bill. Why did the hon. the Minister not put forward any arguments in favour of that important principle contained in the Bill? I listened carefully to the introductory speech of the Minister, hoping to hear some justification. But, Mr. Speaker, nothing was forthcoming. Members opposite have been strikingly quiet on this particular aspect of the Bill. I have yet to hear any member opposite trying to justify the provisions contained in paragraph (f) of Clause 21, whereby the omission of three important sections of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1951 has been provided. Clause 21 (4) (f) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6541-6542" refersTo="page_0517"/>No person shall on conviction of the offence of sabotage be dealt with under Section 342, 345 or 352 of the said Act.</block>

<p>And in this Act there is reference to the Criminal Procedure Act of 1955 which is to be amended. Now, Sir, it has been enshrined throughout our legislation that juveniles are dealt with on a different basis. The hon. the Minister of Justice in 1960, when he was Deputy Minister of Social Welfare, piloted the most important Act through this House, namely the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1960 whereby special provision was made for all children under 18 years of age, how they should be dealt with&#x2014;children in need of care, children who had to attend attendance centres, places of observation&#x2014;all these very important provisions were made in the case of children under 18 years of age. Similarly, in the Criminal Procedure Act, in the three sections I have just mentioned, special provision is made for the treatment of juveniles. It is generally accepted that a person under the age of 21 has not yet reached the age of discretion in certain respects. Starting right at the bottom of the scale, I wish to refer to &#x201C;South African Criminal Law and Procedure&#x201D; by Lansdown. It deals with the question of children between the ages of seven and 14, where it states that presumptive non-responsibility of children of that age does exist. It quotes two important cases of which both are applicable in terms of sabotage as defined in this Bill. One case was where two Native boys aged eight and nine, respectively, had in their own words built a kraal across a road. They were convicted of putting stones in the road and of obstructing traffic. The case was quashed on the grounds that they did not know they were doing wrong. Then there is another case which is quoted of a Native child aged 13 who put a 14 lb. fishplate across a railway line and packed it with stones, and was rightly convicted of a contravention under Act 37 of 1922. Then it goes on to state that since the court felt that the child could not fully have appreciated the enormity of the offence, the sentence was, on appeal, commuted from reformatory detention to a fine. This special provision provided for, shows that the presumptive non-responsibility of a child is recognized by the law. Then it goes further to deal with the question of these young persons falling under the influence of older persons, and what steps are taken in regard to coercion. It says that if a young person is in the custody of an older person, and if the older person could in any way influence and coerce the child to commit an act, he cannot be held responsible.</p>

<p>When we move to the older age groups, to persons of 18 years of age, then we have special provisions under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which was substituted by a new section in the Children&#x2019;s Act. Details are given there of how such a child should be dealt with. In this particular section it is shown that a person under the age of 18, if convicted of any offence, may in lieu of imprisonment be placed under the supervision of a probation officer or in the custody of certain persons designated in a court order, dealt with in terms of both these sections, or sent to a reform school. Then there is a further provision in Section 345 where a whipping may be imposed, apart from any other sentence. For the person between 18 and 21 years of age special provision is also enshrined in legislation. For instance, a person aged over 18 but under 21 years of age convicted of any offence other than treason, murder or rape&#x2014;instead of imposing any punishment on him the court can order that he be placed under the supervision of a probation officer or be sent to a reform school, and that any person who is sent to a reform school may be placed in a place of safety and detention. The other section of the Criminal Procedure Act which is to be limited in terms of this Bill is Section 345, and that section deals with a male person not over 21 years of age convicted of any offence, who may in lieu of punishment be sentenced to corrective whipping not exceeding ten cuts. I have read the debates which took place when that Act was passed, and it was specifically stated that the object of this was to save him from the undesirable influences of being held in imprisonment. Now, Sir, in terms of the Bill before us, there is a minimum imprisonment sentence of five years, and these sections which specifically apply to youths are now to be deleted and taken away entirely. The other section which is also to be abolished in terms of this Bill, deals with the postponement of sentence for a period of two years which may be ordered by the court. In terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1960 this section of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1955 was also amended to make special provision whereby a person under 21 years could be dealt with in terms of the previous provision; in other words, placed under a probation officer or sent to a reform school. These provisions already are on our Statute Book and they show that young persons who could easily come under the influence of other people, are protected by law. Therefore Sir, I fail to see why the Minister should take such a drastic step as to propose in this Bill to abolish these very important safeguards as far as the young people are concerned. Because, Sir, it could quite easily occur that a young person influenced by others could be guilty of committing an offence, which would amount to sabotage, and in terms of this new crime for which provision is made in the Bill, this young person then runs the risk that the death penalty may be imposed upon him, or a minimum term of imprisonment of five years. In the case of the other offences he is protected by law, and even in regard to the death penalty we find it is left in the discretion of the courts, but in regard to persons under 18 years the court even has a discretion in the case of murder. So we see that in our statutes very careful provision has been made to try to reclaim a young person who might have <span class="col_6543-6544" refersTo="page_0518"/>developed behaviour difficulties and problems, and if a young person has become associated with communists, or he himself becomes a named communist due to such association, he is put in a very difficult position where he will be very severely dealt with, more severely than in regard to any other offence in the Statute Book for a person of his age. Surely it is not impossible to allow these provisions we had in the past to remain even if the Sabotage Bill is passed. I hope the Minister will realize the enormity of the penalty he is imposing upon these juveniles. There are other aspects in regard to the offence of sabotage whereby a young person could find himself innocently facing a charge of sabotage. For instance, round about 5 November many teen-agers make their own fireworks, although I admit that that is a dangerous practice, and if they are found on Government premises in possession of these fireworks, which are really explosives, they might be charged with sabotage. I believe that the provisions of this Bill are much too severe. I believe that the Minister should give most serious reconsideration to incorporating juveniles and treating them as adults in regard to the very grave offence of sabotage.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) only raised one particular point and that was in connection with the application of this legislation on persons under the age of 21 years. I will deal with that point later on. Mr. Speaker, we have been listening for hours to the United Party setting out their approach to this Bill and that was to indicate how wide the powers were which the Government was taking under this legislation; and the way they did it indicated that they thought that they had a special lease of wisdom and that this side of the House was not capable of knowing what was in the Bill. I can assure them that this side realizes what all the implications of this Bill are and yet this side of the House has decided unanimously to support this Bill wholeheartedly. We accept the fact that the freedom of the individual should only be curtailed in order to safeguard the basic rights of the community as a whole, and that is the right to live in peace in an orderly and civilized community. The first question which arises is whether this basic right of the community is being threatened. I will be brief. The fact that this right was threatened was already acknowledged by the United Party in 1950 when they also admitted that they were against the threat of Communism, and since then, during the past 12 years, unless they are completely ignorant as to what is happening in the world, they must admit that the threat has become more serious. They need only look at what has been happening in Africa over the past five years and it is not necessary for me to enlarge upon that.</p>

<p>The Government has been asked why it has not exterminated Communism during the past 12 years. They might just as well ask why America has not done so. That brings me to the next question. In view of the fact that Communism has become a more dangerous threat, what is the object of this Bill? In this respect the Opposition has failed hopelessly in getting the public to panic, because the whole object of this Bill is to safeguard the safety of the State, of our industries and mines and the safety of our women and children. We wish to prevent the civilized non-Whites from being incited against the existing order. We are taking measures to prevent a second Algeria from developing in South Africa. But we particularly want to get at those White agitators, those enemies of their own race. I want to ask those people who organize those demonstrations outside whether they approve of those reckless misdeeds which are mentioned in Clause 21. It will only be the person who deliberately and unlawfully commits a deed who will be guilty of sabotage. We are dealing with the criminal, and no law-abiding person will be affected by this clause. The State must first prove that an offence has been committed and the accused then has the opportunity of pleading any of the defences listed in Clause 21 (2). He can plead in defence that he had not committed sabotage and those are facts which are only within his own peculiar knowledge. I wish to emphasize that this clause deals with a criminal, and it is not necessary for the Opposition to be so exceedingly merciful towards such a person. It is indeed true that in theory it may happen that somebody may be charged and found guilty of having committed sabotage whereas he has only committed a minor offence but that is precisely the reason why the Bill provides that the Attorney-General personally should decide whether there should be a prosecution. I just want to clarify something. It has been said that in terms of our laws the Minister can overrule the Attorney-General. It is stated differently in this case from the way it is stated in other laws. The word &#x201C;personally&#x201D; has been inserted specially; you do not find that in the other laws. The Minister himself has explained why the word &#x201C;personally&#x201D; has been inserted, the reason being that there cannot be the slightest suspicion that any political influence will be exercised. Consequently we will have an impartial Attorney-General who has nothing to do with politics, a person trained in law with a full sense of responsibility. Our Attorneys-General are known for their impartiality and fairness, so that there can be no objection to their taking action if they think that sabotage has been committed. Once the Attorney-General has decided to prosecute you still have the impartial Judges who have to decide on the case and I do not think there is anybody who doubts their fairness. You can imagine, Sir, what will happen and what remarks our Judges will make in public about such an inhuman Attorney-General who sends an insignificant case to court. It must also be realized that the proceedings are conducted in public and not <i>in camera</i> The case is heard in public, in the Supreme <span class="col_6545-6546" refersTo="page_0519"/>Court, and not in a special court. Furthermore, it is possible to petition the Minister against the Judge&#x2019;s decision. Furthermore, if there is the slightest suspicion of injustice this Opposition will be failing in their duty if they did not raise such a case in this House. Consequently all the steps which can be taken to protect any innocent person have been taken. Since 1950 the Minister and the Cabinet have had far-reaching powers under the original Act and in spite of the fact that the Opposition have been challenged they could not mention one case where any injustice has been committed. I have full confidence firstly in our Attorney-General, then in the Minister of Justice and after him in the Cabinet and the Judges. Each one separately enjoys the full confidence of this side of the House. No confidence should be placed in anybody, not even in Parliament, and then there is still public opinion in the face of which the Government will never dare to place an innocent person in gaol.</p>

Mitchell) has made the point that the Attorney-General has insight into all the documents, that he lays a charge of sabotage and that the Judge will be influenced because he knows that the Attorney-General has had insight into all the documents, and that the Attorney-General knows that the man is guilty of sabotage. But that argument applies in the case of all crimes which are referred to the court by the Attorney-General. Even in the case of murder he has insight into all the documents and according to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument the Judge must be influenced and think that the person is guilty.</p>

<p>It has also been argued that this Bill may have serious repercussions. I refer to the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 22 May&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The <i>Guardian Financial</i> Editor said roundly that the chances of an early change in the gold price are nil. He remarked that the apprehension in America about the future of the dollar had coincided with an advance in South Africa&#x2019;s economy and a returning confidence in the South African Government&#x2019;s capacity of keeping the lid on the racial pot &#x2026;</block>

<p>This was written after this Bill had been introduced.</p>

<p>The Opposition also maintains that the Bill which has been introduced will promote Communism. It does not appear as though the communists outside this House think that. It does not appear as though they welcome this Act. They also referred to the serious repercussions of this Act, but they conveniently forgot about the serious repercussions which would arise if we did not place Acts of this nature on the Statute Book. They forget what the serious repercussions will be if a single mine is blown up on the Rand. What will happen to the stock exchange in such a case?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) asked why the United Party should be against Communism because it would affect them as much as it would affect us? Mr. Speaker, he is very young in politics but if he is honest with himself he will admit that during this Session that party has often voted against a Bill in this House merely to see what political benefit they could derive from it and in this case they have been encouraged by the Progressives and the Liberal Party, because they have to bid for the votes. That is the sole reason why they are opposing it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) said that by prohibiting meetings we would be creating dangers. He said that was a well-known principle. I should be pleased if the hon. member would explain to us why they prohibited all public meetings in Rhodesia for two months. The hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) said he approved of it that the newspapers would have to deposit up to R20,000 but that he thought it was scandalous that the Minister, only a single person, should have the right to ban a newspaper in which case it would forfeit its R20,000 deposit. I want to tell the hon. member that that right does not vest in one person. If he looks at the Bill he will see that in terms of Clause 6 the President has to ban the newspaper; in other words the entire Cabinet has to decide and the hon. member is making a false accusation when he says that only one person decides on it.</p>

<p>I now come to the point made by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) in regard to children. It has been scandalously alleged that this was the Children&#x2019;s Hanging Act. The hon. member for South Coast was completely off the rails when he said that the age of the person would not be considered when imposing the sentence. Of course the Judge takes that into account. The Judge takes all the factors into account when he imposes the sentence. It is true that the minimum sentence is five years&#x2019; imprisonment but that is far from saying that children will be hanged. Not once in the history of South Africa has anybody of 14 years of age been hanged, and why should that happen in future? And the Judge is not the only person who has a say. It is submitted to the Cabinet for approval. It is simply impossible for anything like that to happen in this country, but hon. members call this the Children&#x2019;s Hanging Act and that is the way in which our name is being besmirched overseas. The hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) dealt with the position which obtained during the last war. He said that the crime of sabotage was created at that time, that it had to be properly proved before the court and only then was the person sentenced. He also conveniently forgot to tell us that when a person was suspected during the last war of having committed sabotage, and it could not be proved, he was interned without trial for years.</p>

<p>It is even worse. I want to sum up by saying that this Bill has three aspects. Firstly, you have the banning of newspapers which must be approved by the whole Cabinet; secondly, you have the powers which vest in the Minister to place certain restrictions on a communist, something which he has been doing with justice for 14 years, and thirdly, you have the definition of the crime of sabotage in respect of which steps will only be taken against the criminal. A heavy duty rests on the Minister, on the Cabinet, on the whole Government to maintain peace and quiet. To attain that object the Government will not hesitate to pass the necessary legislation and to take the necessary steps. This legislation will also apply in South West Africa and I welcome it, therefore, because we do not tolerate communist agitators there. I go further and say that it is the duty of everyone who respects and accepts our way of life to support us and I know that all right-thinking people will reject the attitude adopted by the Opposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it can be stated that if one thing has been proved in the course of this debate it is that both the Government side and this side of the House are against Communism. I am surprised to see the hon. the Minister laugh. When we say we are against communist ideology, which this Bill seeks to combat, we must say on the other hand that we are in favour of maintaining democracy as represented by the social order which we have at present. It therefore surprises me that the Minister can laugh when I make that statement, because surely he does not believe that there are any hon. members on this side of the House who would like to see a communist form of government in this country. [Interjections.] I am very glad the Minister has said that, because that is the point I wish to make. I assume that the Minister will believe that we on this side of the House are against Communism as such, and that he will believe that we are against it because we believe in democracy and we want to see the social order which we call democracy prevail. It is on this argument that the Minister seeks to justify this Bill. The Minister&#x2019;s contention is that the provisions of this Bill will be a bulwark to the social order as we know it, and that it will be one of the further securities that we can offer for a democratic form of government in this country. But we on this side also stand for upholding the existing social order, so where is the difference between us? The difference is that we on this side do not believe that by prostituting the basic freedoms of democracy you can destroy Communism.</p>

<p>It has been our belief ever since the original measure was introduced in 1950, and surely the Minister knows that. I do not believe the Minister was here at that time, but surely he has read the Hansard, and surely every utterance made during the course of this debate shows up the difference between this side of the House and the Government in respect of this measure and preserving our democratic way of life. We do not believe that you can adequately preserve the basic freedoms of our democracy by prostituting the ideal of freedom which is the essence of democratic government. Sir, you do not preserve the democratic form of government by adopting the dictatorship cult of the communist. It has been proved throughout the Western world that Communism does not spread and cannot survive if it does not have those conditions of society in which it can breed. One of the hon. members opposite said there was something like 70 named communists in this country. If, for the sake of argument, they were left loose, and if the seed-bed upon which they have to work to propagate their ideology and their form of government is not right, if the conditions are not there, they can never hope to reap any harvest whatever. When you listen to the speech of the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) he does not see bad social conditions in South Africa.</p>

<p>I agree that that is the approach, and that a great deal has been done. But when the hon. member for Vereeniging spoke, he did not refer to this basic approach in combating the communist ideology which this Bill seeks to control. This Bill works on the assumption that the communist agitator in our country has something upon which he can work. If he is allowed loose to spread his doctrine he will try to make capital out of large masses of ignorant people. But if the conditions do not exist, the effect of what he propagates will be of no consequence whatever.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I think that is more of a statement than a question. What the hon. member for Vereeniging is really afraid of is political principles. He is afraid of the spread of political principles based on, let us say, the theory that Luthuli preaches, of one man, one vote. I think the hon. member for Brits will agree with me that the principle of one man, one vote is a democratic principle, as we know it. When you listen to the hon. member for Vereeniging, he does not approach the principle of one man, one vote <span class="col_6549-6550" refersTo="page_0521"/>from the democratic point of view, but from the communist point of view. He says that any man in this country who preaches the democratic principle of one man, one vote, makes himself guilty of treason. He said that the man who preaches one man, one vote, is guilty of treason, and therefore this Bill closes up all those loopholes. Let me quote his actual words on this thesis in justification of the provisions of this Bill. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Daarom moet hierdie skuiwergate toe gestop word. Daarom moet die deuge wat hierdie mense se nie gepubliseer word nie.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The things said by these people should not be published, and he supports the principle that the Minister should have control over what is published. So this dangerous doctrine of one man, one vote, cannot be published because according to the hon. member for Vereeniging it is not a democratic thought but a communist thought. I put it to the hon. member for Brits and the hon. member for Vereeniging and other members of the Government that this side of the House has a policy of race federation in which it offers representation in this House on the principle of group representation for the non-Whites. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that we advocated, on the principle of group representation, one man, one vote. We do not do that, but let us assume we do it. In other words, the separate race groups of our country, on the principle of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; under a system of group representation, would return their representatives to this House. Sir, on the basis of the argument of the hon. member for Vereeniging and that of the hon. member for Brits, we would be guilty of treason. I ask the Minister of Justice: Would we be guilty of advocating one of the principles of Communism?</p>

In other words, you can say that the principles of democratic government are of no consequence. That any Bill that this Government may care to introduce, which gives the necessary powers to control and to stop the development of such political thought, whether by an underground method or whether, as the hon. member for Brits says, in a constitutional way is justified.

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The support that hon. members opposite have offered for this Bill in all these discussions is that any measure is justified which can protect our conception of a democratic state. Anybody who has any other thoughts of what a democratic state may be like or how it may be governed or how the people may be represented, which clashes with their views of nationalism, of a Nationalist approach, that is unacceptable, that is communist, that is subversive. That has been the general theme of arguments opposite. When you face the hon. member for Brits with this fact, he finds himself in the difficulty in which he found himself just now. Mr. Speaker, members on the Government benches admit that the provisions of this Bill coupled with those of the original Act give the Minister tremendous powers. In some speeches it has been admitted by hon. members they are possibly powers which are not desirable to place in the hands of the Minister, but they have argued that the threat to our way of life is so great, that we must trust the Minister with these powers. You see, Sir, what the hon. member for Brits and other Nationalist Party members do not realize is that this approach of theirs is the very basis of an autocratic form of government in a communistic state. It is the very basis of the approach to government in a communistic state. It is the basis of autocracy in a communistic state, that it must protect what it has. It devises its forms of government and it makes the law placing all power in the hands of the executive. In the autocratic state the executive must have that power because without that power it will be threatened from within, it will be subverted. The remarkable thing about all this is that the hon. the Minister confesses this. The hon. the Minister admits openly that his approach in regard to this matter is the autocratic approach. He said it at his Press conference which he gave before the introduction of the Bill into this House. I do not want to be unfair to the Minister. I believe the Minister preceded his description of the Bill to the Press correspondents present by saying that he admitted that he did not consider the Bill essentially undemocratic. I hope I have that right; I do not want to base my argument on false premises. Can I take if from the Minister that that is right?</p>

<p>Yes, that will be Parliamentary. He offered the same justification for the autocratic approach when he introduced the measure. Sir, the Minister made it quite clear that this measure was not designed only to combat a criminal act but that it is designed to combat the spread of a political doctrine by the printed word, by mechanical means, by gatherings or meetings, even to the extent of being able to create the new crime of sabotage. Let me therefore show, as one not versed in law&#x2014;and I make an open admission that I have no experience of law&#x2014;but by a layman reading this Bill, just in one respect alone, the impression that has been left on the outside world and on the citizens of our country in respect to its provisions. I refer to Clause 21 of the Bill which seeks to create the new crime of sabotage. I refer to Clause 21 (1) (g) and(2) (h). What does Clause 21 (1) (g) say? It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of sub-section(2), any person who commits any wrongful and wilful act whereby he injures, damages, destroys, renders useless or unserviceable, puts out of action, obstructs, tampers with, pollutes, contaminates or endangers&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; (g) any property, whether movable or immovable, of any other person or of the State.</block>

<p>It is clear that if any person should damage any property he can be charged with sabotage, but in sub-section (2) it defines the manner, objectively regarded, in which the crime should have been committed. Clause 21 (2) (h) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To cause, encourage or further feelings of hostility between different sections of the population of the Republic.</block>

<p>Sir, I want to put it in a practical way. Assuming that in my constituency of Turffontein it is publicized that the hon. the Minister of Justice is going to hold a public meeting, and that the purpose of his public meeting is to state National Party policy, including this Bill. As the public representative of that area and that community, I consider that it is not in the interest of that community that they should listen to the Minister; and that they should mobilize themselves to show their opposition to the policies that the Minister represents, as a Minister of State. I consequently organize a tremendous hostile audience to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and let me assure him that it is very capable of being done in my constituency. The Minister arrives at this meeting of hundreds of people at the hall, hostile to the approach of the Minister. They do not want him there, they do not want to listen to him and they want to have nothing to do with him because their views are entirely different to those that the Minister represents. But the Minister persists; he is a powerful orator; he thinks he can sway those hundreds of people, so he gets to the hall and he leaves his motor-car outside. An enthusiastic youth member of the United Party who listens to the Minister says, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like his voice and I don&#x2019;t like his views&#x201D; he cuts the types of his motor-car and then he probably throws a brick through the windscreen and damages the front of the motor-car. In the first instance he is committing sabotage in terms of this definition. If the hon. the Minister likes to refer, I have been to the library on this subject and I looked up every possible interpretation of the word sabotage that I have been able to find. In no single instance is the word &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; defined as an act against a private person. It is described as being an act committed by a body of people against the established government, against the established form of law and order. But in this Bill you can commit an act of sabotage by an act against a private individual. And I ask the Minister pertinently here this morning: Have these words been included to protect the Ministers of this Government? Will it be an act of sabotage if any persons in their abhorrence of Nationalist Party policy in the strength of their feeling, should by an accident damage or visibly indicate their feelings by personally injuring the person or property of any one of these Ministers; is he then going to be charged with sabotage and be subject to a minimum penalty of five years or a maximum of a death sentence?</p>

Why &#x201C;any person&#x201D;? The Minister has not explained it at his Press conference; he never explained it when he introduced the measure before this House. An act of sabotage is against the State, against the Government. Why &#x201C;any person&#x201D;? Sir, the facts are clear that if we go as far as these lengths, and they may not be as absurd as I have made them appear to be&#x2014;when you examine what has happened with this type of legislation and this type of measure in other <span class="col_6555-6556" refersTo="page_0524"/>countries of the world, then we as democratic citizens, the representatives of the people in a democratic institution have a right to have a doubt about how these powers will be applied. What disturbs me more than anything else is that all this type of legislation that is being introduced by the Government is being introduced on the basis of personal assurances by Ministers. Where there are far-reaching powers taken, we always have personal assurances given that they will never be abused.

<p>What guarantee have we got as citizens that some other extreme power may not take over the reins of government and abuse these powers which stand on the Statute Book&#x2014;what guarantee other than the personal assurance, which I accept from this hon. Minister? From this Government there is no guarantee of the free democratic rights of the people of our country once this stands on the Statute Book of our country.</p>

<p>Now I want to take the hon. the Minister one step further. When this legislation was hinted at by the hon. the Minister during the election campaign and immediately after the election campaign, and he made certain speeches which were reported in the Press&#x2014;I do not want to quote them now&#x2014;something rang a bell. I have listened at length to these debates, and I realized when I listened to the Minister introducing the Bill that I had heard what he had said before; that I was familiar with his speech, and I want to quote to the Minister his speech to-day, a very effective speech, one exactly like the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s and completely as his speech. The same pattern, the introduction, the citing of the cases, of the leaflets, of alleged communist activity, offering the proof and the substantiation of the subversive leaflets&#x2014;all of it in the same order and the same pattern. Let me quote it to the House, because I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question after I have quoted it. It starts off just as the Minister started, and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is therefore of value. I consider, that I should state quite clearly what are the reasons which impel the Government to introduce this Bill.</block>

<block name="quote">Permit me, Mr. Speaker, to give an example of the sort of security problems with which my Government have had to contend.</block>

<p>And the Minister gave us that&#x2014;the sort of security problem with which they had to contend. In this case it is slightly different but it was the same thing with subversive leaflets circulated by subversive organizations. And then the Minister went on and said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have to accept the fact that at present there are in this country a number of people who, if they cannot succeed by lawful democratic means, are perfectly prepared to resort to violence and terrorism. It is true that their efforts in this respect have been up till now ineffective.</block>

<p>Did the Minister say that in his speech? Let me quote another piece&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the kind of situation with which we could be faced if our Government did not take the proper steps to safeguard our security.</block>

<p>The situation outlined by the Minister in the leaflets he quoted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is impossible to ignore the possibilities of such things being attempted in our country, particularly when one bears in mind the present unsettled state of Africa.</block>

<p>Did the Minister not use that as his argument?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">First, the only persons who need be alarmed about it (the Bill) are those who are either attempting to organize violence, terrorism or civil war or who are acting as Fifth Columnists for some foreign power.</block>

<block name="quote">The Bill has been deliberately drafted so that the Government can deal resolutely and without delay with any attempt to subvert the State by force. The Government are determined not to be caught unprepared, as a number of other States have been, by subversion either from within or without. In order to preserve the due process of law, &#x2026;</block>

<p>Listen to this one, Mr. Speaker; this is the Minister&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to preserve the due process of law, it may on occasion be unfortunately necessary to take special powers. In the present condition of the world we cannot ignore the dangers which threaten; and after lots of discussions, the Government have finally come to the conclusion that such a measure as this is absolutely essential in the national interest.</block>

<from><span class="col_6557-6558" refersTo="page_0525"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am most grateful to have support from the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet). This Minister went on; he had a great deal more to say; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to add one final word. I expect the members of the Opposition to support the Government in taking all the necessary steps to protect the State. There is nothing in this Bill which proves that the Government are setting up a dictatorship. I appeal to the good sense of hon. members to remember that if the people of this country in any way think that the Government at any moment are becoming dictatorial, the people in their good sense will not let the Government last one day longer. People support this Bill because they are suspicious of the activities of certain people in this country. They support the Bill because they have been told too many lies.</block>

<p>I seem to have heard that expression in the course of this debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the duty of members of the Opposition to help the Government to protect the State. They themselves have an opportunity to talk freely in the House; they have the opportunity to address their rallies.</block>

<p>Then, Sir, several Ministers took part in the debate, including the Minister of Information. He had this to say about the foreign Press&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We all know what sort of newspaper the <i>Daily Express</i> is.</block>

<p>That is the <i>Daily Express</i> published in London&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The <i>Daily Express</i> and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> are known to be anti-our country and anti-Africa. We know that, and since the Editors of these papers believe that our country has a vision for the redemption of the whole of Africa, they will do everything to paint our country black with the support of the members of the Opposition.</block>

<p>Very familiar, Mr. Speaker. I have only quoted a few extracts from his speech, but any member of the House can take this Hansard and can read the introductory speech and can read the closing speech and can read the speeches of Ministers of the Crown, reported in this Hansard. Mr. Speaker, you will be astonished to find that the introductory speech for this Bill followed completely and absolutely and utterly the pattern of the speech introduced by this Minister when he introduced this Bill before this House. Sir, what was the Bill that was introduced? It was a Bill containing provisions such as these: Provisions of detention in house-arrest, publication in the <i>Gazette</i> as counting as notification to a person that he has been named as a communist, and all the other provisions. And what country does it come from? When the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) was discussing in this debate the background of Communism and all the dangers of Communism that arise in Africa and the necessity therefore for this Bill to protect our country against these threats of Communism in Africa&#x2014;and I asked him across the floor, &#x201C;Where are the communistic states in Africa?&#x201D; he could not answer me. But you see, Sir, this does not come from a communistic state; it comes from the State of Ghana. This is the Ghana Hansard that I have been quoting here; the Ghana Hansard and the Emergency Act and the provisions of the Preventative Detention Act which were discussed in that Assembly. This was the speech of their Prime Minister, Dr. Nkrumah. And what I now want to read to you, Sir, is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in the debate, and I hope hon. members will find a bit of familiarity&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why do I object to the passing of this Bill? I object to the passing of this Bill, and I am inviting hon. members of this House to agree to the amendment, because I know that certain things are immoral and certain things are improper. I know that the end of statemanship should be that the individual in the State shall not become the appendage of the State, but that at all times the liberty of the subject shall stand far and above the State itself; that every man and woman in this country and in other countries shall learn that the State exists for the individual and not the individual for the State. There is none in this House who will dispute our patriotism and our love for this country of ours. We, like hon. members opposite, were born in this country, bred in it, and under God, we hope to die in it. We love our country because it is the country of our birth and whatever we do, privately or publicly, we bear that in mind.We will never, never, seek to destroy the country which has given us birth.</block>

<p>That was said by the Leader of the Opposition in Ghana. And where is he to-day? He has been exiled from his country. He had to flee his country, and the other members in their opposition who took part in this debate on the same theme are locked up in the gaols of Ghana. If hon. members want the details of how many, they can get it out of the library. There were something like 206 who were house-arrested and detained under this same Preventative Detention Act and the same arguments of sabotage and preserving their country from subversive elements were used. Arguments that we have had of a similar nature <span class="col_6559-6560" refersTo="page_0526"/>in the course of this debate. No less than 206 have been detained as political prisoners. Sir, the words that I quoted of the Leader of the Opposition were those of a Black African. He had precisely the feelings that we on these benches have had in regard to this Bill now before us. There are also many nationalists who have had similar feelings and expressed strong views about autocratic measures of this kind. By fighting for democratic rights to preserve democratic government they paid the penalty of opposing autocratic powers by being gaoled or fleeing their country. The tragedy for South Africa is that we have to have this Bill presented to us by the Minister which is the very anathema of democratic practice in our country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>Thus far we have heard nothing but admiration from the Opposition in regard to Ghana. It is one of the African states in regard to which they have always expressed the greatest esteem. I am pleased to hear from a member of the Opposition this morning for the first time, that they condemn Ghana. Now I do not wish to argue with the hon. member about that, but I think he ought to be ashamed of himself for comparing the Republic of South Africa with the dictatorship of Ghana. I do not think that is good enough. All this time members of the Opposition have been saying things that are much worse than what has been said by the Opposition in Ghana, but all the members of the United Party are still sitting here safely. And if the hon. member then comes along and compares us and our government with that of Ghana, then I think it is such an insult to the country and the people, that I shall leave it to the people to call him to account for that. Nor is it necessary for me to refute the terrible picture he has painted here of the poor lad with more enthusiasm than brains, and who cuts the motor types of the Minister and throws tomatoes through a window, and that the lad will now necessarily be guilty of sabotage. The hon. member knows well enough, or he ought to know, that it will be the duty of the Attorney-General to decide in the light of the circumstances, whether it is the stupid ignorance of the lad or whether he should be charged and have his bottom warmed, or whether he is a member or tool of a gang of saboteurs who have systematically planned those acts. It will be the Attorney-General&#x2019;s task to decide about that, and that of the courts but not that of the Minister. The hon. member further is burdened down by confusion of thoughts. He attacks the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) because the hon. member for Vereeniging has said that we shall fight if people come along to foist upon us the policy of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. Now he says they have their race federation scheme and they now propose to give the various colour groups a certain number of representatives each, each in its own way. If for instance there is the Coloured Community, they will get say four representatives, and every Coloured person may vote for the four representatives. The hon. member knows well enough, or he ought to know well enough, if only he had thought for a while to-night instead of trying to make trouble, that when we speak against the idea of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, we do so in the sense in which the communists and the liberals intend it, namely, that in the same community the vote should be given to all colours and to all races, and to every individual in the same political community. When it is done in respect of separate political communities, it is something quite different. For instance we could go along to the Coloureds to-day and say to them: Here you have four representatives; you can all come onto the separate list and vote for the four representatives. We have nothing to do with that. Then in their community it is &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; but that is not the meaning the world attaches to it to-day when they say &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, for then they mean that all should have it in the same community.</p>

<p>I really rose to deal with a few points raised here by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) and the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), who is not here. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth quoted from an English speech. I do not know where it appeared, and who did the translation. I have never made an English speech in this House, and I do not know whether it has been translated well or badly. As regards the hon. member for Durban (Point), I do not even know what he quoted. But his technique when quoting from a person&#x2019;s speech is well known. In that regard he always reminds me of what my old professor in Theology, Prof. Moorees, taught me when he analysed the teachings of a certain sect, and said: Look, you must remember, all the sects base their so-called doctrines on the Bible always, but they read the Bible thus: They will say for instance: Look, it says in the Bible that Juda took his 30 pieces of silver and he went forth and he hanged himself, but it also says in the Bible: &#x201C;Go ye forth and do the same&#x201D;. That is what the hon. member does. He takes a piece here, he takes a piece there, and he adds them together, adding some of his own, and then he comes along and quotes them as the words of somebody.</p>

<p>Our attitude is very clear. My attitude has always been very clear. If the hon. member, who has acquired so much admiration for my speeches and writings of the past, now only discovers how much wisdom there is in them that he quotes them at length, has read everything he ought to know what my attitude has always been&#x2014;and I can bring scores of quotations to prove this from articles I wrote&#x2014;that Communism and Fascism are equally repugnant to the people of South Africa, that our national tradition condemns Fascism and Communism to an equal degree. That has always been my attitude and I have written that in numerous articles.</p>

<p>I still maintain the attitude that Fascism and Communism are objectionable to a democratic country such as South Africa. But I should nevertheless like to ask those hon. members, as they are so fond of reading what I said formerly, why don&#x2019;t they also read something else I said in regard to this Bill? I should like to quote from an article I wrote in the <i>Suiderstem</i> on 12 December 1941.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. member says that it is the truth. Now we shall test it a while. I wrote:</p>

<block name="quote">We advocate that at least in the cases where there is loss of life as a result of these onslaughts (i.e. throwing of bombs and arson) it shall be punishable without regard to mitigating circumstances, by death.</block>

<p>I wrote that not as Abraham Jonker, but as the Editor of the official paper of the United Party, and all hon. members of the United Party agreed with that. I wrote that these people should be sentenced to death regardless of mitigating circumstances. This Bill before us gives them plenty of scope to adduce extenuating circumstances, and to get off more easily. I wrote further, and hon. members agreed with me:</p>

<block name="quote">A villain who throws a bomb or tries to commit arson is the lowest form of antisocial being and has no right to live in an ordered society. For all other attempts to commit this crime there should be a minimum penalty of 10 to 15 years&#x2019; imprisonment.</block>

<p>All hon. members agreed with that. But when it is proposed now that a minimum penalty of five years be imposed for the worst degree, hon. members come along and make a great fuss. In those years hon. members agreed with me, and they said it was a good step then. Then they agreed with something much more drastic, but now they come along and make a tremendous fuss about what is in the Bill. I should like to mention only one more example. I wrote as follows in a leader on 13 November 1940:</p>

<block name="quote">The question now arises whether the time is not long overdue that the vast majority of the people of South Africa who love our democratic and constitutional liberties deeply, should now rise in arms to protect their rights and privileges.</block>

<p>Referring to people who commit acts of violence and threaten violence, I asked this:</p>

<block name="quote">Is it not time for our Government to say: &#x201C;You want to murder democracy and our state as it exists to-day in all its liberty, internally and externally, if you get the opportunity&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is precisely what the people who are opposed to the Bill are saying to-day. If they find an opportunity to do so, I said, they will destroy our democratic state with all its liberties. In 1940 I was pleading as official editor of the official organ of the United Party that the Government should consider whether the time had not arrived for democracy to rid itself of this great fault and weakness of the past, and to protect itself against those who openly declared that they would murder democracy and its supporters when they came into power. Those articles were written 21 years ago, and the whole United Party agreed with them. No English paper in South Africa ever uttered a word of protest against those proposals. All of them applauded them. I went further and I wrote a series of articles, I think there were four or five articles, in which I set forth precisely this kind of legislation we have before us now, and in which I said that that was the legislation with which we should restrict the abuse that was being made of liberties. Every man is free to go where he wishes, but he may not trespass on another man&#x2019;s property. Every person has the right to say what he likes, but he may not violate another&#x2019;s character. So there are limits to our liberties. That is why I say that the supreme right is not the right of the individual, the highest freedom is not the freedom of the individual, but the freedom of the community and the right of continued existence of the community. That is why democracy should take the field with measures to tackle those who wish to destroy that freedom of the entire community. That I wrote 21 years ago with the approval and the concurrence of all the members of the present Opposition. I went further: I sent those articles to the various Ministers of the United Party of that time, and all who replied expressed their agreement with what I wrote. There was one exception. One man was a little hesitant and he would not say unequivocally that he accepted them, and that was the well-known liberalistically disposed Jannie Hofmeyr. He moved a little in the direction of the pleas of hon. members. But you see now how much further the hon. members already are than he went. All other Ministers of the United Party expressed their agreement with those articles.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member: Will the hon. member deny that all <span class="col_6563-6564" refersTo="page_0528"/>the articles were written and were aimed at the supporters of the National Party?</p>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a very easy question to answer. All the articles were aimed at certain supporters of the hon. member for East London (City) (Mr. Moolman). It does not concern that question, it concerns the principle. I have always been in favour of all saboteurs, all throwers of bombs, all arsonists, being tackled in this manner, and dealt much more severely than our indulgent Minister of Justice is doing to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to refer to an incident during the debate when I interjected in reference to something which had been said by the hon. the Minister. It appeared to me that he, and I believe, you, Sir, understood that as being an allegation that the hon. the Minister had deliberately misled certain persons. I would like to say immediately that that was not my intention. I don&#x2019;t believe it is the proper construction of my words and although you, Sir, ruled that the remark referred to something which happened outside the House, I desire to withdraw the remark and to dispose of it in that way.</p>

<p>I would like to come for a moment to the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker). I was astonished that the hon. member should have said that it was disgraceful that the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) should have quoted from a debate in Another Chamber, namely the Chamber of Ghana.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course if the cap fits the hon. member he must wear it.</p>

<p>I would like to dispose of a couple of points which were raised during the debate on a few occasions. Let me say at once that I take the strongest exception to the publication in the <i>Burger</i> of completely unjustified news items in reference to this side of the House, and I would like to say that I was very proud to work with the team whom I had assisting me in regard to this Bill, that never have I had a happier relationship, and I hope that that relationship will continue. I believe that those who were helping me. a number of them, are persons who will play an important part in the future of this country, and it will be a very great privilege for me always to work with them.</p>

<p>I now to come to some items raised by the hon. Minister of Information. He referred to an interview, some remarks I had passed. The hon. member will realize that that was in the course of a discussion, but I am not querying the report. I referred to preparatory examinations and said &#x201C;It may be necessary to avoid situations as arose in the treason trial&#x201D;. I will deal with that to a slight extent later, but I want to say at once that I think all sides of the House ought to hope that never again shall we have something like that happening, where a preparatory examination and other proceedings last over a period of years (I will give the details just now) and in the end the persons are discharged. I want to make it quite clear that I said that this was one matter that should be considered. It is perfectly obvious to me that that is a very good example to show the necessity in cases of this sort for a preparatory examination, that it will be a mistake for Parliament not to remove from this Bill the power which allows the Attorney-General to decide that there shall be no preparatory examination. I would like the hon. the Minister in this regard and in respect of another matter, the matter of indictment, to give us some further clarification. In effect he said in his introductory speech &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t we trust the Attorney-General?&#x201D; Sir, I think we can be very proud of the Attorneys-General that we have had in this country. They have played a splendid part, they were men of great distinction, and I know of no case where I can suggest in any way that there was a prejudiced decision by an Attorney-General of any of the divisions of our Supreme Court. I know of no case. But I do want to say this, the hon. the Minister will agree with me, that there is ample evidence that the Attorneys-General have made mistakes. I want to refer to one. I want to refer in more detail to the treason trial. Here you have a case where persons were arrested in December, 1956. The arrests that night numbered 151 and the number was subsequently increased to 156. One year later, after the preparatory examination had proceeded, 61 were discharged; a month after that three more were discharged; seven months later the indictment was quashed and a number were re-indicted. Others were discharged or charges were withdrawn and a year later there were 30 remaining who had not been discharged, and finally, trial took place. If there is one thing we can be proud of in this country, it is our Judiciary. In that case the Judges after hearing the case for the Crown, when the defence was in the early stages of its case for the defence the Judges stopped the case and discharged the accused. I don&#x2019;t think anybody can suggest that there was not a number of very serious errors made in that particular case. I quote it as an example.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>It may have to go to a Judge, but I believe that when persons are on trial, particularly if it is a trial for their lives and particularly in times of peace, whatever advantage there is, and very often there is an advantage either to the Crown or to the accused in a preparatory examination, it is better that the fullest facts are before the court, so that the court can base its judgment on all the best available information. Sir, that is a matter which can be discussed further in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I referred to another matter, the death penalty for juveniles. I would like to point out that already under our Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act there is in respect of juveniles from the age of 18 to the age of 21 a death sentence for crimes such as treason and murder for example. It can be imposed in those cases. Let me make it perfectly clear, Sir, that I am utterly and totally opposed to a death sentence in respect of a youth under 18 years of age, and I believe that that clause in the Criminal Procedure Code should be left as it is. Obviously if there is sabotage in circumstances that justify conviction for treason or where there is murder, then the courts already have the power to impose a death sentence. That provision may be very well left alone, and I hope we will be able to persuade the hon. the Minister to go no further than that when we come to the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I propose to make my own speech and if the hon. the Minister wishes to put questions to me when I have put my points, then I will answer them, but I don&#x2019;t propose to answer questions which are irrelevant to the point I am discussing at a particular time.</p>

<p>I would like to refer to the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) (Mr. Schlebusch), who was one of the last speakers on that side. He said &#x201C;we are engaged in a struggle to save White civilization; we shall fight to the last man&#x201D;. He referred to what he said was a planned attempt to remove the White Governments from Africa, and we see what is happening in Africa. Now let me say this that we on this side of the House are as much convinced as members opposite that we are engaged in a struggle to save civilization in South Africa. In respect of the saving of civilization and in respect of the securing of a permanent and a safe future for the White man in South Africa, I don&#x2019;t believe that there is any difference between us in this House whatsoever. When I hear arguments of hon. members opposite, I think of my own case and the stake that I have. After all we are getting older, but think of the other generations coming along, and I do wish that hon. gentlemen opposite would realize that even if there may be differences between us as to what is the right method to deal with these matters, in respect of the matter of the maintenance of our civilization in this country, quite obviously all South Africans feel the same way. There may be a difference in the method proposed but it would be a good thing if we could only bring ourselves to accept that and believe it. It might form a very much better basis on which we can proceed to try and deal with these tremendously difficult problems which lie before us. I would like to say to that hon. member and other hon. members who have said that Communism is a godless creed and who have referred to the necessity of combating Communism, that for my part I am utterly convinced that Communism is a doctrine which is dangerous to the future of Africa and of the world. We know that there is a world struggle for the minds of men and we of course have a very particular responsibility cast upon us in this country. You see, Sir, we here in South Africa are in this position that if you take the Whites and the Coloureds as the Westernized group, we represent approximately one-third of the people of the Republic. And if we look at the facts of the world, and take the position we find that the proportion in South Africa in that regard is almost exactly the proportion which exists throughout the world. The Whites of the world are outnumbered by two to one. In other words, I believe that the part that South Africa can play in meeting these difficult problems is of the utmost importance for the world, the problems we are discussing, the methods of dealing with these problems, and the legislation before this House is of very great importance in respect of a correct solution of the problems which the hon. the Minister is seeking to deal with in this Bill. The question does arise as to the method, it is necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the Bill will take them <i>seriatim</i> because I think it will be convenient for the House if I do so.</p>

<p>The first one I would like to refer to is Clause 5 which deals with newspapers. I do most sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister is going to reconsider the provisions of this clause. I believe that it is utterly wrong that a Minister who has the power, for good reasons, to stop publication of a newspaper, should be in the position that in advance he can require a variable deposit which might range from nothing up to R20,000, and that that same Minister can decide in due course of time, if he stops publication for good reasons, that that amount be forfeited. The <span class="col_6567-6568" refersTo="page_0530"/>forfeiture is automatic. It means in effect that this Minister or any future Minister would be in a position then that two papers banned for exactly the same reasons will be treated quite differently. In one case there might be no penalty at all and in the other case there might be a very heavy penalty of R20,000. I don&#x2019;t think that that is right. I believe that the Minister might very well reconsider that provision. I don&#x2019;t believe that it is a sound thing to place a Minister in the position that a decision which really ought to be in the hands of a court of law, should be in the hands of the Minister.</p>

<p>I come to Clause 7 on page 7. It is a very important clause and I would like to say that I believe this House would be grateful to the hon. the Minister if he would be prepared to say quite frankly in his reply whether this clause as it stands is intended to be in these words or whether it requires amendment and what the real intention is. I refer to the addition of the proposed new sub-section (3), which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may in the manner provided in sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Riotous Assemblies Act, 1956, prohibit the assembly, except in such cases as he may specify when imposing the prohibition or as may thereafter be expressly authorized by him or a magistrate acting in pursuance of his general or special instructions&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a)Of any gathering; or</li>

<li>(b)of any particular gathering or any gathering of a particular nature, class or kind,</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">at any place or in any area during any period, if he is satisfied that any activities of any person or organization is furthering or may further the achieving of any of the objects of Communism in the Republic.</block>

<p>As far as I can see Sir, there is no difference between the meaning of the Afrikaans and the English text. As I read it, it means that if there is in South Africa any person or organization which is furthering or may further the achievement of any of the objects of Communism, then the Minister is given, in terms of the earlier part of the clause which I have read, the power to ban any gathering or a particular gathering or any gathering of a particular nature, class or kind.</p>

<p>Clause 8, which inserts a new Section 10, is one of very great importance. It is one which was referred to by one hon. member who is not in the House at the moment, as a real stroke of genius on the part of the Minister. I would like to say again that in this clause the Minister is taking unto himself very wide powers, powers which in my view should not be exercised by a Minister of the State, powers which might very well be exercised by some judicial body, if they are to be exercised at all. Because under this provision the so-called house arrest is unlimited in point of time. It is utterly objectionable for that reason. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister will be able to cast any different light on the clause, but certainly in its present form the clause is utterly objectionable. I do not think the Minister has given any reasons in respect of this clause in respect of the extreme powers which it vests in his hands.</p>

<p>Do you object to the clause in principle?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would not object if the decision was in the hands of the court. That would be a different matter. Any order of this sort should be limited in point of time. If in particular circumstances the Minister had power to do this for a day or two or for some very limited period, that may be a matter which can be discussed. Certainly in its present form it is utterly objectionable and I believe should not stand.</p>

<p>Then we come to the Public Safety Act which is amended in Clause 16 of the Bill. I do not think the Minister in introducing the Bill, gave adequate reasons. Perhaps he might deal with it further in his reply. The Section provides for regulations and it is the clause which allows for the declaration of an emergency in one area and the application of the provisions which apply to that emergency, to other parts of the country. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that in this form the clause could be the subject of very grave abuse. If the Minister asks: &#x201C;Do you expect the Minister to abuse it?&#x201D; I say that is not the point. The point is this that no powers should be granted, powers of an arbitrary nature, which can be abused by a Minister. It is absolutely essential, if we want to put on our Statute Book laws which are worthy of the civilized state which exists here, that provisions of this sort if they are included, should be circumscribed very, very clearly, or there should be some other check. The position at the present time is completely unchecked as I see it. The decision rests entirely with the Minister.</p>

<p>I now come to the extension of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. Sir, I would like to express the view that where there is provision in a parliamentary Statute for the extension of an Act by resolution of both Houses&#x2014;while I do not for a moment question the competence of Parliament so to extend by the substitution of 1963 for 1962&#x2014;that provision should be observed. It is my belief that that provision was put in because Parliament wished to have a specific opportunity of debating those matters. It may be a point <span class="col_6569-6570" refersTo="page_0531"/>about which others may have their own views, but it seems to me that where there is a specific provision of that sort, specially designed for a particular purpose, that provision should be acted upon.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 19 of the Bill. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that very careful consideration should be given an amendment of this clause. This is a provision which deals with the re-production of speeches in any form whatsoever. The clause, Sir, is in the widest possible form. I want to submit to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;to put it at its lowest&#x2014;that there is a grave doubt whether Section 2 of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act, No. 19 of 1911, is not repealed by this provision <i>pro tanto</i> or at least varied? Obviously it would not be repealed in form; it might mean that it is repealed or amended by implication in respect of these matters. Sir, if we look at Maxwell on &#x201C;The Interpretation of Statutes&#x201D;&#x2014;I do not want to quote extensively&#x2014;but he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Again, if the co-existence of two sets of provisions would be destructive of the object for which the later was passed, the earlier would be repealed by the later.</block>

<p>If the object of the clause is to prevent dissemination in any form whatsoever, quite obviously the provision which prohibits dissemination is of the same kind as those dealt with in the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act which gives an absolute right to raise any matters whatsoever in Parliament. Here, Sir, is a specific provision which specifically prohibits anybody from in any way disseminating or spreading speeches which have been made by persons who are referred to in the clause.It seems to me that that provision falls fully within the rule which I have quoted. I think the hon. the Minister will follow my argument. If it is intended to stop entirely the spreading of statements by the persons who fall within the terms of the clause, quite obviously the statement of those matters in Parliament would immediately get right round that provision. In those circumstances I do submit to the Minister that there is. as I said a minute ago, a very grave risk that the freedom of speech which exists here, is being impaired. It is only right that freedom of speech in this House should be put entirely beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>I now come to the provisions of Clause 21 I would like to say immediately that I believe that true sabotage is one of the worst and most reprehensible crimes which there can possibly be. We have no crime of sabotage on our Statute Book. It has been found in years gone by that our common law&#x2014;our Roman-Dutch Law as amended by the influence of English law and of course our Statutes&#x2014;has given ample protection. The position is that the hon. the Minister says that it is essential that the new crime should be created. He has pointed out that powers in respect of sabosabotage have been taken in various other countries in the world. Let me make it clear: First of all, it has been stated again and again, that sabotage is absolutely and utterly opposed by the Opposition. When I use the word &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; I mean sabotage in its ordinary dictionary meaning and not in the meaning which it has been given in terms of this Bill. Case after case has been put to the hon. the Minister here in this debate making it abundantly clear that there are innumerable cases where comparatively minor matters fall squarely within the term &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; as defined in this Bill. The hon. the Minister said across the floor of the House to one of the hon. members here who had put a specific case to him, a case which the Minister cannot deny was a valid one, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be silly&#x201D; or words to that effect.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Now, Sir, I say it is utterly wrong to put on a Statute a crime so ill defined although only the Attorney-General can prosecute. I have already disposed of the argument that it must trust the Attorney-General by referring to a case, which was subject to great criticism in respect of wholesale prosecutions, I refer to the Treason trial in which 156 persons being put in jeopardy and later discharged. Don&#x2019;t let us suggest, Sir, that an Attorney-General cannot make mistakes. I do not for a moment believe they would act arbitrarily. But I say this that Parliament would be utterly wrong to put on the Statute Book a crime as widely defined as this, a crime which can bring persons in jeopardy of a death sentence in respect of matters which are of a minor nature. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will reconsider this clause entirely. The Minister will agree that in this clause the definition of &#x201C;sabotage&#x201D; goes very much further than the definition in the War Measure Regulations which were put on our Statute Book during the war. Even there, Sir, when South Africa was fighting for her life, the sabotage clause was nothing like as wide as the clause which we have in this Bill. I believe, Sir, that it is possible to make sabotage a crime which will deal with real sabotage and not with matters which artifically become sabotage because of the terms of a piece of legislation. Now I come to perhaps the most objectionable provision. Member after member on the other side of the House has said that there is not a real shifting of the onus. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) took the first part of Clause 21 and he referred to a wrongful and wilful act and he said that had to be proved by the State. I entirely agree with him. That has to be proved by the State. Once the wrongful act has been proved then immediately the onus is placed upon the accused in respect of the contents of paragraph (2) of this clause, and no hon. member on that side can deny that. The hon. member for Ceres nods his head; and I think the hon. the Minister for Information also appears to <span class="col_6571-6572" refersTo="page_0532"/>agree. So we are at one. It is elementary because the clause says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That no person shall be convicted of an offence under sub-section (1) if he proves that the commission of the alleged offence, objectively regarded, was not calculated and that such offence was not committed with intent etc.</block>

<p>I say that in many of the circumstances which can arise that onus is an unfair onus so far as the accused is concerned. I hope the hon. the Minister will have second thoughts about it.</p>

<p>I should like to say this in regard to this debate. I think all of us on both sides of this House were privileged to be able to hear the analysis of this Bill by my hon. Leader. It was a magnificent analysis of the provisions of the Bill and it stands absolutely untouched by the debate which has taken place over the last few days. Not in one single respect has that case been shaken, not in a single respect. The case which was put by my hon. Leader stands unshaken, stands firmly and that is the case which the hon. the Minister has to meet in his reply to this debate. I hope he will concede a very large number of the points that were raised. It is so easy to say: You are against this Bill, therefore you are in favour of Communism. You are against this Bill, therefore you are in favour of sabotage. I fling that charge back in the teeth of any hon. member who makes that allegation, because he knows that it is an utterly unjustified accusation in relation to the attitude of this side of the House in respect of this Bill.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with the Bill any further. I think it has been fully covered &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the best precedent that we have to look at are our own War Measure Regulations. I would be prepared to examine as an alternative any other law which deals with this matter, so that we can get a better law on the Statute Book. It should be the aim of all of us to get the best possible provision&#x2019;s in our law and particularly in our criminal law because of the dire consequences. Because once a man has been hanged, there is nothing that you can do about it thereafter; it is the end. Therefore, I say we should spend all the time necessary, we should do our utmost to get an entirely satisfactory definition if the Minister feels that it is essential that sabotage should be a separate crime. But I do beg of the Minister this, Sir, that he will not make the so-called sabotage so wide that it covers all aspects of life. Let it be kept to the serious matters where persons are seeking to subvert the State. If that can be done, I think we might get some where.</p>

<p>I have completed the analysis of some provisions of the Bill. I would like in the last few minutes which are available to me to say this: More than ever in a debate that which I have heard during these last few days, has made me wonder whether hon. members opposite&#x2014;many of them, not all; there are many exceptions to whom I pay tribute&#x2014;do not realize the difficulties which face South Africa and do not realize where South Africa is standing at the present time in relation to the outside world.

<p>You hear that, Sir,&#x201D;capitulation&#x201D;. That is not the spirit in which I am approaching this matter, Sir. Let me say at once, that so far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to capitulate. I believe it is nothing less than my bounden duty to pass down to the coming generation, particularly that portion for whose being I am personally responsible&#x2014;my own descendants&#x2014;what I can. I believe it is my bounden duty to do all that can be done. I think it is in that spirit that we should approach this problem. We cannot forever live in the position that South Africa is in the situation in relation to the outside world in which she is to-day. Let me say this: I realize as well as anyone the vast difficulty of solving the problems of this country. It will not be the work of this generation alone. It will be the work, I believe, of generation upon generation. In that work, I believe, to get anywhere near to a solution we must get very much further away from the hatred and the bitterness which has disfigured the life of South Africa for far too long. [Interjections.] Sir, I was not casting stones. I was referring to the South African people inside and outside this House. What is perfectly clear to me, Sir, is this: Whatever the solutions may be great demands will be made on the White man in South Africa in finding a solution to these problems. It is something which will test us to the core. I hope, Sir, that the day will come that we will have a sounder base from which to work. This is a democracy and I believe in democracy. But I do believe that if democracy is to stand, then it must be a democracy which is free from the hatred and the bitterness and the suspicion which we find all too rife in South African public life. [Interjections.] Sir, I am glad to hear hon. members opposite say&#x201D;hear, hear&#x201D;, I wonder perhaps if, in the remaining stages of the debate they would be prepared to do what they can so this may be a start in that regard. Sir, we are dealing with things of fundamental importance. We are dealing with <span class="col_6573-6574" refersTo="page_0533"/>the freedom of people. Don&#x2019;t let us disfigure the remaining stages of this debate by this cry of &#x201C;kafferboetie&#x201D; and &#x201C;communist It is something which has done this country immense damage, not only in that it made the solution of our problems more difficult but very much more than that, Sir. I believe that sort of statement finds its way overseas, and is one of the bases of the difficulties which South Africa faces in the outside world.</p>

Sir, you know votes are not the important thing. The important thing&#x2014;and I hope that will be the important thing to every Opposition who ever sits in this House&#x2014;is that in respect of our political problems all will take their stand on that which they believe to be right. I am quite prepared to take a stand on those principles which have been enunciated from this side of the House during this debate.

<p>Mr. Speaker, in spite of the fact that we have all stayed awake a very long time, particularly I, I should have liked to have replied to this debate immediately but for the fact that circumstances of which we are all aware make it impossible to continue.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I want to thank the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) for the words of appreciation which he addressed to me at the beginning of his speech. In saying that, the reply that I gave him also falls away, of course. I want to add, however, that I would be neglecting my duty if I did not point out to the hon. member that the pious protestations which he uttered in the course of his peroration simply leave me cold. I have heard similar protestations only too often in this House in the past and nothing has come of them in practice. That is why I take no notice of them. Unfortunately I have also reached the stage already where I no longer believe these protestations, because although words have been plentiful they have never been followed up by deeds. In the course of the 37 hours that this debate has lasted, the tragedy of the United Party has become much clearer than ever before in all the years that I have been a member of this House. The United Party is completely helpless in the grip of the forces which control it and which dictate its policy. For 37 hours we have heard protestations here that there is no party which is more inexorably opposed to Communism and to sabotage than the United Party, and yet it has taken them 37 hours to say why they are going to vote against this Bill which is specifically designed to deal with Communism and sabotage. That is the tragedy of hon. members on the other side, namely that whatever the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. member for Germiston (District) and others may want to do, they are at the mercy of forces which do not allow them to act as they see fit. The second tragedy which has been enacted in my mind&#x2019;s eye during this debate is that in any other country which professes to be and which is genuinely opposed to Communism, this debate, however badly this Bill may have been drafted, would have taken no more than one morning, because the second reading debate only concerns the principle embodied in this Bill. In any other country an Opposition which is not helplessly trapped in the grip of the forces controlling it would have said that although the Bill has been badly drafted it approves of the second reading for the sake of the common principle of anti-Communism and anti-sabotage and that it will deal with the Bill in detail in the Committee Stage. That is what one could have expected from an Opposition which is not tied hand and foot as this tragic United Party is.</p>

<p>At this stage I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after a debate lasting 37 hours it is an impossible task, of course, to reply to every hon. member who took part in this debate. If I were to do so, it would simply mean that we would have to have a second night sitting for my reply. Hon. members will understand, therefore, that I cannot reply to every hon. member. In many cases, of course, it is not necessary in this second-reading debate to reply to the arguments advanced by hon. members opposite because many of those arguments, if not most of them, dealt with aspects of the Bill which really belong to the Committee Stage and which can be dealt with there. Fortunately my task in this connection has been made easier because of the fact that hon. members on my side of the House&#x2014;and in that connection I include everybody, from the hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;), who opened this debate to the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker), who was the last speaker on our side&#x2014;replied very effectively to the arguments advanced by hon. members on the other side. I want to make use of this opportunity to thank hon. members on this side of the House not only for the study that they made of this matter, not only for their arguments which were so relevant, but apart from that I want to thank hon. members on my side for the dignified way in which they advanced their arguments. I can say the same thing as far as some hon. members on the other side are concerned; to my regret, however, I cannot say it in respect of certain other members. A second-reading debate, as every hon. member sitting in this House knows, concerns one thing and one thing only and that is the principle which underlies the Bill. There were some hon. members on the other side who did not attack the principle. Here I refer in particular to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). I appreciate the fact that the hon. member did not attack the principle of the Bill. But, as I shall indicate in the course of my speech&#x2014;and this was perfectly clear to everyone who attended this debate and who listened to the arguments of hon. members on the other side&#x2014;the liberal section of the United Party, which it so happens constitutes the majority, entirely rejected the principle of this Bill; they made a direct attack upon the principle. I said in the course of my second-reading speech that in spite of the propaganda that was being made, the masses outside were calm, quiet and at rest. That is still the position in spite of the venomous attacks that were made on the Bill, in spite of the propaganda that was made, in spite of the fact that last week we had to witness the spectacle that a big party like the United Party allowed itself to be scared by the Progressive Party and the communists into adopting the attitude that they adopted here. I shall indicate later on how it came about that the United Party allowed themselves to be frightened. But now that the agitation has died down and all that remains is just an isolated wisp of smoke here and there curling forth from the little flame held aloft by a Black Sash woman, I daresay that this big party must be very ashamed for having allowed itself to be frightened in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I stated perfectly clearly in my second-reading speech that this was no panic measure, that this measure was not being introduced because South Africa was sitting on a powder keg which is likely to explode at any time. I said that the reason for the introduction of this measure was to retain the state of peace and quiet which prevails in South Africa at the present time. I also stated that the principle underlying this Bill was twofold : In the first place intensified action against the communists and in the second place the combating of sabotage. I also stated perfectly clearly that it was not simply a question of suspected sabotage, that it was not simply a threat of sabotage that we had to combat, because hon. members know as well as I do that what we have had in South Africa and what we have to combat here is active sabotage. Sir, this Bill was announced, and when it was first read by the United Party they were not shocked. The hon. member for Germiston (District)&#x2014;and I take it that he was speaking on behalf of his party&#x2014;was not shocked by this Bill. The people who were shocked were the traditional English-language Press (who always like to pretend that they are shocked), the communists, the A.N.C., the P.A.C., and the Congress of Democrats; they were shocked; the Indian National Congress was shocked. The Progressive Party was shocked down to the depths of its soul and the Liberal Party was shocked even more, that is to say, if they have a soul that is capable of being shocked.</p>

<p>I shall come to that. But the United Party, according to the utterances of its leaders, was not shocked. As a matter of fact, the Leader of the Opposition had nothing to say about this Bill for ten days. If the United Party was also shocked, then surely it completely neglected its duty towards the country and towards the electorate, because surely in that case it should have said that it was shocked. But that was simply not the case. The people whom I have mentioned who were shocked, decided to launch an agitation against this Bill. They decided that it was necessary that the United Party should also be shocked, and eventually, as has been evident in this debate, the United Party was shocked. By very clear implication, the attitude of the United Party to begin with&#x2014;that is how I interpret the interview which the hon. member for Germiston (District) gave on behalf of his party&#x2014;was that the United Party did not object in principle to this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not saying that the hon. member said so, but what is significant is what the hon. member did not say. I said that it was implicit in the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude&#x2014;and we shall come back to it in the Committee Stage&#x2014;that in principle he did not object to this Bill but objected to certain clauses, clauses which are going to be discussed in the Committee Stage. That was the attitude of the United Party to begin with. It was only after three or four caucus meetings, after the Younger Pitt, as they describe the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), had persuaded the caucus to adopt this attitude, that the United Party was opposed to this Bill in principle, and then we witnessed this spectacle that we saw here.</p>

<p>And since I have mentioned the hon. member for Durban (North), let me start with him immediately. From beginning to end the speech of the hon. member for Durban (North) was an attack upon the principles underlying this measure. The hon. member spoke not only as a United Party politician but also as a jurist when he did this. I want to say very clearly therefore&#x2014;because I want to base another argument on this&#x2014;that the hon. member, on behalf of his party, entirely opposed the principle underlying this Bill and attacked that principle during the whole of the 40 minutes that he spoke. Let me illustrate to hon. members what words the hon. member used, <i>inter alia</i> (I could mention a great deal more, but time will not permit me to do so), to oppose these two principles, namely the combating of Communism and the combating of sabotage. As far as the combating of Communism is concerned the hon. member simply said that he rejected it, that this was not aimed against the communists, and he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister is now going to destroy altogether any means that anyone might have to voice his grievances.</block>

<p>That is word for word what the hon. member said. In other words, the hon. member says, &#x201C;We do not want to fight Communism.&#x201D; Nor does he want to allow us to fight Communism in this way. The hon. member says that what we have in mind is what I have just read out here.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I agree that what the hon. member said was nonsense, because he is a member of the United Party and that is why he talks nonsense. As far as the sabotage clause is concerned, the hon. member characterized it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to remind him, if he brings in provisions like Clause 21</block>

<p>And Clause 21 deals with sabotage and sabotage exclusively&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he brings in an inquisition, not a trial in any sense of the word in a court of law, as we have always known it in this country.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member goes on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I don&#x2019;t think it helps very much for the hon. the Minister to tie completely the hands of the profession.</block>

<p>That is to say, the advocates&#x2019; profession, the Bar Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to tie completely the hands of the profession and the hands of the Bench when he introduced a crime like that.</block>

<p>That was the background to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech as a jurist and as a politician, and it amounted to a complete rejection of the principles contained in this Bill. I had to listen for 40 minutes to the hon. member&#x2019;s rejection of these principles. The hon. member dragged in the advocate&#x2019;s profession, and then I said to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bar Council does not support you.</block>

<p>He then asked me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Does the Minister suggest that the General Council of the Bar is in agreement with this measure?</block>

<p>My reply to that was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bar Council supports the principle of the Bill.</block>

<p>The hon. member then asked me whether I would indicate that later on. I told the hon. member that I would do so in my reply, and I proceed therefore to do so now.</p>

<p><span class="col_6579-6580" refersTo="page_0536"/>But before doing so, I want to say that as far as I am concerned the position is perfectly clear, and I am convinced that every member of Parliament and I am also convinced that every person outside this House who is any sort of lawyer, or who has any idea of the procedure in Parliament, will realize clearly what the principles of this Bill are, namely the combating of sabotage and the combating of Communism. How one sets about it is a matter on which there may be a difference of opinion. One person may say that it should be done in this, that or the other way, and another may adopt a different attitude; that I fully understand, but there is nobody who can be in any doubt as to what the principles of this Bill are.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. I want to say in the clearest terms that when I met the Bar Council there was not the least doubt in our minds as to what the principles of the Bill were. There was not the slightest doubt, but it was also perfectly clear that there was no objection to those two basic principles, because the Bar Council raised no objection, by word or deed, to those principles in spite of the fact that it was perfectly clear what those principles were. As the result of that interjection which I made while the hon. member was speaking, the Bar Council then issued a statement through Mr. Warner and the Johannesburg Bar Council issued a statement through Advocate George Coleman. When I saw these statements I immediately sent a telegram to Advocate Warner and to Advocate Coleman, and I also informed Advocate de Kock, who had accompanied that deputation, as to the contents of that telegram and asked him to state his attitude. My telegram to the leader of the Bar Council, Mr. Warner, read as follows&#x2014;and I want hon. members to note the words that I used because every word was very carefully considered and was, I take it, regarded in that light by the people who received the telegram&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surprised your statement now Bar Council does not support &#x201C;principle of Bill, whatever that may be&#x201D;. I repeat &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now the hon. member wants to know since when that has become the principle. For 37 hours we knew that that was the principle and for 37 hours the hon. member and his party opposed that principle. Moreover, I informed hon.</p>

<p>members that that was the principle, but now that they are beginning to get into difficulties, we get the sort of interjection which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has just made. I went on to say this in my telegram&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your objections only referred to methods employed to do so and wording of certain sections. Please confirm or deny immediately your support these principles.</block>

<p>I then received the following reply from Advocate Warner&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bar Council does not support this Bill. Regardless of what the principles of this Bill may be, it is not the function of the Bar Council to pronounce upon them. It cannot therefore be said that it either supports or opposes them.</block>

<p>I do not wish to comment on that at all. This is the sort of attitude which is adopted by eminent lawyers. I give it to the House just as I received it. Thereafter I received a further telegram from Advocate Warner which read as follows&#x2014;and I am particularly grateful that this telegram came&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Please add to telegram already sent: Bar Council could not and would not oppose any legislation necessary to preserve law and order.</block>

<p>That is the telegram that came from one part of the Bar Council. I also received a telegram from Advocate de Kock, who had accompanied this deputation, and this telegram reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Question as to whether General Bar Council supported or disapproved of the principle of Bill was not under discussion at General Bar Council&#x2019;s interview with you in Cape Town.</block>

<p>That is precisely how I put it. I said that the question as to what the principle was was not raised by the Bar Council and that it was not discussed. But he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Deputation only submitted proposals with regard to specific provisions of Bill (which is what I also said to the Bar Council). Pretoria Bar Council supports broad principle of Bill mentioned in your telegram, namely legislation to curb communistic activities and to act against sabotage.</block>

<p>Those are the words that I used in my telegram. That last telegram was signed by Mr. de Kock. I want to go further. I also received a telegram, unsolicited&#x2014;I was not in touch with them&#x2014;but as the result of this agitation I received a telegram from the Secretary of the Bar Council at Bloemfontein, in which he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inasmuch as underlying principle of measure is to combat communist activities and sabotage &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_6581-6582" refersTo="page_0537"/>That is precisely the principle of this Bill as we understand it here and as people understand it outside this House&#x2014;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I do not know why hon. members are so terribly interested in this. I have just received a reply also from Adv. Coleman from Johannesburg, and this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Johannesburg Bar Council concerned only with the administration of justice, not Government policy. Council naturally accepts that any person properly proved guilty of sabotage in true sense should be punished.</block>

<p>And then he goes on and, as I have said before, says something about which there might well be a difference of opinion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But disapproves of methods proposed in Bill that they violate the principle of rule of law, as explained in our Press statement.</block>

<p>I think those telegrams speak for themselves, and the conclusions to be drawn from them speak for themselves; it is not necessary for me, therefore, to go into this matter at greater length.</p>

<p>In this matter the United Party, as I have already said, allowed itself to be frightened by the agitation that was unleashed initially by the Progressive Party. The United Party was prodded into taking a stand in this matter because they got the fright of their lives when Jan Steytler, according to reports, drew 3,000 people to the Johannesburg City Hall. Thereafter the agitation started. In Durban 600 people turned up; in the Drill Hall here in Cape Town 600 turned up and in last Friday&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i> I read this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Few people attend protest meetings.</block>

<p>There were 21 in the Maitland Town Hall. And this is the public that is so concerned about this Bill! There were 45 in the Glenmore Hall at Athlone, and then we read in the same <i>Argus</i> what happened in East London&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Seventy turned out for politics, 2,000 for jazz.</block>

<p>And that was after Mr. John Cope had gone there to get the agitation under way. What is left now? The naked truth is&#x2014;and the conduct of hon. members here testifies to this&#x2014;that now that the hullabaloo is over and they see precisely what has happened, the United Party realizes that in behaving as it did it made a fool of itself. The United Party realizes to-day that the country as a whole supports this Bill, and supports it fully, and I want to go so far as to say that it is not only the members of the National Party who support this Bill but also members of the United Party. I have received many letters and telegrams, some in favour of the Bill and others against it, but I want to say here that as far as I am aware I have not received a telegram expressing disapproval from a single member of the United Party, but I have received numerous messages of approval from people. I want to express my appreciation&#x2014;and this augurs well for the future&#x2014;of the fact that members of the United Party outside this House have not followed their leaders in this matter but that they realize that the interests of South Africa are at stake in this matter.</p>

<p>I say and I am convinced in my heart of hearts&#x2014;and this was borne out by the hon. member for Germiston (District) towards the end of this debate&#x2014;that members of the United Party realize that they have made a mistake in attacking the principle of this Bill. They are beginning to realize that it is a mistake to go on record as having voted against the second reading of this Bill. We know as parliamentarians that by voting against the second reading of a Bill, you indicate and openly declare to the world that you are against the principle of the Bill; you demonstrate your opposition by voting against the Bill at the second reading, and if the United Party votes against the second reading of this Bill and if the Whips ask for a division on this Bill, then I say that I shall be perfectly justified in saying to the electorate of South Africa (and the United Party will not be able to say that we are besmirching them) that &#x2026;</p>

<p>I would be perfectly entitled to say that as the result of lack of leadership on the part of the Leader of the Opposition the United Party opposes the principle of this Bill. In other words, the United Party does not want to allow us to pass legislation against Communism or to combat sabotage. I say that the United Party has only one chance to save itself and to render the country and itself a service, and that is by not opposing the second reading of this Bill when it is put to the vote. But if they do vote against it we shall deal with them outside this House and tell the public precisely what the implications are. There may be senior <span class="col_6583-6584" refersTo="page_0538"/>advocates who do not know what the principle of this Bill is, but hon. members on the other side cannot plead that they do not know what the principle of this Bill is. They know pre-fectly well what it is.</p>

<p>What was the attitude of the Opposition in connection with this matter? I do not want to do the hon. the Leader of the Opposition an injustice. I listened to him and to every other speaker who took part in this debate, and if I have to summarize their attitude, as they expressed it in their own words&#x2014;and if I do the hon. the Leader of the Opposition an injustice, he must tell me so&#x2014;it amounts to this: The argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other members, as I understand it, is this: &#x201C;The Bill is quite unnecessary; existing laws can deal effectively with sabotage and the courts have wide powers to impose punishment for any injury to life or property.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I shall come to the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. But that is the attitude that hon. members on the other side adopted. If hon. members feel that I am doing them an injustice and if they maintain that that is not their attitude then they should say so now. I listened carefully, and that is how I summarize their attitude. Since that is so-&#x2014;and hon. members told us that time and again&#x2014;I wonder what the difference is between the views in connection with this matter of the official Opposition and those of the Congress of Democrats. Because this is what the Congress of Democrats says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bill is quite unnecessary. The law already deals with sabotage. The courts have wide powers to impose punishment for any injury to life or property.</block>

<p>I do not know whether the Congress of Democrats took over the words of hon. members on the other side or whether hon. members of the Opposition took over the words of the Congress of Democrats. That is a matter which they must settle amongst themselves.</p>

<p>But let me go further and come to the amendment of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was in this difficulty, of course, that he had to move an amendment immediately after I had made my second reading speech, and consequently he had to anticipate what I was going to say in this connection and adapt his amendment to it; and this is what he says in his amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This House, while determined to ensure the maintenance of law and order and safety of the State, nevertheless refuses to pass the second reading.</block>

<p>That is the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude. I ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Where is the freedom of law-abiding citizens being threatened here? I know of no single law-abiding person who is a communist. And as far as the sabotage clause is concerned I know that the accused must be found guilty of having committed an unlawful act and of having committed it with intent. Why does the hon. member say that the freedom of law-abiding persons is being threatened by this Bill? After all, he knows that that is not so. But he goes further; in the second instance he says, &#x201C;It creates a new crime and defines it so widely that it can endanger the lives and liberties of people who are innocent of any intention to subvert the State.&#x201D; Again I say, Mr. Speaker, that it is perfectly clear that no person can be charged unless he has deliberately committed an unlawful act. How the hon. member can reconcile that with these words in his amendment I cannot understand; but in the third place he says, &#x201C;It grants further extensive powers to the Government and ignores the fact that laws already exist which are adequate to deal with any crisis which may arise in the country.&#x201D; I say that the hon. the Leader had to anticipate what I was going to say here, and usually he is wrong. His prophecies are always wrong. When he predicts that my end is close at hand, I know that my chances of a second marriage have never been better. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition had to anticipate what I was going to say, so he said that we had sufficient powers to deal with any crisis. He expected me to talk about a crisis. As a matter of fact, he holds it against me that I did not say that South Africa was in a state of crisis and that that was why we were introducing this measure. Is that what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants? Does he want to associate himself with the remark of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that I must wait until there is a crisis before taking any steps? I made it perfectly clear to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and to the House that I did not want to wait until there was a crisis but that I wanted to take the necessary steps to obviate a crisis. After all, that is the basis and the reason for the introduction of this Bill.</p>

<p>But in the fourth place he says, &#x201C;It will damage the Republic by creating the false impression that a permanent state of emergency exists in our country.&#x201D; I did not say that, Mr. Speaker, and there is nothing in this Bill to suggest to the Leader of the Opposition or to any other person that a permanent state of emergency exists in this country. But that is what hon. members on the other side would like to see, because judging by what the hon. Whip (Brig. Bronkhorst) said, it is only a crisis in South Africa that offers any hope to the United Party of ever getting into power, particularly if that crisis is forced upon us from outside. The hon. member over there told us that hon. members on the other side were pinning their hopes and expectations on a shock from outside to arouse the people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, I do not want to reply at this stage to Committee Stage arguments. I want to proceed now to deal with the basic attitude of hon. members on the other side, as revealed in the course of this debate. I must say in all honesty that when one condenses it, one is struck by the fact that the Congress of Democrats, which has become the mouthpiece of the communists, has succeeded in forming a new Civil Rights League to oppose this Bill outside this House. The Congress of Democrats acted on the suggestion of Luthuli. Luthuli gave instructions, as it were, to certain people to take part in those activities. I am glad that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who also received that instruction, has not yet carried it out. This Civil Rights League, under the leadership of Mr. Centlivres, is collecting funds to oppose this Bill. The Congress of Democrats, which is the mouthpiece of the communists, is boasting now that one of the members who made a contribution to the fund is the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). I should very much like to hear from the hon. member for Wynberg what the position is; he heard the accusation that I made against him perfectly well, and he has not denied it. One of the people who made a contribution to the funds of this conglomerate which is being led by the Congress of Democrats and the communists, is the hon. member for Wynberg.</p>

<p>Of course he signed it; he admits it. First of all he told me that he did not know who they were. What value one could attach to the standpoint and the words of that hon. member.</p>

<p>The first argument advanced by hon. members of the Opposition, as one could naturally expect, and as I warned in the beginning of my second reading speech, was that we now wanted to establish a police state in South Africa. That argument was used particularly by the hon. members for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), Wynberg, Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) and Kensington (Mr. Moore), and of course they were assisted, as one could expect, by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) and by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), as one could also expect.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I say that between the standpoint of the hon. members for Constantia, Wynberg and others, and the standpoint of the hon. member for Houghton, followed by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, there is of course no difference. In fact, there are many people who believed that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout would <span class="col_6589-6590" refersTo="page_0541"/>join the Progressive Party. I am not one of those who held that standpoint. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is a man of firm principles. He will definitely not join the Progressive Party before the hon. member for Houghton gives him her seat.</p>

<p>We had the argument from that group that we wanted to create a police state in South Africa. I wonder on how many occasions and in connection with how many Bills hon. members have already used that argument against us. I think one need not take it seriously any more; one can only laugh. This argument has been used ever since the days of Mr. Strauss. But why do they do it? They themselves do not believe it. They simply do it because they know that it is again one of the things which will be used against us for overseas consumption. I want to lay it at the door of the hon. member for Kensington, as an old member and an old man, that he not only used that argument against us, but went out of his way to read certain quotations, wild statements which were made in the past by the late Dr. Steyn Vorster. Why did he quote those wild statements? Simply because he knows that because the man&#x2019;s name was Vorster I will eventually be blamed for having said those things. I want to repeat that the statements he quoted of Dr. Steyn Vorster have nothing at all to do with this Bill. It has nothing to do with the National Party or with anybody else. He simply dragged it into this debate in order that it might be interpreted in that way by people outside.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member enjoyed making those allegations, but now that he is being paid back he adopts the attitude he does in this House.</p>

<p>But the second argument we had from hon. members opposite is that by means of this Bill we wanted to restrict freedom of speech. How many hon. members opposite said&#x2014;the hon. member for Zululand and various others&#x2014;that the real object of this Bill was not to combat Communism, but that it had a dual purpose, viz. to restrict freedom of speech and eventually to destroy the Opposition and to render it powerless. I do not wish to render the Opposition powerless. Our criticism of the Opposition is that they are already so hopeless in this House. If they are to be even more powerless than they are, I do not want to sit in this House. Their whole standpoint was that we were now going to restrict freedom of speech. They did not say it in so many words, but if one of them had thought of it, with reference to what Mr. Strauss had said, they could have coined the slogan, &#x201C;Speak for the right to speak again&#x201D;. That is what hon. members kept us busy with in this House for 37 hours.</p>

<p>Then there were hon. members opposite, and here I particularly want to mention the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson), the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) and the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), who tried to ridicule this Bill. Let me say that the way in which that hon. member acted does not redound to the credit of this House. Let us examine for a moment what the hon. member for Drakensberg said, and she was loudly cheered by hon. members opposite, when she uttered the following nonsense. This is what she said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If somebody gives a lift to a man who has been run over by a motor-car, and he takes him to hospital to receive treatment, and he recovers, and it appears that he is a communist, that person can be charged in terms of this Bill.</block>

<p>That is the sort of nonsense to which we had to listen for 37 hours. I am glad the hon. member is now ashamed of herself, now that she again hears precisely what she said in this debate. And we got the same kind of nonsense from all those hon. members I have just mentioned.</p>

<p>But, furthermore, we had the most venomous attacks on me personally in this debate and outside. I reject those with contempt. Those attacks were particularly linked to my previous membership of the Ossewa Brandwag. For that purpose a person had to be called in to come and lift the lid in this House and that person was the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman). The hon. member does not happen to be here now. That is the irony of the matter. It is not the voters who made a mistake by sending him here. He was selected by the Leader of the Opposition, and that is why he is here. One could have forgiven the voters for having made the mistake of sending him here, but he was specially brought here by the Leader of the Opposition. He was now supposed to lift the lid. And when I prepared myself to see how the lid would be lifted, the hon. member sat down without even having come near to that lid. He reminded me of A. G. Visser&#x2019;s song: &#x201C;Sy Wou Gaan Sit, Toe Sit Sy Al.&#x201D; What the hon. member did here was intended for foreign consumption, against me. That is the reason why he made those allegations against me. The hon. member told me that he challenged me to reveal the prosecutions and convictions in his O.B. area at the time and in my area during the war years in so far as sabotage was concerned. That was the challenge the hon. member issued to me, and what was the insinuation he wanted to make by it? That he was quite innocent, that nothing happened in his area, but that I was the man who, if I did not commit myself. allowed sabotage to be committed in the area under my command at the time. That is the insinuation the hon. member made. I take up the challenge issued by the hon. member, and I say here&#x2014;and the hon. member knows that it is true&#x2014;that neither in his area nor in mine was anyone prosecuted for having committed sabotage, for the simple reason that <span class="col_6591-6592" refersTo="page_0542"/>no sabotage was committed. Surely the hon. member knows that. No sabotage was committed in the whole of the Eastern Province. I think no sabotage was committed in the whole of the Cape Province. The hon. member knows that. Whilst he spoke, and I know that this is the insinuation, he realized that this was the price he had to pay for the seat which was offered to him, to expose me in that manner. Whilst he tried to expose me in that way, my thoughts went back to an oath which both he and I took. That oath, <i>inter alia</i>, said: &#x201C;I will assist and protect my fellow Afrikaner, never desert him in battle and hand him over to the enemy and the stranger&#x2026;&#x201D; I do not mind if he wants to hand me over to the U.P., if he wants to, but I object, on the basis of the oath he took, to his wanting to hand me over to the communists.</p>

<p>Because the O.B. was dragged into this debate repeatedly, and because that hon. member saw fit to do so, I just want to tell him that in this House there are three types of ex-members of the O.B. The first group consists of those persons who on principle resigned from the O.B. when there was a conflict between the party and the O.B.</p></speech>

<p>No, I was not, and I will come to it in a moment.

It is that group which resigned on principle, and they are sitting here to-day and they are my friends. I differed from them at the time, and differed sharply. But there was another group which remained over after that difference of principle arose. Amongst them was, <i>inter alia</i>, that hon. member and I. Some people remained with the O.B. right until the end, when it was dissolved. I was one of those people. But some people got out of the way when it became dangerous to be a member of the O.B. The hon. member for East London (City) was not one of those who stayed until the end.</p></speech>

<p>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, there were three groups, and I am very grateful that I do not fall into the category into which the hon. member for East London (City) falls.</p>

<p>Then much was said about notices published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>, about contraventions which were committed, how leniently they dealt with people whilst they were in power, and how harshly we now want to treat the communists. Whilst we are now dealing with the Moolman case, it is interesting to go into it further. It is said that we want to restrict the freedom of speech, and that they themselves did not do so during the war years. Now I do not want you to accept my word for it. You may accept the word of the hon. member for East London (City), as he put it to the <i>Cape Times</i>. He said that during the war he was charged and had to appear before the court at Venterstad. Why? Because he said that the members of the Truth Legion were baboons. Just because he said that the Truth Legion were baboons they, in his own words, brought him before court in Venterstad in terms of Regulation 31 (b), which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No one may make a subversive statement in the hearing of anybody else.</block>

<p>At that time it was regarded as subversive to say that a member of the Truth Legion was a baboon. It is interesting to note that the same people are still sitting in the ranks of the party opposite. The only difference is that the hon. member for East London (City) is now sitting on a stone and crying, &#x201C;Boggem&#x201D;, together with those people. But I want to go further &#x2026;</p></speech>

<p>Another interesting fact is this. Those hon. members made such a terrible fuss about the clause in the Bill which deals with publication in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. The hon. member for Drakensberg told us, <i>inter alia</i>, that the people in Natal do not get the <i>Government Gazette</i>, and how long it takes for a <i>Government Gazette</i> to reach one there, and how unreasonable it was for us to publish such a thing in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and then to say that a person is guilty of a contravention after it has been published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. What happened in this case? These emergency regulations I have just quoted were promulgated on 4 February 1941, and the hon. member made that speech on 5 February 1941 the next day. A regulation published on 4 February in Pretoria, which provides that you may not call a member of the Truth Legion (Kakiridder) a baboon&#x2014;they arrested the hon. member the next day for contravening that regulation.</p></speech>

<p>The next argument that came from hon. members opposite, is that they cannot give us powers under this Bill because this Government has abused the powers they received under the 1950 Act, by using it against people who are not communists. I asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition by way of interjection who those people are, and he then said no, he did not know, for no list of them had been published. But what are the facts? Surely hon. members know that in terms of the provisions of the 1950 Act, every person affected by that Act and who is subjected to restrictions of any nature&#x2014;the names of such persons have to be tabled in the Assembly within 14 days if the Assembly is then in session, or if the Assembly is not then in session, within 14 days after the commencement of the next ensuing session. Time and again my predecessors rose here, and I too, and the names and the restrictions imposed on the people concerned were tabled, in full detail. If now they allege that we abused those powers, why have the Opposition then never&#x2014;for it would have been their duty as Opposition, as the so-called watch dogs&#x2014;drawn our attention to it, or charged us or attacked us for having abused those powers?

<p>It is nonsense to say my decision is conclusive, for the hon. member surely could have attacked me if my decision was wrong, and that is why I tabled it. In 1950 hon. members said they would continually subject the actions of the Minister in terms of this Act to a minute examination, to ensure that he does not abuse his powers. But they have never even glanced at those lists that have been tabled. We have never yet been charged with having named somebody or having restricted somebody who is not a communist. And when we finally forced them to say who it is, they said it was Luthuli. I have dealt with that by pointing out that in fact Luthuli is a communist. And then they mentioned Patrick Duncan. The hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl), that dear, good person, comes along and says that Patrick Duncan can never be a communist because he was at his father&#x2019;s wedding. [Laughter.] Because the hon. member attended the marriage of his father, he says: I know him; he cannot be a communist. But I have challenged hon. members to prove to me that he is not a communist by mentioning one single utterance where Patrick Duncan condemned Communism. On the contrary, if you read the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of a few days ago, you will see an article by Mr. Patrick Duncan in it, and what does he say? Incidentally there are about 2,000 listed communists in South Africa. Mr. Patrick Duncan says that if this Bill is passed, &#x201C;the 2,000 democrats in South Africa will be silenced&#x201D;. That then is the man who is not a communist, but he has referred to those 2,000 listed communists as the &#x201C;2,000 democrats&#x201D;, and the whole point of the article <span class="col_6595-6596" refersTo="page_0544"/>is that they are the only democrats; all the others are only quasi-democrats.</p></speech>

<p>I do not blame them. Having heard the three &#x201C;bright boys&#x201D;, the fourth should rather be left out of consideration. The hon. members persistently adopted the attitude that we are not fighting Communism; they are the people who fought Communism whilst they were in power. I challenge hon. members opposite to mention a single measure to combat Communism in South Africa adopted by them whilst they were in power. What did they do? We know they released Moses Kotane, notwithstanding the fact that he at that time committed scandalous contraventions of the law. They released him simply because he was a communist. But the communist, Brian Bunting, in the latest edition of <i>New Age</i>, the 25th anniversary edition of <i>New Age</i>, sketched the development of the Communist Party, and more particularly, of the communist paper the <i>Guardian</i>, and there is no one in this House or outside who does not know that the <i>Guardian</i> was the mouthpiece and the organ of the Communist Party. It was so openly before the Communist Party was banned, and subsequently it was so under disguise, as I have indicated at the second reading. What does Mr. Bunting say? This is how hon. members opposite fought Communism. Mr. Bunting says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After the outbreak of war and the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the Guardian was the only newspaper to be granted an increased allocation of newsprint at a time when strict rationing was in force. The authorities acknowledged the vital role this paper could play in mobilizing the South African workers for victory if its circulation continued to soar.</block>

<p>That is how they fought Communism. I need not say anything more about it. But now the Leader of the Opposition comes along and says we must not introduce legislation to combat this danger. He says no, we should take positive steps, and then Communism will disappear of its own accord. That is half an argument. I should like to concede to the hon. member the force of it, that one can also combat Communism apart from other measures, by taking positive steps. But if that is so, can the hon. member then tell us why the Opposition has consistently fought every positive step we have taken? Was the clearance of the slums of Sophiatown and Newclare not one of the greatest anti-communist acts from that point of view? Yet hon. members fought us for days and weeks here in the Assembly. Was the clearance of slum areas here in Cape Town and elsewhere, on which the hon. the Minister for Coloured Affairs and Community Development is engaged, not a positive step in that connection? Yet what do we get from them? Only opposition and not an iota of co-operation. But then the Leader of the Opposition came along with an argument that is really too fatuous to run loose, and that is that if we wish Communism to disappear, we should accept his race federation. The moment we adopt his race federation, Communism will disappear in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, one can scoff a lot at that if one wishes, but I do not wish to do so on this occasion. I should like to point out only one consequence of that to the hon. member. What does his race federation mean? It means a qualified vote for non-Whites under given circumstances. But these people, the communists and the agitators, and even the Liberal Party, do not want a qualified vote. They want &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; and surely the hon. member knows that very well. Does he think for one moment, having regard to the documents I have read to you and which I shall still read, that it is not very apparent that they want to take extra-parliamentary action, and commit sabotage, to compel us to the point of view of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; extra-parliamentary? Does the hon. member for one moment think that the compulsion in the threat will stop if he gives a qualified vote, while these people have absolutely rejected it, from Luthuli right down to the rank and file? The communists want &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; because they want to control South Africa and want to destroy democracy, and the hon. member knows that surely. What is the attitude of these people who want to resort to violence? What is the attitude of these communists who want to put us under restraint in this way? I gave the hon. members certain quotations last time, and I want to do so again. It is very clear from this latest circular of the A.N.C. that they are aiming at certain objectives, and having regard to what has happened in recent times, one is surprised how right they saw it. In the first place they say in this circular that they have three immediate tasks in regard to organization, and the first thing they have to do is to mobilize the masses. That is why organizations are being established to organize the masses, and they are boasting that the hon. member for Wyn-berg (Mr. Russell) made a contribution. In the second place they say in this pamphlet that the church leaders should be harnessed against the National Party. Have you not seen it happening under your very eyes in recent times? In this pamphlet they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nationalists have started a new religion in which there is no God but the State.</block>

<p>That is precisely what these political spiritual leaders are preaching outside and in regard to which prayer meetings are being held. But they say in the third place the youth should <span class="col_6597-6598" refersTo="page_0545"/>be organized, and that is my answer to hon. members opposite&#x2014;and I have not come to this conclusion lightly. That is my answer also to the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), who made a moving appeal to me. The hon. member knows the Bantu. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town knows him equally well. What do they say in this connection?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The militant African youth should be grouped in the Youth League with orders directed from the Secretary-General. These form the inner circle of African leadership in the Free South Africa Movement.</block>

<p>In other words, they are stating very clearly what their <i>modus operandi</i> is. The masses have to be organized. The churches have to be harnessed, and the youth, which should form the inner circle, and who must act and do things, have to be harnessed to paralyse South Africa. Mandela leaves us in no doubt at all as to their intentions&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The precise form of the contemplated action, its scope and activities, will be announced to you at the appropriate time. At the present moment it is sufficient to say that we plan to make government impossible.</block>

<p>While that is being said, have I now to wait until government is made impossible, or should I take the necessary measures to put Communism under restraint before they do so? But they go further. One of their other leaders says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Chaos, disruption and plunder as envisaged in the Rhodesias should occur in this country.</block>

<p>That is what these people want to bring about, and then the ex-leader of the A.N.C., Nkosi, who is now employed in the Tass Agency, wrote this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no doubt that the only course open for our success is by organizing a revolutionary uprising of the proletariat, and in the meantime sabotage will be necessary.</block>

<p>That is what we are faced with now. I want to put it very clearly, that I do not for one moment believe that these people will effect it. They believe they will get assistance from Africa states, from Ghana and other states, and they are making the propaganda among their people that they will be supplied with arms by those Africa states. I think it is nonsense, but the fact remains that they believe it, and the fact that I do not believe they will succeed does not detract from the fact that these people are so foolish and indiscreet that they may very well commit such acts, and I am not only meeting trouble half-way. Surely these people have now proved that they want to commit those acts, for it has happened and what greater proof can I mention to hon. members? If I were to say to hon. members these people are planning sabotage, they could say I am alarmistic. But we warned them a long time ago already that that is the intention of these people, and now it has happened; and I want to repeat that they will not succeed in their plans. They are organizing for a take-over of South Africa in 1963. You and I know it will not and cannot happen, but that does not take away the fact that these people are so foolish that they are going to try to do so. And what is my duty under those circumstances? Must I wait until these people in their foolishness, in the state of incitement in which they are, take further steps? Must I permit them to carry on with their organization? Must I permit communists to run helter skelter all over South Africa as they wish, while I know, and see it in my reports, that they are organizing to subvert and to destroy the constitutional structure? Must I as Minister of Justice who is charged with that responsibility, just sit still and wait until they do these things, or is it my duty to restrain those people; to deprive them of their means of propaganda, and deprive them of their freedom of movement to organize those things? No, many charges have been made in this debate. There has been much scolding about Nazis and a police state. We do not serve South Africa in that way. We can do it, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has said, but then it must not remain at words only; we should act, and then this side of the House should know&#x2014;and they do not wish to know it in detail for it would be unfair to expect it of the Opposition&#x2014;but it has the elementary right that any government has of expecting from the Opposition in a civilized country, its support in principle when it comes along with measures to combat Communism and saboteurs. Had it not been for this Government, and had the Opposition been in power, judging from their attitude in the past, the Communist Party would still have been a lawful party in South Africa, for they did not want us to outlaw it. Then the communists would still have had all the liberties they had before, for the Opposition did not want us to restrain them. You say we are abusing our powers. If hon. members wish to co-operate, nobody desires their co-operation more than I. I shall welcome it, but then they should come along with deeds, and not only with idle words and recriminations. I reject with contempt the charge against me that I am seeking power. I am not seeking power; I am seeking the security of the Republic of South Africa. I reject with contempt the charge that I want to eliminate Parliament, and that I desire extra parliamentary action in order to undermine and destroy the foundations of Parliament. No, this is what I wish to eliminate. I want to combat Communism and sabotage. I can understand that hon. members will not always agree with the methods, but I should like to conclude by saying that I have the right to expect that the Opposition will support us at least as regards the principle of this measure&#x2014;and in a few minutes we shall vote on it.</p></speech>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill is the outcome of lengthy and intensive research not only in South Africa but in various parts of the world. My predecessor, the hon. the Minister of the Interior, had intended submitting a Bill of this nature to the House last year, but in the circumstances it was not possible to do so and on this occasion I want to convey to him my thanks for the work done by him in this connection. If my hon. predecessor knew what a lengthy speech I have to make here this afternoon to explain the principles of this Bill, he would understand why I wish that it was he who had to make this second reading speech rather than myself.</p>

<p>This Bill is the outcome of lengthy research. It is based on the best that science can offer. I believe that it will benefit the mining industry, the workers and the owners and that it will certainly be one of the most modern pieces of legislation of its kind in the world.</p>

<p>Since 1911, when legislation was introduced in connection with miner&#x2019;s phthisis, or pneumoconiosis as it is called to-day, this House has already had to give its attention to this matter on 17 occasions. The mining industry is a living industry which constantly expands. Mining methods continually change and improve and scientific and technological research in connection with diseases caused by dust and the prevention of those diseases takes place continually. Economic and social conditions also change continually, and it has been essential therefore to revise this legislation from time to time so as to adapt it to the ever-changing circumstances; to put into practice new knowledge and experience and to give proper protection to workers in the mining industry against the dangers of dust and to compensate and to take care of those whose health is prejudicially affected by dust. Once again, for the eighteenth time, this House is being asked to give its attention to this problem of dust diseases in the mining industry and to the care of workers who are affected by these diseases and to the care of their dependants. Let me say at once that I make no apologies for the fact that the time of this House has to be taken up once again with this matter. The fact that precisely six years after the last consolidating legislation was passed by this House, a comprehensive measure again has to be submitted to the House for consideration, is proof on the one hand of the importance of this matter and, on the other hand, of the Government&#x2019;s earnest desire to see that justice is done to those who assist, and often sacrifice their health, in keeping the economy of our country healthy and in expanding it.</p>

<p>The mining industry, particularly the gold mining <span class="col_6601-6602" refersTo="page_0547"/>industry, still remains, next to the agricultural industry, one of the cornerstones of our economic structure, and it is of national importance therefore that we should continually look after the weal and woe of the industry and its workers.</p>

<p>Before reviewing this Bill, it might be as well to give the House a brief outline of the background against which this measure should be viewed.</p>

<p>The first positive step in the struggle against pneumoconiosis (miner&#x2019;s phthisis) on the part of the authorities was taken as far back as 1902 when Lord Milner appointed a Commission &#x201C;to investigate the incidence of this disease, to determine the causes of it and to recommend preventive and curative measures&#x201D;.</p>

<p>This commission brought to light an extremely serious state of affairs in the gold mines and declared that preventive measures were absolutely essential. Important recommendations were made in connection with dust-control and other measures to prevent miner&#x2019;s phthisis. The findings and recommendations of this commission led to the passing of the Mines and Works Act of 1911 and the Miners&#x2019; Phthisis Act of the same year.</p>

<p>Since then this problem has continually received the attention of the authorities. In the course of the years more than 20 commissions and departmental committees have repeatedly investigated the medical, technical, social and administrative aspects of the problem of pneumoconiosis in the mining industry. There are few other subjects which have been investigated so regularly and so exhaustively as the pneumoconiosis problem. From the economic point of view, it is practically impossible to assess the role that pneumoconiosis played and is still playing at the present time. On a very conservative basis it is estimated that in the mining industry alone pneumoconiosis has cost South Africa more than R700,000,000. This amount only represents direct or actual expenditure in connection with compensation, the administration of legislation, research and scientific and other preventive measures. Then there are still the indirect consequences such as loss of production and the burden which the death of the breadwinner places in so many spheres upon the shoulders of the State a burden which can never be assessed in terms of money.</p>

<p>The administration of the pneumoconiosis legislation, compensation of pneumoconiosis sufferers and their dependants, research in connection with pneumoconiosis and preventive measures, are costing this country more than R16,000,000 per annum at present.</p>

<p>Compensation and other forms of monetary assistance to pneumoconiosis sufferers and their dependants have cost this country R142,013,459 from 1911 up to 31 March of this year. Over the past 12 financial years a sum of R77,289,107 has been paid out to beneficiaries, which is about R12,000,000 more than the amount paid out in the previous period of nearly 40 years from 1911 to 1950.</p>

<p>The seriousness of this matter is borne out by the fact that pneumoconiosis in the mining industry alone is costing the White section of the population something like R6 per annum per head at present.</p>

<p>Accurate statistical data to show the loss of manpower as the result of pneumoconiosis are not available unfortunately but it is conservatively estimated that over the past 50 years the mining industry has lost more than 30,000 White workers as the result of pneumoconiosis while more than 300,000 Bantu workers have already contracted this disease.</p>

<p>It is clear therefore that this is a matter which continually deserves the serious attention of the Government and of this House.</p>

<p>Fortunately this matter also has its bright side and as far as the future is concerned there is reason to be optimistic. Our mining methods have improved so much during the past 50 years that the danger of pneumoconiosis, although it has not been eliminated and although the likelihood is that we shall never be able to eliminate it completely, has been reduced considerably.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this century the workers in the gold mines contracted miner&#x2019;s phthisis after an average service of only three years. The average period of service of miners who show the earliest symptoms of pneumoconiosis at the present time is between 23 and 25 years. Fifty years ago the average life expectation of the phthisis sufferer, after having contracted the disease, was less than two years. To-day we know that pneumoconiosis, where complications do not arise, does not cause death and that it probably does not diminish the life expectation of the pneumoconiosis sufferer.</p>

<p>The explanation for this is that the acute form of pneumoconiosis (massive fibrosis of the lung), which is caused by very high dust concentrations, very seldom occurs in this country to-day as the result of the improvement in dust-prevention measures. In addition to that, effective medical control is exercised over workers in the mining industry to-day and people with physical defects which may reduce their resistance to pneumoconiosis, are not allowed to work in mines where they are exposed to dust.</p>

<p>Equally good progress has been made on the medical side, and South Africa&#x2019;s achievements in this sphere are known to the whole world. The research that was undertaken by our old research workers like Drs. Simpson, Strachan (pronounced Strawhawn) and Mavrocordato, to mention just a few, to this day still forms the basis of modern knowledge with regard to the effect of silica dust on the lungs of the individual. The war years interrupted this research but since 1948 and particularly over the past six years medical research has again been undertaken intensively as a joint effort on the part of the Government and the mining industry. Intensive research is also being done in various other countries, amongst others England, Belgium, Germany, France and the U.S.A., and our knowledge in <span class="col_6603-6604" refersTo="page_0548"/>the medical sphere has increased enormously over the past ten years. As far as pneumoconiosis is concerned, it can be said that in this sphere too, as in all branches of medicine, our knowledge has increased enormously. Medical knowledge with regard to this disease and its effect on the human system has also made fantastic progress in recent times and we have reason to face the future with optimism.</p>

<p>After this brief outline of the background I want to confine myself now to the Bill which is before the House for consideration and I want to mention four reasons why it is necessary, only six years after the last comprehensive measure was passed by this House, to revise the existing legislation once again.</p>

<p>In the first place there are certain administrative problems which are being experienced in implementing the Pneumoconiosis Act of 1956, which have to be overcome. Secondly it has become necessary to revise certain scientific concepts on which that Act was based and to adapt them to the latest scientific knowledge. Thirdly, there are certain unsatisfactory aspects in connection with the financing of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund which have to be removed and rectified. Fourthly, it has become necessary to make certain adjustments in connection with the basis on which compensation is paid as well as in the scales of compensation.</p>

<p>I want to give hon. members an outline of this Bill under the aforementioned four heads, and let me say at once that the fact that this bulky measure is before the House to-day does not mean that the legislation of 1956 is wrong or ineffective. It still remains a very great improvement on the legislation that we had before that date. Since 1956, however, my Department has continued to make an intensive study of all the aspects which the Act embraces, and various missions have been sent overseas for this purpose. Research, as I have already indicated, has also made tremendous strides in the past few years and it would be an unforgiveable injustice towards mine-workers not to give them the benefit of the very latest knowledge. Indeed research would be useless if the results that it produces are not applied to the advantage of the workers and of the mining industry.</p>

<p>This Bill retains all the improvements brought about by the Act of 1956 and simply extends them.</p>

<p>I now come to administrative matters. In the practical implementation of the Act the definitions in the Act of 1956 of certain basic terms have been found inadequate and have given rise to administrative problems. The following definitions in particular have caused difficulties: Firstly, the definition of dusty atmosphere. The Act of 1956 declares certain places in and on mines in respect of all mines to be &#x201C;dusty atmosphere&#x201D; and other places may be so declared by the Minister. No distinction can be drawn between the various types of mines and between individual mines. What is dusty atmosphere at one mine is also dusty atmosphere at another mine. That is not fair towards the mines because it does not take into account the different mines and gives no recognition to individual mine-owners for their particular efforts to improve working conditions.</p>

<p>The definition is now being amended in such a way that no place in or on a mine will automatically be declared to be dusty atmosphere. The Minister will lay down by way of notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> which places in and on mines will be regarded as dusty atmosphere for the purposes of the Act and it will now be possible therefore to draw a distinction between various types of mines and even between individual mines.</p>

<p>This change will in no way detract from the medical control over workers and from their right to compensation. Certain occupations on certain mines where dust tests indicate that there is no danger of pneumoconiosis, can be thrown open in this way to persons who are unable to-day to pass the strict medical screening.</p>

<p>Secondly, I come to the terms &#x201C;mine&#x201D; and &#x201C;mining operation&#x201D;. The definitions of these terms are being brought into line with the definitions of the same terms in the Mines and Works Act, in the first place to bring about uniformity as far as the actions of my Department&#x2019;s various divisions are concerned, and, secondly, to bring about a clear demarcation between the fields which are covered by the Pneumoconiosis Act and the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, respectively. At present there is a certain amount of overlapping between these two Acts.</p>

<p>Thirdly I come to the term &#x201C;owner&#x201D; The definition of &#x201C;owner&#x201D; is being revised so as to facilitate the determination of the ownership of a mine. At the present time it is often practically impossible, with a view to the collection of levies, to determine with certainty who the owner of a mine is.</p>

<p>Then I come to the question of medical control over mine workers. There are still complaints that the examinations of the Pneumoconiosis Bureau are superficial and inadequate. This complaint has also been made by hon. members in this House from time to time.</p>

<p>To some extent this complaint is justified in view of the fact that the Bureau in conducting periodic examinations really confines itself only to the chest of the mine worker and does not carry out the clinical examination which is done in a hospital, for example. The position is that the periodic certificates which the Bureau issues are not certificates of general good health or of physical fitness for work. It is purely a certificate which indicates that the mine worker does not suffer either from tuberculosis or from pneumoconiosis in a stage which prevents him from continuing to work in a dusty atmosphere. It often happens therefore that periodic certificates are issued to people who, because of other ailments or physical defects, are entirely unfit for work of any character. Because the purpose of the Bureau&#x2019;s <span class="col_6605-6606" refersTo="page_0549"/>periodic certificate is wrongly interpreted, it often creates great dissatisfaction and lack of confidence in the efficiency of the Bureau and the capabilities of its medical staff.</p>

<p>This matter is being rectified therefore. In the future these periodic examinations will be full clinical examinations and periodic certificates will really be certificates of fitness for work in a dusty atmosphere. In the future then the Bureau&#x2019;s certificates will be called certificates of fitness.</p>

<p>The Bureau already has the power under the Act of 1956 to withdraw certificates. This power is being emphasized more pertinently in this Bill, and the object of that is that the Bureau should make use of it more often where it is clear that as the result of serious illness, continued employment in a mine may endanger the health of the person concerned or the safety of his fellow-workers. It goes without saying that this power will be exercised with the greatest circumspection to ensure that mine workers are not unnecessarily prejudiced.</p>

<p>When the Bureau carries out fuller examinations other ailments requiring treatment will also be brought to light more often. Unless such ailments are timeously treated, the object of these fuller examinations by the Bureau will be defeated. What is envisaged therefore is closer liaison between the Bureau and private medical practitioners and medical aid societies to ensure that diseases which require medical treatment are given the necessary attention timeously. The Bureau itself cannot, of course, prescribe the treatment.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might just say here that in spite of the criticism of the Bureau, which is frequently without foundation and often <i>mala fide</i>, the medical control that we exercise over workers in the mining industry is regarded as the best and held up as a model internationally. This Bill removes certain existing defects and further tightens up this control.</p>

<p>As far as Bantu labourers are concerned, one important change is being brought about. At the present time compulsory medical examinations are only compulsory for Bantu employed in a dusty atmosphere; workers employed on the surface are not examined.</p>

<p>The pre-employment examination and the regular periodic examination of working Bantu are aimed at tuberculosis in particular. It is found, however, that the control over and the prevention of tuberculosis is not as effective as it ought to be because workers employed on the surface who continually come into contact with underground workers, are not subjected to the same medical control. This defect is now being remedied and the same medical examinations are being made compulsory for Bantu workers employed on the surface.</p>

<p>I may also add that the control which the Bantu exercises over the medical examination of Bantu workers has been overhauled. There are still defects, however, and some mines are inclined to omit to fulfil their obligations properly. So we find that the use of miniature X-ray films are not always effective. This matter is, however, receiving attention and unless the necessary degree of effectiveness is achieved, I will not hesitate to have serious action taken to make it compulsory that even larger X-ray plates should be taken. In this connection I wish to repeat that tuberculosis is not an occupational disease. It is an ordinary contagious disease and it can be effectively combated if the sources of the contagion are effectively controlled. The whole object is to detect tuberculosis as early as possible so that treatment which is very effective to-day with our modern cures, can be commenced timeously. There cannot be effective control, however, if a large percentage of the workers are not subjected to regular medical examination. I view this matter in a very serious light and I will not hesitate to have serious action taken if the necessary effectiveness is not obtained under existing measures.</p>

<p><i>Certification of mine workers</i>: Hon. members will remember that in terms of the 1956 Act the function to certify mine workers for the purposes of compensation was taken away from the Bureau and transferred to an independent statutory committee known as the Certification of Pneumoconiosis Committee. The old Medical Silicosis Board of Appeal was abolished at the same time.</p>

<p>Except for the fact that the certifying committee has the right to revise its own findings either of its own accord or at the request of the aggrieved person, there is no machinery in existence at the present moment to appeal against the findings of the certification committee.</p>

<p>Various persons and bodies have been making representations from time to time for the re-introduction of the Appeal Board. Hon. members have also from time to time pleaded in this House for the re-introduction of a body of appeal.</p>

<p>This matter has received serious consideration and I am satisfied that a need does exist for some form of appeal or other. I cannot, however, agree to the re-introduction of a body of appeal which will itself be able to certify and reject or amend the findings of the primary certification body. Such a procedure always gives rise to friction between the two bodies and to the playing off of the one body against the other. The confidence which the mine worker has in either of the two bodies or in both is usually undermined as a result.</p>

<p>Another form of appeal has, therefore, been decided upon and the Bill provides for the introduction of a body of revision which will consist of not fewer than three and not more than four experienced medical men. This body will have the right, either of its own accord or at the request of the aggrieved person to revise the findings of the Certification Committee. This revision body will not have the right, however, to certify off its own bat or to set aside or amend the findings of the Certification <span class="col_6607-6508" refersTo="page_0550"/>Committee. In cases where it does differ from the findings of the Certification</p>

<p>Committee the relevant findings will be reconsidered at a joint sitting of the two bodies.</p>

<p>The introduction of this body meets a need, not only as far as the mine workers are concerned, but also as far as the Certification Committee is concerned. It creates the machinery whereby the work of the Certification Committee can be controlled and checked. This body will be able to do very useful work and I may say that its establishment has been generally welcomed, also by the Certification Committee itself.</p>

<p><i>Control over mines</i>: I am gratified to be able to say that great progress has already been made with the controlling of mines. Ten years ago the silicosis legislation of the day was only applicable to the big gold mines but in a short space of time of less than 10 years all the other important mines have been brought under control with the result that all gold mines, coal mines, diamond mines, copper mines, asbestos mines, chrome mines, tin mines, platinum mines and numerous other mines have already been declared to be controlled mines. Recently a great number of quarries have been declared controlled mines and we are actively proceeding to declare all mines and quarries where the possibility of contracting pneumoconiosis exists, controlled mines.</p>

<p>My Department has, however, encountered practical problems in the control of mines In terms of the 1956 Act I can declare any mine a controlled mine if I am satisfied that the workers in that mine have contracted pneumoconiosis or are likely to contract it. It is not always possible, however, to prove that the danger of pneumoconiosis exists in a particular mine on the strength of real cases of pneumoconiosis. The reason for this is that the results which are obtained by a medical survey can be influenced by a great many factors and even render them completely useless for practical purposes. For example, reliable conclusions can only be drawn from a medical survey if a sufficient number of persons have worked for an interrupted period of at least 20 years or longer in that particular mine. Where persons have been working in different mines, no reliable conclusions can be drawn.</p>

<p>Internationally it is accepted, however, that any dust containing at least 10 per cent free-silica constitutes a definite pneumoconiosis danger and will ultimately affect the health of the workers adversely. That is particularly the case where silica dust mixes with other kinds of dust. Silica has the peculiar effect of rendering harmful other kinds of dust which are apparently harmless by themselves.</p>

<p>This Bill now makes provision for the automatic control of all mines and all other mines in which the ore which is mined contains at least 10 per cent free-silica. Only in cases where the free-silica is less than 10 per cent will it still be necessary to try to prove by means of dust tests and medical surveys that a pneumoconiosis danger exists.</p>

<p>In this way practically all the mines in the Republic will automatically be controlled in view of the fact that there are very few mines with less than 10 per cent free-silica.</p>

<p>I can only say that the moment a mine is declared a controlled mine the dust prevention measures laid down by the Mines and Works Act and the regulations promulgated in terms thereof immediately become applicable to it. That immediately entitles all the workers in such a mine to compensation if they contract pneumoconiosis or tuberculosis and the workers immediately become subject to the medical control prescribed by the pneumoconiosis legislation. It is in the interests of the workers, therefore, that it is essential that every mine where the pneumoconiosis danger exists be declared a controlled mine and the changes which are contemplated in this Bill will considerably facilitate and expedite action by my Department.</p>

<p>No fundamental change is being made to the granting and the payment of compensation. As in the past the compensation will in each case be awarded by the General Council for Pneumoconiosis Compensation which will replace the existing Pneumoconiosis Council and be paid by the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Commissioner.</p>

<p>The compensation of the Board, is, however, being revised and amended. At the moment the Board consists of ten members of whom six are Public servants (except in the case of one they are all connected to the office of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Commissioner) and two are nominated by the mine owners and two are nominated by the mine workers.</p>

<p>The duties and powers of the council are clearly circumscribed, and as far as the compensation to be awarded is concerned the council has practically no discretion. It is not necessary, therefore to have so many Public Servants on the Council and except in the case of the Commissioner who is chairman of the council by virtue of his position they are being removed from the council and the new council will consist of not less than eight and not more than 12 members who will be nominated on an equal basis by the mine owners and the mine workers. The council, is, therefore. being made more representative of the mine workers on the one hand and of the mining industry on the other hand.</p>

<p>Apart from its present functions it is envisaged that the council will be able to serve as a co-ordinating body between the various mine and employee interests and will act as the mouthpiece of those interests in so far as matters concerning the administration of the pneumoconiosis legislation are concerned.</p>

<p>For the rest there are some minor administrative amendments in order to facilitate and expedite the granting and payment of benefits.</p>

<p><i>Basis of compensation</i>: One of the most important amendments proposed in this Bill <span class="col_6609-6610" refersTo="page_0551"/>is in connection with the basis on which compensation is paid for pneumoconiosis.</p>

<p>At the moment, for the purpose of compensation, pneumoconiosis is divided into four stages as follows based on the extent to which the ability to do physical labour has been impaired: first stage&#x2014;fit to do normal physical labour; second stage&#x2014;fit to do moderate physical labour; third stage&#x2014;fit to do any light physical labour; fourth stage&#x2014;unfit to do any physical labour.</p>

<p>The position is, however, that subjectively, physical labour and impairment of ability to perform physical labour are conceptions which are not circumscribed and which cannot be circumscribed.</p>

<p>As far as can be ascertained nowhere in the world is their clarity or agreement as to what these conceptions actually mean or as to what should be used as the yardstick in order to determine a person&#x2019;s physical ability to perform physical labour. There are so many factors which can influence the person&#x2019;s ability to perform physical labour. As for example, factors such as personal adaptation, proficiency, environment, working conditions, psychological orientation and approach, personal habits, social and economic disposition and many more, all of which can have an important effect on a person&#x2019;s ability to perform physical labour. In order to be able to determine to any degree of certainty the extent to which any one particular physical condition, pneumoconiosis in this case, has impaired the person&#x2019;s ability to perform physical labour, it will be necessary to determine the effect of each one of these additional or incidental factors and to leave it out of account. The doctor will have to know about all these things and he will also have to know what particular work each mine worker does and the extent of the physical exertion which will be required of a normal, healthy person of comparable age, physique etc., to perform that work.</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible to know all these things or to determine them and that is why loss of ability to work is a very unsatisfactory and unjust basis when it comes to determining the extent of the damage which a person has suffered and the compensation to be paid for such damage.</p>

<p>Pneumoconiosis is a lung disease which is caused by the inhalation of harmful dust and the damage which that causes is first of all impairment of his ability to breathe which in turn reduces his ability to exert himself physically, that is to say, his ability to do hard work. He must therefore, be compensated for the primary damage and not only for the ultimate results thereof.</p>

<p>The underlying reason for the dissatisfaction amongst so many mine workers and the criticism which is so often directed at the Pneumoconiosis Bureau is the determination and grading of the disability as a result of the loss of the ability to perform physical labour. I also want to admit that that dissatisfaction and criticism is justified to some extent. I want to state very clearly, however, that the reason for that is not, as is so often alleged, that the Bureau is incompetent or that it adopts an unsympathetic attitude but it is exclusively due to the unscientific avoid subjective basis on which that disability has to be determined. The doctors are expected to do things which they simply cannot do. The fault does not lie with them but with the legislation.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made everywhere to find a more correct and scientific basis on which to determine the inability. Here in our own country this matter has been receiving attention for many years and a great deal of research has already been done in this connection.</p>

<p>The impairment to the cardio-respiratory functions seems to offer the solution to the problem and that is why provision is made in this Bill for the determination and grading of the disability on the strength of the impairment to the cardio-respiratory functions.</p>

<p>Some of the greatest experts in this country and overseas have been consulted in regard to the question of taking the extent of the impairment to the heart and lung functions as a basis for determining the extent of the disability which is the direct result of pneumoconiosis and they are all agreed that not only is that a more scientific and objective approach but that it is also a more just approach as far as the worker is concerned. They are also agreed that with modem clinical methods which include tests of the lung functions, the impairment of the heart and lung functions can be tested very accurately to-day.</p>

<p>I wish to state very clearly that while it is essential to test the function of the lungs if you wish to use this as your basis, the certification and grading of pneumoconiosis will not take place on the strength of those tests alone. It is only an additional method which will be employed to augment the present clinical and radio logical methods.</p>

<p>The experiences of the specialist at his clinical examination, the result of the lung function tests, the industrial history and the radio logical diagnosis constitute the four important and essential requirements.</p>

<p>I also wish to state very clearly that the discretion of the certification committee is not in any way being curtailed or restrained. As a matter of fact more powers and freedom are being given to the committee so that it can come to a sound decision and judge each case on its merits.</p>

<p>For the purposes of compensation the impairment of the cardio-respiratory functions will be divided into three groups or grades, namely 20 per cent to 50 per cent, over 50 per cent to 75 per cent and over 75 per cent. A loss of less than 20 per cent of the ability to breath is regarded as normal and in future there will be only three compensative stages, each of which will carry a pension.</p>

<p>Some experts in the field of testing the lung function state that impairment of the ability <span class="col_6611-6612" refersTo="page_0552"/>to breathe can be as accurately assessed as 1 per cent. I do not for one moment doubt that it can indeed be done as accurately as that but for the purposes of the Bill that is not necessary in view of the fact that lung disability has been grouped into wide categories.</p>

<p>Let me also say that members of this House (Drs. Radford and Fisher) on various occasions pleaded for the grading of disability on the basis for which the Bill makes provision. The idea is therefore not new, but medical science had to make sure that it could apply reliable methods to measure this type of disability. For that reason missions were sent overseas, and a report was submitted to the effect that sufficient progress had been made during recent years to be able to establish it with certainty.</p>

<p>I now pass on to compensation. I have already said that in future there will be only three compensatory stages, for each of which a pension will be paid. The payment of the present benefit of a lump sum payment of R960 therefore falls away in the case of mine workers who have not previously been certified, and they are compensated for its loss by an increased pension in the future second and third pension stadia. Persons who have already received the lump sum payment of R960 retain the present pension scales, except for persons who are at present receiving the fourth-stage pension or who are at present in the third stage and who on re-classification are classed in the group above 75 per cent. In these cases an increase of R15 per month is granted. This increase is made possible by incorporating in the pension the present nursing allowance of R15. It amounts to this, that all present fourth-stage pensioners and all future pensioners in the group above 75 per cent disability will receive this nursing allowance by way of a pension.</p>

<p>The future first compensatory stage, i.e. the 20 per cent to 50 per cent group, carries the same pension as the present second stage and the future second compensatory stage, i.e. the group above 50 per cent to 75 per cent will receive an increase of R10 per month. A mine worker with a wife and one dependent child will then receive R64 per month instead of the present R54. The future third compensatory stage, i.e. the group above 75 per cent disability, receives an increase of R23 a month on the present fourth-stage pension.</p>

<p>The mine worker who at present receives a monthly pension of R50 in respect of himself will therefore receive a monthly pension of R65 if previously he had already received the lump sum payment of R960, and the miner who will no longer receive that benefit will receive a monthly pension of R73. The increase is given in respect of the miner himself, so that everybody will receive the same increase and the unmarried miner or the widower will share in the increased pensions to the same extent as those who are married. The pensions of the widows and dependent children of deceased pneumoconiosis sufferers are being increased in the case of a widow from R25.50 per month to R30 per month, and in the case of a child from R12.75 a month to R15 a month. These increases are being granted to all existing beneficiaries. The pensions of Coloureds are being adapted proportionately.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be desirable to give an indication here of the effect the new basis of certification will have on the benefits. Firstly, I want to say that it is not the object to grant a general increase in benefits. Those who really needed relief are the miners who are in the last stage and are completely unable to earn anything, and the dependants of deceased miners. Therefore basic increases are being granted only to fourth-stage pensioners and to widows and dependent children.</p>

<p>No reliable correlation exists between the impairment of the respiratory function and eventual loss of working capacity. Impairment of the respiratory function can be determined at an earlier stage than loss of earning capacity, so that the application of the new basis of determining and grading incapacity will have the effect that mine workers will reach the various compensatory stadia earlier. Viewed as a whole, this new basis will therefore redound appreciably to the benefit of mine workers.</p>

<p>In the third place, this new set-up now for the first time affords an effective linking up of pneumoconiosis as a disease and the primary damage it does to the human system. Now for the first time we are therefore succeeding in linking up the old concepts of silicosis and chest diseases as a comprehensive sickness entity in our legislation, and with the discretion being given to the certifying committee, which they must exercise to the benefit of the mine worker, every mine worker whose health has been affected by breathing in dust can be assured of just treatment. I am convinced that in this legislation we are following the right course, and I should like to give the House the assurance that my Department and my expert advisers will do everything in their power to ensure the just and sympathetic application of it.</p>

<p>In respect of compensation for tuberculosis, one important change is being made. At present the miner with more than ten years underground service receives the benefit of a lump sum payment of R960 and a pension equal to the pension payable for pneumoconiosis in the third stage. In this case the lump sum benefit is increased to R2,000, which will be paid out over a period of 12 months. The benefit of R1,500 for the mine worker with less than ten years service in a dusty atmosphere remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The pension for the mine worker who has worked more than 3,000 shifts in a dusty atmosphere lapses as a right, but in its place the discretion is granted to the General Council for Pneumoconiosis Compensation, where the mine worker after proper treatment is still permanently incapacitated as the result of tuberculosis, to pay a special allowance which depending on his financial circumstances, may be <span class="col_6613-6614" refersTo="page_0553"/>equal to the pension he would otherwise have received.</p>

<p>The emphasis is laid here on treatment and rehabilitation. Tuberculosis is not an industrial disease. It is an ordinary infectious disease which can be very effectively treated by modern methods. However, medical men throughout the world are agreed that the tuberculosis sufferer should never again be exposed to breathing in harmful dust, however successful his treatment may have been. There is, however, no justification for paying to the cured tuberculosis sufferer a pension for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The position is therefore now that the mine worker is put in the position of being able to rest and to receive treatment for 12 months without having any anxiety about his income. Thereafter, if as the result of the disease he still cannot earn sufficient, the necessary assistance can be given to him.</p>

<p>In regard to grants in connection with training, the amount made available as grants to beneficiaries in connection with the training of their dependants is being increased by R50,000, from R50,000 to R100,000 per annum, and in future this will also be used for university and university college education. Whereas this concession at present applies only to White mine workers, this assistance will now be granted to Coloureds also.</p>

<p>The amount of the grants which can be made in regard to burial expenses is being increased from R60 to R100. At the moment this assistance is available only to White mine workers, but in terms of this Bill Coloureds are now also being included. In their case the board can grant assistance up to R50.</p>

<p>In connection with compensation for persons who do not work in a dusty atmosphere, I just want to say this. In terms of the present Act, persons who contracted pneumoconiosis as the result of work on a mine which is not regarded as work in a dusty atmosphere, are excluded from benefits. The Bill makes provision for the payment of benefits for pneumoconiosis to all employees who have contracted pneumoconiosis as the result of their work in controlled mines, whether they work in a dusty atmosphere or not.</p>

<p>In so far as the conversion of part of the pensions concerned, I have already said that the benefit of a lump sum payment will not be granted in future. In order to meet the case of the mine worker who needs money for a justifiable purpose, and in order to obtain the funds for it, this Bill provides for the conversion of portion of his monthly pension (at most, half of it) for a period of at the most 24 months, into a lump sum payment.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that Bantu do not receive pensions but are removed from the mines at the very first signs of pneumoconiosis, the question of determing the degree of disability does not apply in their case. The basis of compensation in the case of Bantu is not being changed at all, and their compensation also remains unchanged.</p>

<p>In respect of the basis on which the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund is financed, drastic changes are being made. These changes particularly have reference to the apportionment of pneumoconiosis obligations between the State on the one hand and the mining industry on the other hand, and to the apportionment of the obligations of the industry between the various mines.</p>

<p>Here I may say that there are various aspects of the method according to which obligations are at present calculated and apportioned which are not satisfactory. That is so because in financing the fund pace was not kept with changed circumstances over the. past 40 years. The basis of financing to-day really differs very little from the basis laid down for it in the Act of 1919 and even before that. In the meantime the mining industry has expanded tremendously and great progress has been made in the scientific and technical sphere. These changed circumstances and increased technical and scientific knowledge should just as the progress made in the medical field from time to time has been incorporated in our legislation, also be acknowledged in our legislation when it comes to the financing of compensation and the apportionment of obligations. I shall try briefly to mention a few of the defects and to indicate how the Bill attempts to remedy them.</p>

<p>The Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund was established in 1911 in the form of the Old Miners Phthisis Fund, which was established by means of a contribution made by the State and an equal contribution which had to be collected from the mines. Out of this fund grants were made by the Old Miner&#x2019;s Phthisis Board to persons suffering from phthisis. In 1912 the fund was changed into the Miners Phthisis Compensation Fund, into which the State paid a further amount of R200,000 derived from certain accumulated funds derived from mining leases. The rest of the funds required were provided by way of levies on producing mines.</p>

<p>In 1916 the principle of scheduled mines was introduced and further amounts were paid into the Compensation Fund by the State. In 1919 the legislation was consolidated, and the legislation passed that year prescribed the basis on which the required funds had to be levied from the mines. The levy of each mine-owner for every period of three months was constituted as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>45 per cent of his levy was in proportion to the amount he had paid out in wages during the previous three months;</li>

<li>35 per cent of the levy was in proportion to his silicosis percentage, a factor which was calculated on the proportionate share of each mine of the total employment of persons who were certified during a specified period; and</li>

<li><span class="col_6615-6616" refersTo="page_0554"/>20 per cent of his levy was in proportion to his taxable income for the previous financial year.</li>

</ol>

<p>Under this Act certain fines for contraventions in terms of the Mines and Works Act, which would otherwise have been credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, were paid into the Miners Phthisis Compensation Fund. The 1919 Act also introduced the principle of outstanding liability. Every mine which closed down had, on its closing, to pay over to the fund an amount equal to three-sevenths of the total amount which it had paid by way of levy during the seven years before its closing down. Mines therefore had to make provision in advance for these moneys which they had to pay into the Miners Phthisis Compensation Fund at the time they closed down. In terms of the 1925 legislation, security for these funds could be demanded from the mines to ensure that a mine would be able to meet its liabilities at the time it closed down. Security was accepted in the form of a trust fund, and this trust fund which still exists contains an amount of R18,519,658. When a mine closes down its share in the trust fund is paid over to the compensation fund. In 1946 the legislation was amended again and benefits were also increased.</p>

<p>Unlike in the case of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, increases under the pneumoconiosis legislation are awarded not only in respect of future beneficiaries but the increases are also granted to all persons who have already received benefits. This concession then has the effect that every time benefits are increased, retrospective outstanding liability is created. The increase in benefits granted in 1946 created a retrospective outstanding liability of R16,000,000 and the mines became liable for the full amount. In 1950 benefits were again increased and in respect of existing beneficiaries an additional retrospective liability of R18,000,000 was created. This was also debited to the mines. The additional outstanding liability created by the 1946 Act is being repaid by the mines to the compensation fund on the basis of taxable income, and the final installment is due in 1965. The 1950 additional outstanding liability is being paid in equal annual installments over a period of 20 years, and the last payment is due in 1971. Up to 1965 the gold mines, in respect of these two liabilities, must pay an annual amount of R1,951,446, or almost R2,000,000, and thereafter. until 1971, they must pay R1,077,830 every year. As at 31 March 1961, the mines, in respect of these two items, still owed R16,077,816, and together with the 1925 outstanding liability the mines at that date still owed an amount of R34,597,474 to the compensation fund. Of this amount, however, R18,519,658 has already been made available to the trust fund, so that they still have to pay R16,077,816. The 1946 outstanding liability is apportioned amongst the existing mines on the basis of taxable income, which means that only those mines which have a taxable income meet this liability. The repayment of this liability therefore has no relation to the share which every mine had in its creation. In this way the burden of one mine is placed on another, and even mines which started development after 1 August 1946, the date on which that liability became due, and now already have a taxable income, are held responsible for meeting that liability in which they have no share. This is most unfair towards such mines.</p>

<p>The basis on which the 1950 outstanding liability is divided amongst the various mines again has the effect that the older mines bear the heaviest burden in that regard. In the apportionment of the 1946 liability no scientific basis is applied to determine the share of every mine in that debt, whilst in the apportionment of the 1950 liability again, factors applied which cannot be justified scientifically. In general it amounts to this, that there is an inequitable and unjust apportionment of obligations, and that the liabilities of one mine are shifted on to another. However, I want to state clearly that the mines are not to be blamed for this. It is due to a defect in the previous legislation. In 1956 the benefits were once more increased and again a retrospective outstanding liability of R18,400,000 was created in respect of existing beneficiaries. Of this amount R13,800,000 was in respect of mines which were then still in existence, and R4,600,000 in respect of mines which had already closed down.</p>

<p>The Government realized that it was unreasonable to burden mines from time to time with large additional liabilities in respect of the retrospective increase of benefits, and particularly to burden existing mines with obligations which are really incurred in respect of mines which have already closed down. For that reason the Government decided to accept that liability and also to accept the additional outstanding liability created by the 1946 and the 1950 Acts in respect of mines which had then already been closed. This liability was calculated at R3,400,000, so that the State in 1956 accepted a total debt of R21,800,000 in respect of the gold mines. This liability is being paid at the rate of R1,000,000 per annum, and the State therefore at the moment still owes R20,106,629.</p>

<p>As the mines continue to develop, the workers are continually being exposed to dust. The total obligations of the compensation fund are estimated every year up to 31 March. Provision must therefore also be made from time to time for further damage caused to the health of the workers by dust and which will only later become apparent in the form of pneumoconiosis. Provision is made for this further damage by way of current levies on the mines. The mines obligations therefore consist of two elements, i.e. outstanding liabilities and current levies.</p>

<p>Levies are paid in quarterly installments, and in apportioning the payments between the various mines two factors are taken into consideration, namely the number of shifts worked in the previous quarter and the silicosis rate. I have already pointed out that the application <span class="col_6617-6618" refersTo="page_0555"/>of the silicosis rate in apportioning the obligation has the effect that the older mines are taxed more heavily than the newer mines. I also stated that that factor is not based on scientific principles.</p>

<p>The debt of the State was calculated once in 1956 and thereafter remained a constant factor for purposes of assessing the assets of the fund. The 1956 Act makes no provision for a recalculation of the State&#x2019;s liability, whilst surpluses which were declared as the result of valuations of the fund since then indicate that it was probably calculated at too high a rate. Whilst the whole liability, therefore, assists in creating a surplus in the fund on such a valuation, the State receives only a proportionate amount of the surplus of that portion of the liability of mines which have closed down, and not of its total liability.</p>

<p>This is a defect in the 1956 Act, and unless it is remedied it will eventually have the effect that the State will pay more than it should really have paid. The Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund has therefore been built up through the meeting of their liabilities by the mines; by the payment of current levies by the mines; by payments made by the State to the old Miners&#x2019; Phthisis Fund, and by payment of the liabilities which the State accepted in 1956. Apart from other additional reasons, the State therefore has a direct interest in the manner in which the compensation fund is financed, and because the obligations in respect of pneumoconiosis compensation are regarded as operational expenses for purposes of taxation, the State also has an interest in the way in which those obligations are apportioned between the mines.</p>

<p>In the short survey I have given, I have pointed to two important defects in the present basis of financing of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund. In the first place, there is the inequitable apportionment of obligations amongst the mines. That applies to outstanding liabilities and also to current levies. In the second place, there is the fact that the liability of the State cannot be re-calculated and that possibly inaccurate calculations cannot be remedied.</p>

<p>The Bill now tries to remedy these defects by way of an apportionment of the obligations to the fund between the State on the one hand and the mines on the other hand. Together with this apportionment of obligations, there will also be an apportionment of the assets of the fund between the State and the mine and a new basis for the apportionment of the collective obligations of the mines amongst the various mines.</p>

<p>At the time of the last valuation of the fund, i.e., as at 31 March 1961, the assets of the compensation fund in respect of Group A mines was R111,095,097. These assets include cash to the amount of R56,607,797, an amount of R34,597,474, which the mines still owed the fund, and an amount of R19,889,644 which the State still owed the fund. The actual obligations of the fund then amounted to R106,754,200, and there was therefore an accumulated surplus of R4,340,897 which still had to be repaid to the mines. This surplus consists of excess levies collected from the mines and which has to be repaid to them.</p>

<p>The Bill now proposes that the fund should be divided into three separate accounts, namely an A Account for Group A mines, a B Account for Group B mines, and a C Account for the State obligations. The A and B Accounts which will be financed by the mines will be responsible for the payment of benefits to all future beneficiaries, and the C Account, for which the State will be responsible, will be used for the payment of benefits to all existing beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The Bill also provides for a recalculation of the obligations of the fund and the apportionment thereof to the three separate accounts will take place on the basis of the recalculated obligations. Consequently I cannot at this stage give hon. members a reliable indication of the obligations with which each account will be debited.</p>

<p>I want to state clearly that there is no idea of relieving either the mines or the State of any of the obligations they have accepted. If on a recalculation of the obligations of the fund it is found that those obligations in the past were calculated at too high a rate, there will of course be some measure of relief for the mines and perhaps also for the State. These recalculations can, however, only be made after the coming into operation of the proposed legislation, and I can therefore give no indication of what the position will be. It may even be that the obligations are increased as the result of such recalculation. However, I trust that this will not be the case.</p>

<p>The apportionment of the cash assets of the fund will be done on the basis of the recalculated obligations, and the amount which will go to the C Account, i.e., the State&#x2019;s account, is the difference between the recalculated obligations in respect of existing beneficiaries and the recalculated amount of the liability of the State. When the cash in its account is exhausted, the State will provide the funds which will be required from time to time to pay the benefits and other allowances to persons who have to be compensated from the State account. The obligations of the State are therefore simply being postponed, and the State is not exonerated from meeting them.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the mines accept responsibility for all persons who are certified for the first time after the coming into operation of this legislation. These obligations consist of two elements or factors. In the first place, there are the estimated obligations in respect of working miners or possible damage which they have already suffered and which is still latent, in other words, which may still become apparent in future in the form of certifiable pneumoconiosis. This damage already done will be calculated up to the date on which the legislation comes into force, and the amount so determined, less the cash credited to the A mines in the A Account from the cash assets of the compensation <span class="col_6619-6620" refersTo="page_0556"/>fund, will then constitute the collective outstanding liability of Group A mines.</p>

<p>In the second place, provision has to be made for damage suffered by persons employed in the mines after the coming into operation of this Bill. Provision for that will be made by way of levies on the mines from time to time. The outstanding liability of a mine will be payable when it closes down. The Bill therefore provides that mine-owners must provide security for their outstanding liability to ensure that they will be able to meet that liability when it becomes due. The intention is to accept the existing trust fund as security. Depending on the amount of the outstanding liabilities as determined on the date this Bill comes into operation, they will have to supplement the trust fund until it is sufficient to cover their liabilities.</p>

<p>The mines are therefore relieved of payments in respect of outstanding liability in terms of the existing Act, but as against that, they accept the recalculated outstanding liability. The difference, however, is that the present debt liability to be met on definite dates, whereas the payment of the recalculated liability can be stretched over the whole expected lifetime of the mine. Those mines which do not have sufficient funds in the trust fund to cover their liability can make their payments in smaller installments over a longer period, and in this way relief can be granted to certain mines.</p>

<p>The same recalculation of obligations will also be made in respect of Group B mines. The difference, however, is that most Group B mines have already fully met their outstanding liability under the existing Act. That is taken into account. Mines which still have liabilities, however, will still owe that money, so that viewed as a whole the position of the Group B mines will not be affected by the apportionment of the fund.</p>

<p>The recalculation of the obligations of the mines will of course result in a re-apportionment of those obligations, and that will remedy a further serious anomaly in the present set-up.</p>

<p>The basis envisaged for the re-apportionment of the re-calculated liabilities is a single factor, namely the shifts worked over a given period of, say, ten years. The tariff per shift will therefore be the same for all gold mines, and every mine will then be responsible for its fair share of the re-calculated debts. The shifting of obligations from one mine to another which can take place under the present system, and which in fact is also the basis for the legal provisions, then becomes impossible. This re-apportionment of obligations should afford considerable relief to the older marginal mines, and it is even possible that their lives may be prolonged to some extent as a result.</p>

<p>A change is made also in respect of the apportionment of current levies. At present the levies on the mines are apportioned on a basis which depends on factors which are not scientific and which once again have the effect of taxing the older mines more heavily than the never mines. These factors presuppose that the older mines cause more pneumoconiosis than the newer mines. There is, however, no accepted scientific grounds for such a supposition. It is known to science that whilst dust is the basic cause of pneumoconiosis, there are many other factors which play a role in the contraction and development of the disease. Some of these factors are, e.g., the composition of the dust, the density of concentration of dust, changes in temperature, air pressure, depth, the presence of harmful gases and the efficacy of the ventilation, etc. These factors can differ from mine to mine, and therefore from the scientific viewpoint it is wrong to accept that the danger of contracting pneumoconiosis is equally great in all mines, or that a particular mine is more dangerous simply because it is older than another.</p>

<p>A basic principle of insurance is that premiums are based on risk, and particularly is that so in the case of accident insurance. The employer with the highest accident risk pays the highest premium in respect of his employees. The Bill therefore provides for the application of this principle in connection with the apportionment of levies between the various mines. In order to determine the pneumoconiosis risk of each mine on a scientific basis, the Bill provides for the establishment of an expert technical committee and the apportionment of levies will take place on the basis of the risk that committee decides on in respect of each mine; i.e. the tariff per shift worked which the mine-owner has to pay as part of his levy will be determined by the pneumoconiosis risk determined for his mine, taking into consideration all the factors which can affect that risk. That will therefore encourage mine-owners to improve working conditions and to eliminate factors which are likely to increase the pneumoconiosis risk in their mine. The acceptance by the State in 1956 of certain obligations has made it possible to increase the pensions of beneficiaries who were already at that time receiving pensions. The increase in the fourth-stage pension for persons who are already in receipt of pensions, and the increase in the pensions for widows and the dependent children of deceased beneficiaries will, it is estimated, cost approximately R8,000,000, and it gives me pleasure to announce that the Government has again decided to shoulder this burden, thereby ensuring that all widows and orphans who are now in receipt of pensions, as well as all existing beneficiaries who are already receiving the present fourth-stage pension or may in future become entitled to it, will benefit from the increases granted by this Bill.</p>

<p>There are numerous improvements of a lesser nature which I cannot mention here fully. I want to give the assurance, however, that this Bill is the product of intensive research, study and investigation during the past six years. Ample provision is being made for further research and study within the framework of this legislation, and I want to give the assurance that adaptations will be made whenever and wherever they may be <span class="col_6621-6622" refersTo="page_0557"/>considered necessary. Fortunately that is a matter of administration and of judicious application. and such adaptations will not require amendments of the legislation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that this Bill is being submitted as an agreed measure between my Department, the mining industry and the mining trade unions. Mr. Speaker, I move.</p></speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to say at once that, knowing that the Minister is leaving, one can understand that there is a measure of urgency about the passing of this Bill, but I would like to say that I think it is most regrettable, notwithstanding that this is a measure agreed to between the Government and the workers concerned and the Chamber of Mines, that there has not been more adequate time to study the measure, which is one of very great importance. The Minister has just told us that it is an agreed measure, but I think you will agree that some of the unions concerned have not had an opportunity of seeing the Bill. They know that the details have been agreed upon, but they have not seen the way in which the agreement to which they have come have been expressed in the legislation. I hope that the Minister in those circumstances will appreciate that there is clearly a duty, not only on this side of the House but also on hon. members opposite, to study this legislation carefully. I am glad to say that the hon. members on this side of the House have had the opportunity to study it to some extent, and I would like to express my thanks to the Minister for making it possible for Professor Oosthuizen and some of the officials to be at the disposal of hon. members on this side of the House who have a great deal of experience of pneumoconiosis to make a careful study of the Bill. It has helped a great deal, but I do hope it will be possible on future occasions to come earlier with legislation of this kind. Here is one of the most vital pieces of legislation on the Statute Book, the sort of thing which I believe should go to a Select Committee and be the subject of evidence, to give all sides of the House the fullest opportunity of making certain that we are putting the right legislation on the Statute Book. But we appreciate the particular problems which exist at present and we believe that this is a good step forward and accordingly we do not wish to be unduly difficult about the matter.</p>

<p>I would like to say at once that the figures quoted by the hon. the Minister of the immense sums which have been paid out over the years in respect of miners&#x2019; phthisis or pneumoconiosis since the first legislation was put on the Statute Book, are most impressive. But I think the Minister would be the first to agree with me that even that compensation has by no means compensated those to whom we owe so much, the persons who have produced the wealth, who have done the job of digging out the gold in the mines, or the suffering they have had to bear throughout the years, and which has been shared by the members of their families. For them we have the utmost sympathy. It is a subject for great satisfaction to us all that there has been immense improvement in the conditions on the mines. Knowledge has been gained over the years, and the incidence and rapidity with which phthisis has advanced has been cut down enormously. That is all to the good, and no doubt with further research, and with the advantage we have of being one of the leading countries in the world in this respect, and with the benefit of the enormous strides which have been made in other countries, I hope it will be possible in the years to come to cut down even further the incidence of this dread disease, which is one of the most unpleasant occupational diseases from which one can suffer. Those of us who come from the Rand and who have friends among the people who have suffered realize just what that suffering means. As the Minister stated, this is a long road. It goes back to 1902, under Lord Milner, when the first steps were taken. There was an original Act and 17 amending Acts, and all parties have shared in the gradual advance in the efficacy of our legislation in this regard and the relief which it has been possible to grant to those suffering from this dread disease. I repeat that we all owe a great debt of gratitude to the miners who have taken this risk and who have played such a tremendous part in building up this country. At the same time I would like to pay a tribute also to the mine owners who have always been prepared to make available what was required, and tremendous sums of money have of course been provided, and we know that the money provided by the State has unquestionably been paid out of the funds which the State are paying from the mines. So really the whole of the payments made came from the mines.</p>

<p>I would like to say that this is a grand day for this side of the House. We have been pleading for some years now for the institution of an appeal board or a board of review of some kind. I think it is two years ago that the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor promised that such a board would be instituted, and it is a source of the greatest satisfaction to those of us who have raised this matter with the Minister and his predecessors over the years. I know that our representations in this regard were very well received by the Minister&#x2019;s immediate predecessor, but I would remind the Minister that on an occasion this matter was raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), who ever since he came to this House has constantly raised this matter of pneumoconiosis. As one who has had great experience of the medical side of pneumoconiosis, we all owe him a great debt of gratitude for having done that, but it was he who was told by the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor before the last one that he did not know what he was talking about when he said it was necessary to have a board of review or an appeal board in some form or other. I am glad that this Minister has faced the position. I want to say that I am by no means convinced that the <span class="col_6623-6624" refersTo="page_0558"/>particular method which has been adopted will prove to be the best method. I realize fully the difficulties of putting one medical board there as a board of appeal from another medical board, but in the law we also have one set of Judges hearing appeals from another set of Judges. All I would say is that this board of review is very much welcomed. It will be watched with great interest, and it is hoped that it will solve the problem satisfactorily. Let us hope that that will be so, because obviously if it functions in this form it will satisfy everybody, particularly the medical profession who are concerned with the matter and who deal on the board itself with the matter of compensation, and the percentage of disability. We are now told that on the new basis which is proposed, and which we support&#x2014;the hon. member for Rosetten-ville has been pleading for something like this for years&#x2014;it will now be possible to assess the degree of disability to within 1 per cent. I would like to say that I wonder&#x2014;it is only a thought but I believe it is something which we should bear in mind for the future&#x2014;whether it is right that the first stage should be from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, the second stage from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, and the third over that figure. It means that the person who has 20 per cent disability is compensated to some extent, and one can understand that the work that man can do has not become less, nor has his earning capacity. But I believe we must not regard this as the final word on the matter. I believe that the bureau should watch very carefully indeed&#x2014;and I am sure the unions will watch it&#x2014;whether in fact the basis of division which is proposed for the future and which is incorporated in this Bill is the correct basis on which to work.</p>

<p>The other thing I would like to say here is that we all know that prevention is better than cure, and although immense strides have been made I know that neither the mines nor the unions will be prepared to leave it at that. Although I believe that we have reached very near to the ultimate in the gold mines, in respect of the newer fields in which there is pneumoconiosis, it is my belief that we have a long way to go before the preventive measures are as effectual as they are at present in the case of the gold mines. I believe that much research will be required there.</p>

<p>The Minister has referred to the fact that there is a completely new approach, and to the importance of the four clinical examinations. and the fact that compensation is to be based on the four factors mentioned by him. We will watch that with very close interest. I believe all will agree that it is right that the provisions of the law should be extended to those fields where in fact there has been pneumoconiosis in various forms, and which have not up to the present fallen within the purview of the law. I think the Minister will agree that there have undoubtedly been cases where miners have suffered great injustices in the past. I remember two years ago drawing the attention of this House to an investigation which had taken place and a paper which was presented by one who had made a close study of the matter and who suggested that there were grave injustices in regard to the particular stages allotted to people, and which indicated that a change was necessary. Let us hope that the steps now being taken will eliminate that.</p>

<p>I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister in his reply would say a little more in regard to the Bantu mine workers, because he referred to them very briefly. I could not gather why no change whatever is being made in their case. No doubt there is a good reason for it, but it would be of great interest to the House to know from the Minister why no change has been proposed there. From the few words expressed on the subject by the Minister, I could not understand what the reason was.</p>

<p>The financing of these measures has been very carefully considered, and I take it that when the Minister tells us that the Chamber of Mines is in full agreement with this measure that means there have been consultations in regard to all these technical details. Certainly we in this House are not qualified to judge of that, but if they are satisfied then obviously all sides of the House will be satisfied. I am very glad to hear from the Minister that some of the older mines will be relieved and that possibly in the case of some of the marginal mines this will extend their lives, but I wonder whether this is going far enough. It is my belief that it is of the utmost importance that the marginal mines on the Rand, and particularly on the East Rand, should be kept in production for as long as possible. It is quite clear that until considerable additional industrialization has taken place there must be an economic recession in those areas when some of these mines cease producing. I believe that his step the Government is taking is one in the right direction, but I wonder whether the time has not come that the Government could undertake some of the responsibility for keeping some of these mines in production for a longer period, because they are of course adding to the wealth of the country by remaining in production and producing additional gold which is of immense value to the country. I believe that while the steps now taken will provide some relief, I will be glad to know that the Government is doing everything possible to extend the lives of these marginal mines for as long as possible, and at least until such time as industrial development in the areas concerned will enable those areas to continue as prosperous parts of the country, notwithstanding the fact that those mines have gone out of production. We welcome this Bill and look forward to seeing it on the Statute Book, and I again express the hope that the Government will keep in the closest touch with the position and watch what, after all, is an experiment. I am quite sure the Bureau will watch it, and I hope there will be a full report to this House next year when the Minister&#x2019;s <span class="col_6625-6626" refersTo="page_0559"/>Vote comes under discussion, or possibly even before that, as to whether the conclusion has been reached that this is the best solution for these problems. I would express the hope that when legislation of this sort is under consideration in future and is rushed, as this Bill is being rushed&#x2014;and I say this whilst fully appreciating what the Minister has done to assist the Opposition&#x2014;if we could have been made aware at an earlier stage that such legislation was under consideration, I think it would have been possible for all of us on all sides of the House to qualify ourselves very much better to discuss the Bill when it came along. I believe that could have been done. I say that, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has been helpful in regard to the matter, for which I have already thanked him. The Minister can therefore rest assured that whilst we do not wish to see this Bill rushed through the House, we will help to ensure that it becomes part of our legislation this Session still.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) for his very objective and realistic approach to this Bill. I fully agreed with him when he said that it was a very good step forward. There are certain other points on which I agree with him, and those points will become evident during the course of my speech. I congratulate the hon. member on this type of speech, in comparison with the speech he made here a few days ago. [Interjections.] Sir, the Minister has given us a very detailed analysis of this Bill and I wish to congratulate the Minister on the Bill. I am fully aware of the considerable part which his predecessor played in regard to this Bill, and I therefore wish to extend our appreciation to this Minister, as well as to his predecessor, for what they have done in this respect. On behalf of the mine workers and their dependants, I express my thanks and appreciation to the Minister as well. This is once more proof of the fact that this Government is always conscious of the importance of the mines and the mine workers and their families in the development of our country. This Bill is the result of hard work, constructive thought, wide and thorough research and intensive study, and this was done by the Minister, his Department and his advisers, and I wish to convey to him, too. our appreciation for what they have done. Allow me, Sir, to state that our mining industry is still playing, as in the past, a very important part in the economic life and structure of our country. No other industry in South Africa has done more to bring stability to our economy and to contribute so much towards making our Republic known in the outside world. Apart from being one of the most important sources of our national income, I think our gold mining industry is the largest single employer of White and non-White labour in this country. I want to remind hon. members that it is the employee who is responsible for keeping the industry going, and the fact that we have this Bill to-day is a matter of national importance&#x2014;the fact that we want to protect the interests of those who contribute so much to the economic stability of our country. There are, of course, certain social and human considerations which must be taken into account. One of these is the fact that we cannot allow a wastage of manpower, especially skilled White man power. In the second place, we cannot allow a wastage of human lives; that is most important. Therefore I welcome the protection which this Bill intends to give to the mine worker. We have come a very long way since the days at the beginning of this century when gold mining was one of the most hazardous occupations in the world. Since then science, especially medical science and technology, have made tremendous progress and have made a considerable contribution towards reducing the hazards of gold mining. Dust, however, is still the most important hazard to which the gold miners are subjected, and it is necessary for us therefore to take the necessary legislative and other steps from time to time to protect the workers against this hazard, and to revise from time to time the arrangements which exist for the payment of compensation to those unfortunate mine workers who have succumbed to the effect of this hazard. The enactment in 1956 of the present Pneumoconiosis Act marked the beginning of a new era in fighting this disease. It also introduced a new era in our approach to this disease and in the question of compensation for this disease. This 1956 Act brought about considerable improvement and removed certain unsatisfactory features of the previous legislation. I am grateful, however, that this matter was not left there and that in the past six years, energetic efforts have resulted in this Bill, which brings about substantial improvements for our mine workers in general. What is most important&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014;is the fact that this Bill puts into effect the latest scientific knowledge of pneumoconiosis, and secondly this Bill puts into effect the recommendations made by the Allen Commission of Inquiry, the Beyer&#x2019;s Commission of Inquiry and of the Oosthuizen Departmental Committee of Inquiry. Sir, I am no scientist but I have full confidence in our scientists, and especially after having studied this Bill I have full confidence in the scientists who have advised the hon. the Minister. I am satisfied as a layman that this more scientific approach to this involved question of certification of pneumoconiosis and classification of disability, will benefit the mineworker and will do nothing else. I do not plead for compensation where compensation is not due. What I do plead for. however, is for compensation for the miner who has suffered irreparable harm to his health through the inhalation of dust. That is the miner who needs assistance. I therefore welcome this more objective and scientific method which this Bill provides for the determination of the <span class="col_6627-6628" refersTo="page_0560"/>degree of harm suffered by the miner. I have no doubt that impairment of the function of the respiratory system is primarily caused by this disease, and that from a legal point of view it is an infinitely better and more equitable basis on which to award compensation instead of the out-dated subjected concept of impairment of capacity for manual work, which is not only a secondary but often a delayed effect of the disease and of the primary damage. We all know that science is at man&#x2019;s service, and if science can assist us to ensure a more just treatment for those who actually need assistance and, for the sake of justice, for those who risk their health in the service of their country, then this Bill must be welcomed. A considerable amount of public money is spent annually on pneumoconiosis research. The Government took the lead in 1956 to establish this pneumoconiosis research unit, and the Government would be failing in its duty if it did not put into effect the result of that research. I think it is a responsibility of the Government towards the public and towards the miners to make full use of the details and the knowledge gained through that research. I am pleased to be able to say that the Government has not neglected its duty in this respect and has taken the lead here once again.</p>

<p>This Bill provides for better medical control over workers in our mines, and for the first time the Pneumoconiosis Bureau will fulfil its duty as the guardian of the health of our mine workers. This is a very great improvement and I welcome it wholeheartedly. Although this Bill does not provide for basic and general increases&#x2014;it makes no provision for that and I do not accept it as a basic aim of this Bill&#x2014;certain substantial relief is given to those who most need relief. And who are they? The people who most need relief are those severely incapacitated miners, their widows and their dependants, and this new basis of certification will benefit the miners in general, so that a large number of our miners will be re-certified and re-classified into more advanced stages of disability. That is my firm belief and it was confirmed to me by the experts and the scientists. The fact that the Government has undertaken to bear the burden of the immediate increase in the pension of the existing beneficiaries is further proof of the Government&#x2019;s sympathy for the victims of pneumoconiosis and their dependants. While I support this Bill I want to plead with the Minister to ensure that the law is applied sympathetically, with discretion and with equity. Sir, a good law can be rendered ineffective by bad administration and through lack of facilities. I have no doubt that the Minister will do everything in his power to ensure just administration. I want to plead with him to make adequate facilities available to the Bureau to fulfil its dutites in the best traditions of medical science for the benefit of those who need assistance. If that does not happen and if, the necessary facilities are not made available, it may lead to injustices. This Bill makes provision for research into the prevention of pneumoconiosis and for the treatment of persons suffering from that disease. Prevention, as we know, is better than cure. We know also that compensation is no remedy for an incurable disease. No person can be adequately compensated for permanent and irreparable loss of his health. The emphasis&#x2014;and I repeat, the emphasis&#x2014;should therefore be placed not on compensation but on prevention of the disease. We know that where there is no dust there can be no pneumoconiosis. Dust prevention and extraction have become more and more efficient in the course of the last few years, but in spite of that miners still contract pneumoconiosis. It is doubtful whether dust prevention will ever become so effective that pneumoconiosis will disappear completely from our mines. Other preventative measures will therefore have to be found, and every possibility should be thoroughly investigated. One such possibility, as the scientists and experts tell me, appears to be the use of aluminium therapy. It appears that in animal experimentation its value as a deterrent has been proved, but that sufficient controlled experiments, as far as human beings are concerned, have not been completed and carried out. This was used in Canada and in Australia for some time, I am informed. I know, however, that for such tests we have better facilities in this country than anywhere else in the world, and I appeal to the Minister to have this matter thoroughly investigated and studied. If there is a slight possibility that the development of pneumoconiosis can be prevented in the early stages or that it can be delayed to some extent or that the process of incapcitation can be delayed, then the miners are entitled to a thorough investigation of this matter.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the question of the treatment of miners suffering from pneumoconiosis. One is aware of the fact that pneumoconiosis is regarded as an incurable disease. Medical science has not yet found a cure for it. It appears also that there is not much hope that a cure will ever be found. It is known, however, that certain complicating conditions can be treated and that at least some relief can be given to the pneumoconiosis sufferer by adequate treatment of those complications. Responsibility towards the miner does not end with the award of compensation. The object should be to assist the miner to remain in his job as long as possible. Compensation can never compensate a miner for the irreparable loss of his health and his livelihood. It is a fact that some miners who are known to me spend a considerable part of their pensions on medical care and medical treatment. I therefore plead with the Minister to establish some organized scheme for the treatment of persons suffering from pneumoconiosis, and I do hope that the Minister will make use of the powers given to him in this Bill to establish such an organization for the treatment of persons suffering from this serious and this historical disease.</p></speech>

<from><span class="col_6629-6630" refersTo="page_0561"/>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>There is nothing that I can quarrel with in the speech which has just been delivered by the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling), and I am very pleased to say that he is at last seeing this disease as we have been seeing it for many years. The importance of this measure before the House can best be demonstrated by putting it in its correct perspective. We must look upon this disease as following upon the employment of approximately 50,000 White people on our mines and 300,000 Bantu. These are the people who work on the surface and go underground and extract from the bowels of the earth 17,000,000 to 18,000,000 ounces of gold a year valued at R500,000,000 per annum, apart from the coal and the other minerals which are brought to the surface by others employed in the mining industry. The hon. the Minister of Mines knows better than I do how important this industry is to our economy. We are told in the Year Book that South Africa&#x2019;s greatest source of foreign exchange and its principal attraction for overseas investors are our gold mines and our mining industry as a whole. The mining industry has raised &#x2026;346,000,000, and out of its profits it has contributed a further &#x2026;124,000,000, making a total during the years of &#x2026;470,000,000. That is the amount of money that is coming into our country through our gold-mining industry. I am very tempted, Sir, to quote to you from Hansard this evening what the hon. the Minister of Mines said to me in 1958 when I dared to bring up this subject of pneumoconiosis. I am very tempted to read out what the hon. member for Krugersdorp said to me, but seeing that he is here and the then Minister of Mines is not here, I think I should quote just one small extract. When I spoke about the necessity for some sort of appeal, which was the least of the important matters that I dealt with at the time, this is what the hon. member said in referring to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should say now that the things for which he pleaded here are nothing but eye-wash, to use a good English expression. What does he want an Appeal Board for now? An Appeal Board was necessary in the past and in the time of the United Party when you had a Bureau which was frustrating the Act.</block>

<p>I just read that out to show that for political reason very often members on both sides of the House but more so on that side say things for wish they are not altogether responsible and which they have to swallow very bitterly later on. I think Hansard is one of the most dangerous documents that we have here from the point of view of those hon. members.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister at that time was most annoyed with me because I had dared to disagree with his findings. He was so enamoured with his Act at the time, that he said that it was a model Act for the world to use and that there was no room for improvement in it. I think that was the sentiment that he expressed. Sir, I do want to take this opportunity, however now, of saying that I have no words to express adequately the admiration that I have for those people behind the scenes who have done so much in the past six years in preparing this measure. I think all of us and particularly the mine workers and the controllers of mines and the investors in the mining industry should be very grateful to those people, because to my mind this Bill does two things. In the first place it protects the individual who works in the mines, and it protects the individual who invests his money in mining ventures. That is the first group of people to receive protection. Secondly, protection is given to the industry as a whole. As I have said, our whole economy is based on the mining industry in this country, the gold-mining industry in particular. But apart from the gold-mining industry there are the copper mines, the diamond mines; there is our uranium and then we have 101 base metals in this wonderful country of ours. I shudder to think what the country would be like if we did not have the mining industry to fall back on. Sir, we talk about the great citrus industry. Think of the amount of work that is required to produce the oranges which are sold overseas; think of the amount of work that is put in to produce our wool clip, and yet these two industries produce a mere fraction of the foreign exchange that is produced by our gold-mining industry and our diamond mines. In spite of that fact, we find that when the Mines Vote is under discussion there are very few members who take sufficient interest in the mine worker to attend the debate. I have said that before; I repeat it to-day and I will keep on saying it until I find that this House is filled to capacity when we talk about mining matters, because we should do everything in our power in this house to keep our mining industry going. We have to build our whole economy, our whole life around these industries, and if we let them go, then everything else will go with them. It is no good producing wool, it is no good producing oranges and it is no good have a great fishing industry if we let our mining industry go by the board. The more I read about our mining industry, the more I realize how much the other sectors of our economy are dependent on our minding industry. Think of the secondary industries which flow from the mining industry; think of the food that is used by these people; think of the towns which have been built around the mines; think of the progress that has been made in the Free State, for instance, since 1934 when gold was first found at Odendaalsrus. The whole structure <span class="col_6631-6632" refersTo="page_0562"/>of our country is changing to-day. Great masses of people are moving from one area to another because of the discovery of gold etc., in our country. If around every mine that is discovered, towns like Johannesburg, Germiston, Brakpan, Benoni and the other towns of the Reef can be built and established, then we will be safe here for all times. We have a wonderful future ahead of us. God has been good to us here, because no sooner do we find one mine falling by the wayside, than another richer, better and bigger mine is discovered. I do not know where it all comes from but thank God that it is so. I say that those people who take an interest in the men who extract this wealth from the bowels of the earth must be given every opportunity to continue the great work that they are doing, and I sincerely hope that our present Minister of Mines will remain Minister of Mines for as long as his party remains in power. I do not want to see another change of Minister next year again; that has been happening too frequently in the past. My plea is that while the Minister occupies that portfolio he should encourage as much research work as possible, not only on the person who contracts pneumoconiosis, but also on the healthy person. Ways and means must be found of discovering the catalyst that we have somewhere that produces pneumoconiosis in various stages in one group of people, while not affecting other groups working under the same or different conditions. I also want to say to the hon. the Minister in dealing with this question of research that he must not depend entirely on the C.S.I.R. to do this work. We should make full use for research purposes of universities that we have throughout the country on the Witwatersrand, in the Free State, in the Cape and in Natal. In Natal there are the coal mines; the Natal University should establish a research unit at the university to undertake research into coal; at the Witwatersrand University research can be conducted not only into coal but into the other metals that we find in the Transvaal. We should investigate the effect of copper and asbestos on the body. Why should asbestos cause carcinoma of the lung, for instance? How quickly does it develop? Does it affect people in surrounding areas? That is the sort of thing that I would like to see the University of the Witwatersrand tackle as soon as possible in their Medical School and in the Engineering Department.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Just before the dinner break, I was saying a few words about the value of research and the importance of research in the matter of pneumoconiosis, and I want to read one small paragraph from the report of the Pneumoconiosis Conference which took place, as the hon. Minister knows, in 1959, a paragraph which I am sure his advisors have taken note of&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the field of etiology and pathology it is recommended, firstly, that as observations on man with regard to the pathology or silica are incomplete, it is desirable that further observations on man and experiments on animals should be carried out.</block>

<p>That is of paramount importance. It means that although we bring in a Bill here to-day which appears on the face of it a suitable means of dealing with pneumoconiosis, we must make up our minds here and now that this is not the last word. It is only the beginning of a process which in the end will benefit the mine workers, benefit them to such an extent that I believe that if we carry on along these lines of research, in ten years time, mining will no longer be a hazardous occupation. But we have to provide all the facilities which we can give to the research workers. My own feeling is that in the field of pneumoconiosis we have not got enough people to do the work. You see, it is a specialized field and the best of our people to-day are spending their time in the bureau examining the patients and they have about 50,000 White people and some 30,000 Bantu to deal with. I don&#x2019;t say that the people in the Bureau have to deal with 300,000 Bantu at one time, but they have to deal with them eventually. So those people have all their time taken up with examination work and have not got the time to do the necessary research work. You cannot expect the few people in the C.S.I.R. to-day to undertake that work. That is why I suggest that it is essential for us to get as many of our universities and medical schools as possible, interested in that type of research. On the Witwatersrand they could busy themselves with research in respect of the coal-mining industry and the gold-mining industry, in Natal also with the coal mines, perhaps in the Cape in respect with some of the base metals like copper, manganese and so forth, and in Pretoria I think they could busy themselves immediately, especially in view of the fact that they have taken the interest they have in dealing with carcinoma&#x2014;they have got the use of the cobalt bomb and so forth&#x2014;to see what relationship there is between carcinoma of the lung due to asbestos and pneumoconiosis and how the two interlink with one another. Those are two very important suggestions. We have been very fortunate, Mr. Speaker, that the overseas research workers have been so ready to give us the benefit of their work, but remember that we are the greatest gold producer in the world and it is up to us therefore to show the way to the other countries.</p>

<p>I am certain that if America for instance had produced as much gold as we have, they would be in the forefront of research work, and although the gold-mining industry year after year puts thousands and thousands of pounds back into their efforts to promote education as a whole, it is in this particular field that we must look for men, good men, to concentrate on research work in respect of the various types of mining activities that go on <span class="col_6633-6634" refersTo="page_0563"/>in our country. I do not want to go further into that because time is getting short, and because I want to deal with what I consider to be four of the main aspects of the Bill as we have it before us and which I think are to some extent at least the result of some of the criticisms we have put up from this side since 1958.</p>

<p>Firstly, I am of course pleased that the capacity for work to-day is of secondary consideration; not that it is not important, but it takes its place behind the more scientific and more accurate assessment which we can now arrive at from the cardio-respiratory examinations. X-rays in themselves are also not sufficient either. We have got to remember this, that when a man comes up to be examined, he has got to be treated as a patient who will be examined by a specialist to see whether he is fit to become a miner, fit to have a certificate. We have to have precise X-rays. X-raying is not easy. It is not a matter of taking a picture and looking at it and to determine from one picture what is wrong with the patient. We have to have experts in the field of radiology. Then we want a clinical examination of the patient who comes up. I say &#x201C;the patient&#x201D;, because when he walks into that room, he must be treated as a patient will be treated in a doctor&#x2019;s consulting room. A complete clinical picture must be built around that man. We must see whether his build, his structure, his psychological outlook, his weight and his height, and all other allied things must be taken into consideration, to see if he is fit for employment to become a miner. He will have to work for years as a miner and because of the precautions which should be taken now, his years of work become longer and longer. It is no longer employment which starts say in 1950, and ends in 1955; it goes on and those of us who deal with mine workers know that you have people in the mines now who have been working there for 35 and 40 years. They are already working as long as that. Men of 60 say &#x201C;I am quite fit, I don&#x2019;t want to retire; I am working, I am earning a nice living, let me stay on;&#x201D;. They go for their periodical examination, and they are still well and fit. They are very proud, as a matter of fact of being able to continue. Those are the people from whom you want to find out why they have been able to resist pneumoconiosis,&#x2014;the living person working under the same condition as miners; why is he able to resist pneumoconiosis.</p>

<p>I go on now to the next point which I think is very important and that is the division of stages. To-day we have given up the previous method of distinction into various stages. There will no longer be four stages, but three stages. We on this side all stood for that. My difficulty now was briefly expressed by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). When we say that a man is suffering from pneumoconiosis in the first stage, i.e. 20 per cent to 50 per cent, then I picture it&#x2014;I may be wrong&#x2014;that at this level of disability he is half a man from a working capacity point of view and that he is only able to do 50 per cent of his work. When he gets to the third stage, or when he reaches the 75 per cent stage&#x2014;one imagines that 75 per cent of his lung tissue is not working normally and he is only able to do then 25 per cent of his normal work. That is how I picture it. I may be wrong. It may not be the scientific way of looking at it, but when I look at it that way, I think it is not fair to group the 20 per cent disability with the 50 per cent. I think here I would like the hon. the Minister, when he has had time to consider the matter with his advisors, whether it would not be better to go from 20 per cent to 40 per cent, from 40 to 65 and then the final stage 65 and over. What life can a man have left if he is put in the third stage with a 75 per cent disability? With a 75 per cent disability there is not much left for him in life. You can give him very, very high benefits when he is in the third stage. You can be very generous with your benefits, because I can tell you that he won&#x2019;t enjoy those benefits very long. So I say: Rather let him live longer and let him enjoy the benefits that you are going to give him. Because the way I see it, the whole plan is that something more should be given to the miner, but I think we are not giving sufficient in the third stage. And I am not talking in terms of money now, but in terms of years of life, and when I talk about years of life, I say: Give him what is due to him financially, but let him enjoy it for a longer period than he will if you proceed in what you are doing here. It should not be necessary for me or my colleagues here to move an amendment at this stage, because I said right at the beginning that I think this is a good Bill because it allows flexibility, it allows for alteration after a short period; there is nothing rigid about it. When the Minister said that it is a step in the right direction, he was right, and I hope he will keep moving in the right direction. If I thought for a moment that it was bad, I would have no hesitation in saying so and condemning it lock, stock and barrel, but I can see here ways and means of improving the position, and one suggestion I make now in favour of the mine worker is to stop at 65 per cent, and let him come up from there and retire if necessary.</p>

<p>The next point I want to make I think I must clarify, because listening to one or two people, I am sure that the appeal board, has not been clearly explained. I just want to say briefly that the way I read it here, the position is that this appeal board which will come into operation as a reviewing board, as it is called in the Bill, comes into operation when the certifying committee has given a decision which is not accepted by the miner. He does not like the decision because his private doctor from whom he asked advice told him differently and he then wants his case reviewed. But instead of what we thought previously was a very good idea of having an independent body reviewing <span class="col_6635-6636" refersTo="page_0564"/>his case, now we have the position that the doctors who examined the case on the one side plus the certifying committee sitting together, when there is disagreement, as representatives of each body, and they decide whether this man is or is not entitled to something which he thinks he is entitled to. It is not an outside group of people that come in and pass judgment on the doctors&#x2019; decisions that have been made. Those people that make decisions, will be able to rectify their own mistakes if it should be felt necessary to do so. I think that will work. I have got the most utmost faith in the medical personnel of the bureau, and I know that they will give a fair review of the decisions they came to earlier on.</p>

<p>The next point that I want to emphasize is that I would like the Director of the Mines Medical Bureau, I think it is going to be called that, to bear in mind that when the doctors come there to examine the miners he must forget that he is bound by laws. We find here that he may not be a doctor, and therefore this is a point I want him to bear in mind, and I am quite sure that the medical advisers to the hon. Minister agree with me. He must forget about the rigidity that hampers him according to law. Let the man go in and be examined by these people as if, as I said earlier on, he is to be examined by a specialist, and if there are difficulties, legal difficulties or regulation difficulties, we will sort them out later, but let there be a clear understanding that these people are being examined to see whether they are fit and able to work, or secondly, whether any condition has arisen in their body to prevent them from continuing with the work they are doing, and let us forget about this rigidity and inability to do this or to do that because the law says this or the law says that.</p>

<p>I come to the next point. I am pleased to hear that at long last there is going to be some liaison between the panel doctors who look after the patients and the bureau itself. I cannot stress the desirability of this too strongly. If the hon. the Minister wants to have a contented group of people, I say that he can best achieve that by making those people who are being examined feel that they are human beings and that they are not just numbers. One of the things that they detest is that when they go down for examination, and when they present their cards, their names are of secondary importance. The bureau numbers are taken and everything goes by numbers, and the doctors will know much more about No. 19760 than about Mr. Diederichs.</p>

<p>The next thing is that as soon as a finding is made, a confidential report (confidential if necessary), should be forewarded to his private doctor especially if it is thought inadvisable to tell the patient what is wrong with him. In these enlightened days I am inclined to say that if a thing is wrong with a patient, let him know; but if necessary a confidential report should be given to the doctor who attends to him, and that doctor will look after him. The doctor who has sent the patient should know what is wrong, if there is anything wrong when he comes back to him from a special examination. It should not be kept a secret from us. I hope that that will be a thing of the past.</p>

<speech by="#schoonbee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>Are you now talking of private practitioners?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The private practitioner in this case is a contract doctor. He works for the Mines Benefit Society on contract and the Mines Benefit Societies&#x2019; Doctors look after all the patients on the mines, whether they work underground or on the surface, and they are treated, I hope, as private patients. The doctor is a panel doctor.</p>

<p>I am also pleased that the hon. the Minister has set aside, or will set aside, moneys for the teaching of a second trade or to guide a man when he goes to the second stage of phthisis into some trade, or occupation. I think that is very important, but to do that, you must make sure that you have sufficient public relations officers who will be able at all times to place these people who are going to leave the mines with small pensions into some other industry, or into commerce or wherever it is to be. A series of well-informed public relations officers will have to be instituted. That is terribly important. Today those mines which have public relations officers are much more concerned to see what happens between the man&#x2019;s home life and his working life, but there has to be this connection outside the mines as well. We must set up as it were an employment agency for those people who wish to leave the mines.</p>

<p>Now when you have made those provisions and you have got the stages fixed and you have decided to give the worker the pension that is due to him, I must say that I think the hon. the Minister has perhaps been a little bit too careful in giving the money. I know you will always get that. None of us will ever be satisfied with what somebody else is giving. We always say: Give more, give more. But when we take into consideration that the lump sum of R960 is not going to be given to the individual in the first stage but that the money is going to be spread over a period of years, you are giving him very little more than before. It means that for the first four or five years he gets no increase in pension at all. All that you do is that you take this lump sum and you are dividing it up and giving it to him in monthly instalments. So the man in the first stage virtually gets no benefit from this new scheme at all. He only starts to derive benefits at the rate of about R10 a month after he reaches the second stage. I hope that later on we will discuss this matter again and see whether we cannot get a better allocation of money to these people.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister that one of the reasons why I think there has been a <span class="col_6637-6638" refersTo="page_0565"/>slight increase in the curve of pneumoconiosis, is the fact that a lot of mines are allowing their workers to do too much overtime. These fellows look for work because it is only by getting overtime money that they can come out. Ordinary time plus overtime enables them to make a decent living, and I think that too many miners to-day are doing overtime for the sake of getting the money, but are impairing their health. I feel that we should try to give them as much as we possibly can, but I think the time has come now where if a man is going to be asked to do a double shift (and that is a very common thing) he should come up to the surface for a couple of hours before going in for the second shift. He must come into the fresh air. Give him three or four hours fresh air before he starts his second shift. Some people who don&#x2019;t know about the position, may say: What does it matter, he gets double pay, he wants to do that work. But we who know, know that he is impairing his health in many cases and I think that in most cases where people are taking these long shifts, they must be made to come to the surface for a period of three or four hours before they continue onto the second shift.</p>

<p>Just to wind up before I sit down, I have left one point to the last, but that point will be dealt with more fully with by the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford).I think the Director will have to consider very carefully, especially if he is a non-medical man, what orders he is giving to the doctors, not only those who work with him, but according to the Act he can direct a doctor anywhere to do certain things; he can order a doctor in the country to do a post mortem; he can order that doctor not only to do the post mortem, but to give his findings. And what amazes me most in this Bill, and I think it is terribly wrong, is that he will be paid for his services if he does the work to the satisfaction of the Director. He may carry out the wishes of the Director, but if the Director does not think he has done it properly, he need not pay him. I think that is one of the things that will be elaborated upon by my colleague, and I hope we can get that little matter straightened out. The other minor matters I think we can deal with at a later stage, but I do wish to say to the hon. the Minister that I hope that this Bill he has brought in here, will serve the purpose for which it was introduced and that the mine workers, who have done so much for us, will enjoy the benefits which they so richly deserve.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has said a great many things with which I agree and with which the whole House will probably agree, <i>inter alia</i>, that much more research should be done in connection with this subject and that we should never cease doing research work into this question of miner&#x2019;s phthisis. I think the whole House will agree with him that the time of the Bureau is so limited that those who are employed there will not have the time to do that research work and that others should be placed at its disposal to do that work. Another important point on which I agree with him is that the mine worker should be given something while he is still alive. Everybody would like to have a fine and a beautiful funeral but everybody would prefer to have something while they are alive. These are basic matters in respect of which I feel the same way as the hon. member does.</p>

<p>Before I deal with the contents of the Bill I should like to say something in connection with the problem of pneumoconiosis as such. As far as good miner&#x2019;s phthisis legislation is concerned, there are three basic facts which you have to bear in mind, Sir. The first one&#x2014;and this is fundamental&#x2014;is the one to which the hon. member has also referred, namely that the object of the measure should be to lengthen the life of the mine worker. That to my mind is the main and most important requirement when we talk about progress. Positive steps should be taken to lengthen the life of the mine worker. The second basic requirement is that his family should be reasonably provided for when the husband is no longer in a position to work in the mine and to earn a salary. That too is a very basic requirement when we talk about progress in connection with our miner&#x2019;s phthisis legislation. The third requirement follows logically on to the first, and is that the levy which the mines have to pay to augment the fund from which compensation is paid, must serve as a measure to force mine owners and mine managers to take every possible step to prevent miner&#x2019;s phthisis. Those are the three things which you must look for in any miner&#x2019;s phthisis legislation.</p>

<p>As far as the first point is concerned, it is essential that this House take note of the other essential factors when we talk about the fate of the mine worker. It is this, that a considerable number, yes, most of those people who report to the Bureau for examination and approval to work in the mine, are rejected. The examination was already so thorough in 1935 that only 35 per cent of the men who applied to the Bureau to become mine workers were approved. You can well understand, Sir, that the person who goes to the Bureau to apply for work regards himself as a healthy person. However, of those selected persons only 35 per cent pass the examination to which the Bureau subjects them before they can become mine workers. I cannot over-emphasize the fact that we are dealing with the cream of South Africa. The person who is issued with a ticket to go to work underground has to be an A-1 Springbok type of person, otherwise he is not passed out and that is the person who ultimately turns into a hopeless miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferer. It is very gratifying to note that conditions, working conditions in the mines are being improved. We have been hearing that for years and we want to encourage that; yet it remains an unpleasant fact, and it is necessary that this House realizes it, that up to the present not a single person has <span class="col_6639-6640" refersTo="page_0566"/>spent his whole life underground without contracting miner&#x2019;s phthisis. It is necessary for this House to know that. Those people who ultimately become miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferers deserve all our attention. We should consider what effect it has on the health of our people in general that such a large portion of the cream of our nation turn into miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferers. As far as I know this is something which has never as yet been investigated. That is also something of which this House should take note. I repeat that the detrimental effects of pneumoconiosis or silicosis and tuberculosis on the rest of the nation and on the national health as such have never as yet been investigated. That aspect has never been investigated. That as far as the background of the whole problem is concerned.</p>

<p>I now come to the provisions contained in this Bill. I first wish to deal with the scales of compensation. When we talk about being liberal or extravagant in respect of compensation, it is necessary to make a comparison. I cannot claim to be a strong or handsome man unless I compare myself with one of you. We must make a comparison. Let us consider the pension scales which are paid to the people to-day and those which will apply under the new legislation and then compare them with the other pensions which are paid in South Africa. We can then see to what extent they conform to point No. 2 which I have made; we should apply a little test.</p>

<p>In terms of the existing Act a miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferer received R24 in the old second stage, his wife R6 and his child R3. In terms of the new Bill the husband will receive R24 in the stage comparable to the former second stage under the old set-up, although it is no longer called the second stage, the wife R6 and the child R3. It, therefore, remains exactly the same. What is the position in respect of the old third stage, that is to say the group between 50 per cent and 75 per cent. At the present moment the husband receives R36, the wife R12 and the child R6, whereas only the benefits in the case of the husband are being increased to R46 under this Bill. Let us compare these pension benefits with those of a railwayman.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must give me a chance; I haven&#x2019;t much time. When we make the comparison between the pension benefits of the mine worker suffering from miner&#x2019;s phthisis and those received by a railwayman we must remember that in the first-mentioned case the pension is being paid to a person who has already contracted miner&#x2019;s phthisis and who is, therefore, already a sick person whereas in the last-mentioned case the pension is being paid to a healthy man. What do we find on making such a comparison? I have already given you the scales relating to mine workers, Sir. As far as the railwayman is concerned, a second-grade clerk with 25 years of service receives R551 per annum plus a gratuity of R1,826 whereas the miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferer receives no gratuity. Not only is the pension of the railwayman to whom I have referred higher than that of the miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferer, but he receives a gratuity in addition. And he is a healthy man! If this clerk to whom I have referred has had 35 years of service he will receive a pension of R60 per month and a gratuity of R2,559.</p>

<p>What about the Provident Fund of the mine workers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>That fund has nothing to do with the compensation paid for miner&#x2019;s phthisis. The less we talk about the pension of the mine worker ex the Provident Fund the better. But the hon. member should give me an opportunity of going on with my speech because I have not much time. As I have said we should compare the pension payable to miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferers with something in order to come to a just decision. I have compared it with the pension benefits payable to a railwayman and that leads you to conclude, Sir, that the mine worker who is already a sick man, receives less than the particular railwayman whom I have taken as an example and who&#x2014;you must not lose sight of this fact&#x2014;is still a healthy man. In other words, the miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferer receives no compensation, therefore, for the fact that he was a sick man when he ceased to work.</p>

<p>Let me examine the position in respect of the fourth stage. At the moment that miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferer receives R50, his wife R13 and his child R9. This scale is being raised in this Bill to R73 in the case of the husband, R13 in the case of the wife whereas the child&#x2019;s allowance remains the same. We welcome these increases. It has already been pointed out, however, that provision should not only be made for these people so that they can have a decent funeral, because we should not lose sight of the fact that once a man has reached the fourth stage, he has not much longer to live. I want the House to realize this fact. When we make such an analysis as the one which I have just made. I think there is much to be said for it that this whole question should again be revised one day.</p>

<p>This is an agreed measure, in other words, the parties concerned, namely the Chamber of Mines and the mine workers have agreed to this. With a view to that it is no good even thinking of moving amendments in the Committee Stage. That is excluded because we have been asked to accept the Bill as it stands at the moment, to accept it as a measure in respect of which the parties concerned have agreed. In this connection I wish to point <span class="col_6641-6642" refersTo="page_0567"/>out that the words &#x201C;agreed measure&#x201D; have their origin in the thirties and that since then we have often had a repetition of them. It is not my intention to try to say anything about the integrity of any of the parties. I suppose they did their best to ease the task of this House. When you look at Clauses 41 and 42 of the Bill. Sir, you will notice that the Department of Health and the Department of Bantu Administration are in the foreground and that certain compensations have to be paid to mine workers who receive treatment after they have contracted the disease. We notice that the Department of Health treats a Bantu who has contracted the disease in the mining industry, and thereafter hands him over to the Department of Bantu Administration which is then responsible for his future maintenance. Ultimately he finds himself in the hands of the police and he is returned to the place where he originally came from. I would be failing in my duty if I did not bring this matter to the notice of the House. We are not dealing therefore with the Chamber of Mines and the mine workers&#x2019; union alone, but also with three Government departments. It is now provided by law that a person can be deprived of his service certificate for reasons other than miner&#x2019;s phthisis. It is all very well for us to say that he should be taken out of the mine in his own interests but who becomes responsible for him in that case? In that case he becomes the responsibility of the Department of Labour and of the Department of Social Welfare. Hon. members surely do not expect us simply to forget about this man. It must be remembered that this person is still a young person who has only been working in the mine for a few years and who was disqualified from working underground when he went for his first examination because he had contracted other ailments there. In that case he is placed at the doorstep of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour.</p>

<p>I hope that when it does happen again that we have to discuss a matter such as this in this House we will have the benefit of a thorough investigation. All these bodies which I have mentioned, such as the Department of Health for example, should also be consulted and should not simply be saddled with a person who has already contracted miner&#x2019;s phthisis. All these bodies should be given an opportunity of making their contributions to the solution of the problem. I wish to emphasize that in the first place there should be a far-reaching investigation by a competent commission and that for the purposes of this investigation they should have the benefit of the opinion of all the medical men in the country so that we can get away from canalized medical evidence because there are also many diverse opinions in the medical field. That alone is sufficient reason to have the matter thoroughly investigated. The questions which such a commission will have to investigate will be, firstly, the effect of miner&#x2019;s phthisis on the national health in general, secondly; the extent of the poverty and misery among miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferers and their dependants; and thirdly, what can still be done to prevent miner&#x2019;s phthisis. These three basic factors should be thoroughly investigated so that when we are again confronted with a Bill in this connection in this House, the House will be able to accept that the Bill is the result of a far-reaching investigation into all the aspects of miner&#x2019;s phthisis. After that the measures should be subjected to the test of a Select Committee. An agreed measure will be acceptable once it has been subjected to the scrutiny of a Select Committee where people with knowledge of the disease and people with knowledge of social welfare work will be able to air their views authoritatively. It is along this road that this problem should be tackled. It has long since become a matter which cannot be solved by the two interested bodies alone, but it is a problem with national repercussions, particularly in the field of national health. Consequently the matter cannot be left to two bodies alone and I want to express the hope that we will not again be confronted with a Bill which has only been discussed by these two bodies. Every medical man in South Africa, and everybody who thinks that he can make a contribution to the solution of the problem must be given an opportunity of making that contribution. We will then be able to see whether the pension benefits as set out in this Bill can be justified by this House, particularly in view of the fact that the mining industry can no longer plead poverty to-day but that it is an industry which is enjoying liberal concessions from the Government to-day and an industry which enjoys many more benefits than any other industry. We all want to see this industry flourish but that should not happen at the expense of the general national health of South Africa. Hon. members must not tell me that the incidence of miner&#x2019;s phthisis does not have a deleterious effect on our national health in general. Nobody dare allege that. It is, therefore, the duty of the Government to tackle this matter at a much higher level than it has done in the past&#x2014;during the past 15 years.</p>

<p>As I have already said we will not be able to change this Bill now because it is a measure agreed upon by the Chamber of Mines and the mine workers. I am convinced, however, that there will still be complaints. That is why I trust that when we again have to deal with such a measure in this House, we will be able to accept it that there has been a thorough prior investigation by a competent commission and by a Select Committee of this House. I have said my say.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it has been generally accepted that this Bill has a lot of merit as far as the legal, medical and technical aspects of the mining industry are concerned. But here I stop. It will be observed that I have not included the financial aspect amongst the considerations in respect of which this Bill gives satisfaction. It has been said that this is an agreed measure, but <span class="col_6643-6644" refersTo="page_0568"/>although that may be so, I think it should be known that the underground miners are not altogether happy with this Bill. To link up with this, I want to point out that we in this House have not been given sufficient opportunities to consult the miners concerned because of the short time available to us to study this Bill. To-day is only the sixth day since this Bill was made available to us, and to study a complicated Bill of this nature, comprising 107 pages of a technical, medical and financial nature, is asking too much of a layman.</p>

<p>I should also like to point out that at no stage did the various organizations concerned meet round a table with the purpose of deciding finally on the provisions of this Bill. What was done, was done on a unilateral basis and through intermediaries. Representatives of the Mine Workers&#x2019; Union, of the Mining Union Joint Committees, and of the Underground Officials&#x2019; Association have not yet jointly met the representatives of the mining industry at a Round Table conference for the purpose of ironing out the final provisions of the Bill. As I said, this was done on a unilateral basis which, we all know, is not the best way for drawing up satisfactory industrial legislation. It is well-known that the dangers of pneumoconiosis are not as great to-day as in days gone by. In this connection, I think we will all agree that the facilities which the mining industry has made available to miners have helped considerably towards the reduction of the incidence of pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis. A tribute must be paid to the mining industry for what it has done in this regard. Time alone will tell whether this Bill will bring such big improvements as are expected from it. It will be conceded, however, that a more scientific approach is now being made, in so far as the medical aspect of the disease is concerned, in the detection of pneumoconiosis through the cardiac-respiratory tests, and I think time will show that miners will get the benefits of better, if not earlier, certification.</p>

<p>All of us, I think, would like to see a miner being removed from underground working as soon as the first signs of pneumoconiosis are detected in his system. In saying this I do, however, realize the practical and financial problems attendant upon this suggestion, both to the miner and the industry. It would, of course, be the ideal thing if we could take a miner away from underground as soon as he shows signs of pneumoconiosis, thereby ultimately saving manpower and lengthening the lives of miners. I hope the day will come when we shall be able to do that, without financial loss to the miner. Then we shall indeed have rendered this very fine band of workers an excellent service.</p>

<p>When I made reference to the need for a Round Table discussion in regard to this matter, I should have taken it one stage further. This is, that the hon. the Minister should be asked whether he will not consider an arrangement in terms of which a non-medical representative of the miners will sit on the Certifying Committee consisting of medical men. When I suggest this for the mine workers, I think the same privilege should be extended to the mine owners, i.e. they too should be represented by a non-medical man on that committee. My reasons for making this suggestion are these. It is well-known amongst those of us who have regular contact with miners, that they always have the suspicion when coming up for a medical examination by a certifying committee, that the dice may be loaded against them, and consequently they may not get a fair test. I have no reason to believe that sort of suspicion is justified, but human nature being what it is, it is there nevertheless. Therefore, I feel that if there are two non-medical men sitting on this certifying committee and representing the interests of the miners and the mining industry, the psychological prejudice, which is in the mind of a miner when he is called for an examination, can be overcome and the more healthy state of affairs established. This can be brought about by a slight amendment to Clause 7 of his Bill, to the effect that the number of men serving on the certifying committee be increased from six to eight&#x2014;the two additional men being the non-medical representatives to whom I have referred. I hope the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accept this suggestion for the reasons I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Speaking about representation, I should like to have an assurance from the hon. the Minister that the Underground Officials&#x2019; Association will get representation on the Pneumoconiosis General Council to be established under Clause 48. Such an assurance was, I believe, given to the Underground Officials&#x2019; Association but there is no reference to it in this Bill. This association is playing a vital and active role in the mining industry, and as its members are working in a dusty atmosphere as well, it, too, should be represented on the Pneumoconiosis General Council. Is the hon. the Minister prepared to extend to this body such representation?</p>

<p>I have already referred to the fact that, in my opinion, this Bill does not, from a financial point of view make adequate provision in so far as compensation and pension benefits to the miners are concerned. I was surprised to hear from the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) that &#x201C;that basic purpose of this Bill was not its financial aspect in so far as increased pensions were concerned&#x201D;. I have to cross swords with him immediately on this score. Compare that statement with what was said by the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) who certainly should know what he is talking about when he talks about miners, namely that &#x201C;no person working on the mines has lived out a normal lifetime&#x201D;. In the light of this statement, the statement made by the hon. member for Ventersdorp cannot bear examination, and, if the hon. member for Krugersdorp is correct, then the financial aspect must always play an important part.</p>

<p>Now, when one examines the financial aspect <span class="col_6645-6646" refersTo="page_0569"/>of the Bill, what do we find? Firstly, we find that the lump sum payment of R960 has been abolished, and has been incorporated in an augmented pension in respect of the last two stages. Looking at the pension for the last two stages, however, it will be noticed that the pension for persons who are incapacitated to an extent of from 50 to 75 per cent, is increased by only R10 per month, or R120 per annum. This means that it will take the pensioner concerned, eight years to get an amount as extra pension to equal the lump sum payment that he is now forfeiting. In other words, it means that only after the lapse of eight years will he be starting to get an increased pension. As far as I am concerned, this increased pension does not constitute any concession at all. As I previously said, he will have to wait eight years before he will have got back that which he lost as a lump sum payment. In addition, he will be losing the interest on that sum of R960&#x2014;amounting to roughly R560 over a period of eight years. I do not think it is fair to expect a miner to be satisfied with this new basis of compensation.</p>

<p>When we examine the position which is going to apply in respect of miners who are incapacitated to an extent of 75 per cent and more, we find that there is to be an increase of R23 per month. We find, however, that this R23 incorporates R15 in the form of an attendant&#x2019;s allowance which a miner already got previously. We know that at that stage of their illness in all probability they would have been paid an attendant&#x2019;s allowance of R15. In practice, therefore, the last stage miner is only getting an increase of R8, or roughly an increase of 11 per cent. Now, when you take into consideration the fact that the cost of living has risen by 9.5 per cent since 1956, what extra amount is this man in actual fact getting? Only 1.5 per cent! In view of these facts, I think that the hon. the Minister should adjust these scales of pensions in the Committee Stage. If you consider that a miner with a disability of 75 per cent, is &#x201C;technically dead&#x201D;&#x2014;that is the expression which medical men use&#x2014;then you will agree with me that this increase is very little indeed.</p>

<p>In regard to the decision to abolish the lump sum payment and to spread it over a period of eight years, I want to state that I accept the arguments that there may be many miners who fritter away the money when they get it as a lump sum payment, with the result that within a short time their families have not got the benefit of that compensation any more. There are, however a large number of prudent pensioners amongst the miners. These people invest this money in the best possible manner&#x2014;for the purpose perhaps of establishing a home for themselves and their families, or for purchasing a plot, or establishing themselves in business of their own etc. In this way, we find that there are many miners to-day who possess their own plots living in the fresh open air, and making a fairly good living. This has become possible only through the lump sum payment they received. We must, therefore, give consideration to those miners who invest their money wisely, and not deprive them of this lump sum payment.</p>

<p>If one examines this Bill, one finds that the first stage of pneumoconiosis is conceded only when there is an impairment of the lung function to the extent of 20 per cent. The position up to now has been that a miner has been regarded as suffering from pneumoconiosis of the first stage, when dust has been detected in his lungs. He would then have been certified and placed on pension. If a miner who had not been certified, died, and it was found on post mortem examination that there were the slightest signs of dust on his lungs, the widow received the lump sum payment of R960. But what is the position going to be under this Bill when a miner is found to have dust on his lungs although he was not previously certified? Will the widow of that miner also get some compensation, even if the miner was not infected to the extent prescribed, i.e. 20 per cent? If not, a large number of widows are going to be prejudiced, in comparison with what happened under the old Bill. If it is borne in mind that there are roughly from 20 to 25 new cases of pneumoconiosis per annum, one realizes that this is an aspect in regard to which there must be absolute clarity, so that any worries on the part of these widows can be eliminated.</p>

<p>I say this because it was accepted by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), as well as by the hon. the Minister, that although the new basis is certainly more scientific than the old one, it still represents a certain amount of &#x201C;educated guesswork&#x201D; on the part of the certifying panel as to what actually is the extent of impairment. We do not know when it is going to be 21 per cent or when it is going to be 17 per cent. It will be purely an arbitrary average based on experience overseas. We have to provide for future contingencies which might arise in this regard. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that instead of taking the first stage at 20 per cent to 50 per cent, it should be 20 per cent to 40 per cent. Similarly, instead of the second stage being from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, it should be at 40 per cent to 65 per cent, with the third stage from 65 per cent, upwards. I suggest this especially in view of the fact that it is generally accepted that with a disability of 75 per cent a miner is techncially &#x201C;dead&#x201D; and cannot, consequently, be of any value to the mining industry, to his family or to himself. Even with a disability of 50 per cent a man is disabled to such an extent that he cannot be of much advantage to his employers.</p>

<p>In connection with the question of Bantu labourers, the hon. the Minister did make reference to the fact that they will be receiving a lump sum payment of about R480. In this connection I should like to congratulate <span class="col_6647-6648" refersTo="page_0570"/>the hon. the Minister for including, for the first time, Coloureds under this legislation. As far as these two groups are concerned, I think it will be conceded that nowhere in the world has any industry played such a helpful and excellent role in looking after the welfare and health of its employees as the mining industry in this country has, towards the Bantu labourer.</p>

<p>The Minister dealt with the position of the marginal mines and the manner in which they will get relief under this Bill. I welcome the suggestions for assisting these mines and especially to I welcome the establishment of a Technical Committee to ascertain the question of the degree of pneumoconiosis dust in the old mines. Up to now, the marginal mines have been suffering under a disability in this regard, in that they have been made to pay a higher levy than the rich mines, under the false and unreal supposition that there is more dust in an old mine than in a new mine. I am particularly pleased that the hon. the Minister has now removed this anomaly, and that the marginal mines will be given assistance which will prolong their lives and bring sustained employment in those areas in which this question of the marginal mines is a very grave problem. It is found that some of the new rich mines pay roughly 4s. 6d. a day levy, whilst some of the old mines can pay up to as much as 39s. 6d. The average, however, is about 9s. a day, and that is a heavy responsibility on a mine with high working costs and low ore payability. In that regard this is a welcome innovation, to find that this relief will now be given to the marginal mines. One wonders, in regard to the question of the welfare of a miner, whether we should devote ourselves wholly and solely to payment of pneumoconiosis benefits only. When one remembers that less than 4 per cent of the White miners ever contract pneumoconiosis, I think consideration should be given to the other 96 per cent who cannot profitably carry on earning what they did in years gone by, because as they grow older there is a loss of earning capacity. Other ailments contracted as the result of mining occur, like ulcers, rheumatism, arthritis etc. and one wonders whether we should not give consideration to using certain of these funds, which are now being made available in terms of the Bill, to develop and improve a comprehensive pension scheme for miners. You will then be able to overcome the problem which has worried the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg), and in this regard I want to say to him that I do not think his figures&#x2014;in comparing the small pension of a miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferer with that of a Railway pensioner&#x2014;is correct, because he has overlooked the fact that the miners are now only getting a small pension. One hopes that as time goes on this pension fund will increase and therefore their pension will be bigger; but at the moment there is a small pension available to them of approximately R23 a month, and under those circumstances the argument of the hon. member for Krugersdorp really falls away.</p>

<p>A further aspect that worries one is the necessity for a statement that I feel the hon. the Minister should make, in regard to the position of the old miners who had no cardiograph taken before, but who may now contract the disease. What basis will be used in order to establish the degree of impairment of an old miner, in comparison with a new miner coming into the mines? The new miner will undergo his examinations and his condition can thus readily be ascertained, and as time goes on any deterioration in his condition can be detected. But what is the position of a miner who has been in the mines for the past 20 to 25 years, where no cardiograph had been taken, and you now have to compare his condition with what it was in the past? I think a clear statement by the Minister in this regard will bring a lot of relief and clarity as far as the miners are concerned.</p>

<p>I would like also to ask the Minister if he could not arrange a more definite form of contact and liaison between the Department of Health and the Department of Mines in regard to the aftercare treatment of tuberculosis cases. I am referring particularly to the case of the Bantu, and not as much to the White worker in the mines, who is taken care of to a great extent by the Chamber of Mines at places like Springfield Sanitorium, and he is getting exceptionally fine treatment from the mining industry. But so far as the Bantu is concerned who contracts tuberculosis and subsequently leaves the mine, he may be cured, possibly completely, but there is always the danger that if he goes back to his tribal home&#x2014;after he has received the compensation for his disease&#x2014;he may infect other people. At present I understand that the liaison between the two Departments is not sufficiently close to keep regular and adequate contact with these cases. It is something that we have to concern ourselves with to a much greater extent than before, in order to prevent disease being spread right throughout the country. I hope that this Bill will be applied with sympathy and justice as far as the miners are concerned, but I cannot associate myself with all the tributes that have been paid to the Minister that everything in this Bill is absolutely satisfactory, and meets all the requirements of the miners. I think there is a lot of scope for improvement, particularly on the financial side, and I do hope that in the committee stage the Minister will accept certain amendments which will meet the cases I have mentioned this evening.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should also like to congratulate the Minister with this legislation, but not in all respects. There are certain very great improvements, but then again we find that more improvements could have been effected. Where we do find improvements here are e.g. that to-day a reviewing committee will be appointed. That was a complaint we frequently had from the <span class="col_6649-6650" refersTo="page_0571"/>miners, that there was no appeal board any longer. In the explanation, and even in the Bill, we see that the two committees, the certifying committee and the reviewing committee, will sit jointly. Now I am wondering whether it would not be better if these persons were qualified specialists that are appointed to do the reviewing, and were to meet on their own to certify or reject the person. It seems to me that if the two come together, there may possibly, not deliberately&#x2014;perhaps the one may persuade the other to accept something. Another advantage in the Act is that the panel doctor will be able to say something about his patient. As we know, formerly no notice was taken of the panel doctor or the family doctor. It was simply futile for the man to go to the Bureau with a certificate and try to satisfy them that it is the finding of his family doctor. This is a very great improvement. There is another improvement, but I should like to ask the Minister whether he will not review it later, namely the silica content of 10 per cent where the Minister may from 10 per cent upwards schedule such a mine as a controlled mine. But it is a well-known fact that 10 per cent is already very high, and that people may contract the disease under those circumstances, and even where it is less than 10 per cent, for the dust is there.</p>

<p>Then I should like to ask the Minister what the position is in regard to the persons operating the stampers, (crushers), and even on the mine dumps. We know from experience that those people also contract pneumoconiosis, and I may perhaps not have seen it, but I have gone through the Bill fairly carefully, and I did not find those people being covered anywhere. It is of importance. We know that under the circumstances nothing can be altered. The Act has come before us as a <i>fait accompli</i>, and we have to accept it in this form.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>No, why?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>But I should like to ask the Minister that he and his advisers should keep an eye on things and if they find that during this year fewer people are certified than under the old Act, he shall step in immediately and revise it. We are now breaking new ground. As a layman I do not know whether the medical men have advanced so far that they can tell us precisely that this new Act can succeed. It is still in the experimental stage.</p>

<p>Then I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that I am very sorry about the R960 the miner is being deprived of. I do not know what the circumstances are. Possibly the financial position is such that it can no longer be paid, but what would now have been better than if this fine gesture could have been made, that the miner in his second stage, when he leaves, could receive that R960 plus that pension which is only equivalent to the old scales. There is no change. It would be a fine gesture from our side. I really feel that under the circumstances we cannot do anything now, but if the Minister finds it possible within a year that something can be done about it, I shall be glad. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) has mentioned the case of the railway man. We know that the railwayman is a contributor himself, but now I should like to ask why we did not introduce such a scheme for the miner so that he also could be a contributor and also could receive a lump sum plus his pension. The comparison the hon. member for Krugersdorp has made was quite correct, that a railwayman gets that lump sum plus his pension, and it is a good deal more than this man, who sacrificed his health, receives. The man in any other industry is still capable of doing any other kind of work when he retires, but the miner has lost his health. I think the Government and the Chamber of Mines should co-operate in this regard and something should be done in future for the miner to improve his pension.</p>

<p>As regards the widows, I am very pleased that something extra is being done for them too, and that they will receive something more after the death of their husbands. There are even the improvements in regard to the funeral expenses but those are the roses we bring after the man&#x2019;s death. We should really have given these roses during his lifetime, for then he could have lived better. What is R30 for a person? Something should be done about this. Then I should like to ask the Minister this. This scale seems to be very high to me. If a person&#x2019;s respiratory loss has dropped to 75 per cent&#x2014;I wonder whether anybody in this House has ever seen such a person? I have, and it is a tremendous suffering and a struggle. This fourth stage, which is the third to-day, should not be higher than 65 per cent. Then the man still has a reasonable chance of carrying on. Now I should like to bring the following to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. I see the Minister of Lands is not here, and it falls under his Vote, but we get the complaint from the miners that they have a great hunger for land, and their one ambition is to have their own little piece of land. Now they complain that they apply for an agricultural holding, but they are virtually not taken into consideration for it. It surely is a well-known fact that a large proportion of those miners were farmers who could not make a living on the land owing to drought or other causes, and that they had to go to the mines for a livelihood. When he leaves at the second stage, he should like to commence farming. I think that where we now have the new schemes that are to be commenced soon, something ought to be done for those people.</p>

<p>I wished to bring only these few points to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. Before I conclude I should like to say that I feel that something else that is better could also have been done in respect of the tuberculotic. Why can that person also not be classified on the same <span class="col_6651-6652" refersTo="page_0572"/>basis as the pneumoconiotic? We know that before you can begin working on the mines, you have to pass a very severe medical test, and once the man has acquired that certificate, you should know that he is virtually 100 per cent healthy, and the mines are the cause of that man contracting silicosis or tuberculosis. But now he is not eligible for a pension, but only for a lump sum. He must have worked at least 200 to 3,000 shifts, and then he receives R1,500. After that he receives R2,000, but his condition must have deteriorated to such an extent that consideration will be given to perhaps helping him further. I feel we should do something for those people. They went to the mines in a healthy condition, and contracted the disease there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to start off with a complaint, although in general we welcome this Bill. This is a large Bill. The Minister took 1&#x00BD; hours to explain it to us, and what it would mean to the mining industry. He told us that it was an agreed measure, but as the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) said, everyone does not agree with it. Nearly everything the Minister said was pregnant with meaning to us who come from the Reef. We should have had much more time to discuss this whole matter. I think we should have been given a White Paper. On the 24th of this month we got a letter, for which I am very grateful, from the Department, which helped us tremendously in digesting this Bill so far as we could. I have no complaints about the contents of this letter. It is full of information, but I believe that this Bill is of such importance that&#x2014;and here I agree with the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg)&#x2014;it should have gone to a Select Committee where it could have been dealt with on a non-party basis. However, that is about the only destructive thing I will say about the Bill. I welcome most of it, but I want to make one or two requests.</p>

<p>First of all, I want to say that most of the men in my constituency who are affected by this Bill welcome the restoration of the appeal board. I was up there a few days ago, and although this is not quite what they were asking for, it is an appeal board or a reviewing committee, and they will sit together with the board and come to a decision in the event of disagreement. I think this is a very reasonable attempt to get over the grievances that existed in the past and it will be accepted by most of us representing mining constituencies. I think we have all suffered on occasion from the fact that our own doctor friends do not always agree. I welcome also the fact that all Bantu will now be examined and not only those who work underground. But there is one matter in regard to which I want to cross swords with the Minister. I got a letter from the Department which says that the present lump sum payment of R960 will no longer be paid, but will be used to augment the pension during the last two stages, and similarly the compensation for Bantu will remain unchanged. I want to say that from previous experience of pensions I personally am in complete agreement with the spreading of the benefits. The commutation of pensions, in my experience, which is fairly wide, is that only in exceptional cases is it to the benefit of the man commuting his pension. The Minister explained to us that under Clause 88 there was still provision in deserving cases for a man to commute 50 per cent of his pension, which is about R500, but it can only be given after due consideration and it is not a right. I am in complete agreement with that policy, but where I want to cross swords with the Minister is this. The man was entitled to a lump sum payment of R960. He did not get it and it was then to be spread over his pension in his third or fourth stages. The hon. member for Springs calculated it at being about R10 a month over a number of years, but what will be the position if the man dies within three years? The words I wrote down for my own information are these: If a pensioner is expected to live ten years but lives only three years, is he to receive only 30 per cent of that R960 to which he was entitled, his widow nothing further? I may have read this wrongly, but I do not think so. I think that will be the practical effect, and if that is so I think it must receive the Minister&#x2019;s consideration. It will mean that because the man is unlucky enough to die earlier, his widow suffers. I admit that it is all actuarially calculated, and I am trying to reduce this to simple terms, and the example I gave can possibly be attacked by an actuary, but basically I think it is correct. Of course the whole fund is run on an actuarial basis, but I think this point must receive the Minister&#x2019;s consideration.</p>

<p>Now I want to welcome another thing, and that is the increase in the funeral allowance from R50 to R100. Anybody in this House who has had anything to do with the mining industry will realize that this is rather an extraordinary provision for any man working in a particular industry. The fact that the Government has always considered a man might die at his work is of particular significance. I merely mention it to bring home to the House the conditions under which men in the mining industry work, and nothing can bring this more to their attention that the fact that burial expenses have to form part of the benefits they receive when they can no longer work. Speakers on both sides of the House have stressed that these men have given their all to the industry. This country has ridden on the back of the mining industry for many years, and the health of these men is part of the price we pay.</p>

<p>Another matter I would like the Minister to investigate is the question of the training grants for the dependants of deceased miners. In this Bill the Minister makes provision for an increase in the amount for this purpose from R50,000 to R100,000 per annum, but he also said that it was hoped to extend these benefits as far as university and other specialized <span class="col_6653-6654" refersTo="page_0573"/>training was concerned. The report of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Commissioner for 1961 says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Training Grants: During the year grants were awarded in terms of Section 81 of the Act for technical, commercial or academical training of 781 persons &#x2026;During the year 401 persons completed training courses.</block>

<p>I have made a rough calculation and this works out at something like R60 odd per annum per child. I know education is not very expensive and that this assists them to a large extent, but on the face of it this seems to me a bit niggardly. I do not want to say anything more about it except to ask the Minister to keep his eye on this particular matter.</p>

<p>I want to support the hon. member for Springs in the suggestion that the beginning of the fourth stage should be not 75 per cent but 65 per cent. Again, it is very difficult for men who do not represent mining constituencies to realize how these fellows live when they become ill. Until you see it you cannot realize what it is. The Minister may attack me and say that I am being irresponsible and that I do not realize the financial implications, but I do not think he will do that because it will not be quite fair. I honestly and sincerely think that notwithstanding what the mining industry has said, and the mine workers&#x2019; unions, that 75 per cent is too high a rate for incapacity. Had I been given the opportunity of listening to evidence before a Select Committee, I might have been convinced that these figures are correct, but not having had that opportunity, I am afraid I must stand by what I feel, and again I must admit in all fairness that what I say is not based on actuarial calculations but on ordinary humanitarian considerations.</p>

<p>Finally, I, too, want to deal with this question of the marginal mines and the effect of the pneumoconiosis contributions on their future. The Minister and his predecessor&#x2014;and he personally in the Other Place recently&#x2014;explained that as far as he could see, he could not help the marginal mines except possibly through assistance in the reduction of the pneumoconiosis contributions. He mentioned that these average about 11d. a ton in the marginal mine. That is a considerable amount. The Minister said he was thinking of assisting these marginal mines by reducing their contributions. I sincerely trust that this assistance is not going to be the result of an actuarial calculation which would reduce the liability of the original contributors to the fund. I sincerely hope it will not be that, but that it will be as the result of the Government accepting its own responsibility towards assisting these areas by making a direct contribution to reduce the pneumoconiosis contributions of these mines.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>There is much in this Bill that I welcome. It is very clear also that much intense and very com petent study form the basis of this Bill. I am sure that much research has been done, and to me the legislation is the result of scientific study and research, as the hon. the Minister also told us very clearly in his introductory speech. However, there are two matters in particular I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Other hon. members have already referred to it. I feel less happy about these two aspects. It is clear that all of us are striving to lengthen the lives of those people and to bring about better and more pleasant working conditions for them, in legislation we pass here in the House of Assembly that affects the underground workers in the mines. The one thing we can do to achieve that is to get the person out of the mine, where he is employed in dusty air, sooner. There is only one way of taking a person out of his underground employment sooner, and that is to enable him financially to maintain a proper standard of living for the duration of his life. There is only one way of getting him out of that dusty atmosphere, I repeat, and that is to enable him financially to do so. I know it may be argued that in any other sector of the labour market he must be prepared to work up to a certain age, when he will qualify for a pension. in conditions that are different from the conditions of employment under which the miner has to work. The next question that arises is who should be responsible for making that miner financially able to leave the mine, that mine for which he has sacrificed his health while he was working. Who has to bear that responsibility? We have every sympathy with marginal mines that are having a difficult time, but the mining industry as a whole is not having such a bad time that it cannot enable that miner of his to leave the mine sooner. He need not be afraid then that he will not be able to attract labour forces to his mine; if the conditions of employment are made more attractive and if greater benefits are given to the miner at an earlier stage, more labour will be attracted to the mine. Otherwise than in many other occupations or industries. I should like to say this in regard to the mines, namely that vocational training is not given at schools. I do not know of one miner who has accepted work in a mine out of love for working underground. Circumstances beyond his control have forced him into it. I am not referring to the engineering division; I am not referring to the mine bosses such as mine captains and mine engineers who are trained sometimes to spend more hours above ground than underground. I am referring to the miner whom we know as a miner. I say that that industry for which he has sometimes sacrificed his health should see to it that he leaves the mine sooner. I am very thankful that the hon. the Minister, towards the end of his speech said that he will watch the position. He again referred to the basis of compensation for the miner, but I trust that if amendments are introduced after a year, this matter will be borne in mind very seriously. In this way then the miner <span class="col_6655-6656" refersTo="page_0574"/>will also have the opportunity of getting a small share of the profits he is exploiting and extracting from our soil. To bring that about, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make an urgent plea. I hope that when the Minister replies, he will be able to set my mind at rest in connection with this amount of R960 that is being taken away. I do not feel happy about the fact that this one amount which was given at a certain stage in the past, is now being given at a later stage now. I would urge that as soon as we see our way clear&#x2014;we do not only want to say these things here, we also want to be practical&#x2014;we should enable the miner financially to leave the mine not at the last stage but at the second stage when he has contracted either tuberculosis or pneumoconiosis. I agree also that we should, as far as practically possible, not fix this last stage at 75 per cent. Mr. Speaker, we know the miner; we have lived with him; we know him. By now taking away a sum of money that he could have had at an earlier stage and adding benefits at the later stage, you are simply forcing that man to strive after that diamond that hangs over the precipice, with all the dangers involved. We should also try to imagine the psychological effect this announcement has on the minds of the miner and his wife and his dependants. I am leaving it at that, but I should like once again to plead for greater financial benefits at an earlier stage so that that person may be able to leave the mine earlier.</p>

<p>The one thing I welcome in this Bill and for which I wish to thank the Minister and the draftsmen of the Bill, is the greater benefits now being given for the education of dependants of pneumoconiotics. I am very thankful for that. We notice that the amount has been doubled. In terms of the old Act, the amount that could be appropriated was R50,000, and this Bill now provides for R100,000. I have on a previous occasion under the Vote of the Minister of Mines pleaded for an increase of that amount, and I am very grateful to see it in the new Bill. We are also particularly grateful to see that the field of education is being extended. Formerly it could only be a trade that had been prescribed, and it did not provide for university training or training at a university college. We thank the Minister that education may be permitted in that direction also in future. I wish to say this particularly when I thank the Minister. We should bear in mind that we are extracting wealth from the soil of South Africa that cannot be restored. Every ton of ore we extract from the earth, has been extracted once and for all, and we cannot restore it. Therefore we cannot enrich the earth again otherwise than in respect of agriculture. I hope this amount will be adjusted from time to time and will be increased to enable us to use these children and dependants of pneumoconiotics, this human material, in which we can plough back a part of these profits. There is not one miner who encourages his son ever to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps. We should enable the dependants of this sufferer from a vocational disease that he has contracted in a dusty mine to render service to South Africa in a sphere other than that in which his father has done so, not so much only for the sake of the terror the mine holds for him, but for the sake of the fact that perhaps there will not always be gold mines in South Africa in which he could work. We should now use a part of those profits to enrich the human material in this country. So we thank the Minister for this sum of money that is being granted for the education of the children of pneumoconiotics.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>It is very pleasant to see the measure of agreement in regard to this Bill. I say it is very pleasant, for things are no longer as lively as they perhaps were earlier this afternoon. I should like very much, with reference to a remark by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), to say a few words. With a broad smile he told us that he would very much like to read the Hansard of 1958 to us. He was keen to read to us how the then hon. Minister took him to task because he pleaded that we should have a lung function test. The reason why I am taking him up on that, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that the hon. the Minister at that time never scolded him for that statement, but he scolded him because the hon. member for Rosettenville attacked the Act. He can see it in Col. 104. He attacked the draftsmen of the Act, and said that one would think that all of them suffered from a permanent defect in their heads. That is the reason why the hon. the Minister attacked him. The hon. member knows that; I see how heartily he is laughing. I think it might be as well if I mentioned it. I have to point out to him also that there was a reason in fact why the National Party opposed the old board of appeal, why the National Party no longer wanted an appeal board. It was not that we refused to have a review, but we felt that the type of appeal board that existed, and the manner in which it functioned, were so hopeless that we were not keen to have something similar. That is why the hon. the Minister is now coming along with something which we believe will be better and more effective than that appeal board. I do not think it is necessary for the hon. member to quote Hansard to us.</p>

<p>The hon. member has also said that he should like to see the stages being changed, not from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, but from 20 per cent to 40 per cent, 50 per cent, 65 per cent. He made the remark that if 50 per cent of your respiratory capacity is impaired then you are, as he expressed it, only half a human being. I am not an expert such as he is, but I want to submit that that is an erroneous statement. If someone has an impairment of 50 per cent of his respiratory capacity, then he is not half a human being by far. The hon. member and the other hon. members who referred to it, are confusing it with the idea of 50 per cent working capacity. It is something completely different. I contend that if you have a 50 per cent loss of <span class="col_6657-6658" refersTo="page_0575"/>lung function, you are not half a human being by far, but you can still do much good work. Another aspect he referred to is that he should stop working at 65 per cent instead of 75 per cent. If we knew enough about that figure, we could perhaps argue. But if we were to discharge workers who have lost 65 per cent of their lung function, I wonder if that is what the miners will want, for that is what it is going to mean. According to the hon. member the man who has 65 per cent impairment of his lung function should be declared unfit and discharged. I do not believe that any miner will thank me if I were to vote in favour of his leaving his employment so much earlier. We should remember that where we now have the figure of 75 per cent, it is somewhat earlier already than the old fourth stage. I do not know whether I am expressing myself well, but if a person is certified as 75 per cent impairment of his respiratory capacity, I say it happens earlier than he would be certified to-day under the old fourth stage. If we were to reduce it still further to 65 per cent, then I am afraid we shall have to discharge too many of those people against their wishes. If we have to discharge them and we can pay them higher pensions, I am in favour of it. I do not think there is a single member here who would not like to see higher pensions. But when we are discussing these things, we must try to remain within the limits of possibilities. That is why I say we must be careful and not just play with figures here. The hon. member also asked, if I understood him correctly, that two lay members should serve on the reviewing committee. Perhaps I misunderstood him, but that is how I understood him. I do not know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to that will be. but on my part I should like to ask him to to accept such a proposal. I for my part should like to point out that an impossible situation will arise when a reviewing committee is sitting and when there are two lay members present when they are discussing the case of a patient. Firstly those laymen will not understand a thing about the whole matter. Both of them will be a nil on a contract. In addition those two members will be embarrassed for the doctors will talk about things they know nothing about. They will be very seriously embarrassed. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, it is not the custom of doctors to discuss the intimate affairs of their patients&#x2014;and it will be intimate affairs when they are concerned with a borderline case&#x2014;in the presence of laymen. So I hope the hon. the Minister will not accede to that request.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) made a further statement, and said that at the fourth stage the majority of the people receive attendant&#x2019;s allowances, with the result that very few of them will benefit from this extra amount what is now being granted to persons in the fourth stage. I do not want to create the impression that I do not want a fourth stage person to get more. I should like to give him more. But I say than when you are dealing with these things, your facts must be correct. The hon. member for Springs has pleaded and made this statement, namely that the majority of your fourth stage sufferers will receive an attendant&#x2019;s allowance in any event. I say that is not so, less than half receive it. The correct figures is 1,003 fourth stage sufferers of whom 444 receive the attendant&#x2019;s allowance. 559 do not get it, and they will get the benefit of the extra R15 per month. Those are the facts. If someone asks for more, I shall be prepared to support it if it is possible, but your facts have to be correct when you come along with arguments. I myself feel sorry for these 444 and my sincere hope and wish is that something can be done for those people. I know everybody desires that. There is not one of us who does not keenly wish it. When I say that, Sir, I should like to emphasize once again that I think all of us feel satisfied about the new reviewing committee for which provision is being made in this Bill. I am sure that all the miners will accept it as a step in the right direction. There were difficulties and problems always. If we study the various reports of Allen, Beyers and Oosthuizen, we shall come to the conclusion that all of them decded that too much emphasis is laid in an examination on the X-ray examination, and too little on the clinical examination. There was a time when silicosis and pulmonary diseases were regarded as two distinct diseases. The Oosthuizen Committee stated the matter very clearly and pointed out that in fact it is one conception, and that the one is the result of the other. The committee very clearly showed that the grading of these diseases should not be based on the extent of the X-ray plate alone, but that it should really be based on the clinical finding. That is why they decided that a lung function test should be put into operation. In those days when the committee came along with its findings, the feeling still was that the lung function tests had perhaps not yet been developed to that extent, but during the past five/six years we have reached that stage&#x2014;although there still are differences of opinion&#x2014;that experts consider that you can determine up to 1 per cent of the impairment of the lung function. The experts maintain that we shall be able to do so within 5 per cent with the methods they intend applying under this Act. That is why I say that we can be glad that we are getting away from the old method of grading according to the working method, for at the best of times it was based on the X-ray plates and guess-work. That is why there was so much difference of opinion and that is why so many mistakes were made. I am convinced that when we introduce these new methods, so many mistakes will not be made. For in the first place the doctor is not required to indicate the impairment to the nearest one or two per cent. A wide margin is left of 1 per cent to 20 per cent, as we know, from 20 per cent to 50 per cent and 50 per cent to 75 per cent. A very wide margin has been left so that the chances of making a mistake <span class="col_6659-6660" refersTo="page_0576"/>are not so great. Apart from that the doctor still retains his clinical methods. He has the history of the patient and he still uses his X-ray methods and he still retains his discretion. And that is an important aspect, Mr. Speaker. When I say that this method that will now be applied is a very much better method, I should like to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister. I should like to ask him to use his influence to see to it that the doctors who do the certifying should bear two things in mind. The one is sympathetic dealing with the patient. The other is that the principle should be maintained that if there is any doubt as regards the disease or the degree of the disease, the doctor should give the worker the benefit of that doubt. I have reason to ask that, Mr. Speaker. I want to say very clearly that I am not here to launch an attack on the certifying committee, which consists of leading persons. But the fact remains that because we are human beings, your best methods can make mistakes. The fact remains that we are dealing here not with mathematical acts, but with human beings. The fact of the matter is that you cannot measure diseases and people with mathematical precision. That is why I ask that if there is any doubt, the worker should get the benefit of that doubt. I am doing so on the basis of cases we have come across. I am mindful of persons who cannot walk 30 paces without some discomfort, but they have not been certified. I am not blaming the doctor, but they have not been certified because it could not be proved that the person was suffering from pneumoconiosis in spite of the fact that he had all kinds of treatments in hospital and in spite of the fact that he was stopped from working underground, all of which indicated that there was a very strong suspicion; in spite of the fact that his father was suffering similarly and that it was only ascertained after his death. I am not taking that as an exceptional case. If you look at the latest annual report of the bureau, at page 10, you will see that of 37 persons examined and not certified, it was found that all of them were suffering from an advanced degree of pneumoconiosis. After the films had been checked it was found that 24 of these 37 persons could and should have been certified three to 12 months ago already. It is here I wish to thank the hon. the Minister for the remarks he made in regard to miniature X-rays. I want to submit it has some bearing on this picture. I know it is a very sore point with the miner. I know he will appreciate it if this particular aspect could receive attention. I mention another case from this annual report. Reference is made here to 105 persons who were not certified, but who were found to be pneumoconiotics after their death. According to this report, there were 26.7 per cent whose X-ray films showed that they had suffered from this disease. In the case of 77, nothing could be ascertained during their lives. I repeat that mistakes can be made. It has been provided that even with the best tests it was claimed that 77 persons had nothing wrong with them, yet they were suffering from the disease. That is why I ask the Minister to try, because there will always be borderline cases, because there will always be cases that will fall within the discretion of the doctor, that the accepted policy of the doctors should be that they will not refuse a certificate unless they can prove that the patient is not suffering from pneumoconiosis; that they should never refuse a certificate because they cannot prove the contrary.</p>

<p>I should like to make a few remarks in regard to research in medical treatment. In 1956 we put the house in order. Now we are dealing with legislation that improves the Act of 1956. I think that as the National Party Government has always been known as the friend of the mine worker, it is the opportunity for the Government now to show that it is also his father and doctor. That is why I should like to make a very strong plea. As the principle is laid down in Clause 102, I think, that money should be set aside for research in medical treatment, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to see that this will not become just the dead letter of the law, but that effect will be given to it. I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that research be done not only in connection with the prevention of pneumoconiosis as regards underground ventilation etc. but that very much more research should be done as regards the cure itself. I think it is necessary that the requisite facilities be established in Johannesburg, and I think it is important that similar facilities be established on the Free State goldfields, so that research may be conducted in regard to the prevention of pneumoconiosis with the patient as such. It should be ascertained whether we cannot delay the disease which is progressive&#x2014;progressive in another sense. We should conduct research in order to determine whether those sufferers cannot be transferred to other types of work. I think it is necessary. We know that certain experiments are being conducted in countries such as Australia and Canada. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to send officials to go and see what is being done over there. I conclude by urging that we should devote much more attention to the cure of the pneumoconiotic. The fact is that from the medical point of view we are dealing with the flower of the country</p>

<p>here. They are healthy young men we are sending underground in the mines. When we send them down there, we already know what the end is going to be. In the meantime</p>

<p>we may as well sign the certificate and that</p>

<p>is exactly what we are doing. After so many years we diagnose the disease, we hang a label on the man&#x2019;s neck and for practical purposes that is all we do. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that that is quite wrong. So far as I know, there is only one small place at the General Hospital in Johannesburg&#x2014;I withdraw my words if I am wrong&#x2014;where these people undergo special treatment. I want to urge that at every hospital a ward or two should be placed <span class="col_6661-6662" refersTo="page_0577"/>at the disposal of the experts. If we cannot do so in all hospitals, let us then do so at the East Rand and West Rand and at Klerksdorp, at Odendaalsrust, Welkom and Barberton. We must have places where people who have special knowledge of the matter can give the pneumoconiotic the necessary treatment. Treatment can be given; lung exercises can be given; medicaments can be used by inhaling etc. Instruction can be given in regard to the use of cigarettes and alcohol etc. We must help to save manpower for our country. We cannot afford to waste our manpower in the way we are doing to-day. I submit that if we tackle this matter properly, we shall be able to keep a man in the mine for from five to ten years longer. We must be able to contrive it, so that he and his wife and his dependants may have the happiness of being able to live together longer and in health.</p>
