<p>Mr. Speaker, apart from the taxation proposals, we are only effecting one amendment to the Excise Act which is of importance. I am referring to the provision that the Commissioner, where circumstances justify it, may grant an extension of payment of excise duty. The fact that there is no such provision in the Excise Act makes it very difficult to administer the Act. In order to afford the public the necessary relief in deserving cases, we are now inserting such a provision. The Customs Act already contains a corresponding provision and the provision in this Bill has been taken over word for word as <span class="col_8469-8470" refersTo="page_1481"/>far as possible from the Customs Act. As in the case of the customs provision, provision is also made that all exciseable goods or instruments for the manufacture of exciseable goods in possession of or under the control of the debtor shall be subject to a lien until the amount due has been paid. The object of this safeguard, of course, is to do away with the necessity of providing any bond or other form of security.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a very short Bill. It is intended mainly to give effect to the taxation proposals which were fully discussed in Committee of Ways and Means. I do not propose to say more about them except to repeat that the Bill contains exemptions in respect of books which were announced in the amending notice of the taxation proposals on 21 May. The exemptions in respect of certain approved religious magazines, educational readers and books which have also been published in hard covers, will be contained in Government Notices which will be published on the same date as the amending Act. The Bill also contains certain other amendments which are of minor importance. These amendments are explained in notes which I have given to hon. members interested on both sides of the House. They are mostly of an administrative nature. If hon. members should like some more information regarding any of these amendments I shall be pleased to explain them.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>We do not object to the second reading of this Bill. We would reiterate the remarks made during the Committee Stage of Ways and Means when we took exception to the increase of certain tariffs, increases which were not recommended by the Board of Trade. We feel that when the Board of Trade makes a recommendation and the Bill provides for increases in excess of those recommended by the Board of Trade or increases contrary to the recommendations of the Board of Trade, we should voice our protest. It is significant at a time when the Minister of Economic Affairs is overseas to see what he can save from the European Common Market, we should be increasing tariffs. As the Minister well knows the European Common Market is concerned with lowering the tariff walls and here we are increasing the tariff walls, and increasing them to an extent beyond that recommended by the Board of Trade. We feel that our protests against these increases should go on record. These increases will have the effect of increasing costs and the burden will fall on the worker and the man in the street who can ill afford to carry it.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to support the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) in regard to the increase in duties particularly in regard to those items which are not available from South African manufacturers. I think there is no argument about it and both sides of the House are fully agreed that where goods are manufactured in South Africa there should be protection. But there are items on which duties have been increased which are not available. Thereby it becomes a pure taxation measure, a pure means of raising revenue, at the expense of increasing the cost of living. Particularly for the poorer people of South Africa, who have to make their own clothing, many of these duties which have been increased of late, can have a serious effect on their cost of living. I have taken out a list at random of items which have gone up from 30 per cent to 40 per cent over the last week. In the case of one item costing 1s. 1d. at the factory an increase of 40 per cent will mean that it will now cost 35c wholesale whereas its price used to be 27c. A cotton mixture poplin which used to be 36c will now be 49c. These are increases which affect particularly the mothers of children, the mothers who have to make the clothes for those children. These are basic staple materials. School spun has gone up from 50c to 60c per yard. This is necessary for the making of most girls&#x2019; dresses for school. So I can list item by item. These are not items which are available from any South African source. They are not luxury items; they are essential items, essential for the average and lower income wage-earning families. I feel it would be wrong to allow this measure to pass without placing on record our concern that blanket increases are being imposed without regard to availability in South Africa and without regard to the effect on the cost of living.</p>

<p>There is one other point, Mr. Speaker, and that is the question&#x2014;it could fall within the terms of this Bill&#x2014;of goods at sea, goods already ordered&#x2014;goods which were already <span class="col_8471-8472" refersTo="page_1482"/>ordered at the time the increase was imposed. There are many small firms which are often almost crippled by being caught with consignments at sea. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether, although this matter has been considered before, he will not reconsider the question of whether goods in transit should not fall under these increases. They were bought at an expected price and at an expected landing cost and the increased duty will now have to be paid on them. In many cases this amounts to an amount which cannot be afforded by the importer. I hope the Minister will give us some information in regard to his attitude to that matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the remarks made by the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell), I may say that it is quite true that all the increases in tariffs which we have here, were not recommended by the Board of Trade. But increases in tariffs are not merely for protective purposes. There are two other purposes which are no concern of the Board of Trade. The first is the question of revenue and the second is the question of the saving of currency on unnecessary imports. Those are matters which belong to the Treasury. The Board of Trade is not concerned there. There are also many exemptions and rebates granted in the Second and Third Schedules which in some cases were not made on the recommendation of the Board of Trade. There is one case which I know of in this Bill where actually the Board of Trade and the Department of Economic Affairs were not in agreement. We considered the matter on its merits and we decided that the case of the Department of Economic Affairs was very strong. We then acted against the recommendation of the Board of Trade. That is one case in which it was a question of protection.</p>

<p>As I have said the Bill contains many clauses which give concessions. Schedules Two and Three contain concessions; either industrial rebates in Schedule Two or general rebates in Schedule Three. We cannot be guided solely by what the Board of Trade have to say on these matters. There is the question of currency which is a Treasury matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the Minister a question? Isn&#x2019;t the question of the saving of currency a matter which can be dealt with under import controls rathers than by increasing tariffs?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>No, not necessarily. As a matter of fact, I think if you want to save currency, it is sounder to do it by tariffs than by import control. But you can do it either way. It is a question of taste. I think the better way is to do it by tariffs. Anyway, where we had to increase tariffs we saw to it that it was only on the more expensive type of article. Even if it is not made here, we say we do not want that imported. If it is made here, of course, then there is very good justification. Even if it is not made here, if it is a luxury article, an article on which the imports are of a luxury nature such as fancy combs, etc., we frame the duty in such a way that it will not catch the ordinary product but only the luxury type of the same kind. That is generally the pattern which we have followed here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) asked me about consignments in transit. That is a matter which we have thrashed out before. When you have to impose duties it is simply impossible to say that there will be exemptions in the case of goods in transit. From an administrative point of view that is very difficult to control. The whole substance of import duties is that it should be made effective from a certain date, usually the date of the Budget. You cannot have another date to cover the date of dispatch of the goods. On the other hand, I have to point out to the hon. member that is not always against the importer. If during the Budget speech or during the Budget debate certain concessions are granted, whether by way of exemptions or by way of rebates, even if the goods are already on the way to South Africa the importers get the advantage of that. So when there is a disadvantage they must also take that.</p>

<p>Clauses of the Bill put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On the First Schedule,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I would like some clarity from the Minister in regard to Item 284. I do not want to repeat the arguments I submitted to the Minister in regard to this tax in the Committee of Ways and Means, but I would like to get some clarity from him in respect of one statement he made, that he proposes to give certain exemptions in respect of certain types of literature published in paper-back form. The Minister said in his speech that he would in the Third Schedule indicate the nature of the rebate and the exemption that would be granted, but I understand now that the Minister, in terms of the original Act, has the power to add to the Third Schedule by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i>, in terms of Section 100 of the principal Act. I would like to ask the Minister whether he can give an indication now as to the nature and the form of the exemption which will be granted in respect of the type of paper-back he referred to, which could come in duty free if it had formerly been published in hard-cover form.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which I think the Minister did not consider in attempting to justify the tax in the Committee of Ways and Means. I would like to refer the Minister to <i>Government Gazette</i> 8 December 1961, which lists items for which an import permit must be obtained, and certain exemptions are stated <span class="col_8473-8474" refersTo="page_1483"/>where import permits will not be granted, and one of them is the type of books and publications listed in Item 284 here. The Minister has said that one of the reasons for the tax is to apply a form of censorship and restrictive measures on the importation of trash. But I want to put to him that in Item 284, it states quite clearly in this Government Notice, that books and printed music, newspapers and periodicals are included, but excluding the following, which includes all unauthorized prints of any copyright works the importation of which is prohibited, magazines and periodical publications of a class or kind embracing science fiction, fantastic stories, detective stories, sex, westerns, love, and true confession stories and similar publications, publications commonly known as comics, publications which present the narrative mainly in pictorial form and back numbers of magazines and periodical publications of whatsoever nature shipped on a date more than two months from the date of issue. This is in the <i>Government Gazette</i> 8 December, Item 284. Paragraph 1 says that the following groups are hereby exempted from the provisions of the Government Notice and may be imported into the Republic of South Africa from any country without an import permit, and it states what may be imported without import permit, namely books, printed music and newspapers and periodicals.</p>

<p>That has nothing to do with the rebate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it has, in this sense, that what I have read out here are the exempted items which fall into the broad category which the Minister may not tax.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>They could be imported. It has nothing to do with the duty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>They cannot be imported. That is the point. That is why I draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this, for this reason, that the Minister seeks to apply this tax as a means of restricting the entry of certain publications, as a form of censorship in respect of certain types of literature, and not merely as a means of raising revenue. I want clarity from the Minister. Either this tax is imposed as a means of raising revenue or as a means of censorship, and we have had no clarity on that at all. As we stated, we are opposed to the principle of taxing literature.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>But we are surely entitled to move the deletion of this item. We are asked to approve this tax and I take it I can state reasons why I do not think it can be imposed. But I have stated these reasons before and I do not wish to repeat them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The question of censorship has nothing to do with this item.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Then let me put it this way. If this type of literature which the Minister taxes to raise revenue is already under import control and the importation is virtually restricted and it cannot be imported without a permit, then what is the object of imposing a tax of this nature from a revenue-earning point of view? How much revenue can be derived from it? That is why I raise the matter to get clarity from the Minister.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet, may I point out to the Minister that under Item D it says soft-covered fiction books and booklets not being books in leather covers, and under 2 (a) it says periodicals, fiction consisting predominantly of a single complete novel or story in a single issue. Those two items are taxed. The rest are exempted, it clearly states in this notice that in respect of certain types listed by the Minister, which he now wants to tax, that that type of literature cannot be brought in without an import permit. May I point out that in many cases import permits are not granted unless the Department of Education has approved of the articles as being a suitable type of publication to be imported. But if the publication consists predominantly of one story, then in terms of this item it must be taxed. The effect is that many of those publications are not imported unless there has been prior approval by the Department of Education. I put this to the Minister: Why tax it as a means of restriction, or of raising revenue, because in principle it is a bad tax and one which can cause a great deal of harm. What we are asked to do here is to approve of a tax which may be greatly extended in future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>In the Committee of Ways and Means we objected to this item in principle and we propose to continue our objection because we think the principle is unsound, even though the tax may be for revenue-raising purposes, and I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit tariff Item No. 284.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to Item 284, I want to make a few remarks. Apparently there is not much clarity, or a superabundance of it, on the other side in regard to the matter. The position is this. The point put by the hon. member for Turffontein is that there is an import ban on certain of these soft-cover books, and what is the use of taxing them because there will not be anything to tax? That is how I understood his argument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Of this undesirable nature.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>There will <span class="col_8475-8476" refersTo="page_1484"/>not be anything to tax, because all the types of books I said should be taxed cannot be imported. Well, the answer is quite simple. The import control may be removed tomorrow. I do not know whether the import control is as wide as the articles which I want to tax within the taxation net and therefore I have to take these measures that I am taking here. I want to make it clear that if the amendment of the hon. member for Pinetown is adopted and Item 284 is deleted, it might mean that all the goods mentioned in Item 284 will now become dutiable under Item 335, at 20 per cent <i>ad valorem</i>. So I do not know whether the hon. member has considered that possibility.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Do you suggest that it will be, or that it may be?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I say that if Item 284 is deleted, these goods will become dutiable under Item 335. The hon. member shakes his head, but that is what I am instructed is the position by people who know more about it than I do.</p>

<p>The other point I wanted to make is this. I do not want to discuss the principle, whether this impost is one for the protection of morals or to protect foreign currency or simply for revenue-earning purposes. I have already explained that. We are not imposing a ban. It can be imported, but when it is imported, a certain type of soft-cover novel should at least make a contribution to the Treasury. We say that is the type of thing on which we can save foreign currency, because it is an unnecessary importation, and if we cannot stop it completely by the tax we can at any rate make them contribute to the coffers of the country. That is our attitude and I do not want to go into it further, because it is not really relevant to this discussion.</p>

<p>I said that there is a lot of misunderstanding in regard to what I said in the Committee of Ways and Means, in regard to what I said I proposed doing. I have already explained that there are two broad categories of books which are not in the exemptions in the item but which will be introduced in the Third Schedule as a rebate&#x2014;not as an exemption but as a rebate. Hon. members will know that Schedule 1 deals with tariffs, with duties payable. Schedule 2 deals with industrial rebates, and Schedule 3 deals with general rebates. So in Item 284 in the First Schedule we impose a duty with certain exemptions, and then in the Third Schedule we will introduce a rebate on two broad classes of books, namely series of religious books and educational readers, and secondly books which have already appeared in hard-cover form. That will be done by proclamation, and when it is proclaimed, the hon. member will see in this Bill we have all the proclamations made in the course of the year. They are now embodied in this Bill. This proclamation which I am now issuing after the Committee of Ways and Means&#x2014;we could not introduce it there because it was a technical matter and we were not ready to draft it yet&#x2014;but this will now appear in next year&#x2019;s Customs Act as part of the Third Schedule, but in the meantime it has the effect of law, just like all the others which are now formally approved and in respect of which proclamations have been issued from time to time, some almost a year ago. The position is now that from 21 March, when I made that statement in my Budget speech, all these soft-cover books were dutiable until 23 May, when there was the amended proposal in the Committee of Ways and Means. From that date only those which were not exempted were dutiable. From the date when this proclamation appears there will be these rebates, a third class, and they will be able to get a rebate if they are imported in future, but in the meantime, from 21 March, many of these books which will in future carry no duty, if they were cleared in the meantime, would have carried duty. But the point is that in future when this proclamation is issued&#x2014;and it will be issued simultaneously with the promulgation of this Act&#x2014;provision will be made for what I have said here, namely for these two broad classes of books. There will naturally also be provisions as to under what circumstances the rebate will be granted. I think that will appear in the proclamation also. For instance, the rebate can be granted provided (a) evidence to the above effect is submitted to the proper officer on demand, (b) a certificate signed by the publisher of such soft-cover book is produced to the officer in respect of every consignment of such books, (c) such book is not packed or enclosed with any other books not entitled to this rebate, and (d) a package or parcel containing such soft-cover books imported by post is clearly marked as to its contents. Something on these lines will be incorporated in the proclamations. It will not be an exemption, but a rebate. It would be dutiable ordinarily, but in terms of this proclamation the whole duty may be rebated&#x2014;not a part of it only, but the whole duty, and it will then come in free of tax. I want to say again that this step we have taken on those two big categories removes the points which worried the book trade also, and the Book Trade Association of South Africa have helped us in framing this distinction. They admitted that the &#x201C;Library Series&#x201D; was one of the most dangerous series and the most unnecessary to import, and the most clear example of an unnecessary wastage of foreign currency. But they also said that there was a counterpart to that series in a religious library series, which one would like to exclude if we could find a formula for doing it. In regard to (b), i.e. books which have appeared in hard covers, the final draft is not ready yet, but it will be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> amending the Third Schedule to the Customs Act, as the Minister is empowered to do by Section 100 of that Act. It is intended to provide for the rebate of the whole duty on any soft-cover fiction book being an abridged or unabridged version of any book published for unrestricted <span class="col_8477-8478" refersTo="page_1485"/>sales in hard covers at the same time in the same language by any publisher in the country of export. Both these notices, in regard to the religious series and the educational series, and the one in regard to hard covers, will become operative on the date of the promulgation of the Amendment Act.</p>

<p>We made our point of view quite clear when we discussed ways and means. It should be unnecessary to add anything to that. Now the Minister says there is not a superabundance of clarity on this side of the House. There is certainly not a superabundance of understanding on the part of the Minister, and certainly no great generosity on his part. We put the position quite clearly, but now we are faced with the threat that should we persist in our original amendment and point of view, it might mean that under Item 335 worse things might befall us.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Now the hon. member for Pinetown has met that situation. We have explained that this tax on literature is absolutely unnecessary, not because it may mean the thin end of the wedge, but because it is not intelligent taxation. It involves censorship, to begin with. The book has to be described under 1 (d), where we have the 5c tax. Here we are asked not to define the book but to define the exemptions, and surely that is not good taxation, to define the exemptions to any tax but not the article that is taxed? I mentioned earlier that only English language hooks are concerned. If the Minister wishes to tax trash, then tax all trash in the country, whether it comes in or whether it is produced &#x201C;here because, believe me, there is plenty of trash produced in this country in Afrikaans and in English.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to come back to the remarks of the Minister in regard to the rebates that he will now give under this tax in regard to certain classes of literature. The Minister has made it clear that in regard to educational and religious books there is no difficulty. They will not be taxed and will get the rebate when they are imported. But in respect of the second class, fiction published in paper-back form, fiction is not necessarily of a western nature; it can be of a classical nature. All that will be subject to taxation. The Minister is going to give one rebate, namely that if any of those books have formerly been published with a hard cover, then on the certificate of the publisher or importer he will give a rebate. What will happen in fact? In the first place, the publisher importing books has to make a declaration that that particular publication was originally published in hard-cover form. The Minister therefore says that merely by virtue of the fact that a book has been published with a hard cover it can come in duty free. I want to put this to the Minister. There are books written in fiction, of a classical nature, which have never been published with a hard cover. On those books a duty will have to be paid, but a book which is sheer rubbish but which has been published with a hard cover can come in duty free. How is the importer going to know, when he gets offered a number of titles, whether they have been published in hardcover form or not? He will have to have an investigation carried out overseas to show that it has been published with a hard cover. But if a particularly good piece of literature originated abroad in paper-back form, because that is the modern trend in publishing, it is taxed, but a piece of rubbish, even of pornographic nature, can come in duty free because it was originally published in a hard cover. In fact, the Minister is placing a premium on trash because it will now pay any publisher to import any trash if he can merely prove that it was published in a hard cover. But the position will be even more ludicrous. The Minister challenged me in ways and means and said that the greater bulk of this type of literature comes in through the Dost, but what will we have now? The publisher who can certify that the book was published in hard-cover form brings in the publication free of duty, but the thousands of citizens who join book clubs and get books from overseas will have to pay a higher duty than the man who buys it in South Africa from the publisher, merely because the publisher certifies that it was published in a hard cover. How is the ordinary individual to know this? So all you will have is a discriminatory tax where certain persons will be paying a higher price for the same thing than others. If you examine the difficulties connected with this type of tax, you run into a ludicrous situation because the Minister will have endless trouble and there will be the <span class="col_8479-8480" refersTo="page_1486"/>application of a discriminatory tax on literature.</p>

<p>But there is still another aspect. On the Continent in France, Germany, Holland and Italy and many other countries, the majority of publications never appear in hard-cover form, but in paper-back form. The effect is there are many world-famous writers whom I could name whose books are not published in hardcover form and therefore anybody wishing to purchase them in South Africa has to pay a tax. Is that fair and reasonable? I mention this to the Minister because in terms of the description he has read out here&#x2014;and I can assure the Minister that there is consternation in the book trade about this definition. The feeling is that if the Minister wants to give a rebate of this nature, the fairest way to do it would be to say that if a book had formerly been published and sold at a certain price it will be exempted. By far the fairest way to determine this would be to say that books published abroad at a retail figure of, say 10s., 11s. or 12s., will then get the rebate exemption that the hon. the Minister wishes to grant in respect of this taxation. If the Minister would like examples of high-quality literature in paper-back form which has never been printed in hard-cover form but which in fact would retail in this country at 7s., 8s. or 9s. I would be very happy to submit to the Minister many examples of that type of literature. But in fact because they have never been published in hard-cover form, their price will now be loaded as far as the reading public of South Africa is concerned, merely by virtue of the fact that they have never been published in a hard cover. The fact that the Minister has had to make all these exemptions and allow for rebates that he is going to grant, clearly indicates that the revenue which this tax was originally designed to produce&#x2014;and the Minister has admitted that this tax was conceived as a means of censorship, not as a means of raising revenue; the Minister&#x2019;s Budget statement is absolutely clear in that regard &#x2026;</p>

<p>Fourth Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for Second Reading,&#x2014;Liquor Amendment Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Justice, adjourned on 18 June, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I feel that this Bill is aimed at giving control over the supply of liquor to the Coloureds in their own areas, but it also does other things as well. It increases the facilities for Coloured to obtain liquor in their own areas, and it also takes liquor nearer to their homes. I think everyone who knows the Western Province realizes that there is a pattern at the present time by which the liquor licence houses, particularly those supplying the Coloureds, are centred at certain points, usually strategic points, at which they catch the Coloureds as they come from their work over the week-end and get their money away from them before they are able to get to their homes and hand it over to their wives to buy bread and clothing for their children. The effect of this Bill will be to take the liquor nearer to those homes. In recent years, especially now with the development of new Coloured areas, the Coloureds have been developing some very beautiful suburbs and some very beautiful homes and large numbers of them take pride in those homes. What I am concerned about is this: This Bill makes provision for the issuing of licences&#x2014;how licences may be issued to Coloureds in their own areas&#x2014;but I cannot see in the Bill any means whereby objections can be lodged by those in those areas who do not want licences issued in their areas. I can quite picture a certain number&#x2014;ten or a dozen Coloureds&#x2014;thinking that they can make some money in a Coloured area, following the correct procedure and succeeding in having a licence granted for that particular area, but the people in those areas may not want their homes to be nearer to these licensed premises. I think anyone who knows the Western Province will realize that it would be surprising if Coloured children brought up in those areas where you have a concentration of these liquor licences, turned out other than juvenile deliquents as they grew up, because the whole atmosphere in those areas on a Friday afternoon and Saturday morning is certainly not the sort of atmosphere which anyone in this House would like to have near his home. I know for certain that there are large numbers of Coloured people who do not want those licensed premises to be near to their homes. I should like therefore to know from the Minister whether the fact that no provision is made in this Bill for the procedure to be followed by those who do not want licences to be issued in those areas to lodge their objection, means that they are debarred from making any such objection or whether one can take it for granted that the normal procedures under the existing Liquor Act are sufficient to provide procedures by which they can object if they wish to do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>In the first instance, I wish to express my gratitude to hon. members on both sides of the House for the way in which this Bill has been received and the way in which it has been discussed. I am saying this particularly in respect of the main speaker on that side, the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). I think the way in which the hon. member has approached the Bill and the views he has expressed on this Bill, have greatly contributed to maintaining the level of this discussion and I wish to express my gratitude to the hon. member for the attitude he has adopted.</p>

<p>I now wish to reply to the arguments which the hon. member has advanced in a very reasonable manner. In the first instance the hon. member argued that it was somewhat unreasonable that a Coloured person had to pay R150 for a licence in this case whereas we demanded a much higher amount, namely R10,000 from the White person. I think the hon. member will agree with me when I say, in the first instance, that there is, of course, a very big difference between the capital resources of the two groups, and in the second instance, the hon. member will also admit that in the case of the Whites this is an amount which once having paid it, makes it worth their while because it ensures a monopoly to them for many years as it were. The hon. member also knows that it was mainly in respect of the large centres that this amount had to be paid. I think that this amount which they have paid has been justified over and over again by the profits they have made. The hon. member will also remember that in that connection it was mainly limited to such areas as Johannesburg, Germiston and other large towns in the Transvaal. In that connection the hon. member will also remember that the Coloureds there have never yet had the right to purchase liquor as they have in the Western Province. In other words, if we grant liquor licences to the Coloureds in their own areas, we are not depriving the White trader of anything which he had formerly&#x2014;because they could only obtain it by way of a permit&#x2014;but we are giving an additional right to the Coloured people, a right which they have never had before and consequently we are not causing any damages to the Whites in this connection. I am grateful to the hon. member for agreeing with us that it would have been wrong in principle had we adopted the attitude that only the Whites could have a monopoly in the liquor trade. In this connection I wish to express my gratitude to members on both sides of the House. I do not think we can adopt that attitude and I am very grateful that not a single member has adopted that attitude.</p>

<p>That brings me at once to the objection raised by the hon. member for East London (North) (Mr. Field) who has just spoken. The hon. member asked me whether people could <span class="col_8483-8484" refersTo="page_1488"/>still object. My reply is that people can still object, if not more so than in the past because these objections can now be lodged with the National Liquor Board, which is one body, instead of raising them at the various liquor licensing courts, as was the position in the past. I am convinced, as I said in my second reading speech, that because we intend granting these licences as provided for in the Act, you will no longer have mere drinking places in the ordinary sense of the word, as you indeed have them here and there to-day where the Coloureds have to buy their liquor, but that they will be more dignified places where food will be provided under hygienic and decent conditions. As a result fewer evils will result than would otherwise have been the case. The hon. member also referred to the atmosphere. A much better atmosphere will prevail than in the past.</p>

<p>If I may return to the hon. member for Durban (Point), Sir, I wish to say to him that on a previous occasion I granted an interview to the advocates of the following associations: The Western Province Bottle Storekeepers and Off-sale Licences Association and the Cape Licensed Victuallers and Hotelkeepers. I had previously granted an interview to their advocates and in spite of the limited time at my disposal I also once again met their advocate, attorney and I think six of their members yesterday. I discussed this Bill with them and listened to their objections and I think I can say to the House, that as far as the broad principles are concerned, we fully understand each other. Those bodies informed me that as far as the principle was concerned, they had no objection to the Bill. They asked me for assurances in regard to objections similar to those raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point). <i>Inter alia</i>. I gave them the positive assurance that in no circumstances would the Government lay down a cheaper price for liquor in the Coloured areas than the price which obtains to-day in the White areas. In other words, as far as it is within my power to prevent it, there will be no difference in the price. Hon. members who are acquainted with the liquor trade will know, of course, that that is not always within my power and that there are many wheels within wheels in the liquor trade. In other words, we will not cut the throats of existing licensees by allowing anything like that, as far as it is within our power to do so. I also want to state very clearly to hon. members that the general policy is&#x2014;and I do not think anybody will find fault with it&#x2014;apart from those people who have rights within the half-mile limit, not to allow any further movements within that half-mile area. When I had discussions with the Coloured people they expressed their appreciation of the attitude that no further White licences will be issued in those areas; and because they appreciate that; they are also pleased about it that as far as practically possible, Coloured licences must not encroach on that half-mile area either, thus coming into unfair competition with the White licensees. In other words, the Coloureds have asked us to apply the same yardstick to them which we are applying to the Whites, because they do not want to use their situation to do business in unfair competition with existing White licence holders. I think that is a reasonable attitude. Just as you cannot apply it in the case of White licences, you will, of course, not be able always to apply it in the case of Coloured licences because if the Coloured area, for example, is only half a mile wide you will naturally find yourself in a position where you will of necessity have to cross the border in places, but those will be the exceptions. I will request the board that where that is the position it should not grant authorities if it would place the licence holder in direct competition with existing White licensees who have already acquired vested rights in that area; in other words, to keep the licences as far apart from one another as practically possible. As a matter of fact, that is also how the Coloureds see the position. Both the hon. member and the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) referred to the use of the word &#x201C;association&#x201D; in this connection. I do not think that can give rise to any problem because it has been taken over from Section 67 of the old Liquor Act and consequently I do not think there will be any difficulty in that connection. I want to say clearly to the hon. member for Durban (Point)&#x2014;I will move an amendment to this effect in the Committee Stage to-morrow&#x2014;that where we talk of an association of Coloured people or an association of Indian, there is no doubt about it whatsoever&#x2014;and I am sorry if this Bill has perhaps given rise to such a doubt and that is why I will put it right in the Committee Stage&#x2014;that no White person can obtain an interest in it; in other words, that association, whether it is in the form of a company or in any other form, must in any case consist of Coloureds or Asiatics; the people who are concerned, the shareholders and partners, etc. must belong to that group. But apart from the provisions of this Bill, in terms of the Group Areas Act it is impossible for Whites to acquire an interest in that association. The law provides that if, contrary to the provisions of this Act, it nevertheless appears that White people circumvent the law in some way or other or find loopholes and acquire an interest in such an association, that authority can be cancelled and I wish to give hon. members the assurance that I will not hesitate to cancel that authority if anything like that should happen.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. Minister a question in connection with the number of ten who comprise an association; will it be possible for, say, five or six Coloureds or Asiatics to form an association or must there be ten?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>As the Act reads at the moment there must be ten. I have already explained that we are doing that at the request of the three groups of Coloured people with whom I have had discussions. I have also explained to hon. members that we are joining the on-consumption <span class="col_8485-8486" refersTo="page_1489"/>and off-consumption rights with the exception of the one which we have in sub-section (12) namely, the one which already exists, the one who already has vested rights. In the circumstances which I put to the House in the course of my second reading debate, it will not be reasonable, while the building in respect of which the licence is held does not allow it, to impose further requirements in that licence under which vested rights have already been obtained. The question has been put to me: What about existing hotels where certain White persons have taken the risk of providing certain hotel facilities to Coloured which they had no right to provide and who are rendering a very good service to the Coloured community. It is obvious that those people were not imbued with philanthropical ideas; they entered that field because they felt that it would be worth their while to do so. Nevertheless, they risked their capital, they went there and they acquired vested rights. I want to say clearly that the idea is not to kill those hotels to-morrow or the day after. I think we must gradually&#x2014;and when I say gradually I mean over the course of a number of years, say ten, or so&#x2014;make these people realize that it will be to their benefit to make over their interests to Coloureds as that becomes possible. As a matter of fact, I think those people themselves will come to realize that. I want to assure members that we will not force them in any way or try to kill them off by means of this legislation. We realize that they are rendering a service. I appeal to them, however, to realize that it will be to their own advantage gradually to make over their interests to Coloureds when and if Coloureds come forward who are prepared to undertake that service.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) asked me a question in connection with the areas which fall under the Mission Reserves Act. In this connection the Minister of Coloured Affairs has assured me that it is his intention to introduce legislation in this connection&#x2014;if possible next year. He has given me that assurance and I leave it at that. The hon. member as well as the hon. member for Germiston (District) asked me whether these grants would be taken into account when it came to determining quotas. My reply to that is that they will not be taken into account. These authorities are not granted in terms of the Act but by the Minister on the recommendation of the National Liquor Board. Subject to what hon. members may decide next year under the Liquor Bill, the quota provisions will not apply here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) also wanted to know whether White licensees would still be able to deliver liquor in Coloured areas and vice versa. My reply is that Whites will still be able to deliver in Coloured areas and Coloureds will still be able to deliver in White areas. It is only the establishment of businesses by the one group in the area of the other which is affected here.</p>

<p>I have noted the attitude of the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). Although I do not agree with it, I can nevertheless appreciate it. The hon. member for Durban (Point) raised the question of compulsory beer stocks. I think the hon. member for Hercules (Prof. Malan) who knows more about this matter than I do, has already effectively disposed of that matter. I am definitely of the opinion that where we have accepted that principle in respect of wine and brandy it would not be wrong to apply it in the case of beer as well. It is right that we encourage competition in this way because competition, particularly in the liquor trade, is welcome. It will be an evil day in this country when any group&#x2014;I am not accusing anyone&#x2014;acquires a monopoly in the liquor trade because we know the power which such a group can exercise. I readily concede the point to the hon. member that it may be argued that in this way we are making it possible for a company to exist which would otherwise have found it impossible to exist. That is an argument which I have to face up to. I do not think, however, that it is unreasonable, particularly not when we weigh the one against the other. While I appreciate the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude, therefore, I cannot subscribe to it and we will just have to continue to differ on this point. As I have already said I think the relevant provision in the Bill is a reasonable provision.</p>

<p>In this connection I might just add that the people with whom I discussed this matter, did not express any strong views on the subject. Nor has the interested company&#x2014;a company which, as the hon. member for Hercules has said, has rendered great services to South Africa&#x2014;made any representations to me in this connection. I take it that they think they are capable of facing up to any competition.</p>

<p>No such memorandum has come to my notice. My office may have received one, but unfortunately it has not come to my notice. However, even if they did take a stand, I think that it is not unreasonable to demand that three out of four types of beer should be made available, particularly when you bear in mind the way in which it has to be made available and also when you bear in mind the concession which we have made by substituting the very strict provision in the old Act&#x2014;strict because he could lose his licence&#x2014;with a penalty provision. Hon. members said they thought the penalty was too severe, but I wish to point out that it is similar to other penalties in the law. Nothing more has been done than to bring it into line with existing penalty provisions.</p>

In reply to a previous question of mine, the Minister said that the National Liquor Board would be the body which would <span class="col_8487-8488" refersTo="page_1490"/>make a recommendation whether a licence should be granted or not.

<p>I am aware of what the hon. member wants, Mr. Speaker. I want to inform him that local liquor licensing boards are not appointed on a democratic basis. No elections are held for the appointment of members to those boards. On the contrary, they were always appointed by the Minister&#x2014;some from the personnel of local authorities and others from amongst members of the public. If these were to be elected, I am afraid there would be such a rush that anyone would have been unable to cope with it. The hon. member will also recollect that a few years ago this House decided on another procedure, i.e. that only three magistrates would in future constitute those boards. Under this Bill, six persons will be appointed by the Minister. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that this board will be prepared to receive and consider representations at all times. I have appeared before liquor boards on many occasions and so have other members in this House who are attorneys and advocates. We know that when in the olden days objections were lodged, counsel had the right to speak against those objections. Although this right will not exist under this Bill, the board will view any objections and representations objectively and take account of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>As is generally known there has been great expansion in the defence organization of the Republic since the acceptance of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No. 44 of 1957), and it is, therefore, necessary for amendments to be made from time to time to ensure that the organization runs smoothly, and to eliminate defects.</p>

<p>The Bill before the House contains two as I believe non-contentious amendments which are recommended for consideration as well as a third clause which, although it does not affect the Act as such, is submitted to validate certain overpayments as the matter cannot be disposed of in terms of existing provisions.</p>

<p>In connection with the first clause I wish to inform the House that many artisans leave the South African Defence Force after having completed their apprenticeships and before the expiration of the periods for which they have signed on. Their services are then lost to the Department.</p>

<p>The South African Defence Force is a very popular recruiting field for skilled artisans who, because of their high standard of training, are in great demand by commercial and industrial undertakings.</p>

<p>Loss of skilled artisans takes place at such a rate that it has an adverse effect on the activities of the Department especially in the case of specialized equipment already in use or which is in the process of being acquired.</p>

<p>It costs my Department approximately R7,300 to train an artisan apprentice over a period of four years and it is, therefore, necessary in view of what I have just stated, to curtail to some extent the outflow of skilled artisans to civil life.</p>

<p>In terms of the existing Section 52, members of the Reserve of Officers of the Citizen Force can be compelled to render service only during war-time or internal disorders or when a state of emergency exists. There is, however, no provision in terms of which former members of the Permanent Force, and who are on the Reserve, can be called up for duty during peace-time.</p>

<p>The proposal, therefore, is to amend the Act as indicated in Clause 1 on the Bill by the addition of the two new sections, viz. 5<i>bis</i> and 5<i>ter</i>, to Section 52 which, Sir, will have the effect that a former member of the Permanent Force who is on the Reserve will be liable for service during peace-time for not more than one period of 30 days in each of the six years following the year in which he so obtained his discharge, provided that the number of such periods do not exceed the <span class="col_8489-8490" refersTo="page_1491"/>number of months by which the date of his discharge preceded the expiry date of his period of service in the Permanent Force and which, all told, do not exceed six periods.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to elucidate the point I would like to give the following example:</p>

<p>Suppose someone enlisted as an artisan apprentice in the Permanent Force on 1 January 1957, for a period of seven years, i.e. up to 31 December 1963, and purchased his discharge on 31 December 1962&#x2014;that means that his discharge preceded the expiry date of his engagement by 12 months. He would, therefore, in terms of the proposed amendment, be liable for duty for a period of 30 days annually in the Permanent Force for the next six years. Should the same apprentice purchase his discharge on 30 September 1963, i.e. three months before expiration of his period of enlistment, he would not be required to do more than three spells of duty of 30 days&#x2019; duration each.</p>

<p>Section 5<i>ter</i> is self-explanatory and I therefore proceed to explain the amendment to subsection (2) of Section 54 and to which Clause 2 of the Bill refers.</p>

<p>In terms of sub-section 54 (1) of the Act a member of the Reserve of Officers is required to advise my Department of any change in his address within 14 days of such taking place. This period is reasonable and permits of contact being maintained with such member. The same period should logically apply to members of the Permanent Force and Citizen Force Reserves as there appears to be no sound reason for the existing difference.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, Clause 3 of the Bill is necessary to validate overpayments to certain Commando&#x2019;s in respect of rifle range grants which were made in all good faith as a result of a misinterpretation of the Commando Regulations which were in force at that time.</p>

<p>In Government Notice No. 2847 dated 18 December 1953, Rifle Commando Regulations were promulgated and for the sake of convenience I quote the contents of paragraph 29, Chapter 3, i.e. the one which was wrongly interpreted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;29 fa) There shall be paid to rifle commandos a grant to cover the cost of preparation and maintenance of rifle ranges, the erection of targets, provision of material and range stores and the payment of incidental expenses and transport. The grant shall be at the rate of 5s. (50c) per member per annum calculated on the strength of the rifle commando as at 31 December of each year. The maximum grant payable to a rifle commando in respect of any one financial year shall not exceed &#x00A3;90 (R180).</block>

<p>(b) This grant will not be payable in respect of any members of a rifle commando who are provided with free target facilities at Government expense.</p>

<p>(c) This grant will be decreased in proportion to the number of members of the rifle commando making use of Government facilities to the total strength of the rifle commando.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What the Department did, Sir, was to pay a Commando which had members who made use of classification rifle ranges, the maximum amount in terms of sub-paragraph (a) of the regulation quoted, irrespective of the number of members who made use of such a range and of the actual strength of the Commando concerned; the amount was thereafter reduced as determined by sub-paragraph (c); in other words, where a Commando consisted of 300 members of whom 100 made use of a classification range, the Commando was paid the maximum amount of R180 in terms of sub-paragraph (a) of the Regulation and after that amount had been reduced in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (c), a grant of R120 was made to the Commando.</p>

<p>According to the interpretation of the Controller and Auditor-General the grant should have been determined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;In calculating the allowance, the number of members using a departmental range should in terms of sub-paragraph (b) of the Regulation, have been ignored and the total should have been reduced in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (c). In the example quoted, the 100 members who used a Government range, should have been deducted from the total strength of 300 leaving a balance of 200. 200 members at an allowance of 50 cents each would make the grant R100. The amount should then have been reduced by one-third as provided in sub-paragraph (c), which would have made the grant R66.67 instead of the R120 paid.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The Department subsequently approached the Government Law Advisers for an interpretation of the regulation and they endorsed the opinion of the Controller and Auditor-General. It is clear, however, that in the event of payment having been made in accordance with the interpretation subsequently furnished, it would have been totally inadequate for the purpose envisaged. It was never the intention that the grant should have been decreased twice and with the concurrence of the Treasury the relative regulation was amended during July 1960, to remove any further doubt. It now reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>&#x201C;Grants in Respect of Rifle Ranges</i>.</block>

<p>2 (1) In each training year there shall be made a rifle range grant of five shillings (50 cents) to each commando in respect of each member or honorary member who is posted to such commando as at the last day of January of that year and does not regularly use a Government rifle range: Provided that such grant shall not exceed the amount of ninety <span class="col_8491-8492" refersTo="page_1492"/>pounds (180 rand).&#x201D; The purpose of the grant remains the same as previously. The Treasury was approached with the request that the overpayment amounting to R1,518.46 and which was made over a period of six years, be condoned, but a reply was received to the effect that the misinterpretation should be regarded as <i>ultra vires</i> and that the Treasury was not in the position to condone the irregular payments. I may add that the Treasury has no objection against the steps which we are now taking to regularize this matter.</p>

<p>For years we have been losing artisans from the Defence Force, from the nature of things, what we need are meticulously trained technicians. They also have to be very reliable. The Government spend a great deal of money to train artisans&#x2014;as a matter of fact the hon. the Minister said so. Over and above that the training which these men undergo, not only in the Force itself, but at the technical colleges which are supported by the Force, is of an extremely high quality. Nor did it take industrial concerns very long to realize that. They are offering these people much more money than the Minister can, with the result that the Force is continually losing trained men, and whether there is a great demand outside or not these men have always succeeded in looking after themselves. I want to give you only one example, Sir, and that is of a young man who left the Force only three months after he had completed his training for a salary nearly three times that which he earned in the Force. The result is that as soon as these people have finished their training&#x2014;and even before they have served the prescribed apprenticeship of seven years&#x2014;they leave the Force.</p>

<p>I want to bring it to the notice of the hon. the Minister that one of the main decoys&#x2014;I can almost say inveiglers&#x2014;is one of his colleagues, namely the Minister of Transport. Many of the artisans whom he has in his employ to-day&#x2014;particularly in the Airways&#x2014;come from the Defence Force. The hon. Minister of Transport, of course, pays much more.</p>

<p>I am afraid, however, that this measure of the hon. the Minister will not put a stop to that outflow. It is a good thing, however, that he is providing that those people can be recalled in times of peace, not only to make their contributions, but also to undergo a kind of refresher course in the Force and acquaint themselves with new equipment. This side of the House wholeheartedly support this section of the Bill</p>

<p>I now come to the validation of certain over-payments. To me it seems very much a case of much ado about nothing. What surprises me is that more over-payments were not made because the relevant regulation is very complicated. After this matter had been through the hands of the Controller and Auditor-General and the legal advisers we now have this new regulation in terms of which an amount had to be paid calculated on the following basis&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by deducting from the amount of one hundred and eighty rand an amount which bears to the amount of one hundred and eighty rand the same proportion as the number of such members bears to the total number of members of such commando&#x2026;.</block>

<p>The over-payment is then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to the extent to which that payment exceeds the amount which could lawfully have been paid to it under the said regulation, hereby validated and confirmed</block>

<p>I challenge any member to tell me what I have just read. Not only do you require a legally trained man to explain that but also a philologist. I think we should say what we want to say in much simpler language; in that event these over-payments will not take place. We also support this part of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are frequently being reminded from the Chair that at a Second Reading Stage of a Bill, we are concerned with the principle of a Bill. Now, a very important principle is stated here. This principle, briefly, is this, that where a man has reviewed the benefit and the privilege of training, he has thereby incurred certain responsibilities. The hon. the Minister and the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronk-horst) have explained that in the case of the manual worker in the service, i.e. the air mechanic, this principle is being applied. But is the Minister prepared to apply that principle also to air crews? If a man has been trained as a pilot or a navigator and he can obtain three or four times his salary in a civil air line, would he be prepared to say that he should return to the Air Force at regular intervals? It is something which we have to consider very carefully. To extend the principle beyond our forces, Sir, a school master is frequently bound, after he has enjoyed the benefit of being trained, to serve &#x2026;</p>

Why should a doctor or an engineer not be bound as well as the other character is being bound here? I do not wish to extend the principle but it is a very, very important principle, not only in the case of our mechanics, but in the case of all soldiers and of all civilians in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>We can appreciate the necessity for the insertion of this provision into the Defence Act, but there are one or two <span class="col_8493-8494" refersTo="page_1493"/>aspects in regard to the Bill which I think the hon. the Minister should give us more clarity. The Minister&#x2019;s main object in introducing this is to retain for the South African forces those men who have acquired skills as a result of their training within the Defence Force itself. The Minister knows that when he enlists men as tradesmen, or skilled men, within the Defence Force, certain conditions apply to them. They attest for certain periods. As I understand the position, the minimum period for which a man can attest in the Permanent Force to be trained as an artisan, is seven years. The maximum period that he can attest for&#x2014;he does this voluntarily&#x2014;is for a maximum period of ten years. In the first year obviously he acquires no knowledge or knowledge of the barest nature. It is only after a period of four or five years that these men have acquired all the skills that will make them effective tradesmen or artisans within the Defence Force itself. What the Minister is seeking to do here is to retain as many of those men and for as long as possible within the force. I want to put this to the hon. the Minister: Whilst we recognize the need for this, the Minister must bear the other aspect of the matter in mind as well. There are regulations and provisions for men to buy themselves out. When you look at the amount a man must pay to get himself out of the Permanent Force, you see that it is utterly negligible. I have the scale in front of me. Let us assume that a man attests for the minimum period that he can attest for. In his seventh year he can buy himself out for R200. In his first year he can buy himself out for R100. But if he has attested for ten years and he wants to buy himself out before his tenth year, he need only pay R20.</p>

<p>Yes, but the purpose of what the Minister is doing here is to have these men available. The Minister does not want to lose them in building up our army. He wants to retain these skilled men, even though they have bought themselves out. I think a more satisfactory way is to say to the man: &#x201C;Look, you are going to buy yourself out so easily; you signed on voluntarily; you are doing this as a job to your country; you elected this as your career; you elected to get this training and if you want to get out I am going to make it more difficult for you to do so.&#x201D; I think the hon. the Minister said that it cost R7,300 to train one artisan over a period of four years and he can buy himself out in the fourth year for only R160.</p>

<p>Sir, I am discussing the principle of the Bill. One of the principles of this Bill is that the Minister wants to have available to the Defence Forces these trained personnel. I am trying to indicate, by way of argument, how easy it is for them to get out. Let me put it this way, Sir: It is so easy for these men who have attested to get out at such a low cost, that they do leave very easily. The Minister now says to them that they are still going to complete the whole period for which they have attested, even though they have bought themselves out, and they will have to do so by way of 30 day periods per year. I suggest to the Minister that he gives consideration to it whether or not it should not be made a little more difficult in prevailing circumstances, who voluntarily attested in this manner, to get out of the Permanent Force. Because a great many of them will say &#x201C;Oh, well, it is not such a burden to have to go back for 30 days&#x201D;. But it will be a burden if they have to pay a considerably larger amount than they have to pay to-day to get out.</p>

Those people are not available to the hon. the Minister to bring back for a refresher course. They are lost to our Air Force.

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this new condition is going to apply to contracts which have already been entered into, in the case of those people who are already in the armed forces. I say that, Mr. Chairman, because a person enters into a contract. He signs on for a period in the Army whether he becomes an officer or not. He signs on in good faith. There are two parties to the agreement. I think it is totally unfair to impose an additional condition on them. I would suggest that this should only apply to new contracts and not to the contracts which are already in existence. There is a provision in the Apprenticeship Act, for instance, which imposes certain conditions on apprentices, but that contract can at no time be varied by the inclusion of further conditions which would make it more onerous. I should like to hear from the Minister whether it is his intention to apply this clause to contracts which are already in existence, or whether this will only apply to new contracts.</p>

<p>How can you impose additional conditions or impose new conditions? These conditions are more onerous. This is going to make it more costly to those people. Even if they buy themselves out they have to come back to the Army for one month in a year if the Minister decides to call them up. Financially they may lose a considerable amount of money. This is a more onerous condition. I think it is totally unfair to impose a condition which was not agreed to at the time that they signed the contract. Actually it is an unheard of thing, Mr. Chairman. When you sign a contract of agreement, I think it should be adhered to in all circumstances. These individuals should be invited to sign new contracts, if they want to, containing the new conditions. But I think it is totally unfair to insert this condition in a contract which already exists.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill is the usual Bill to give effect to the decisions taken in Committee of Supply and to make the money available for the purposes as accepted there. It is not really customary to make a speech on this occasion but there are two matters, however, to which I wish to refer on this occasion. In the first place, I wish to say a few words in connection with the financing of State requirements which are imported. The Auditor General thought it would be a good thing if Parliament were informed in this regard and that is why I want to do so.</p>

<p>Hon. members will remember that on various occasions in the past I emphasized the fact that in the changed circumstances in which we were living, particularly the post-war period, it had become more and more difficult to raise the traditional type of long-term loans at a reasonable rate of interest. The tendency is more in favour of short-term loans. In recent times oversea loans have more and more become linked with the exports of the borrowing <span class="col_8497-8498" refersTo="page_1495"/>country. In future we will probably more and more have to avail ourselves of this type of loan which is linked with the imports. It is a supplier&#x2019;s credit or a kind of international hire-purchase agreement under which the goods are delivered in the normal way but where payment is made by way of instalment or in a lump sum after the lapse of a certain period. The Treasury has decided that the time has arrived that we avail ourselves of this kind of facility, particularly to finance the importation of weapons and equipment for the Department of Defence.</p>

<p>There are two types of import credits. In the case of the first one the credit forms part of the agreement with the supplier, in other words, the contract makes provision for payments on certain dates which stretch over a longer period than the period within which the imports have to be delivered. In this case provision will have to be made annually in the Estimates for payment direct to the supplier, in terms of the contract. Interest is not, however, calculated separately or paid separately and the credit will be regarded as an integral part of the contract.</p>

<p>The second type of import credit is in the form of a loan by a third party, with the specific object of financing certain purchases and that will be treated as a loan. In this case the credit is arranged separately with an overseas financial institution who then pays the supplier either in cash or in instalments. The State in turn fulfils its obligations in respect of interest and capital, according to the conditions of the credit agreement. In such cases provision will be made in the Vote concerned to pay for the imported article and the Loan Account will be credited. In that way we admit that a direct, short or medium-term loan has been granted. On due date the loan will then be repaid from Loan Account.</p>

<p>The intention is to apply these two methods for financing purchases under the Special Defence Equipment Account which was introduced in terms of Act No. 8 of 1952 as well as purchases under the ordinary Vote. There will be no departure from the normal Estimates procedure and the loans will be negotiated within the framework of the General Loans Act of 1961. In view of the fact that we did not avail ourselves of this kind of credit facility in the past, not to a large extent at least. I think it is my duty to inform the House that we will in future avail ourselves of such facilities.</p>

<p>I also want to avail myself of this opportunity of saying a few words about Dr. M. H. de Kock, who will be retiring on 30 June as President of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank, is of course, a private body, although a statutory body, performing its own important functions; but apart from his duties as head of the Bank the President of the Reserve Bank plays a very important role as adviser to the Minister of Finance in so far as financial policy is concerned. Dr. de Kock has been President of the Bank since 1945, after having served as under-president for approximately 14 years. I know I am also speaking on behalf of my predecessor when I say that his advice, based on his very wide knowledge and extensive experience of monetary and banking policy in South Africa and overseas has been of inestimable value to the Treasury and to the country. The relationship between the Treasury and the Reserve Bank has always been of the best, and I think that has been due to a great extent to the person of Dr. de Kock. I am pleased to say that although Dr. de Kock is retiring as President of the Reserve Bank, he has agreed to stay on as Chairman of the Board of the Reserve Bank. I am sure, therefore, that his advice on broad matters of policy will still be available to the country. He will also stay on as chairman of the National Finance Corporation, and also as South Africa&#x2019;s substitute Governor at the International Bank. Whereas he will in future play a less active role in the Reserve Bank, however, and whereas we have come to the end of one chapter, we wish to thank him very sincerely for his services; we hope he will enjoy his well deserved semi-retirement in the future. I think I am speaking on behalf of all of us when I place on record our appreciation and gratitude to him for the very valuable services which he has rendered the State and the country.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of hon. members of this side of the House, it gives me the greatest pleasure to associate myself with the words which have fallen from the lips of the hon. the Minister of Finance concerning Dr. de Kock on his retirement as President of the Reserve Bank. I think the Government is to be congratulated on having arranged to retain his services on the Board and on the National Finance Corporation and as our alternate on the World Bank. Dr. de Kock&#x2019;s name has become synonymous with the integrity of South African financial institutions, and I think that successive Governments have indeed been fortunate to have been served by a man of his calibre. I believe that all of us would like to express our real debt of gratitude to him for the guidance he has given, and at the same time our thanks to him for his willingness to continue in certain tasks which he is undertaking.</p>

<p>Having said that, of a very distinguished public servant, I hope it will not be confused in any way with my feelings for the members of the present Cabinet, because if there is anything which has become obvious in the course of the discussion of the proposals placed before us by the hon. the Minister of Finance, then it is clear that although this Government has been in power since the last election only for a very short time, there are already evident very significant chinks in its armour, chinks which in certain respects are already threatening to become gaping holes. For that reason, I have felt it right at this stage of the discussion of these proposals to draw attention to these matters by moving the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8499-8500" refersTo="page_1496"/>To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the second reading of the Appropriation Bill because the Government has failed, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<p>I felt that it is perhaps right to start by focusing attention on the agricultural situation in South Africa, because whilst successive governments have adopted the same schemes in respect of marketing, I do not think the agricultural industry has ever found itself so universally critical of any government as is the industry of this Government at present.</p>

<p>It is necessary perhaps to sketch the background of the situation which has arisen, and I do it in terms which the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing himself has used, so that we should have common cause in respect of the matters I want to discuss. Attempts quite clearly have been made in the past, and are still being made, to achieve stabilization of prices in agriculture by the use of four methods. Firstly, there is the one channel price fixed method used in respect of maize, wheat, oats, barley, tobacco, dairy products and which covers, according to the Minister, some 33 per cent of the total agricultural production. Secondly, there is the one channel pool scheme covering about 17 per cent of production, according to the figures of the Minister, and covering more particularly things like bananas, fresh milk, deciduous fruit and citrus. Then there are the floor price schemes which cover particularly slaughter stock and eggs. Then there are the remaining 27 per cent of our total production, covered in almost every case by special legislation. Now, the interesting thing is that surplus problems in the agricultural field have arisen in respect of certain products in each of these groups and in regard to each of the methods of marketing. What is so interesting is that the Government&#x2019;s methods of dealing with them, or rather, failing to deal with them, have differed in each case and they have sometimes been contradictory and sometimes inconsistent. We find, for instance, that in maize you have the one channel fixed price system. There you have very large surpluses indeed, as you also have with tobacco, which falls under that head. In the one channel pool scheme there is trouble with bananas, and very often with fresh milk. In the floor price scheme there is trouble particularly with eggs, and sometimes with slaughter stock. We all know that in regard to the remaining methods our sugar growers have suffered as the result of our no longer being a member of the Commonwealth, to the extent of several millions of rand a year under the new agreement.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is the reactions of the farming community and particular farmers to the efforts which have been undertaken by the Government to deal with the surplus problem. I have here an interesting cutting dated 5 April 1962: &#x201C;Surpluses worst poultry disease&#x201D;, from one of the leading poultry farmers in the Cape Province. Then one has a comment from the South African Agricultural Union on the question of the dairy industry, &#x201C;Suiwelboere se toestand nog benard: S.A.L.U. vra ondersoek en het vyf-punt-plan&#x201D;. Sir, so the thing goes on as the farmers become more and more dissatisfied with the attempts of the Government to deal with surpluses that have been built up under the various schemes. But I know that there is nothing worrying the Minister more and nothing worrying the agricultural industry more than the position which has arisen in respect of maize in South Africa. I think it is worrying the agricultural industry because there is a feeling that the farming community is not getting a square deal in that regard. There is a feeling that the Government has not been consistent in this respect. You find that a former Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Stephen le Roux, when he had to deal with mealie surpluses which were exported, refused to allow the mealie farmers any part in the profits made on the export of that maize. I know that the hon. the Minister of Information will back me up as to the correctness of that statement, because year after year he was one of those who pleaded for a division of those profits made on the export of maize. But l will not quote him; I will quote instead the Minister of Agriculture at the time, the Mr. Stephen le Roux. Here is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die beginsel is dus duidelik dat die stabili-sasiefunksie in verband met mielies op die Staat val. Die Regering en ek sou die mielieboere verraai en in die steek laat as ons in hierdie stadium die indruk sou wek in die land, veral by the verbruiker en ook by die belastingbetaler, dat hier nou &#x2019;n geleent-heid is om op die mielieboer self die stabili-sasiefunksie af te skuif deur sy winste te gebruik as &#x2019;n stabilisasiefonds vir die toe-koms wanneer wereldpryse daal. As ons daardie indruk laat dan beteken dit eenvoudig dat ons die stabilisasiefunksie afskuif op die mielieboere en die Mielieraad in plaas van dat die Regering dit op hom neem.</block>

<p>Then later on he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die mielieboere van Suid-Afrika het vir die land gesorg, en die tyd het aangebreek en sal in die toekoms aanbreek dat die land ook vir die mielieboere moet sorg. Daarom se ek dat ek nie gewillig is om die uitvoer-winste aan so &#x2019;n diens vas te koppel nie. As so &#x2019;n diens nodig is&#x2014;en dit is nodig&#x2014;dan is ek gewillig om die saak met die <span class="col_8501-8502" refersTo="page_1497"/>Mielieraad te bespreek om te sien in hoeverre daarmee gehelp kan word.</block>

<p>Those were the words of Mr. Stephen le Roux, the then Minister of Agriculture, and his war-cry was &#x201C;mechanize and produce Now, Sir, we hear a different story from this hon. Minister. I do not believe I am doing him an injustice by quoting him in the following terms, where he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And the State has never undertaken to assure producers of guaranteed prices regardless of circumstances.</block>

<p>It is quite clear that the circumstances to which the hon. the Minister was referring is, of course, the huge surplus of mealies which is being exported at the moment at a loss. Thus you find, Sir, that whereas in the past maize farmers were not permitted to share in the profits when surpluses were exported and sold at very big profits to the State, now they are being forced to accept a lower price than that to which they should be entitled because there is a surplus.</p>

<p>Do not let the Minister worry about what happened to the profits; but let him tell me why he is tie-parting from the guarantee given to the maize farmers in the past. You see, Sir, what is so very interesting is that whereas the maize farmers are going to have their price affected because there is a surplus, we find ourselves in the position that the wheat farmers, where there is no surplus, are going to have the price reduced. In the one case the costs of production are gone into and a fair reward to the individual farmer in every regard; so also in the other case. When there is a surplus the price is lower because the mealie farmer has to help pay for the export of the surplus at a loss. In the other case what happens? Here in the case of wheat where there is no surplus the wheat farmer gets the lower price. What do we now hear from the hon. the Minister and other members on the other side? We hear talk of &#x201C;aanpassing&#x201D;; we hear talk of inefficient farming and of uneconomic units. The Minister of Agricultural Technical Services actually said this at Kimberley&#x2014;</p>

<p>Having got the hon. gentleman duly classified where he belongs, according to the stud-book run by the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) I think we can proceed and I think we are entitled to ask what the Government is really going to do about this position. It is true that by reducing prices you may succeed in reducing production and to some extent overcoming the surplus problem. I myself am not at all satisfied about that. If the price is brought down I believe that you may find farmers trying to produce more so as to get a bigger income from smaller unit profits, and I do not know whether it is going to succeed, but what they may succeed in doing is to force the weaker farmer off the land, very often only because he is a small farmer and lacks the capital resources to stand up to the stresses and strains which are going to be the result of the price policy being followed by this Government at the moment. There has, of course, been talk of quotas. There have been talks about quotas in respect of the production of mealies and they have been supported by some very experienced farmers. But as hon. members will know the scheme has its difficulties, and it would appear that that has caused the Minister himself to disapprove of it. One understands that representatives of the Mealie Board are now visiting the United States of America to study a scheme imposing limitations upon acreages sown in the hope of dealing with this problem here in South Africa. But so far as I can see the only policy which this Government has is to force the small farmer off the land. I know very well that in the United States of America the Committee appointed by President Eisenhower, after examining the various schemes to deal with surpluses in agriculture in the United States of America, came to the conclusion that it would have to reduce the agricultural population of the United States of America by one million people in the next ten years, and having come to that conclusion it saw to it that it was part of a big socio-economic scheme, with proper plans for the rehabilitation of the people concerned, with proper plans for their resettlement and with proper plans for fitting them into the various communities that were affected. Sir, if it really is the Minister&#x2019;s scheme that the smaller farmer is going to go under&#x2014;and it seems to be the result of the price policy which is now being followed &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; then what plan has the Government got for dealing with this situation? Let hon. members opposite who want to know where I get this story go and read what the Minister said in the Other Place; let them go and see what is happening amongst the maize farmers of South Africa to-day. It seems that this Government is departing from the policy which it followed <span class="col_8503-8504" refersTo="page_1498"/>in the past, the policy which it had always had of combating the depopulation of the platteland, one of the policies by which it stood most strongly. Listening to these two Ministers it seems that they are departing from that, and one can very well ask what the result is going to be. I have a very uncomfortable feeling as to what that result is going to be. I think that as the smaller farmers get forced off the land, the land is going to be bought up by the bigger farmers and the bigger units, and I think we are going to see what we have seen in parts of the Free State already and what we have seen in other parts of South Africa already, and that is the buying up of those small units and the replacement of the Europeans on those farms not by European labour but by non-European labour. It seems to me that one of the biggest dangers of what is likely to happen under these proposals is that in large areas of the platteland you will find that they will become nothing more nor less than agricultural Bantustans, on which we shall depend for the population of South Africa to be fed. It seems to me, when one looks at this problem in that light, that this Government does not seem to have found any answer at all to the problem. It is not as though this problem has arisen suddenly; it has built up over the years. It has been noticed from year to year that the increase in the consumption of maize has failed to keep pace with the increased production from year to year. It seems to me that the tragedy is that this Government has just let things slide. Things have gone from bad to worse and it has never really faced up to the issue. It is very probable too that another of the problems with which it is faced has been caused in its half-hearted attempt to assist in certain cases by diversifying the agriculture of the maize farmer. Thereby they have helped to create another problem, a problem with which the Government is also faced and with which it seems just as incapable of dealing, because in an attempt to diversify agriculture in the maize-growing districts, the Government assisted many farmers in difficulty to purchase stock for the production of dairy produce and things of that kind. The result is that we now have a vast surplus in the production of dairy products, very largely contributed to by the application of this very scheme. We are now sitting with something like 16,000,000 lbs. of butter for 10,000,000 lbs. of which there is no immediate market that can be foreseen either by the Department or by the Minister. It is small wonder that the South African Agricultural Union itself passed a resolution calling upon the Government to cease applying this scheme. It is no answer to come along and say that the cattle must have been there anyway or you could not have bought them and that they would have produced milk anyway, so the surplus has not been increased by what has happened. Anyone who is a farmer at all and knows that surplus maize has been used for stock, knows that the surplus has been pushed up as the result of the application of this scheme. Now we sit with a vast overproduction in dairy produce, a vast overproduction which also falls in the one-channel fixed price group but which creates other problems with which the hon. the Minister does not seem able to cope at all. Here again what has happened? There have been increased subsidies, nearly R2,000,000 worth of extra increased subsidies, and a lowering of the price to the producer. Once again the Minister seems to hope that by a lowering of the price to the producer, the production will fall, but I am sure that he will be the first to concede that it is going to take a longer time to see what the effect of the lowering of that price is going to be than in the case of mealies.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>When we adjourned for lunch, I had drawn attention to certain circumstances which had arisen in connection with agricultural products, and was saying something about the surpluses in the field of dairy products, and I mentioned particularly the question of butter, where there is said to be some 16,000,000 lb. in stock in respect of which a market for 10,000,000 lb. appears to be uncertain. I pointed out that the method used by the Minister and the Government to deal with this problem had been increased surpluses to the order of some R2,000,000 in respect of dairy products and the lowering of the producers&#x2019; prices. But we still seem to be a long way off a solution. Great Britain has enforced a quota in respect of the import of butter, and, so far as it affects us, it is considerably lower than the amount of butter we would like to sell there; it is, I think, some 4,400,000 lb.; in Rhodesia Australia has undercut us, and we lose a market there of perhaps 250,000 lb. of butter. I think one is entitled to ask: Where are the new markets for these products which were produced very largely as a result of schemes introduced by the Government? What has the Government done about finding new markets? There have been sales in the Bantu areas at sub-economic prices, but they appear to have been undertaken, if I may say so, somewhat half-heartedly, if one is to judge by some of the remarks made by the hon. the Minister on other occasions, and that despite the value of butter as a protective food. There has been some small success with the sale of powdered milk. But once again it seems that we are in the position that the Government has been caught napping, and that not enough has been done to meet a situation which should have been anticipated.</p>

<p>Then there is the position which arises in regard to another product marketed in another way, marketed in accordance with a floor price scheme, namely slaughter stock. Here, too, we find that a problem has arisen at times, because, with the abandonment of the permit system, we have time and again seen over <span class="col_8505-8506" refersTo="page_1499"/>loading of the abattoirs with slaughter stock to the point where animals have sometimes been kept waiting for days before they have come forward for slaughter, to the detriment of the producer, and very often the consumer as well. Now there are attempts being made to off-load the responsibility in this regard upon the market agents, and the Minister is appointing a commission to examine the question of abattoir facilities. Sir, commissions take some time to report, and abattoirs take a long time to build, and they are most expensive buildings. What is going to happen in the meantime? What is happening about our cold storage facilities? Is the Government doing anything about it? We know that some beef carcasses have been exported, some mutton carcasses have been exported as well&#x2014;some at a small profit, some at a small loss. We know some baby-beef, or what is akin to baby-beef has been sold. I believe some at a small profit. But one is left again with the feeling that the Government is doing too little too late, and that it is going to be the farmer who is going to suffer in the end. I don&#x2019;t even want to mention the subject of eggs. I don&#x2019;t think the Government is beginning to have a solution as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>I cannot recommend that way of getting rid of our surpluses. But another system, a quota system, is being applied in respect of certain areas, as far as fresh milk is concerned. Here again, if one is to judge from the criticisms which the hon. the Minister himself has levelled in respect of the application of that system. I think we are entitled to ask what is he proposing to do for the future, because, quite clearly, he does not think he has got the answer as yet. Then, lastly, I think one cannot pass on without saying a word about bananas, of which tons and tons appear to have been either destroyed or chopped up and used for other purposes, and there seems to be some little doubt as to the exact amount which has been lost, but it is quite clear that the banana producers are in a very sorry position. So one could go on through the whole list of commodities, and I think it becomes clearer every day that what is necessary in the sphere of agriculture is new thinking, for new ideas to be examined, for a more imaginative approach to be sought. But instead. Sir, the story seems to be the same all the time. It is a long story of lack of preparation, of wasted opportunities as far as the Government is concerned, a story of 14 wasted years, as far as agriculture is concerned. The tragedy is that, despite surpluses and good food that we can&#x2019;t sell, there is still malnutrition in the Republic.</p>

<p>There is still malnutrition in the Republic, but in very few countries where there is surplus food, as the hon. gentleman ought to know, who is so inclined to make interjections on subjects he does not know about. [Interjections.] I think, judging by the brainpower of some hon. members, there must have been a lot of malnutrition earlier in their lives. Sir, the fact is that, despite these surpluses, there is still malnutrition and a lack of protective foods for a large section of our population. Surely here it is not beyond the wit of men, not beyond the wit of this Government, to come forward with some scheme that would be of advantage both to the primary producer and to those suffering from malnutrition. One wonders whether the Minister&#x2019;s problem would have been quite as great had the school-feeding scheme not been abandoned; one wonders whether his problem would have been quite as great if these schemes for the industrial development of the reserves had been advanced with the speed and the expedition which was expected by the Tomlinson Commission; one wonders whether the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s problem would have been quite as great had schemes for better payment of our labour been advanced and sponsored with more enthusiasm by the Government. You see, Sir, that, whereas the Marketing Act was designed to afford orderly marketing, and to give a square deal both to the producer and to the consumer, it has been applied in South Africa most effectively to keep prices down for the consumer when world prices were high, but it does not seem to be applied to-day to protect the producer when world prices are low.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Let us go a little further. It is not being applied in that way simply. I believe, because of the fact that the Government is not applying the Act in the right way and is not playing the role that a Government should. Sudden price changes of the kind which you see now in the case of maize should not have occurred if the Act had been properly administered through the years and if the Government knew what it was about. Up to now, Sir, the Minister and the Government have been having trouble with products consumed very largely internally and of which only the surpluses have been exported. There has not been much trouble in respect of products produced entirely for export and that has largely been the position because of the fact that we have enjoyed a protected market, a market with few, if any quotas applying to it in Great Britain under the Ottawa <span class="col_8507-8508" refersTo="page_1500"/>Agreement and its successors. Now, Sir, what is the position going to be in respect of those products which we do not consume to a large extent locally and which are produced largely or entirely for export., if Britain joins the European Common Market and those preferences fall away? We know it could mean something like 2s. 6d. per box in the case of citrus. We know there is a possibility of South American competition in respect of the citrus industry. What is the position in regard to other products? All we have had so far, Sir, has been somewhat depressing statements alleged to emanate from certain representatives of the Deciduous Fruit Board overseas who are examining the position. When are we going to be told what the position is and when can the farming community hope to be put into the picture? You see, Sir, one would have expected, at a time like this, that every nerve would have been strained to the full, not only to keep the farming community properly informed as to what could happen, but also on the technical and research side in order to ensure the best possible services for the community. What have we had from the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services? We find there is still a shortage and a wastage by resignation of technical and research personnel. Last year the Minister appointed a committee under Prof. Rautenbach to advise him on this problem. In consequence he has reorganized the head office of his department. He now has three chief directors, a chief director of research, a chief director of field services and a chief director of technical policy. I will be the first to concede that there have been salary improvements, additional posts have been created, there are more career posts and the technical personnel are better treated. But it seems, Sir, that the Minister now has the generals, but where are the soldiers, where are the men to serve under the generals? He is still short of personnel. He admits that he has asked the Cabinet to allow him to go ahead on a ten-year plan for the improvement of the establishment and the creation of additional posts. But the cabinet, if I am right, would only commit itself to additional expenditure of R300,000 on a one year basis. I think the Minister will agree that I am correct.</p>

<p>I may be a little bit out, but the hon. the Minister is still without the troops. He still has the generals unsupported on the battlefield; he is still sitting with only one veterinary surgeon for 100,000 head of stock in South Africa as against one to every 5,000 in Europe. One appreciates now why there have been these troubles of foot and mouth disease and rabies. One appreciates that very largely it has been due to a shortage of personnel and the inability to cope with the problems when they arose. He still fails to recognize the necessity for an agricultural research council. He is arguing that agriculture and animal husbandry are too diversified to have one body directing and co-ordinating research. But is industry in general not far more diversified than agriculture and doesn&#x2019;t the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research work very well, or doesn&#x2019;t the Minister think so? If it is so diversified, while he has created various research committees for the various branches of agriculture&#x2014;he thinks that will be more effective than one control body&#x2014;why does he appoint one director of agricultural research? Surely that defeats his own argument. Surely, Sir, that shows that the real problem could have been handled by a research council. When one looks through its record, Sir, you will recall that this Government has always claimed to be the farmer&#x2019;s friend. All I want to say is this: If ever this Government were the farmer&#x2019;s friend then it has lost an awful lot of friends in the past few years. In fact, Sir, the only friends amongst the farmers the Government seems to have are those farmers who sit in this House and who try to defend it, sometimes somewhat hopelessly. Do you know, Sir, what is actually happening? I believe they are afraid to let the farming community know what is happening. Here I have a cutting of a report of what happened at the South African Agricultural Union&#x2014;</p>

<p>This is one example of the helplessness of the Government when we get down to realities. They are a wonderful band of talkers, but what this country needs are doers, careful administrators, people with foresight and what have we <span class="col_8509-8510" refersTo="page_1501"/>had instead? For 14 years the country has had to wait for the Orange River scheme and I wonder how long we will have to wait before we really see a start made. What has been the position of the ordinary man in the street? This is the Government who has talked such a lot about the cost of living which is steadily rising. Here in this legislation there are additional tax burdens on the small man, both direct and indirect. We find that the expenditure on defence, which I agree is necessary, is probably ten times as much as the extra expenditure on social, civil, war&#x2014;and other pensioners provided for under this legislation. We see the removal of the 10 per cent rebate. We are going to have very little benefit from the back-payment of the 1957 levy. There is R14.2 million more direct taxation and R21.5 million more indirect taxation. We find ourselves in a position, Sir, that with all these surpluses with a Government which has been in power for 14 years, with every opportunity to make plans for the future, the industrial and economic development of the country is hardly keeping pace with the growth of the population. And who is suffering? The man who suffers is the small man, the little man. We are reaching the stage where, owing to a large extent to lack of immigrants, lack of risk capital, we are faced with a slowing down in the rate of our industrial development. That is due to the sort of policies which this Government has been following, policies which have so often led us to ask for information from the hon. the Prime Minister and from other members on the Government side as to what their real intentions are. Because we see them embarked on a road which must create uncertainty in industry and business, a road, in respect of the constitutional development inviting the Native reserves, where, I believe, the tempo of development is going to be taken out of the hands of the hon. the Prime Minister. A road which may result in inviting interference from UNO as Great Britain herself has now discovered in respect of Southern Rhodesia.</p>

<p>We hear of plans for the expenditure, under this legislation, of R114,000,000 over the next five years in the Bantu areas. But, Sir, the uncertainty still remains. The farmers on the borders of the reserves still do not know where the boundaries are going to be. Industry does not know where border industries are going to be and where they will not be. We do not know what the position is going to be in respect of border industries or industries inside the reserves. The first incisions have been made in respect of the Transkei; that is merely one-tenth of the Native population of South Africa. The same thing will have to be done in the Transvaal and Natal. If it is done in the Transvaal it is going to mean taking 24 per cent of the land; if it is done in Natal it is going to mean taking 35 per cent of the land. Do you wonder, Sir, that there is uncertainty; that there is a slowing down in the rate of our industrial development? Who is going to risk investment when he does not know one day whether a border industry will be inside or outside a reserve? Who is going to invest money in a development of that kind when he finds himself in the position that he does not know whether job reservation is going to be applied inside the reserves or not? Is it surprising that many members of the farming community are unwilling to make permanent improvements when they do not know whether their farms are going to be inside or outside of the reserves in the future? Mr. Speaker, what is going to happen in respect of border industries? Are the workers there going to be allowed to form trade unions inside the reserves? Small wonder that commerce and industry are asking for particulars. Small wonder that it is felt that many of these uncertainties to-day are due to Government policy and they are the reasons for the failure of our maintaining the standard of development which we are entitled to expect. If industries are developed within the reserves, will they be allowed to import White technicians and skilled artisans if they need them, from outside South Africa? Will those in the reserves be allowed to form Native trade unions? Will job reservation be applied in the industries in the reserves or will it not and what is the effect going to be? If the reserves are to be developed, a section of the population will have to be removed from the soil for its rehabilitation and for the establishment of an adequate agricultural industry in the reserves. Where is the indication that jobs are available in industries on the borders of the reserves for those people who have to be removed? There is a report from one of the directors of agriculture in the reserves calling upon the Native to increase production. Mr. Speaker, how can they increase production under the present system? Successive reports have made it perfectly clear that you will have to take people off the land before you can increase production. To do that you will have to find jobs for 28,000 people annually in border industries. Where is the indication that those jobs are being supplied or that steps are being taken by this Government to supply them? If the reserves are to house anything like the population which the Government has in mind, jobs will have to be found for something like 50,000 Natives a year inside the reserves. It has been pointed out again and again that for every job you create in industry to-day, you require a capital expenditure of approximately R2,000. Where is that money coming from? Where are the indications that a start has been made? The tragedy of it all is, Sir, that the entire approach of this Government, the entire morality of the policies which it applies, is going to be judged on whether or not there is a realistic approach to this subject. No wonder, Sir, that there is uncertainty. Small wonder that, because of the inability to establish the morality of these policies, we are suffering from increasing isolation in the outside world. This matter has been raised time and again, Sir. This matter has been raised in this House before and what did we have? We have had the hon. the Minister of Defence warning us of the dangers to South Africa, warning us some months ago of the dangers to South Africa. <span class="col_8511-8512" refersTo="page_1502"/>Can he come now and tell us that he has found additional friends and allies, that we are better off, that we are forming part of some big new defence organization, or do we remain as isolated as ever before in the defence field? In the international field we have warned again and again what the position is going to be and what the position may now be that we are outside of the Commonwealth if Great Britain is to join the Common Market. I touched on that in respect of purely agricultural products. We know that with an economy as strong as that of the United States of America, the President himself has indicated his concern as to what may happen if Great Britain joins the European Common Market. Virtually every member of the old Commonwealth has voiced his or her concern as to what the effect thereof will be on his or her economy. Most of them have been to London for talks; most of them have seen each other to discuss the position. In the meantime we have been sitting still. It is only in the last few weeks that the Minister of Economic Affairs has been sent abroad. This morning we seem to have his first public statement. Of course Sir, he is at a disadvantage. Other Commonwealth countries speak to Britain on this issue as members of the household, whereas he speaks as a mendicant outsider looking for assistance and help.</p>

We hope that it will be possible for him to achieve something for South Africa. But, Sir, we are in this position that statements made overseas indicate more and more that the likelihood of Great Britain joining the Euromart is becoming closer and closer. That is only becoming evident now that we are studying this matter seriously. It seems to me that the time has come when we should have some statement from responsible sources indicating to our agriculturalists, those who are interested in those markets, what it is likely to mean to them. It is no reply to say: &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know yet on what terms Britain will go in.&#x201D; Of course, we do not know, but there must be a great deal of information becoming available already. Our people will have to plan ahead if they are to replace the markets which they will lose or find more difficult to enjoy than at the present time. We had a statement this morning&#x2014;</p>

We may find that we are not as well informed as some people. We may find that, because of the actions which have been taken in the past, we are not in as strong a position to negotiate as we might have been had we retained our membership of the Commonwealth. Now, Sir, if that European Common Market is formed and we are outside, what is our position going to be? Is there any indication from the Government that it is going to try to seek a new relationship with the older members of the Commonwealth?

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated that this Party and this Government claimed that they were the friends of the farmers in South Africa. It is not necessary for the Leader of the Opposition to go back very far; he need only go back as far as the last election, which did not take place very long ago, to find that not only the platteland trusts this Government and regards it as the farmer&#x2019;s friend, but that the other voters in South Africa, namely the urban consumers, are regarding the Government more and more as their friend and one who looks after their interests. They are realizing more and more that the claims which the Opposition have made in the past that they represented the so-called consumers in this House are unfound; and I think the Opposition realize today that they can no longer claim to have the support of those people who have supported it in the past.</p>

<p>I listened to the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I knew that he would avail himself of this opportunity of trying to exploit the circumstances which existed in South Africa to-day, circumstances which do not only exist here but which manifest themselves throughout the world, namely circumstances in which most countries have surpluses of certain agricultural products in excess of the normal consumption of the country concerned. I did not, however, quite expect him to do it in the way in which he did do <span class="col_8513-8514" refersTo="page_1503"/>it. I thought he would concentrate more on matters of policy. I waited and I predicted that one of the matters which he would still raise would be the price of eggs; I also thought he would come to milk recording. Unfortunately his time expired before he could do so.</p>

<p>One of the points of attack of the Leader of the Opposition was that the Minister and the Department apparently did not have a policy or method whereby they could dispose of the various kinds of surpluses. He said that the Minister and the Department were trying different methods of solving the problem of various agricultural surpluses. That must of course be the position. Surely you do not expect the surplus in respect of each product to be handled in the same way because the circumstances relating to the marketing of each product are totally different. Consequently the methods adopted in connection with the various products must be different. For example, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to the marketing of a product such as butter for which we do not have a European market and a very small market in England, in other words a limited market. He cannot expect us to employ the methods which we employ in the case of butter in the case of another product for which there is a reasonably market in overseas countries. It is obvious that the method must conform to the demand which exists for the product and the way in which you market it. I gained the impression that after 14 years of National Party government the Leader of the Opposition was particularly jealous of the achievements of this Government and not only particularly jealous of that but also of the achievements which the South African producers had attained over the past 14 years as far as their production was concerned. We know what the position was when the party opposite was in power. They know that since then agricultural production has increased much more than the population has increased, taking it on a percentage basis. The result was that the increase in production was such that the local population could not absorb all those products. But if you made a comparison of the global income over the two periods, even if you converted it to the former value of money, you will find that there has been an average increase in the global income of the agricultural community after 14 years&#x2019; of National Party Government, even with the existing surpluses, as against the period when the United Party was in power. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will be one of the first to admit that there has been a tremendous increase in the income of the agriculturist. Take maize, for instance, to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has referred. Fourteen years ago, under the United Party Government the first crop was 20,000,000 to 21,000,000 bags and at a price of 21s. per bag the global income of the maize producer was R40,000,000. To-day the production is 56,000,000 bags of maize. The price is &#x00A3;1 8s. per bag, and you can calculate for yourself, Sir, what the global income is.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Of course the population has increased. I am talking about the increase in agricultural production. If the population has grown and the number of agriculturists on the platteland has grown, the number has increased for no other reason than that it is profitable to go in for agriculture, that it is profitable to produce. If there are more farmers on the platteland to-day than there were during their r&#x00E9;gime, it is because it pays them to be there. Whereas there has been an increase in our population on the platteland over the past 14 years there has been a decrease in the countries of West Europe and in America over the same period. That proves to you, Sir, that opportunities must have been created for the agriculturist by the National Government. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke spoke about maize and he naturally did so because there is a little dissatisfaction about the decrease in the price of maize because of the large surplus which has been produced. The Opposition is naturally trying to exploit the maize position a little bit. It is natural that the maize producer should be dissatisfied because he has to accept a lower price. That is human. It is very human on the part of the Opposition to try to exploit such a position and to put a wrong construction on it. The Leader of the Opposition said that a previous Minister of the National Government had promised that under all circumstances the South African farmers would receive a guaranteed price. I want to know from him who gave such an undertaking? Nobody gave it. I do not even think that the Leader of the Opposition would be prepared, while he is in Opposition and have made so many election promises to add to those, that he would guarantee the price for agricultural products. [Interjections.] It seems to me as though the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) is prepared to do so, but not the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>However. I want to return to the accusation made by the Leader of the Opposition that the Government had left the maize producer in the lurch. The National Party Government came into power in 1948. A price for maize for that year was then announced and there were accumulated maize profits. The United Party Minister of Agriculture announced that price. The Maize Board made representations and said the price was too low; world prices were three times as high; give us only 1s. per bag more from our own funds, from our own profits. What was the reply of the United Party Minister? They refused and it was a National Party Minister who paid that 1s. per bag out of that fund in the form of an arrear payment to the <span class="col_8515-8516" refersTo="page_1504"/>farmers in 1948. The Leader of the Opposition says it appears as though this side has no sympathy for the farmer. No, the producer realizes that we are faced with a big problem but he is not prepared to exchange the security which this Government has afforded him for years for the doubtful benefit which he may perhaps never get under the United Party. The hon. member referred to the speech made by a former Minister and he said the policy which was announced was that the profits made on the export of maize would go to the Treasury. Yes, that was the policy of the United Party. They refused to pay those profits to the producers, but in 1954 this Government came forward, the same Minister to whom the hon. member referred, and he paid the maize profits made by the Maize Board into a stabilization fund and he made further contributions to the fund in the form of subsidies and over the years that fund has assisted in exporting maize and guaranteeing the price. Where does the Leader of the Opposition get the idea that the Government is paying the profits made on the export of maize into the Treasury? He should make sure of his facts.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition criticized and said that promises had been made; prices were fixed on a basis and now that we had a big surplus we could adhere to that basis, and in the same breath he criticized the decrease in wheat prices which had been occasioned exactly because they were fixed on that basis. He sees in this position an opportunity of making a little political propaganda among the wheat farmers, but he can forget about that. The very basis which he asks for in the one breath he critizes in the other breath if it leads to a decrease in the price, just for the sake of making propaganda.</p>

<p>We in South Africa are faced with the same problem in connection with our agricultural products of which there are surpluses as any other country in the world and when we are faced with surpluses we have to find a market for them, and the only way in which you can find such a market is to sell on the market in a competitive world at prices lower than those which obtain locally or at a price lower than that at which people are prepared to buy on the local market. In these circumstances there are a few ways open to you. You can try to expand your local market, to which the hon. member has referred because we have a potential market; we have the people who can consume it but they cannot pay. We can expand that market in South Africa by supplying them with the product at a lower price. We can expand it further by competing with overseas countries, which also means a lower price. You can do a few things in order to bridge this period in which you have to accept lower prices both locally and overseas. You can do what has already been done in the case of dairy products where the State pays a subsidy to keep the price low for the consumer in the country or you can subsidize the price of maize to the consumer in order to increase your market. But the producer will have to adapt himself to this whole process and now the Leader of the Opposition comes along and criticizes the very fact that there has to be an adaptation. I want to ask him this: Does he plead for it that the producer should not be required to adapt himself to the idea of accepting a lower export price, or a lower price on the local market for that portion of the product which cannot be absorbed by the ordinary market? If he pleads for it that they should not be required to adapt themselves, there is only one way in which the producer can be compensated for the price which he receives for that portion of his product for which there is indeed a demand and that is for the Government to subsidize him for the full amount which he loses, that is the difference between the decrease in his price on the local market or the export price and the normal price. The Leader of the Opposition must tell us whether they are prepared to say that the producer should receive his full price for the product which he exports, whether he exports maize or dairy products and whether he should recover the difference in the price from the taxpayers by way of a subsidy. [Interjections.] Let us be reasonable. I am stating my attitude and he must state his. My attitude is that the Government cannot subsidize it. If he criticizes that, he must accept another attitude and say the Government must subsidize it. Surely that is logical. I maintain that the Government can subsidize to ease the position in the intervening period, but I maintain that the Government cannot subsidize that loss 100 per cent. The hon. member may disagree with that, but in that case he must tell us that the Government must subsidize. The Leader of the Opposition critizes three things. Firstly he criticizes the Minister because the Minister says the producer must adapt himself. He says that is wrong. I say it is right. If he says they must not adapt themselves, what does he suggest as an alternative? In the second place he says I should not encourage the producer to be more efficient, because that will only lead to a reduction in prices. What criticism has the Leader of the Opposition to offer against increased efficiency? He is a cattle farmer himself. When we talk about inefficiency, does he want the Government to subsidize the inefficient farmer to keep him going? I know that is not his attitude but if that is not his attitude he has no right to criticize us for saying that the farmers should be more efficient and create the impression amongst the farmers that they need not increase their efficiency because it is the duty of the State to subsidize their inefficiency.</p>

<p>He also criticized what was said about uneconomic units. He said that my colleague and I had on numerous occasions said that the small farmer should disappear from the <span class="col_8517-8518" refersTo="page_1505"/>industry. I just want to put that right. Nobody has ever said that the small farmer should disappear. We said the inefficient farmer should disappear. The small farmer is not necessarily an inefficient farmer. In many cases it is the farmer who farms on a big scale who is inefficient, because he farms on too big a scale or he does not manage his affairs properly, or he does not make proper use of his credit. He can be inefficient in many ways. The impression which the Leader of the Opposition wishes to create among the farmers is that my attitude is that the small farmer should disappear. I think the Government has proved that that is not our attitude, particularly over the past few years where certain branches of agriculture found themselves in difficulties due to climatic conditions, by the way in which the Government has acted and assisted the farmers with loans so as to enable them to carry on &#x2026;[Interjections.] I want to repeat that the price factor is not the only thing which will save the small farmer in South Africa, particularly when the price is subsidized by the State. If a farmer produces 500 bags of maize&#x2014;and there are many of them who do&#x2014;and you subsidize him to the tune of 5c per bag, it means that that person only receives a global figure of R25 more. But the income of the farmer who harvests 25,000 bags of maize, increases by R2,000. He is the person who receives the greater portion of the subsidy. We realize, therefore, that that constitutes a problem and that the uneconomic small farms should be consolidated. I have even said that we would have to enlarge those uneconomic units and some of those people will disappear in the process. The Leader of the Opposition criticizes that. I would not mind his criticizing it if he had another solution to offer, but in that case he must tell us what his solution is; he should tell us what alternative solution he suggests. In that case he should tell us whether they expect the Government to keep those people on the land by way of subsidy. It is very easy for the hon. member to criticize, but I want to tell him that if he wants to make any impression outside with his criticism, he will first have to offer a solution. I have given my solution. I have said how I looked at the matter. I want to tell the hon. member where he is making a very big mistake. He says that if the number of farmers on the platteland were to decrease, the platteland would become Black and you would find more Natives there. On other occasions the hon. member does not mind the platteland going Black, but when he can use that as a propaganda instrument, he says the platteland will become Black if more farmers were to disappear, if more uneconomic units were consolidated. But is that really the position? Does the platteland go Black if there are more farmers or there are fewer farmers? Unfortunately the position is that every farmer employs a number of Native labourers. I am not pleading for it that there should be fewer farmers on the platteland. I realize that the stronger we keep the agricultural population on the platteland the better it is spiritually for the nation. We are in the position, however, where we have to get rid of our uneconomic units. Many circumstances have been responsible for that, such as, for example, the very prosperous times that were experienced when the prices of products were high, or when people sub-divided their land injudiciously or when large companies acquired land and subdivided uneconomically. We will have to give attention to this problem and we will of necessity have to consolidate some of the uneconomic units. But in the process of doing so those farmers who get into difficulties will have to be assisted by the Land Bank, as is being done to-day, so as to help them to get out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition has also criticized the Minister of Finance and the Department of Agriculture for having purchased milch-cows with the funds which the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board and the Land Bank have made available. My Department has never recommended that milch-cows should be purchased, but has recommended the introduction of the animal factor into agriculture, and the farmer decided for himself which animal factor he wanted to introduce. He decided whether to buy milch-cows or other animals in order to introduce the animal factor. Guidance was given. Unfortunately we had the position in 1958-9 when this scheme was introduced that there was a shortage of butter in South Africa and we had to import butter in order to supply Rhodesia. Our prices were attractive with the result that the farmer himself decided to buy milch-cows. I am convinced that had we refused to make funds available for the purchase of milch-cows, the Leader of the Opposition would have been the first person to criticize. They would have said: You want to tell the farmers how to farm. I do not want to repeat the whole speech which I made the other day under my Vote. I merely want to say that our most important duty which we have taken upon ourselves is to develop our markets and also the various boards. The Leader of the Opposition says we have woken up too late but you can only try to develop a market once you have the product to sell. It is no use trying to develop a meat market in Europe if you do not have enough meat for your local market and the same applies in the case of butter. From time to time, however, as the production of these products increased, the various boards sent people overseas to develop markets. You have the case of the citrus board, Sir. To-day they are selling just as much citrus in Europe as in Britain because they have developed their markets. When the United Party was in power they sold 4,000,000 boxes but to-day they are selling 11,000,000 boxes and we expect that number to increase. The Egg Board and the Dairy Board and the various other boards all have their representatives there and they send missions overseas from time to time to develop the markets. The Department has appointed a special official in London to investigate the whole position and to keep in touch with developments <span class="col_8519-8520" refersTo="page_1506"/>in the Common Market. But the fact remains that with the development of all these markets, particularly in the case of products such as maize and dairy products, of which the whole Western world has a surplus, you can only find a market at a price, and that if the South African producers produce huge surpluses, they will have to market that portion which they produce in excess of local demand in competition with the world market. That is the advice which we are giving the farmers. It is no good producing for a market which does not exist. That is why that is the advice which we give the people and why we are keeping them acquainted with the marketing position.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also referred to meat. We were reasonably fortunate in obtaining good prices for our beef on the overseas market but the export of beef is only in its initial stages because we are only to-day beginning to produce reasonable surpluses. For years the position was that the Opposition had created a shortage of meat and its took South Africa a long time to produce sufficient meat. When it became clear that surpluses were sporadically being produced for only one or two months per year, but that the surplus of meat was becoming more general we immediately instructed the Meat Board to develop the overseas market, that it could export meat in a filleted condition and that it should keep super and prime beef away from the controlled markets and prepare it for export. But we are only in the initial stages. We still have to develop the market. We also know that there is not a decent market for mutton overseas. There is no demand for it and if there is a demand for a good quality meat we cannot compete with the Australian and New Zealand prices. Those markets are being developed according to our surpluses. The problem is this, however, that in the case of most of the important products of which we have a surplus, the rest of the Western world also has a surplus and we have to compete with them. I repeat that the only way in which we can compete is for our producers to adapt themselves to those prices just as the wool producer and the fruit farmer have to do.</p>

<p>In the meantime we have also started to develop our Bantu market. The hon. Leader referred sneeringly to the Government subsidy on butter and the decrease in the price. He said the Government paid a 2&#x00BD;c subsidy but the producer also had to accept a lower price. Since the price has been reduced, however, there has been a 7 per cent to 8 per cent increase in the sale of butter in South Africa. We had to reduce the price because we could not export butter. Britain could only take a certain quantity under the quota system and Europe nothing. We immediately started to develop this Bantu market when we were faced with surpluses. The Minister of Bantu Administration and I together appointed a special committee to investigate the further development of that market. The Minister of Health has already embarked on a scheme to supply Native children and those institutions under his control with milk powder in order to prevent disease. We are engaged on that, but we must realize that it is only during the past two or three years that we have had surpluses in the case of most products and it is not such an easy thing to suggest a solution.</p>

<p>I just wish to refer to the meat scheme to which the hon. member also referred. He said that there was a permit system in the past under which meat was supplied to the market, that the permit system had been abolished and that the agents were to-day responsible for controlling the supply to the market under the quota system. My honest opinion has always been that the agents had far too little responsibility under the whole scheme, as it operated in the past before the quota system was introduced. The agent had no responsibility whatsoever because he knew that all the stock which came to the market would at least be sold at the floor price and that he must at least receive his commission on the basis of the floor price. He knew it was not necessary for him to take the stock back and that the price could not be lower than the floor price.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that is still the position to-day. It is. In other words, the more stock that agent can get to the market the higher is his commission. It is not a question that the price will drop if he sells too much; you have the protective, controlled price. The more stock he can get to the market the higher is his global commission. Under this system we are placing a little responsibility on to the agent whereas he did not have it in the past. To-day he must see to it that he does not overfeed the market with stock with the result that stock have to stand over for a week or ten days. The hon. Leader of the Opposition now says that the Minister is shirking his responsibility and placing it on the agent. Does he want the agent to continue as he did in the past with no responsibility? Surely he forms part of the marketing system and if the producer has his responsibility and the butcher his, that agent who also forms part of the pattern, must also have his responsibility.</p>

<p>The Board must see to it that the supply is there. It uses the agent and it places a responsibility on him to see to it that the supply is more even. I still believe, as I said on a previous occasion, that supplying the market under the quota system or the permit system does not offer a solution in so far as that portion of our production in excess of the demand on the local market, is concerned. I still believe that <span class="col_8521-8522" refersTo="page_1507"/>and I repeat it because you create an accumulation outside and our biggest problem is lack of facilities to which the Leader of the Opposition has also referred. The hon. Leader of the Opposition wants to know why we do not build cold storages. It is easy to ask why we do not do that. We have sufficient cold storage facilities in South Africa for normal marketing. The Leader of the Opposition must realize, however, that we have outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease from time to time. We have just had a serious outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in South West Africa. The meat which comes from South West Africa cannot be exported; we may not export it; the overseas market does not want to accept it. As a result of these circumstances we have an accumulation of meat at our cold storages from time to time. There is a second question we have to answer. It costs a great deal of money to-day to build a cold storage; it is an expensive undertaking. Every cold storage which you build to-day costs much more than an old one cost. It is no good building a cold storage at Germiston where it will cost you R170 or R180 to slaughter one ox whereas it costs 90c or R1 per ox at Newtown in Johannesburg, because the producer will continue to support that market where his marketing costs are the lowest and where he incurs the least expenditure. All these questions of cold storage facilities, abattoir facilities and the financing of abattoirs and all the other problems which present themselves are not so very easy of solution, particularly where we are approaching a stage where a reasonable number of our slaughter stock is in excess of local consumption, and where you can hardly expect your municipality, the local authority, to provide facilities in excess of those required by its own inhabitants. It is not such a simple matter to find a solution for all these problems as hon. members think. In order to see this problem as a whole you have to take all these things into account you have to bear in mind, in the first instance, the financing of your abattoirs; in the second instance, you have to take into account who should provide the services, and that was why I appointed the commission to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has referred.

<p>If ever we have had to listen to a Minister who finds himself in a maze and does not know how to get out, we have listened to such a Minister this afternoon.

<p>If ever a case has been made out that a Minister is inefficient and should make room for another Minister who would be more efficient, then the Minister himself has made out such a case this afternoon. The hon. the Minister let the cat out of the bag right at the beginning of his speech. He said that this Government has always been the friend of the farmer but then he added that this Government was progressively more and more becoming the friend of the urban population. That was where he let the cat out of the bag because the smaller the number of farmers on the platteland becomes and the less important the platteland vote becomes and the more platteland constituencies disappear with the following delimitation&#x2014;and they are going to disappear particularly in the Cape Province&#x2014;the more this Government is going to leave the farmer in the lurch and more it is going to woo the urban vote. Had the hon. the Minister listened properly to the amendment moved by my hon. Leader he would have noticed that it was a three-fold amendment. Not only do we say that this Government is leaving the farmer in the lurch but that it is not interested in the ordinary man who is faced with increasing costs of living. We say in the third leg of our amendment that we deplore the fact that we had lost our friends in the world outside. Where the hon. the Minister has now let the cat out of the bag and said that this Government would in future concentrate more on gaining the friendship of the urban consumer, it is quire clear to me that we have heard a song of unwillingness to assist this afternoon. The hon. Minister talked about the wonderful surpluses which we had in the country to-day. He said that we on this side were jealous of the producers and of their increased production. He spoke about the tremendous increase in the income of the farmer &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and then he compared the position of the maize farmer in 1948 with the present position. The hon. Minister&#x2019;s arithmetic was not so good because he said that 20,000,000 bags of maize were produced in 1948 by the maize farmer at 21s. per bag and that that came to &#x00A3;20,000,000. He said that it was estimated that 50,000,000 bags of maize would be produced in 1962. It was there that the hon. the Minister made it clear to the House that this Government had not realized over the years what the position was which was developing in the country. The Government did not realize that we were producing at a rate, particularly as far as the maize industry was concerned, which would present the Government with a problem, a problem particularly to a miserable Minister such as the present Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;the stronger we become&#x201D;. Perhaps that hon. member is one of the members to whom the Minister has referred, one of the farmers who will become stronger because other farmers who cannot farm economically will have to leave the platteland. Perhaps the hon. member for Harrismith (Mr. J. J. Rall) visualizes a picture in which he will be able to acquire his neighbours&#x2019; farms for next to nothing within two or three years&#x2019; time. I want to point out that those people who will have to leave their farms will get practically nothing for their farms. We have already had a suggestion of that in other speeches of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing that he was very sorry that farms fetched the good prices which they did fetch to-day. He referred in particular to the price of farms in the maize triangle and said that those prices were too high. The hon. Minister is always saying that if it were not profitable to produce maize there would not have been such an over production of maize in which case the price of land would not have been as high as it was and the farmers would long ago have ceased to produce maize. How can the poor Minister be so ignorant? Does he not know that you cannot produce anything else but maize in that maize triangle?</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister spoke about the farmer having to adapt himself. He said that that side deplored it that the farmers did not try to adapt themselves to circumstances. I say that the farmers are trying to adapt themselves, particularly in the maize triangle. They are trying to adapt themselves by trying to find an alternative product to produce there. They have tried to grow summer wheat. By growing groundnuts they have tried to find an alternative industry from which to make a living; they have tried to grow sunflowers; they have tried to produce dried beans. But what do I find? I find that whereas very good prices can be obtained locally for some of these products the Minister has allowed some of those products to be imported. The hon. the Minister continually tells us about the difficulties as far as overseas markets are concerned and about the almost insuperable problem which confronts us in that we cannot find markets overseas and that when we do sell on the overseas market we must always sell at a lower price. But whereas a very good price can be obtained on the local market for dried beans at the moment, the hon. the Minister told me that he had allowed a large quantity of dried beans to be imported into South Africa and that he was going to allow more to be imported.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister usually does not know what he is saying. Let me repeat what I said during that debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1958 a large quantity of beans was imported. From Kenya 893,000 lbs. were imported; from Tanganyika 754,000 lbs. and that rose in 1959 to 5,500,000 lbs. from Kenya and from the Federation and to 1,750,000 lbs. from Tanganyika and 1,700,000 lbs. from Uganda and over a million lbs. from other areas.</block>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s reply to me was this: He asked me whether I was pleading for a further rise in the cost of living in South Africa because he was not going to allow the cost of living to rise in South Africa and that was why he was allowing as much dried beans to be imported as there was a demand for. The farmers can get R14 per bag on the local market for sugar beans. The hon. Minister talked about adaptation and he said that the farmers must subject themselves to this period of adaptation and he wanted to know whether we had any objection to that. But the moment the farmer tries to adapt himself by growing something else, the Minister throws the doors wide open and he allows people to import those products and he tells us that that is being done in order to combat a rise in the cost of living. Surely, Mr. Speaker, it is not necessary to import beans to combat a rise in the cost of living. Nobody has ever died because beans were unobtainable. The hon. the Minister told me that he had allowed haricot beans to be imported. He said that he had to allow haricot beans to be imported for canning and resale in this country.</p>

<p>I would rather not talk about who is importing them. I think we will probably discover at a later stage why the hon. the Minister was so willing to allow them to be imported. I contend that the cost of living will not rise if we do not allow beans to be imported. The hon. the Minister challenged the Leader of the Opposition; he asked whether we would under all circumstances guarantee the price of all products. It is not a question of what we will <span class="col_8525-8526" refersTo="page_1509"/>pay; it is a question of what they have promised. I do not know whether it is the dead hand of the past but I again want to read to the hon. the Minister what promises they made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to explain what my attitude has always been in connection with these profits. I have said in this House and outside that the mealie farmers of South Africa have made big sacrifices. They made sacrifices in connection with the export of mealies.

<block name="quote">Our attitude in connection with the main food products of the country differs from our attitude in relation to fruit&#x2026; In connection with products like mealies, wheat, butter, meat etc. the Government&#x2019;s attitude is that the farmer should be rewarded for his work on a fixed price basis, so that the food requirements of the country can be secured.

<p>The hon. the Minister asked whether we were willing to subsidize all these products and he referred to the period which had to be bridged and the small farmer and he said it was not his policy that the small farmer should disappear from the platteland it was only his policy that the inefficient farmer should disappear.

I do not want them to be placed in that position as a result of the actions of a Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing who does not know his job and as the result of the actions of a Government which does not realize its responsibilities. The hon. the Minister said that he was not pleading for it that there should be fewer farmers. He explained that the uneconomic holdings should be consolidated and he said that in that case it would not be regrettable if there were fewer people on the platteland. Mr. Speaker, I received an interesting letter this morning from a Nationalist in the Free State. The person describes himself as a Nationalist. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nationalist Government with its bankrupt agricultural policy has chocked in its own eloquency because it is developing its Bantustans on the platteland, and not in the Native reserves as they intended with their short-sighted policy.</block>

<p>That was what my hon. Leader said and he knew nothing about this letter. He goes on to write this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The light-hearted statements by Nationalist Ministers&#x2026;</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, there is an hon. member here who is making very personal remarks, but I am not taking any notice of him; I am pleading the cause of the farmers in the country&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The light-hearted statements by Nationalist Ministers who see the solution to our agricultural problem in fewer farmers on the platteland, are indeed half true.

<block name="quote">&#x2026; without the weak Ministers realizing that the farms which are vacated there are taken over by Combines or companies who fully develop the production potential whereas here in the Republic that land is taken over by land barons who leave Natives in charge of those farms which is nothing less than integration and which leads to the creation of large Bantustans on the platteland.</block>

<p>That was why I said a moment ago that with the next delimitation we will find constituencies delimited in a different way, because this Government is to-day heeding the warning. What are the true facts of the matter, Sir? The fact is that the farmer has become prosperous; that he is accepting the technical guidance which comes from that hon. Minister; because of mechanization that the farmer has become more efficient and has produced more; that he is exercising stricter control over his labour and has in consequence reduced his costs as much as possible. While the farmer has done all that and while I have nothing but praise for all the farmers of the country, even for the man who has not been so prosperous and successful&#x2014;because I do believe that he also did his best&#x2014;they have no control over the prices and over their production costs. Among others, the farmer has no control over the climate; that is beyond the control of everybody. The farmer is subject to depressions, which is also a matter which is beyond his control but a matter which can be controlled by this Government. The fact is that the more unfavourable the conditions under which he produces, the more he has to try to make a small profit. The fact is&#x2014;the Minister denied it to-day&#x2014;that the price factor is the mightiest factor when it comes to determining what sort of product to produce. However, a proper price to the farmer depends on the policy of the Government of the day, and in this respect the Government has failed hopelessly. In spite of <span class="col_8529-8530" refersTo="page_1511"/>the fact that the farmer has tried to improve his position by cultivating a greater number of morgen and by acquiring more grazing land if he is a stock farmer, or by producing more per unit; in spite of the fact that the farmer has tried to improve his position by using better fertilizing methods, the farmers are finding themselves in the distressing position in which they are to-day.</p>

But the farms of many of those farmers are encumbered to-day, some of them have already left their farms and the hon. member knows it. Some farmers inherited their farms unencumbered but they have been forced by circumstances and as a result of the declining margin of profit to mortgage their farms. The Minister said that himself. The hon. the Minister spoke about the enormous amount of money which had to be lent to the farmers by the Land Bank. He said the Government had helped the farmers. That is true, the Government did assist them to this extent that they are only indebted to one person to-day whereas in the past they were indebted to a number of people, but they owe every penny of that money and they will have to repay every penny of that money and they will have to repay it during this time when the profit margin is shrinking and while the production costs are increasing from day to day.</p>

In other words, since 1959 up to 1961 it had quadrupled. In this connection I want to say what I have already said before namely that there is no co-ordination between the various departments of the Government. When the Vote of the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services was under discussion the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing was absent with the exception of about 20 minutes, and when the Vote of the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing was under discussion, the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services was never present.</p>

However, as I have said, there is a continual lack of interest on the part of the Government. They simply do not care what happens to the farmer. As far as the farming group of the Government party in this House is concerned, they are divided into two sections. You have the section who gets up and honestly and sincerely tells the Minister and the Government that something will have to be done. Then you have the other section who says that the position of the farmers has never been as good as it is to-day. I have studied them, Sir, and those hon. members who say that the position of the farmers has never been as good as it is to-day, have something else to fall back upon, and if they have not they make application as quickly as they can to find something else.

<p>My hon. Leader said that the agricultural unions had decided not to make any further use of the broadcasting services. I will return to that. However, I saw another article in that same agricultural journal in which they ask the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Who must the farmer believe&#x2014;the Department&#x2019;s stock-breeding experts or its economists?</block>

<block name="quote">This question is posed in the latest edition of the <i>Friesland Journal</i>, the official organ of the Friesland Cattle Breeders&#x2019; Association.</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8531-8532" refersTo="page_1512"/>The editor writes that the average farmer definitely requires expert guidance in order to find something alternative to farm with where his mainline of farming has become unprofitable.</block>

<block name="quote">If the low profit margin is due to one or other aspect which can be remedied with the necessary co-operation on the part of the farmer, planned expert guidance should be given to every farmer concerned. This aspect cannot be over-emphasized. There is a multitude of underlying economic considerations in modern farming, each one of which affects the ultimate income of the farmer. The calculation is so complicated that even an economist of the standing of Dr. Tomlinson has had to rack his brains. It is very easy, therefore, for the average farmer to follow the wrong course for the simple reason that he is not economically able fully to appreciate all the facets.</block>

<block name="quote">Such a great deal is being done for the farmers as far as farm planning is concerned but do they get that economic guidance which is playing an increasingly important role in present-day farming operation and which depends such a great deal on the ratio between price and costs?</block>

<block name="quote">It is doubtful whether farmers in general study such complicated economic reports as the one under discussion and benefit by it. Such important reports can to a great extent be compared with the proverbial minister of religion who only preaches to the converts.</block>

<p>This is the report to which my hon. Leader has referred. They only preach to the converts. It is not surprising, therefore, that they do not want the position of the farmer to be exposed over Radio South Africa and that this article concludes by saying this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Director, Dr. G. P. Le Klus, said that for some reason or other the talks were censored at official level in spite of the clear understanding which exists between the Director and the two agricultural secretaries in this regard, as stated.</block>

<p>I judge the official by the Minister or Posts and Telegraphs. If the Minister appointed him he cannot be anything else but very ordinary. The position is to-day that the farmers are being told a story in which the facts are not taken into account, a story which does not take into account what the farmers and organized agriculture themselves say. What does organized agriculture say? Here I have a resolution which they passed at their congress&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Realizing the dilemma of the producers concerned, namely that the employment of further capital, scientific knowledge, labour, etc., in order to effectively lower production costs, of necessity increases yields and therefore must depress prices further and more than necessary, congress resolves that the general council be requested to discuss with the Government a basis for an overall policy and thereafter to formulate a policy for submission to its affiliations and that the following aspects be included in the discussions and studies: (a) Whether a more virile sales policy can be initiated.</block>

<p>He got rid of his generalities and has now disappeared and does not care what happens to the farmers in future.

<p>Of course, I am saying that to a member of the Maize Board. It is obvious that the Maize Control Board did not know that there would be such a big production and that was why they have not made any plans and the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing was the person who spoke in condemnatory terms about that, because he referred to the citrus farmers and said &#x201C;Look what the Citrus Board has done&#x201D;. He referred to other boards and said that they themselves should find markets. What has the Maize Control Board done? <span class="col_8533-8534" refersTo="page_1513"/>Let the hon. member tell us.

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have often heard the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) speak, but I must honestly say that I have seldom seen her perform such an egg dance as she did to-day. She went from the one point to another and tried to score a point here and another one there; she made all sorts of statements, peculiar statements. One of her statements which I cannot allow to pass unnoticed was to the effect that maize production was not profitable and in order to make it profitable the farmers had to produce still more. That was really a peculiar statement and to-day was the first time that I heard it said that that was the reason why they had to continue to produce more. I want to return to some of the allegations she has made, but there is another one with which I want to deal immediately. During the agricultural debate she spoke about beans, the shortage of beans, and on that occasion the hon. member argued that when there was a shortage of beans, the Minister had allowed beans to be imported. Mr. Chairman, we have had two governments and the United Party handled agriculture for a long time. Beans do not constitute a staple food but let us take maize which does constitute a staple food and let us see what the United Party did. When there was a shortage of maize, what did the United Party do?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member how the sins of the United Party have affected the farmer of to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#WENTZEL">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you, Sir, what those sins of the United Party have cost the farmers. At a time when great profits could have been made they kept the price low, so low that it was totally uneconomical. I will return to that. Let me just point out that during those years the price of maize was 19s. and &#x00A3;1 1s. 3d. per bag and maize was impored into South Africa at &#x00A3;2 4s. per bag and when it arrived here it was discovered that there was a shortage of maize in Rhodesia and they sold some of the maize which they had purchased at &#x00A3;2 4s. per bag to Rhodesia at &#x00A3;1 10s. and &#x00A3;1 6s. 9d. per bag. Can the hon. member deny that? That was United Party policy.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said about the guarantees which Mr. Stephen Le Roux promised when he was Minister of Agriculture. I first want to return to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition Let me tell you, Sir, on what basis the maize prices and the prices of most of the staple food products was determined in those years. Since when has there been a fixed basis? That was one of the guarantees which the Minister gave at the time namely that a fixed basis would be introduced on which production costs would be calculated, and prices are throughout to-day still calculated on that basis, on the basis laid down by Mr. Stephen Le Roux at the time. The Department of Economics and Marketing accepted the basis on which costs were to be calculated and to-day the actual costs of the farmers are determined on that basis and the price is based on it.</p>

<p>Let us return to the profits which were made. The hon. member also talked about the small farms, the uneconomic holdings. I should very much like to know from the hon. member what an uneconomic holding is. If she talks again one day she must tell us what an uneconomic holding is.</p>

<p>As far as the maize surplus is concerned, we believe that the Railways will probably be able to handle the expected surplus of 28,000,000 bags. That will really be an achievement on the part of the Railways because it will be double the amount they have ever conveyed in the past. Due to the consultations which are being conducted to-day, and as things are at the moment, I believe that we will be able to sell it fairly profitably and that we will make something out of it.</p>

<p>I want to return to the speech by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Really, Sir, it reminded me of the years when I still played rugby, because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made me think that he was also trying to play a wily game, that he was trying to slip past on the other side. During all the years that I have been sitting in this House the Leader of the Opposition has usually made a speech on general matters of policy on the occasion of this important debate of the end of the Parliamentary Session, he usually gave us a review of world conditions. The Prime Minister then replies and gives us a statement of policy as well. I maintain that there have been great developments in recent times in the world, but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say a single word about those. He only spoke about agriculture. I take it that the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs listened attentively in order to reply to him. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to go round at the wrong side, the playing side. I think if anybody has been disappointed in that speech, it must have been the members of the agricultural group in the Opposition, the members on the Opposition side who represent agriculture. During the past few weeks nothing new has happened in the sphere of agriculture which was not criticized under the Agricultural Votes. We must take it, therefore, that the debate on those occasions was of such an extremely low standard that the Leader of the Opposition had to <span class="col_8535-8536" refersTo="page_1514"/>devote his main speech to agriculture, something which really amounts to a motion of no confidence in the members of his own party. You cannot regard it as anything else, Sir. He is very disappointed that he had to devote his main speech at the end of the Session to agriculture. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition reverted to and spoke about the profits which were made on maize over the years. I want to point out, however, that profits have not only been made during the years that the National Party has been in power. Profits were also made in the years when the United Party was in power. I want to give you a few figures, Sir. During the years 1939-40 9,000,000 bags of maize were exported at a profit; in 1940-1, 5,000,000 bags were exported; the following year, 2,400,000 bags were exported. That was why there was such a terrific decline in production during the r&#x00E9;gime of the United Party, it was only in 1947-8 that we again exported on a large scale. Will the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tell us what happened to the profits which were made on maize during the first years which I have mentioned under the United Party? Do you know what happened to them? All the profits for those years were paid into the general State coffers in contrast with the policy which the United Party is advocating to-day. It was only when the National Party came into power that the position changed. During the first few years of the National Party Government we did not export large quantities, but when the United Party was still in power the Maize Board said: Very well, we accept it that it must go to the State coffers but as a temporary measure; we regard it as totally wrong, however, that it should be paid into the general State coffers. They, however, continued to do so from year to year until the National Party Government paid the profits which were made according to the auditors into the Stabilization Fund. Since the National Party has been in power every penny of the profits made on the export of maize has been utilized to the benefit of the maize farmers. The maize farmers have received every penny of the profit that has been made during the r&#x00E9;gime of the National Party.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition as well as the hon. member for Drakensberg talked about guarantees and they referred to the surpluses which have accumulated. The National Party guaranteed that the price would be laid down according to a fixed basis of costs calculations, totally different from the method followed by the United Party. But on the occasion when that basis was accepted, Mr. Stephen le Roux added something else. I want to refer to the address given by Dr. Neethling in those years to the Agricultural Union when he said that there were three parties who had to contribute to the Stabilization Fund, subject to this proviso: When the production is more than the country&#x2019;s requirements the surplus should not be such that it cannot be controlled. The condition was laid down at the time that the three parties, namely the State, the consumer and the producer should all three contribute to the fund. I am not saying that those three parties have throughout all these years contributed directly, but directly and indirectly all three parties have in the course of years continued to make their contributions to the funds.</p>

<p>We have the position to-day, Sir, that for the second year in succession over 50,000,000 bags will be produced and the position with which we are faced is this: Which of the three parties must pay more? As the position has developed since last year, we must think about it whether we can allow the consumer to pay more? If you make the consumer pay more to what extent will that affect local consumption? Is the consumer prepared to pay more than he is already paying on the local market? And if you do not do that, what do you do then? The State is already paying R10,000,000 in order to stabilize the maize industry, which includes subsidies. In order to stabilize the industry the State is paying approximately R10,000,000. The present crop will be the biggest crop we have ever had in this country and only one of two things can happen and I would have been pleased had the hon. the Leader of the Opposition taken a stand in this respect. Does he see his way clear to let the consumer pay more? In the second place there will be a shortage of approximately R17,000,000 and does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition suggest that the State should contribute that, that the taxpayer should pay that amount, which would lead one to conclude that a policy would be formulated whereby if the production continues to rise&#x2014;it was 42,000,000 bags formerly, last year it was 53,000,000, and this year we expect 56,500,000 bags, when it reaches 70,000,000 and 80,000,000, which is not at all improbable&#x2014;the State will have to continue to pay the deficit while the yield per morgen had increased by six bags. My question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is this: Must the State in that event continue to pay the shortfall? Who must pay it; only one of the three parties or all three together? That is what we are anxious to hear from the United Party. All we have had from the United Party to-day, has been the policy which they followed throughout the years when they were in power, namely that when there was a surplus of maize, they reduced the price. When there was a surplus they did not even calculate the production costs, but they immediately brought the price down to the consumer and everybody else. During their time they never calculated the cost of production. That is the policy which the United Party followed and which we must compare with the policy of the National Party. We are today faced with a surplus which is about to assume vast proportions. I do not deny that there are some farmers who are in difficulties; I do not deny that this creates problems. But then the United Party must be honest and tell us whether they have another policy and what that policy is&#x2014;that their policy is that the State and the taxpayer should make good that loss. I should like the next United Party speaker to tell us clearly that in future the United Party will follow a new policy&#x2014;<span class="col_8537-8538" refersTo="page_1515"/>because it will not be their old policy&#x2014;namely that they are prepared, if there are losses, not only in respect of mealies, because if they subsidize the one product they must pay a subsidy in respect of all surplus products which are produced in South Africa, the production in excess of the country&#x2019;s demands&#x2014;that those losses should be subsidized by the taxpayers of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to refer to a final point raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and that is the mission which has gone overseas. I am not going overseas. The hon. Leader also referred to the quota system. The United Party tried a quota system during their r&#x00E9;gime, namely a basis on which to assist the small farmer and they paid an additional 1s. 6d for the first 500 bags of maize. If it is true that the small farmer has such a difficult time and that he is going under, as we have been told by the hon. member for Drakensberg, do they think that an additional 1s. 6d. on the first 500 bags will mean anything to him and that that will save him? What has been the experience? Some of the farmers split their crops. In short, the scheme was not a success and it was abolished by the United Party itself. If a quota system basis has to be introduced, the matter will have to be thoroughly investigated. It is not necessary for us to follow the American policy. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition enlarged haphazardly on a number of things that were happening in America, as though we were already experiencing those things in this country. But when you investigate any matter, when you are faced with the difficulty of huge surpluses, difficulties which you have to meet in future, it is essential that you find out what is happening in other countries. It is not necessary for you to adopt their plans, but they can teach you and give you guidance. I accept it that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will never adopt the attitude that you cannot gain by the experience of other countries and learn something which you can apply in your own country. That, however, will not be the only task of the mission. A section of that mission is also going to Japan in respect of trade with that country and at the moment we are conducting negotiations with certain parts of China to try to sell maize to them as well. Should we try to develop those markets or should we leave them alone? Surely we should try to expand our trade with the outside world and try to find new markets. It would be a short-sighted policy on our part if we did not do so. And I am sorry that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whom we regard as a reasonable person, particularly as far as this sort of development is concerned, has adopted that attitude in respect of the mission. I hope the mission will be successful and that we will reap wonderful benefits from it, as happened in the case of previous missions which went to Europe, missions which really showed good results. The hon. member : also referred to the fact that we were originally of the opinion that only 22,000,000 bags would be exported but that we expected today that it would probably be the full 28,000,000 bag. That being the position, should we not, because of a little criticism, because of a short-sighted attitude on the part of the Opposition, avail ourselves of those opportunities and try to develop markets where we can sell our surpluses?</p>

<p>As far as this debate is concerned, Sir, I have really been disappointed in the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. We thought that in a debate such as this, we would get a speech from him in which he dealt with important matters, with world politics in general, but he sunk to a level at which he thought he would gain a little party political capital for himself in the country; he thought he could get that by sinking to the level of conducting the sort of agricultural debate which he did.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to refer to the hon. member for Christiana <span class="col_8539-8540" refersTo="page_1516"/>as the hon. member and as an &#x201C;oubaas&#x201D; whom I love. One would almost think that the country had not emerged from a war in 1945. It was necessary during the war to supply ships, to sell our agricultural products, to a great extent to the outside world, and the animal population was reduced in an attempt to supply warships and the people in overseas countries with food. But the most important fact was that a large percentage of the farmers was up North and in war camps as prisoners of war and were not themselves in a position to produce. And then we really still have the argument, Sir, that there were no surpluses from 1945 to 1948.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana mentioned the price structure which the United Party maintained from 1945 to 1948 and he said it was of such a nature that the farmers could not produce profitably, and he repeatedly men-during that period from 1945 to 1948 and afterwards we had a head at the Department who followed a policy (and he repeatedly propagated it at many agricultural congresses) that the price structure should not be allowed to get so high as to bring about inflation in the country with the result that land prices would follow suit and increase more and more.</p>

<p>And to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There we have the question! The prices of agricultural products have gone up. I blamed this Government the other day for having allowed the price structure in regard to agricultural products to get so high that the price of a maize farm has increased to &#x00A3;100 per morgen. [Interjections.] The price of land is so high to-day that the Government is unable to reduce the price of mealies sharply, because a great portion of production costs arises from the capital which has been invested in the land on which the maize is produced. Because if you have paid &#x00A3;100 per morgen for the land on which you produce maize, you have to pay interest on that capital, and that at an increasing interest rate.</p>

<p>I wish to return to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics until the hon. member for Christiana returns and I want to ask him this: He states that the good price structure and the good agricultural policy of this Government have been responsible for it that we to-day find ourselves in a cycle of surpluses. If that is the case how does he explain the fact that in the case of Canada and Australia, where the population has practically doubled, and where the increase in the population, that is consumers in the country itself, has been much more than normal, their exports have increased tremendously over the same period? We know that even before the war they were already exporting countries. Surely it is a normal occurrence in agriculture, Sir, that when you mechanize and you have enthusiastic people, they will produce more and more unless you prevent them from doing so. The Government must not underestimate the public outside and advance an argument such as that and tell the farmer and the city dweller that it has been this wonderful Government which is responsible for these surpluses. It is not this wonderful Government which is responsible for these surpluses. They are due to the fact that the farmers found it necessary to produce. Mechanization has been introduced and when the farmer buys a tractor he has to plough, otherwise it does not pay him to have that tractor. He no longer has the span of oxen which he can fatten and re-sell, or a number of spans of oxen which he can also regard as an asset. He no longer has oxen which appreciate in value. To-day he has a machine which he must keep going otherwise it is a loss to him, and even when it does run it sometimes means a loss.</p>

<p>Both the hon. the Minister and the member for Christiana issued a challenge. They asked whether this side of the House was prepared to say whether the people should subsidize the export of these surpluses at a reduced price&#x2014;yes or no. I most certainly say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; and there should be a gradual decrease in the prices of the products; it should not at once be half a crown a year per bag of maize.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will reply to that. The hon. member for Christiana asked the same question when he asked whether this party suggested that those losses should be subsidized. I said most certainly yes, subject to the condition that the decline in the price structure should be more gradual and not 2s. 6d. per bag of maize in one year&#x2014;9 per cent in one year on what the farmer receives; or 14c on 100 lb of milk, which is 12 per cent of the farmer&#x2019;s income in one year. That is what is being done in one year in order to put the price structure right, so that the State will no longer be responsible for subsidizing the farmer to such a large extent. We can tell the hon. the Minister at this stage already that it will only take him three years at that rate and he will have caught up with world prices in the case of maize. If you build a structure over a period of 10, 12 or 14 years I say it is illogical to try to put it right in three years&#x2019; time. Surely the farmer too is an economist.</p>

<p>Where I said that the State must pay it, the State coffers are the source, and that hon. member ought to know that. I want to ask this pertinent question: Is it the fault of the farmer that production costs are what they are to-day? What can he do in order to reduce those costs? I have <span class="col_8541-8542" refersTo="page_1517"/>often heard the argument that because of mechanization and increased production, production is on a more economical basis to-day. I have also heard the story about wheat&#x2014;the story that wheat is produced two years out of every five and that you sow lucerne simultaneously during those three years. Nobody has yet got up and said that the income which you derive from the stock which graze on that lucerne can be compared with the income you receive from the wheat which you produce on the same morgen of land. Get up and say he derives the same income. Surely he does not derive the same. He does not derive the same income from the stock which he places on those wheatlands which he has put under lucerne, lucerne which he keeps there for three years in order to replace the nitrogen in the soil. He gets much less from the stock. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to come back to a point which I made the other day, a point which is of great importance to me, to this side of the House and to the farming community, apart from any propaganda. I am referring to droughts and the sacrifices they demand from our animal population in this country. While I am dealing with that, Sir, I want to remind you that the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) sneeringly said the other day that he did not understand the term &#x201C;kubusse&#x201D; which I had used. The English for it is &#x201C;cubes&#x201D;. Had he kept pace with agricultural development &#x2026;[Interjections.] He can look it up in the dictionary and he will find the word there. Had the hon. member kept pace with organized agriculture and had he known about the Drought Commission and the Fodder Bank Commission, on which the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture served for a long time, and had he known what they recommended, he would have known about this. They pointed out that we should use the fodder which we had available in its raw state, fodder which may perhaps be surplus, and if we added concentrates to it, maize or oats or whatever it may be, molasses, trace elements, bone meal and pressed in into cubes, the eventual loss in fodder would be less than 1 per cent and the harm to the animal nil. The animal can pick it up off the ground or else eat it out of a trough. He can eat and digest it as a balanced food, without suffering any harm and without there being any wastage.

<p>In 1949-50 this country sustained losses to its animal population due to droughts as follows: 2,500,000 head of sheep, 1,000,000 head of cattle and 500,000 goats. According to the market prices which prevailed at the time the estimated value of that stock amounted to R30,000,000. That was the direct loss. What was the indirect loss? What about the breeding potential that was lost; what about the dairy products and the wool that were lost, and what about the good farmers who were ruined due to the fact that they were impoverished by the drought and could not carry on.

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to finish. Mr. Speaker, that brings me to the Orange River scheme. We are all proud of that scheme, it is one which we should all like to see materialize. The scheme is cast in this mould that it will operate irrigation schemes; it will also benefit industrial and urban communities, without taking into account the tremendous problem of the drought-stricken areas of the great north-west, whereas that could so easily have been done. Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that with a view to criticizing the Orange River scheme. The scheme is only in its initial stages and I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that earnest attention should be given to this. We have already sent there deputations to Australia to make a study of their irrigation schemes. Many of my friends have already been to America where they have seen what they do with irrigation. We see the methods they employ there in order to make water available for irrigation. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services has the information but I should like to give it to him once again. Years ago they harnessed the Goldburn River and what did they do with it under the Wimmera-Mallee scheme&#x2014;it is only one of the peculiar Australian words. It is situated in the State of Victoria. Apart from the fact that they irrigate 263,000 acres of land they have done the following: The State built canals and laid on pipes for over 12,500 miles. Private enterprise built canals for a distance of 3,000 miles. What do they do with those? They supply farm dams and supply water to an area which is as dry as our north-west, so that the stock will not die of thirst during droughts. In this way 15,800,000 morgen of land are being provided with water. Australia has greater drought-stricken areas in its centre and in its western area than we have. This scheme supplies 12,000 farms on which there are 45 villages and 120,000 people. I ask in all reasonableness: Where this big scheme has been announced and where everybody is anxious to help to promote the scheme and to see it developed, we do not want to criticize it from this angle that it will bring about an increase in agricultural production and that it will create more and more surpluses. [Interjections.] We will <span class="col_8543-8544" refersTo="page_1518"/>have to see to it that our price structure in respect of agricultural products is such that it will be at a par with world prices when faced with huge surpluses. However, the cardinal requirement at this stage is that it must be brought about gradually, so that the farmer hardly feels it. It is in this respect that I have so much criticism to level at the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. He shrugs his shoulders and all the friends opposite echo what he says whereas the farmers definitely feel that they are suffering an injustice. He cannot sacrifice half a crown per bag in one year. Had it been 5c or 10c he would have felt differently about it. What is the reason? Mr. Speaker, we blame this Government &#x2026;</p>

<p>Had the hon. member for Christiana been present earlier on&#x2014;I repeatedly referred to him&#x2014;he would have had a reply to his question. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say anything more about the maize position. My hon. Leader has already dealt with it adequately. I was only replying to the hon. member for Christiana. I just want to say this in connection with the price structure. I am not qualified to talk about wheat prices. I know that the price has been reduced. But let us just examine what is happening in a country which can surely also say that it has increased production due to mechanization. What do we find in the report of the International Federation of Agricultural Producers for the year 1961?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Canadian wheat farmers got more money for their wheat this past season than they have received in many years. The Canadian Wheat Board gave farmers the largest average final payment in history.</block>

<p>I maintain, Mr. Speaker, that if the policy in Canada is that because production costs have increased, the farmers must receive more, it is a pathetic policy which we follow in South Africa that if production costs do not come down, the farmer must receive less. The hon. member for Christiana also asked whether we were opposed to missions going overseas to look for markets for our products. Good heavens, Mr. Speaker, we have always said in this House that we must look for markets and where we should look for them and whether we should always just look for them in those areas where we know we will lose some of our markets or whether we must look elsewhere for markets. I said on a previous occasion that we had the large Middle East; those countries are not all ill-disposed towards us as far as markets are concerned. The United Arabic Republic only has one partner in the Middle East, as far as I know, and that is Syria, and the other countries do not all agree with Syria. If Lebanon is prepared to buy from every White race in the world, what is wrong with us? Or is this another case of Cyprus and Turkey and Greece? What are we doing to find a market there for the maize of the hon. member for Christiana. We are in favour of it that markets should be sought over the whole world. We should not discriminate on the basis of colour and refuse to look for markets in those countries.</p>

<p>I want to deal with dairy products. Was it necessary to reduce the price for 100 gallons of milk by 14 cents in one year whereas our export of butter increased from 2,000,000 lb. to 30,000,0000 lb. in one year? Did we really get such a fright at the neglible export of 30,000,000 lb. of butter at a small loss that we immediately reduced the price by 14 cents? Let us see what is happening in the dairy world today. They say in this article in the International Federation of Agricultural Producers: &#x201C;United Kingdom restricts butter import quotas. The restriction went into effect last month (April) and will hold butter imports to 874,000,000 lb.&#x201D; The Minister said a moment ago that if all the countries produced too much what would happen to the surplus in that event? He said on a previous occasion that we could not export butter, not even at any price. Here is another country which wants 870,000,000 lb. in one year in terms of a programme that &#x201C;the main suppliers to the British market are given specific quotas. The New Zealand quota is 349,000,000 lb.&#x201D; We all know that she is an old supplier to Britain under contract. Let us go further. Denmark has a quota of 205,000,000 lb.; Australia 139,000,000 lb. I wonder where they get all these surpluses from? Holland has a quota of 31,000,000 lb. and Ireland 27,000,000 lb. Irrespective of quotas, why did we not enter that market two years ago? [Interjections.] One would almost imagine. Sir, that we did not already have a surplus in 1960.</p>

<p>We imported butter at that time.</p>

<p>We already exported butter at that time, but we did not make the provision which those countries made, they got people to sit on the steps of 10 Downing Street. We were so delighted with our position of isolation that we said more or less that we could get along without the world and we did nothing. [Interjections.] I contend that this Government has thrown the dairy farmers to the wolves this year. It is not their fault that they have all gone in for dairy products on such a large scale. The farmer has to produce something and if he cannot produce maize because of the surplus, he will produce dairy products, and if the climate is right he can produce pineapples, or sugar or something else of which there is already a surplus or where a surplus threatens. If he cannot produce dairy products what is there for him to produce?</p>

<p>The policy is obviously that because agricultural surpluses are developing, the price structure must be brought down so that it will not be necessary for the State to pay such huge amounts in order to subsidize exports. We now have this cry, this statement by the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, that uneconomic units should disappear and that the only solution will be to have fewer farmers on the land. I wonder whether the Minister was correctly reported as having said that and whether he really meant that there should be fewer farmers on the land. There should be more farmers on the land. Not only are there uneconomic units but there are also uneconomic units due to the fact that they are hopelessly too large and cannot be properly farmed.</p>

<p>The Minister also says that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister also said that the agricultural potential has practically been exploited to its fullest extent. We have not even scraped the surface of the soil, Sir, and those who have not yet had the privilege of travelling overseas and who have not yet seen what they are doing in Italy, in Lebanon, in Cyprus, do not know what they are talking about. There they have mountain ranges, similar to ours along the coast as far as Swaziland, a terrace 6,000 ft. high. They produce on every inch of land and where there are rocks they cover them with soil. The Minister must not say that our agricultural potential has been exploited to the full. That is nonsense. The agricultural potential of this country is limitless, but he requires a multitude of farmers to exploit it and a multitude of technical assistants to give guidance and financial assistance.</p>

<p>I want to return for a moment to the meat scheme. I think the Minister will agree that as long as this industry is controlled by the present board, composed as it is, where the members never agree on any recommendation which they want to make to the Minister, that industry will struggle. We have lost all hope for the meat scheme. I think the Minister has also lost all hope and all the farmers opposite as well. I contend that as long as the board consists of 23 members, where the producers seldom agree because the views of many are influenced by the interests of those concerns on which they serve as directors, that Meat Board will not be a success. It will function properly when it is reduced to a board similar to some of our control boards on which not so many diverse interests are represented. Approximately 14 different interests are represented on the Meat Board. In this instance, as in so many other instances, the Minister uses the board as a smoke screen and the few recommendations which they do still make he turns down. I referred to the permit scheme the other day and the Minister again said to-day that he did not know whether the permit scheme would work. I do not know how the Minister can use that argument; if a neighbouring state has a permit scheme according to which animals are sent to the market and according to which you have to take your turn three or four months beforehand otherwise you forfeit it, and if you do not do so you are penalized by having to take your place at the end of the queue. That country has export contracts and two years ago it had four simultaneously, <i>inter alia</i>, one with Israel and one with Egypt. Many of us marketed our stock and we had to say four months in advance when we intended to market our stock. You have to submit your allocation and if you do not do so you forfeit your turn and you have to take your place at the end of the queue. How is it possible for the Minister to say that the permit system will not work here when he knows that a small country like New Zealand which exports a great quantity of meat, a country which fulfils contracts and where the farmer has to reserve his turn six months beforehand has one. What other methods are there whereby the supply to the market can be controlled? The permit system has been suspended, not abolished, according to the Minister. The Minister should tell me if there are other methods bar these two alternatives, you either take the stock at any time when they are fat and you store the carcasses in storage facilities&#x2014;facilities which he says neither the State nor the industry have&#x2014;and if you cannot do that you should control the supply to the market in a different way, otherwise you will come to grief. The Minister himself admits that the quota system cannot work. He is on the defensive at the moment and says the agents should also do something, they should control the quota system. But the quota system does not work and the Minister knows it. What else, other than a permit system, will work in order to control the supply? Must we also throw the meat industry to the wolves? It has been thrown to the wolves long ago and we no longer know what to suggest because nothing is accepted. The more members on the Government side try to defend the agricultural policy of this Minister, the more they say that everything is right and that there is nothing wrong with agriculture, the better it suits this side of the House because the sooner will they be overthrown as a Government. Agriculture will break them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the present debate is usualy regarded as one of our important debates. It is not always that we have so much that is comical in this debate as we have had to-day. After the capable and effective way in which my colleague, Minister Uys, has replied to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, I do not intend dealing with the details which he raised during his speech and to which one could perhaps reply more fully. But I have said that this debate is characterized by its comic aspect. <span class="col_8547-8548" refersTo="page_1520"/>There have already been quite a few jokes. We have had three Opposition speakers who have criticized our agricultural policy, but despite the distasteful things they have said about the two Ministers of Agriculture and their competence or incompetence, they differ greatly amongst themselves, and I think they also differ regarding that one remark because one of the main points made by the Leader of the Opposition, as well as the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) was that the farmers are not in a sound economic position and that this is due to the fact that their prices are not realistic, but too low, and that their costs of production have risen so greatly that at the present price levels they cannot make an economic living. But the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) who has actually been brought here and has been selected to strengthen the agricultural representation in the United Party, has said: &#x201C;No, the main sin committed by this Government has been that prices are too high, and this has so greatly encouraged inflation that the price of land has risen so much that this is the difficulty facing the farmers.&#x201D; He has said that unduly high prices have caused the difficulties of the farmers. The other two speakers, whom I regard as more authoritative in this field than the hon. member for East London (City), have adopted quite a different attitude, an attitude which is in direct contradiction to the attitude he has adopted. I think the hon. member has been away from his farm and engaged on social services also affecting agriculture for too long with the result that he has lost contact with the actual practical problems of agriculture to such an extent that he cannot make a productive contribution to an agricultural debate. The hon. member for Drakensberg has said that Minister Uys has let the cat out of the bag. I think the biggest pig in the poke (kat in die sak) which any political party has ever bought is the hon. member for East London (City). [Laughter.]</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the question put to me by the Leader of the Opposition regarding what I said in Kimberley. When one examines the newspaper reports, one finds that the last sentence&#x2014;I have no fault to find with the others&#x2014;is to the effect that I said that the only solution would be to have a smaller percentage of farmers on the platteland. I did not have that speech written out so that I could give it to the newspapers or the radio. There were reporters present and they submitted their reports, and they reported that I had said that this was the only solution, which I definitely did not say, but I shall say presently what I did say and I have said this before as well. It was also incorrectly reported then, and I corrected it in the newspapers, but people believe what they want to believe, as the hon. member for Drakensberg has done. She always says what she feels the Minister should have said, and then she knocks down the skittles which she herself has put up. At Kimberley I discussed <i>inter alia</i> certain problems facing the agricultural industry which should receive attention and <i>inter alia</i> I dealt with this much-discussed problem relating to the ownership of land, namely that the excessive ownership of land, in other words, the sister of big land barons, definitely constituted a problem and could create evils in this country which should be countered. But this is a problem which, even if the State does not take any concrete steps to solve, is a problem which in practice will diminish and will gradually solve itself. In other words, this is not such a serious problem, and I want to substantiate what I said on that occasion by quoting this fact, namely that the over-extensive or uneconomic utilization which must accompany excessive land ownership practically no longer exists in our country. In addition I said that the total agricultural potential of the country was not fully utilized to-day, but was in effect fully occupied. In other words, there are not thousands of morgen of agricultural land in the Republic which are still in the hand of one or more owners. But I said there was a second problem namely of unduly small farmers, in other words, uneconomic ownership of land, and this varied from area to area and region to region, depending on the rainfall and farming practices. An unduly small farm which is uneconomic, is not necessarily a unit which is inefficiently managed, because no matter how efficiently it is run, if it is an uneconomic unit, it simply means that the person concerned cannot make a proper livelihood on it. There are many such farms. I do not want to go into the causes. This is a real problem because if the State does not do anything about this, the position will also remedy itself in the course of time because those people must inevitably fall by the way-side, but such a natural process whereby the problem will be eliminated is always accompanied by great suffering and loss of manpower because it results in bankruptcy and before the farmer on an uneconomic unit leaves his farm he must first suffer greatly and it is usually his creditors who force him into bankruptcy. In the meantime he does not provide properly for his wife and family. He could not give them the proper training nor pay for their studies. We all know of the many good brains in our country which have been lost in this way because their potential value to the country in the shape of the service they could render has been reduced because they are not properly qualified for the task which awaits them. I then said that we could solve this problem by consolidation, but consolidation did not always mean a reduction in the number of farmers. It is a gradual process, and we still have sufficient scope for water storage in various parts of the country, as the Orange River Scheme has once again proved, in terms of which at least 12,000 to 15,000 more intensive irrigation farmers can under this one scheme be established on the land. When we think of the fact that in addition there are about 40,000 morgen of irrigable land which is not fully occupied, as a result of irrigation schemes which have been improved and enlarged in recent years and which have brought new land under irrigation&#x2014;<span class="col_8549-8550" refersTo="page_1521"/>I shall only refer to a few. I am thinking of the Sand-Vet Scheme, which will place approximately 16,000 morgen of new land under irrigation. I am thinking of the Kouga Scheme, which will place between 7,000 and 10,000 morgen of new land under irrigation, not to mention the improved and more assured provision of water which will be effected, and the areas which can now be more heavily populated than before because the water supply is assured and which can absorb such people who love farming but have failed in farming elsewhere. There is a difference between less farmers and a lower percentage of farmers in the population. There was a time when 40 per cent of our population were farmers. Is it wrong that there are now only 18 per cent? Was that an undesirable development? It was not wrong. Nor was this development directed along those lines by the actions of any Government, but it was the economic laws of the time which adjusted themselves to the circumstances of the time, and it was also the result of the employment opportunities and the relationship between one type of calling and another type of calling, skilled or unskilled. I must now add this. In the future I would rather see a lower percentage than the present 18 per cent of our population on the platteland in preference to a higher percentage, but subject to this proviso: The smaller percentage of farmers on the platteland, of the population on the platteland, must then be in a position to make a decent living. Because, when viewed on a broad national basis, economically sound and progressive farmers are a far greater asset to the agricultural industry and the nation as well, even if there are slightly fewer of them, when expressed in terms of percentages, in proportion to the total population of the country, than a high percentage of farmers who are living below the breadline. It seems to me that the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) rather enjoys it when I say that. Perhaps he does not agree with what I am saying. But I shall be glad if he will tell me that I am wrong; that he advocates something else, which he cannot do. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said that the position in the agricultural industry is that we are not approaching matters realistically; that we are not making the necessary provision for the requirements of the extension services, research and the utilization of the technical and scientific staff of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. My Department, just like other departments and other organizations in our country with scientists and technologists who are highly qualified and specialized, makes the best and fullest use of the services of such scientific staff. I am surprised that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has made this allegation. In what condition did the National Party Government receive the scientific section of the Department of Agriculture from the previous Government? The reply will immediately be that there had been a war.</p>

<p>But did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party not know at that time that the war could not last forever?

They let our agricultural colleges run empty; our universities were empty. In certain fields they said that people who held key posts need not join the army. Those people were given a badge with a red flash which they wore to show that they had joined up, but they made an exception in the case of the agricultural industry; they took some of our best keymen and placed them in less responsible work, less essential work, in the war effort. It does not just take a day to train technologists and scientists. Do hon. members know what other countries of the world say how long it takes to train a highly-specialized and well-qualified scientific research worker?</p>

<p>No, not seven years. It takes the best part of ten years. We set about the task. I now want to ask the Leader of the Opposition: Why would the National Party Government make provision for and agree to the expenditure on the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, which mainly employs technologists and scientists, being increased this year by R300,00 if we could not prove, not that we would be able to utilize the whole of the R300,000 during one year, but that if we are fortunate we shall require an amount very close to this figure for the strengthening of our establishment, including the increasing of salaries? Our staff position is continually improving and we are now reaping the benefits on a large scale&#x2014;this was one of the main reasons why the Government has granted its approval&#x2014;of the schemes which have been progressively introduced by the State as well as by our agricultural marketing boards, such as the Tobacco Research Control Board, the Mealie Board, the Wheat Board, the Citrus Board, each and everyone of which in turn have made bursaries available to us for the training of scientists. These people are now beginning to return in increasing numbers and there is no question of our reducing the bursaries. We shall always have a shortage of staff because the State cannot pay as much as private enterprise. We find that there are organizations which require scientific and agricultural experts but which do not make provision for training. Here I want to mention the fertilizer companies which have now established an association. I told them that I would welcome it if that industry, which employs so <span class="col_8551-8552" refersTo="page_1522"/>many agricultural scientists whom in general we have trained and whom they then later take away from us by making higher offers, would also make a contribution in the shape of bursaries. Then we would not complain so much when we train scientists and also provide their needs, because then we would perhaps do so more readily than we do now.</p>

<p>I might just say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition just referred in conclusion to the Orange River Scheme&#x2014;I think it was more a friendly gesture than anything else&#x2014;-and said they had waited 14 years for the Orange River Scheme. I can make another inference, namely that he was very disappointed at the fact that we did not have to wait 30, 40 or 50 years and that 14 years was too short a time &#x2026;</p>

<p>It was no longer ago than 1947, 15 years ago, that the then Leader of the Opposition, General Smuts himself, said the following at Cradock, and he after all was a realistic person; he was a man who could judge the needs of our country; he was a man who surely had a vision of the possible future developments and expansion of this country. What did he say? He said at a public meeting&#x2014;and hon. members will not deny this: &#x201C;Look, this is a scheme which will still have to be tackled And do hon. members know to which scheme he was referring? Not to an Orange River Scheme such as the one I am now discussing. He was referring specifically and exclusively to a scheme which would bring the water of the Orange River to the Eastern Cape. That was the Orange River Scheme of that time to which he was referring. [Interjection.] Of course that does not suit the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) because these after all are not facts which he wants one to make known to the public, but that is the position. General Smuts said: &#x201C;The scheme will have to be built but I shall not see it. My children will not see it. My grandchildren may be the first to see it.&#x201D; And what is the position to-day? The children of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will see it and his grandchildren will still benefit greatly from it. I now come to the only discordant note which I have heard anywhere regarding this Orange River Scheme, but I think it has resulted more from ignorance and stupidity than from anything else. This discordant note has come from the hon. member for East London (City). He held a meeting somewhere shortly after the announcement of the Orange River Scheme. And does the House know what he said? He said: We are already faced with surpluses and now we are undertaking this scheme which can cause such great surpluses. He also refuses to believe at all that this scheme will be as efficient and practicable as we say it will be until such time as he is given the assurance that we are going to ask Mother England or the Protectorates whether they will allow the water to flow to the republic to make possible the development of this scheme. This is not the only indication of his dependence on the outside world which the hon. member for East London (City) revealed during his speech this afternoon. Even in connection with the utilization of water, the hon. member says that we must go outside the Republic; he says that I must go and see what development there has been in Australia and what development there has been in Lebanon. When he said this, I thought the hon. member was probably thinking of dam-building techniques, but I found later to my surprise that he was not referring to dam-building techniques; he was referring to the various methods of utilizing water to provide for the existing needs of those particular countries. It is clear to me that the hon. member for East London (City) is not an irrigation farmer. He says that our methods for the utilization of water&#x2014;and he wants us to change this&#x2014;are such that they encourage the over-production of agricultural products. The methods used for utilizing water in Australia to which he has referred will apparently not do so because for thousands and thousands of miles they take water by means of pipes and / or canals, mainly for drinking purposes; in other words, water for primary or perhaps for tertiary consumption, that is to say for industrial purposes, but not so much for the irrigation purposes to which the hon. member has referred. That is how I understand him. But let us assume that I understood him correctly and that the water is used mainly in the extensive agricultural areas. When that water arrives there, apart from the fact that it will make it possible for stock farming to be practised which is impossible without water, it has this further effect: It makes it possible in such areas where farming is practised, whether it be stock farming or agricultural farming&#x2014;I am referring to the cultivation of crops&#x2014;to produce more of the same product because more water is now available. The land can carry more sheep; it can produce more agricultural products. Will this not also contribute towards an increase in agricultural production? And if an increase in our agricultural production is wrong because it results in surpluses, then is not the only solution to send all the water to the Kalahari or certain parts of the North Western Cape where people do not have drinking water &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member has said that this is what we should really do and he has criticized the scheme. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that provision will be made for all the possible requirements which fall within the scope of the scheme&#x2014;because unlimited distances can of course not be served by the schema&#x2014;and which can be served economically by this scheme or schemes and/or canals. There is nothing in the scheme to prevent that.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>I understood the hon. member. I have said that I am glad he has changed his opinion. He is the only person who has given vent to something of a discordant note but I did not take the hon. member too seriously. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that my Department was already engaged on investigations and surveys even before we announced the Orange River Scheme, and seeing to what extent within economic limits we can provide water, quite apart from the Orange River project, because if the water is too expensive, we cannot do so, as we shall be creating a precedent if we have to subsidize these people to an excessive degree. Then the hon. member would have to tell me where we must draw the line and to which farmers we must provide water by means of a higher subsidy by the State, not in respect of work which such a person is undertaking but actually in respect of State work, which will cost him nothing, in order to make it possible for him to farm. We must therefore keep the economic factor in mind. We must ask ourselves how much that water is going to cost if we take it to a certain area and how many people we can serve. This must all be worked out and planned for and we are engaged on such planning, and we shall certainly go further and extend this type of planning still further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) has referred to the question of surplus production, but I want to ask the hon. member whether 12 or 14 years ago there was anyone in this House who knew exactly to what extent consumption of all the various agricultural products in South Africa would increase, and who could prophesy at that stage that there would be such great development; that there would be such an increase in the standard of living that the per capita income of our people and our national income over this period of 14 years under the National Party Government would rise as it has risen? Is there anyone who foresaw this? No, hon. members opposite prophesied when we came into power that the banks would close, that there would be large-scale unemployment. They said that we were finished, that we were destroyed. They firmly believed that an Afrikaans-speaking person could not be appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs because what did the farmers, the Afrikaans-speaking people, know about business? They honestly believed at that time that just as they could only speak English, so we could only speak Afrikaans, and how would we be able to represent South Africa abroad? These were the ghosts which hon. members conjured up at that time, and I am glad that there are hon. members opposite who are now shaking their heads and who find it ridiculous that people could conjure up such ghosts. But I now want to refer them to ghosts which hon. members still conjure up every year as far as South Africa&#x2019;s future is concerned. When we became a Republic, the same economic ruination was forecast for us. I am thinking for example of the speech by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on the evening before the referendum and I am thinking of the speech he made last year before the election. A more scare-mongering type of speech one can hardly imagine, and notwithstanding the lack of faith and of confidence, of vision and of faith in the development potentialities of this country even under a Nationalist r&#x00E9;gime, our country has developed and grown and our consumption of agricultural products, all agricultural products included, has increased by 69 per cent. I am told that by the year 2000 our population will have doubled. We have seen how the purchasing power of our non-White peoples who hitherto have not played any significant role as consumers of agricultural products, has increased. That is why I am convinced that in planning the Orange River scheme we can make provision on a flexible basis to provide for adjustment to the requirements and needs of the country, to ensure that it will not have a disruptive effect on the country&#x2019;s economy and particularly on the agricultural economy, but that it will only have a stimulating and strengthening effect. I am convinced that we need not fear that this scheme will encourage surplus production, because it can be adjusted and so planned that it will not have that effect. But our demands for agricultural primary products, for consumer as well as for secondary industrial purposes, may double once again during the next 10, 15 or 20 years, and may do so to an even more marked degree than in the past, because I believe that the development which we have experienced hitherto and particularly in recent years is only the start of a far greater and far stronger development process in the Republic of South Africa. There are certain products in respect of which we have reached the stage in our production and development which may result in our having chronic or permanent surpluses, but the surpluses of other products are in my opinion not of a permanent nature but of a temporary nature. It may take a shorter time or a longer time, but what can one do about surpluses which one produces in one&#x2019;s own country and for which one has to find a market, whether it be an industrial article, an agricultural article or a mining article. I want to describe a surplus article in the following terms: A surplus article is an article for which one does not have a demand and an adequate market in one&#x2019;s own country. What is one to do with such an article? There is only one solution; one must export that product; one must sell it to other countries, and if one sells it to other countries, one must bear in mind that one has to take into account the fact that one will have to sell it at prevailing world prices. <span class="col_8555-8556" refersTo="page_1524"/>On the market of such other country we shall have to compete with other countries which also have surplus products which can be unloaded on that country&#x2019;s market. We shall have to concentrate on the production of quality articles and the production of higher quality articles means inevitably that there must be adjustment, in the sense that adjustment means increased efficiency, the use of improved methods of production, the use of improved stock, the use of improved methods of preserving soil fertility, of improved utilization of the land, the use of the knowledge one acquires through scientific research in one&#x2019;s own country, and the use of improved plant material.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not propose to follow the hon. the Minister in the line that he has been taking. But I have listened to both Ministers of Agriculture this afternoon and, Sir, what does it all boil down to? It boils down to a sort of sermon by each of the Ministers in turn, each indicating a state of affairs which is building up surpluses of our agricultural products. What are they doing to get markets for us? It is no good their hiding behind boards of various kinds. The boards are not there for Ministers to hide behind. There is this Orange River Scheme, which we will welcome. To do what? To produce a lot more food to add to a surplus which is already so large that we cannot handle it, surpluses which are now becoming a menace to the economy of the farmers in South Africa and threaten to become a menace to the economy of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I do want to say a word to the hon. the Minister of Finance. My hon. Leader dealt here with our position and our markets in the event of Great Britain entering the Common Market and the position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> one of our Ministers who is already overseas battling with a very hard task in the interests of our country. My hon. Leader asked what the Government do to help us in this difficulty, and the hon. the Minister of Finance interjected and said &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t be getting your help; it won&#x2019;t be with your help&#x201D;. Sir, the hon. the Minister has the effrontery to make a remark like that in regard to an issue of that character when he is the Minister who stood up here and assured the House that we were going to remain in the Commonwealth. He was the hon. the Minister who did that. He stood up here and asked us to accept his statement at its face value, laying down the law if we dared to doubt his slightest word, in the most absolute manner, permitting of no doubt whatever that we would remain in the Commonwealth, and the whole position of the South African economy flows from that basic fact &#x2019;</p>

<p>I say that it illbehoved the Minister of Finance to make a remark like that when my hon. Leader was speaking. If South Africa is in the trouble which it seems we may well be in over this question of Britain&#x2019;s entry into the Common Market, we will all have to lend a hand. That is not party politics either; it is something that applies to all of us, and the hon. the Minister ought to be pleased to accept any hand which is offered to him. He will have damn few hands offering any help to him at all.</p>

<p>With regard to the hon. the Minister who has just sat down, I want to come back to the question of the Hluhluwe water scheme, which I started to deal with on the wrong Vote. I take it that the hon. the Minister is proceeding with the scheme, not as set out in the White Paper but as determined by himself with his Department after the White Paper was shown to be inaccurate. The hon. the Minister says that he is giving this matter reconsideration.</p>

<p>Sir, I wanted the hon. the Minister to give a decision one way or the other here. I dealt with the manner in which he sent me the information last time. I want just to deal with the White Paper which the Minister put before Parliament and on which the scheme was initiated and the original money voted, because I say that there was not one single important fact in that White Paper which has not in the results been shown to be wrong and more or less wrong. Some of the facts were so completely wrong that it is incredible that a document like that could have been placed before Parliament, on which we were asked to vote a sum of money.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am coming to it; the hon. the Minister need not be impatient. I will deal with it step by step. I want to come back to one point that I made in the few minutes when I was speaking on the previous occasion, as to the survey. Sir, the survey was never made by the Departmental officials for the purpose of the White Paper. It was calculated on other plans made by other people. If the hon. the Minister doubts it, then let me read out to him the official reply that he gave to this question in the Other Place&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The difference between the information supplied in the White Paper and that contained in the survey plans of the <span class="col_8557-8558" refersTo="page_1525"/>reconnaissance branch are due to the fact that the first-mentioned information was obtained by approximations of so much on official topographical maps compiled by the Defence Force in 1943.</block>

<p>They took data from the Defence Force map compiled in 1943 and used it as a basis of their plans for 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The boundary between Bantu reserves 12 and 3 and the adjoining triangular piece of Government ground as shown on the 1 in 50,000 official topographical maps concerned, was subsequently found to be one mile out of position.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I ask you, Sir. That fixed point was one mile out of position in regard to an irrigation scheme! What happened thereafter? Is it a wonder that some of the other matters were found to be erroneous? What was found on inquiry? The area taken up in Bantu reserves at its full supply level according to the White Paper was 130 morgen. In fact when the survey was made, it turned out to be 23.6 morgen. The White Paper told us that there were 130 morgen taken up in the Bantu reserves, but when the land was actually surveyed, it was 23.6 morgen.</p>

<p>I want to go further. This dam may wreck the whole ecology of the Hluhluwe Reserve. What is the hon. the Minister so stubborn about? The White Paper said that about 200 morgen would be inundated at full supply level. In fact, when the survey took place, it was 23.6 morgen.</p>

<p>It is no good the hon. the Minister trying to interrupt me like that. I am saying that these were mistakes in the White Paper that he was responsible for. He laid the paper before us. When he found in August last year, by this true survey that mistakes had been made, why did he not have the courage to come back to Parliament and say &#x201C;That White Paper is completely wrong, it is false, I am coming back to Parliament now to place the true position before Parliament&#x201D;? Because the Minister found it out in August, last year. He laid the White Paper before us on 3 May, last year, by the end of August he knew it was wrong, he knew what the correct figures were. Mr. Speaker, the first dam to be built on the Hluhluwe River was to cost R80,000.</p>

<p>It was big enough for the farmers and for the sugar quotas that they had at that time. I am not going to deal with the sugar quotas that had been given since then, because that Minister is not here, and I am not going to deal with that. But that is what the farmers wanted. It was a scheme that they put up to the Parks Board and the province and they asked whether we had any objections. The matter was discussed and we raised no objections to it. R80,000 and there were 15 farmers. The Minister&#x2019;s scheme, what will it come to? No less than R1,200,000; the R80,000 for the whole scheme for 15 farmers becomes R80,000 per farmer. Then the White Paper said that approximately 1,000 acres of land could be irrigated in the Native reserves, apart from what the 15 farmers were to get. But when the Minister was asked whether levels had been taken for the purpose of dealing with the 1,000 acres to see whether it could be brought under the influence of the scheme the answer was &#x201C;No, that is not my business, I leave that to the Bantu Affairs Department The White Paper said that 1,000 acres could be irrigated when they had not even taken the levels.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister met an official deputation, members of the Executive Committee of the province. In addition to that he kindly met members of the Parks Board and myself at an unofficial <span class="col_8559-8560" refersTo="page_1526"/>meeting, and subsequently at an official meeting. Now I want to make two points. One is that the Minister said that the farms to be brought under the scheme could only be served with the dam at its present site, because the water could not be brought by gravity to the farms if the dam were built at a lower site. Sir, what did the White Paper say? On page 1, paragraph (2), the very last line, it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No canal system is envisaged as part of the proposal.</block>

<p>The White Paper did not envisage a scheme by gravity from the dam. I go further, and I quote from the White Paper again (paragraph (5). page 5)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Existing pumping plants along the river will deliver the water to the irrigation lands.</block>

<p>There was no question of the water going down by gravitation. The water was to be pumped.</p>

<p>When the deputations met the Minister, not only did he make the mistake about irrigating by gravity, but he made a great to-do about the necessity of keeping his own counsel where such irrigation schemes were concerned. And I am sorry to say that by inference, he cast a very grave reflection on members of the Executive Committee of the Province of Natal and on my colleague from the Senate and myself. He said, and he made it abundantly clear, that if knowledge in regard to matters of this kind leaked out in advance, unscrupulous people might take advantage of such knowledge. He said he did not consult with other people in regard to the desirability or otherwise of such schemes. Mr. Speaker, when the White Paper was before us, and the Minister was supporting it, it said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Parks Board has been kept pretty well in the picture.</block>

<p>He said that the Parks Board was advised of what was happening and that in the main they had raised no objection to what was contemplated. When the hon. the Minister was subsequently asked this year whether the Parks Board had been advised and whether it had approved, he said that the Parks Board had not been advised. When he was asked whether he had consulted with the Parks Board, the answer was &#x201C;No&#x201D;. With regard to the first dam, Sir, there was a letter on 24 June 1960 from the Director of Water Affairs saying that the question of water conservation in that area was enjoying the attention of the department, and that that department would do all in its power to prevent the loss of wild life in any form. That was on 24 June 1960. On 5 January 1961 the ex-Director of Water Affairs wrote seeking permission to carry out a survey in the Hluhluwe Game Reserve for &#x201C;a certain irrigation possibility&#x201D;. On 11 September 1961, after the survey had been completed in August, the Secretary for Water Affairs wrote thanking us for our assistance to the field party which had been carrying out the survey, and on 25 January this year the Secretary for Water Affairs wrote again asking the Parks Board for permission to carry out further survey work and to clear some bush.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister attempts to throw doubt on the statement that I am making. I had given the hon. the Minister a copy from our official files showing that no less than 44 letters were written to his Department or received from his Department by us and by the farmers&#x2019; committee that was established to go on with the project, and so forth. No less than 44 letters are quoted, and I defy the hon. the Minister to show that one of them is erroneous. He has had the opportunity to check up on every one of them. From July 1958 we had been consulted by the farmers&#x2019; committee, and been given an opportunity to state our views, and finally, we said to the Minister that his dam would ruin the ecology of the Hluhluwe Game Reserve. And then the Minister said: I am going on with it; I am not going to be dictated to by the Province of Natal. &#x201C;Of course I have kept my own counsel; of course I have not consulted with anybody; I am not going to let people know these things in advance.&#x201D; For two years there had been consultation between the Parks Board and the Minister. The Minister cannot deny that. He has the letters in his files. It was simply that he got stubborn, and he had changed the site of the dam. What does the White Paper say in regard to the site of the dam which was to be based on a pumping scheme, not a gravitation scheme? The White Paper says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The possibilities of the particular dam site and storage basin were investigated in 1959.s</block>

<p>In 1959 the Department of Water Affairs was not in the picture. In 1960 I had an interview with the then Director of Water Affairs, who said that they would not allow any farmers to build a dam on that river, and that, at a later stage, the Department of Water Affairs was going to build a dam. That dam site was the first dam site selected by the farmers. It is the one that is the basis of the White Paper put before us. But that is not the scheme that is going ahead to-day, Sir. The White Paper says: &#x201C;In 1960 a local investigation of the irrigation possibilities of the Hluhluwe Valley was carried out.&#x201D;; What investigation? That was the farmers&#x2019; investigation I was referring to. It goes on: &#x201C;In addition foundation drilling at the proposed dam site was begun in 1960&#x201D; (by the farmers) &#x201C;and sufficient information has already been collected to indicate that the site is suitable for the construction of the proposed dam wall.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, this scheme was to cost R80,000 to supply 15 <span class="col_8561-8562" refersTo="page_1527"/>farmers. It was their scheme, and they found a site which was suitable to carry the dam; the foundations were tested, and they were found to be all right. The Minister&#x2019;s Department came subsequently and, to get 25 morgen of land, inundated for approximately four miles back up the river, they increased the cost from R80,000 to R1,200,000, to supply 15 farmers, and a nebulous amount of land in the Native area that has not yet been surveyed, and there is nothing to show whether land there will come under the influence of this scheme or not. For 50 acres of land we are going to inundate and possibly destroy, the ecology of our reserve for a distance of four miles up the river! We rely on the winter grazing there for the game in our reserves. We say categorically, as a result of a survey that we have carried out in regard to siltation, that, within the first few years, that 25 morgen in the reserve, the four miles, instead of having great water holes which remain there during the winter months, it will be all silted up, and it will be simply a mud-trap for thirsty animals which seek to get in there to try and get at the water. Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has now struck up a friendship with all kinds of hon. members on his side of the House, with whom he is having discussions, most important discussions, no doubt. Sir, it is ordinary courtesy in this House, when you are addressing yourself to a Minister, that the Minister gives you the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>I say in regard to what is taking place that it is a crying shame, and it is a bitter reproach to the Minister personally that he is allowing his personal stubbornness to go on with a scheme which he knows will be the undoing of such a vast natural asset as we have in the Hluhluwe Game Reserve. Sir, the whole of the water supply in that eastern area will be affected. For thousands and thousands of acres no other water is available, and it has been calculated that a drop of 25 feet in the water level there during the dry months will turn the whole of that stretch into a desolate mud stretch, where the poor animals will be trapped when they try to get to the water. If they try and push on down to where the water is, they get outside the reserve, and they go into that Native area where we have continuous trouble with poachers, and there will be endless slaughtering of animals.</p>

<p>Sir, the Hluhluwe Game Reserve is second only as a tourist attraction to the Kruger Park in South Africa. The hon. the Minister knows that. The Railway Administration advertises it overseas. It is advertised throughout the world. The Board does not spend one penny to advertise the Hluhluwe Game Reserve, because the people who come there in their thousands every year, are the best advertisement we can possibly have. But the Minister goes on with it. The Parks Board now is having an ecological survey of the effect that this dam is going to have, not only on the Hluhluwe Game Reserve, but, in addition, on the False Bay area, which other rivers run into, and where the salinity can be built up to a point where it will be the death-knell of the fish in that area. The whole of that vast salt river lake, the biggest in the Republic, 52 miles long, is kept at a degree of salinity which will maintain the marine life only because it is continually diluted by the fresh waters of the rivers that flow into it, and with these big dams being erected on the river&#x2014;this is the first of several that are to come, and which have already been forecast&#x2014;we say that there must now be a full ecological survey, not only in respect of the Hluhluwe Reserve and the effect on this river, but in regard to the whole of the fresh water system, the feeding system to False Bay and the whole area, so that perchance we don&#x2019;t lose that great asset because of short-sighted action, damming up the fresh water which is so necessary to go down and dilute that water. I may say, Sir, that a matter of about 15 or 16 years ago, when we had a series of three or four bad drought years, the fresh water running into St. Lucia, into the False Bay lake system, was so reduced that evaporation at the top end of the lake reduced that water at mean level to four feet below sea level. The salt water from the sea was running in and out all the time, whether the tide was going in or out to the sea, it continued to run 24 hours into that lake system because the water level was so low, and the result: The salinity was built up to such a point that it killed every fish and living thing and weed and grass and every single bit of vegetation that existed in those upper lakes. It is to prevent such a thing happening again that the Parks Board has now initiated this particular ecological inquiry. I plead with the hon. the Minister not to let his own personal feeling stand in the way of the interests of South Africa. Reinvestigate the whole thing in co-operation with the Provincial Administration. This Government appointed the Administrator in Natal. Let him go and have a talk with the Administrator in Natal. Let him co-operate with his own Administrator if the Minister does not want to talk with me. Review the matter from the point of view of the longer-term interest of South Africa. Is he going to destroy the ecology of the game reserve to get 25 morgen of extra land flooded? It is heartbreaking for anybody who is trying to preserve our wild life in South Africa that such a thing can be contemplated. For the sake of what? For the sake of providing a little extra water to people who are already satisfied with the R80,000 scheme&#x2014;their own scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a tragedy, an absolute tragedy&#33; I hope that <span class="col_8563-8564" refersTo="page_1528"/>the hon. the Minister will halt and reconsider this particular operation.</p>

<p>In the very little time still left to me, I want to deal with another matter. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to deal with this matter, because it concerns his colleague who is overseas, the Minister of Economic Affairs, and it concerns both Ministers of Agriculture and it is this. We have now owing to the limitation on the supply of sugar cane to the mills through the quota system reached the stage where many thousands of acres of land are going out of sugar production. I know of one big estate that is putting 1,000 acres a year under eucalyptus for the purposes of milling by Saicor. That one estate alone is ripping out 1,000 acres of sugar cane a year under a five-year plan. That is merely one case. But there are thousands of acres going the same way. Mr. Speaker, the sugar cane lands in Natal and Zululand are some of the most highly fertile in the whole of the Republic, and the point I want to make is this: They are in an area where the normal rainfall is adequate for most purposes, between 30 and 40 inches per annum, and, Sir, the fertile soil of the Republic is one of our greatest assets. Not only is that soil fertile, but surveys from time to time have shown that in the whole of the agricultural industry, no branch of the agricultural industry is creating and putting back greater fertility in the soil than it is taking out other than the sugar industry. The industry is not robbing the soil. There are areas where 20 tons per acre were produced 15 years ago, which are producing 50 tons per year to-day. The fertility is growing continuously. And I repeat that fertile soil is one of our greatest assets, and we have to protect it for our people. As the years go we will want that soil. But, Sir, it is no good just using that fertile soil to produce more foodstuffs and putting them into markets which already are carrying huge surpluses. The point I want to make is whether the Minister of Agriculture and his colleagues will not see whether it is possible to give advice to those people who are proposing to go out of sugar because of the pressure of the quota system. It may well be that if the people in authority who have got the knowledge are satisfied that within the next few years the quota system will either be completely modified or abolished, and that sugar cane can again be produced there. Then, Sir, what a tragedy if in the meantime it is put under long-term things like eucalyptus and coffee and things like that, which then cannot be taken out to allow the soil to revert to the purpose for which it was primarily developed.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to be led off the trail, but I will simply say this that coffee has got its own diseases that we could never cope with in the olden days, and people suffered huge losses. My father was one of them. Sir, that land in my opinion should not be put under crops of a permanent character, but should be used for annuals. If there is a crop that can be grown and reaped annually, so that the soil remains available for sugar if the quota system is ever modified, well and good. We do not want the soil lying there barren, fallow, but it can be highly dangerous for farmers at the present time who are trying to get a cash crop to come into the market with perhaps a huge amount&#x2014;because it is a question of thousands of acres&#x2014;a huge amount of foodstuffs where the market is already glutted. Sir, they should be given advice, and I hope a survey will be made with the intention of giving advice to those farmers on whom the quota system is pressing. It is quite possible that if the quota system is modified in a few years ahead of us, those farmers will be the first to get back the quota they have lost. Sir, that soil is very fertile. Markets for the time being are being denied us, but in time people will find new markets. I am not losing faith over this. Let the Government give these people the right advice and tell them what crops they should go in for, without going in for crops which will tie up their lands for 10, 15, 30 years. The same difficulty of course arises in regard to the big scheme on the Makatini Flats, the Pongola-Makatini Scheme, on which the Government is spending R32,000,000. The plan was designed for sugar-growing. It is being held up and a survey is being made to see what crops can be grown there economically. It is part of the overall picture, and the Government must not discriminate between Government-owned land and private-owned land. That fertile soil is our heritage. Let us protect it and put it to the best possible use. Let a committee be appointed and give advice to the people concerned.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) has fared even worse than his Leader. The present Session is now running to its end. We have sat here for six months and the people of South Africa have waited for certain statements, for a review of important matters of policy and of international affairs; they waited for the Prime Minister to make a statement, but what have we had from the Opposition during this important debate? Nothing! And I <span class="col_8565-8566" refersTo="page_1529"/>am saying this deliberately because only a few days ago we discussed two agricultural Votes in Committee of Supply. In addition we have had two major agricultural motions before us which gave the United Party the opportunity to submit an alternative agricultural policy and to submit constructive criticism of the agricultural policy of the Government. During this debate we expected the Opposition to place international affairs under the spotlight, but no! It is because they are bankrupt that they did not do so.</p>

<p>I want to go further and to tell those members of the United Party who are members of the agricultural group and have participated in the agricultural debates of this Session as such, that they have failed in the eyes of their own Leader. Their own leader is convinced that they have performed so poorly that he has considered it necessary to make an attack on the agricultural policy of the Government during this debate. If their leader had considered that they had done their duty towards the agricultural industry of South Africa, then he would not have considered it necessary to introduce this amendment to-day. I thought that he would also take the opportunity to welcome the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) as a member of his Party. In the newspapers however I see a &#34; swop &#34; column and I do not know whether the hon. member has swopped Helen for Sannie and can now no longer be welcomed&#33; The hon. member for South Coast however has committed a greater sin than that to which I have already referred, and this he has done by devoting his attention to local matters tonight. While we are holding a debate on matters affecting the country as a whole, the hon. member for South Coast has confined himself to conditions at Hluhluwe&#33; This is surely a matter which he could have discussed on the Minister&#x2019;s Vote or on the Loan Vote. Moreover his facts are wrong as well&#33; He has compared the areas provided for in the White Paper and the areas as determined after inquiry. And this he has done while he should have known that the 135 morgen was based on an estimate. He has also said that the Department of Water Affairs did not institute an investigation <i>in loco</i>. His information in this regard is not correct. On 29 April 1957, the farmers of that area asked for the establishment of a local irrigation committee and also that their scheme should be drawn up. On 19 March 1958, that committee asked for the construction of the dam to be accelerated. The committee then appointed Professor Vorster of the University of Pretoria as consultant. This professor submitted his technical report to the Department of Water Affairs on 3 June 1959. On 14 August 1959, the engineers of the Department of Water Affairs instituted an investigation <i>in loco</i> to study conditions there. I also find that on 14 October 1959, an inter-departmental committee, consisting of representatives of the Department of Lands, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the Department of Water Affairs, was appointed to investigate this scheme <i>in loco</i> and to study conditions. This inter-departmental committee submitted its report on 4 April 1960. Consequently the hon. member&#x2019;s facts were not correct. I now want to submit that if he wants to build up a case and the facts which he submits are not correct his whole case collapses. I feel that his whole case regarding the dam at Hluhluwe has collapsed.</p></speech>

<p>The whole thing does look very suspicious!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>These are the facts and nevertheless the hon. member for South Coast says that no departmental investigation was instituted. I have given the House the various dates on which investigations were in fact held.</p>

<p>But there is another matter which the hon. member has raised and which I want to discuss. In this regard I think the hon. member has succeeded in making out a case. I am referring to the sugar quotas of the sugar farmers. I am very glad to be able to say that the hon. member in this instance has taken positive action and has put matters in the correct perspective. He has not made an attack, because, as we all do, he knows the sugar farmers have asked that a quota should be laid down for them in order to protect them. I agree with the hon. member for South Coast in this regard. I believe that the Government will have the necessary investigation instituted and will take steps to advise the farmers there to plant annuals instead of gums, in other words, will advise them how to utilize their lands profitably without causing over-production so that when they eventually want to commence the production of sugar&#x2014;and we believe that they will be able to do so&#x2014;the soil will still be suitable for this purpose. As I have already said, I think the hon. member has made out a case here.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the other allegations which have been made. I am sorry the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) is not here. He has said that the members of the Meat Board can never reach agreement regarding recommendations which have to be made and this is because 23 members serve on the board and they represent various interests and undertakings. I want him to tell the South African Agricultural Union and the farmers that he does not want producers to be represented on the board, or if not, he must say that commerce, or the butchers, or the consumers, or the hide and skin processors should not be represented. Does he want the Marketing Act to be dismantled? Did the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Swart) not make it quite clear the other day that the Marketing Act had complied with certain tests? The Meat Board is one of the sub-divisions of the Marketing Act and is so constituted that the meat industry can be controlled and protected as a whole. Because he has had a disagreement on the Meat Board with Neels Visser and they then threw him out, as he has been thrown out of the Wool Board, he should not come to this House and build up a case against <span class="col_8567-8568" refersTo="page_1530"/>the Meat Board by advocating the drawing up of a different constitution. He knows that such a suggestion is in direct conflict with the Marketing Act. He has said that the permit system has failed, but he nevertheless wants the Minister to reintroduce this system. Is he then not the person who at a certain congress of the National Woolgrowers &#39; Association kept the Meat Board occupied for a whole day in an attempt to prove that the permit system could never solve this problem? Because before the permit system was abolished, we had an unrestricted flow. But he has forgotten this and he is now asking that the system should be reintroduced.</p>

<p>But he has also tried to bring this House under an incorrect impression. He has stated that the farmers in Canada are now receiving so much for their wheat while the South African farmers are receiving less. But why does he not also say that in Canada the domestic price of wheat is far lower than the price which can be obtained externally? Why does he not also say that the producer in Canada receives less than the amount for which Canada can sell wheat? Why does he not also say that the farmers receive part of the profits made on the sale of wheat abroad? In South Africa we have a shortage of wheat and consequently still have to import wheat. When we made a profit on the export of our products, the United Party paid that profit into the Treasury. In Canada however the farmers are paid part of the profits when profits are made on the export of a particular product. Those profits are not paid into the Treasury.</p>

<p>I shall return later to the remarks made by the hon. member regarding our dairy production. At this stage there is another matter which I should like to make clear. The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) alleges that the Government regards the small and the inefficient farmer as one and the same thing. The hon. member for East London (City) has said this as well. By saying this, they are accusing this Government of wanting less farmers on the platteland. But let us see how many farmers this Government has placed on the land during the 14 years of its r&#x00E9;gime, and how many were established as such in the preceding 38 years. The fact of the matter is that this Government, under Sections 20 and 23 of the Settlements Act, has restored four times as many Whites to the platteland as was the position during the 38 years which elapsed before this Government came into power. And these were not only soldiers. In addition, the Government has announced the Orange River scheme, which will make provision, not only for industrial development, but also for the establishment of additional farmers on settlements. This is clear proof that the Government believes that our platteland must be populated, and that, with this aim in mind, we must place more farmers on the platteland. This being so, why have hon. members made such an incorrect allegation?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg, like the hon. member for East London (City), and, to a certain extent, the Leader of the Opposition, has alleged that the Government has ignored organized agriculture, and has tried to substantiate this allegation by quoting the mealie price. I am sorry the Leader of the Opposition is not here. He moved this amendment, and now he is not here to hear our answers to the unfounded allegations which he has made! So little is he interested in this debate! He moves an amendment, but then he disappears, and we do not see him again!</p>

<p>Where is the Minister&#33;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Florida said the other day, quite correctly, that the Marketing Act had stood the test of whether it could protect the consumer, and that this Act had stood that test particularly during the r&#x00E9;gime of the United Party, and particularly at the time when we had shortages, with the result that a member, who was in this House at that time, even had to smuggle a leg of meat! Then the Marketing Act protected the consumer at the expense of the producer. The hon. member for Florida stated that the Marketing Act had answered its purpose in this respect. This is the Act which they placed on the Statute Book with the wholehearted support of the National Party&#x2014;the then Opposition. To-day, however, the Leader of the United Party says that we cannot apply the Act. He says that we should not have these various methods of price determination, and that the Minister should not differentiate between the method used in fixing the price of mealies and the method used in fixing the price of sugar, bananas, etc., but that he should use the same method in all cases. I now want to ask the hon. Leader of the Opposition whether he is not going to expel the hon. member for Florida from his caucus? The hon. member for Florida has said, after all, that the Marketing Act is the Act in terms of which this control should be applied, and that orderly marketing to the benefit of both the consumer and the producer can be assured under this Act. But here his Leader has come and rejected his contention&#x2014;four days after he made it in this House.</p>

<p>I want to say this. The South African Agricultural Union, which is the mouthpiece of the farmer, has asked that we should keep the Stabilization Fund for mealies at the same level. To do so&#x2014;so it was stated before the Select Committee&#x2014;it is necessary that certain price determination methods should be applied, namely the cost of production plus the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage. Do hon. members want us to rob the Stabilization Fund so that there will be nothing in this fund next year?</p>

<p>What about the surpluses?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The surpluses will be borne by this Stabilization Fund. The surpluses will therefore be marketed to the advantage of <span class="col_8569-8570" refersTo="page_1531"/>the farmer. Hon. members however do not want a Stabilization Fund. They want the surpluses to be made the responsibility of the farmers. The Government is even prepared, in order to keep the Stabilization Fund in a sound position, to pay a subsidy so that the fund will have the necessary money available. The hon. member for Drakensberg and the hon. the Leader for the Opposition must not come here and say that the Government is rejecting the producer. The hon. member for Drakensberg has said that the cat has thereby been let out of the bag. But this Government is a friend of both the consumer and the producer and in terms of the Marketing Act will make proper provision for both these aspects of our national economy. For this reason the Government also enjoys the support of the consumer and the producer on every occasion. It is because both the consumer and the producer are confident that they will receive the necessary protection under this Government.</p>

<p>But the United Party have tried to repudiate the Act which they themselves placed on the Statute Book. They have repudiated the Marketing Act to-night. I now want them to tell the South African Agricultural Union that they, that is to say the United Party, no longer have any faith in the control board system. Let us analyse the position. The hon. member for East London (City) has criticized us for not having quotas in respect of our butter exports, and also because we did not sell butter to England two years ago. Do hon. members not know that every country&#x2019;s quota in respect of a specific product is based on the quantity of that product which has been exported in preceding years? During the preceding four years we did not sell any butter to Britain, but Australia, New Zealand and Canada did deliver butter to Britain. And hon. members now want us, while we did not deliver any butter to Britain during the preceding four years, also to be granted a quota in competition with countries which did in fact export to that country. Hon. members say that it is because we are out of the Commonwealth that we cannot obtain a quota. The fact of the matter is however that we have not received a quota because we did not supply butter to Britain during the preceding years.</p>

<p>Let us review the production position in South Africa. During 1958-9 South Africa had to import 3,780,000 lb. of butter and during 1959-60 3,472,000 lb. We therefore had to import approximately 7,000,000 lb. of butter during those two years!</p>

<p>The hon. member over there says &#x201C;poor administration&#x201D;. But I am certain that he would not be able to tell a cow from a bull! If he were to enter a kraal, he would milk the bull instead of the cow! In any case, whereas we only produced 44,000,000 lb. of butter in 1940, we produced 114,500,000 lb. of butter in 1961-2 and 118,750,000 lb. in 1961-62. With the assistance of technical service.sound administration, and the assistance of the farmers it has taken the Government this short period to increase our production of butter to such an extent that we no longer need to import butter. And now the hon. member for East London (City)&#x2014;the Wise Man from the East&#x2014;expects that we should obtain a quota for exporting butter to Britain and this while we have not supplied any butter to that country&#33; He must not talk nonsense (wol) in this House if he knows nothing about butter.</p>

<p>In addition the Government is not sitting idle now that we are faced with over-production. We had a Stabilization Fund of R10,000, but this fund has been greatly reduced as a result of over-production. At present, however, the position is that while we had 25,000,000 lb. on hand in March 1961, we only had 20,000,000 lb. on hand in March 1962, and this notwithstanding increased production. This 20,000,000 lb. of butter can be consumed in 11 weeks and it therefore does not create such a tremendous problem. Why do we have this relatively favourable position? Because the Government immediately took steps to increase local consumption. The Government has also succeeded in increasing local consumption by 7.5 per cent which has brought local consumption to a total of 6,000,000 lb. In addition the Bantu markets are being developed and very good progress has been made in this respect; as a matter of fact, to such an extent that in April we were able to increase the weekly consumption from 8,304 lb. to 11,340 lb. The Government has therefore taken the necessary steps to remedy the position in respect of dairy production, just as in respect of other products.</p>

<p>I now just want to express a final thought regarding price stabilization. Hon. members, <i>inter alia</i> the hon. member for East London (City) as well, have discussed wheat, However, they know that the agricultural union for the wheat regions has already been asking for two or three years for a review of the costs of production. This review has already taken place and it shows that there has been a reduction of 13.5 cents per bag in the costs of production. But despite these reduced costs of production, and despite the fact that in the case of certain other products there is tremendous over-production, hon. members opposite say that the price of wheat should be increased! This is after all a false promise to the voters. It has always been accepted that under the Marketing Act prices are fixed on the basis of the costs of production plus an entrepreneur&#39;s wage. If the costs of production have now fallen, then we must after all take into account the possibility of a reduction in prices. We cannot increase the wheat farmer&#x2019;s entrepreneur&#39;s wage while the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage of other producers is declining still further! No, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;hon. members opposite are trying to catch some votes as a result of circumstances prevailing in the agricultural industry. We admit that tremendous problems are facing the agricultural industry. We know that not all our farmers are doing well and also that the position is not good in all regions. The United <span class="col_8571-8572" refersTo="page_1532"/>Party is preying like a vulture on the little dissatisfaction which exists and which has arisen as a result of climatic conditions and world trends. A party which acts in this way remains a dead party. The situation which has arisen has not arisen as a result of poor administration or poor control, but in certain areas as a result of droughts and in others as a result of uneconomic sub-division. A party which preys on this type of thing is a party which is gradually dying. Such a party cannot make any positive suggestions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) has done a very strange thing. He and other members have risen and said that during the years 1945-8 the Secretary for Agriculture repeatedly said that prices should not be allowed to rise because the price of land would be forced up unduly as a result. The hon. member now maintains that it is because the farmers received so much for their products that one has to pay R200 per morgen for mealie land. In other words, a member of the United Party, a party which is courting the farmers&#x2019; votes so vigorously, tells the farmers that it is because they have always been paid so much for their products that the price of land is now so high. Just imagine, Mr. Speaker! The one group are complaining that the farmers are being paid too little and that they are going to go bankrupt; on the other hand their main speaker, whom they regard as a Wise Man from the East, says: &#x201C;Oh no! The farmer in South Africa has been paid too much for his products and that is why the price of land is so high&#x201D;;. He tells the farmers, in other words, that if the United Party had been in power during the past 14 years, they would have been paid less for their mealies, wheat, fruit, etc.&#33; This is the only conclusion which one can draw.</p>

<p>The same hon. member has said that as a result of the ley-crop scheme the farmers are now receiving less than before. Is he then a stranger in Jerusalem? Does he not know that the ley-crop scheme was introduced in order to increase soil fertility? Does he not know that it was introduced so that when the farmer&#x2019;s grain crops failed, he could have another income, that is to say, from his stock.</p>

<p>I want to give an excellent example, and this example is provided by our immediate vicinity. During the past seven years the quantity of wool delivered to the Cape Town Docks has risen by exactly double. Why? Because the farmers are using lupins to integrate stock into their crops&#x2014;in other words, they are receiving an income not only from wheat, etc., but also from woolled sheep. And yet the hon. member&#x2014;the Wise Man from the East&#x2014;says that the farmer is being paid less!; No, Mr. Speaker, hon. members must not discuss agricultural matters because they know too little about them. There is another aspect of the matter which I want to emphasize. When the farmer could have received far more for his products abroad during the r&#x00E9;gime of the United Party than is the position to-day, the United Party paid the resultant profits into the Treasury. It was, in other words, at that time concerned about the taxpayer and wanted the taxpayer to pay as little as possible in tax. But to-day, however, they say that we should subsidize products, but when we ask them whether the necessary funds should come from the taxpayer, they do not know!</p>

<p>We can only subsidize agricultural products by means of additional taxation. That being so, the United Party must therefore openly advocate increased taxes if it wants these products to be subsidized. In addition, hon. members must publicly state that the Marketing Act should be repealed. The reason for our difficulties is not to be found with the Marketing Act or over-production. Our difficulty is that we have a United Party which just preys on complaints and failures and cannot submit anything positive. If the United Party would submit a proposal to the effect that we should investigate the Marketing Act to see whether we cannot give the Marketing boards the necessary control powers in order to effect certain economies in distribution, they would be doing something positive. If they would say: Let us investigate the Marketing Act in an attempt so to arrange matters that South Africa will not have specialized shops, and so that we shall save on distribution costs, or so that we can arrange for differentiated prices for the man who buys for cash and the man who buys on credit, so that the consumer can derive the benefit because a shop sets aside 15 per cent and 20 per cent in respect of its accounting system which could be saved with a cash system, and it sets aside 10 per cent in respect of its delivery system, which could also be saved if the customer buys directly. If they would make such suggestions, I would say that they are making positive proposals in order to help the farmer and the consumer. But no, they do not do so. Our problem in South Africa is that we have a United Party which has lost contact with agricultural industry and with the consumer, and is now courting the votes of both&#x2014;to-day the vote of the farmer and to-morrow the vote of the consumer&#x2014;with the result that they are always falling between two stools.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) started his speech by criticizing the Opposition for not conducting this debate in the sphere of international affairs. On that I would like to make two suggestions to him. The first is that he should remember that this is only the first half-day of this debate and that our leader moved an amendment which has three legs, the first of which deals with agriculture, the second with the ordinary family in South Africa, and the third by the image of South Africa created in the world by this Government. As the hon. member admitted, in the very nature of his speech, we have been discussing to-day only the agricultural leg of our amendment. So his challenge was completely unfounded, wrong, and without justification.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to speak on the second leg <span class="col_8573-8574" refersTo="page_1533"/>of the amendment, but before I do so I think it is only right that I should say something about the Minister of Water Affairs and his attitude to the Orange River scheme. It is common knowledge that we of the Opposition welcome the gigantic scheme for the development of the Orange River as announced by the Government. We are eager that they should go ahead with that scheme. We shall watch their progress and we shall not hesitate to criticize if that progress is too slow, or if it is not what people have been led to expect. We do not have much confidence in this Government to implement that scheme. The one question which the Minister of Water Affairs has not answered, although he spoke for his full 40 minutes, and which he should answer at the very first opportunity that offers, is when did he and his Government become converted to the Orange River scheme? How many times did the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) have to move private motion after motion and raise the matter year after year and debate it under the Vote of the Minister before he could persuade the Minister that this was a good scheme?</p>

<p>To which scheme are you referring?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I see the Minister is becoming coy. On 13 March 1959 not so long ago, the hon. member for Albany asked for the Orange River scheme, and particularly for something to be done to relieve the unhappy fate of the settlers under irrigation in the Fish River Valley. The Minister damned that scheme and told the House and the country that this idea of diverting the water of the Orange River from a barrage near Bethuli and through a 51 miles long tunnel was utterly impracticable. The reason the hon. the Minister gave was that it would be too expensive. The Minister told us that everything had become more expensive, that we of the United Party thought that this scheme would cost &#x00A3;18,000,000 but that afterwards Mr. Strijdom revised the Estimate to &#x00A3;40,000,000, and then his Department revised it to &#x00A3;70,000,000. The Minister explained so much more. He said that everything had gone up in price. He said, in Hansard, Col. 259&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us take an example. Let us take fruit salts. In 1951 the price of fruit salts was 2s. 6d. What does it cost to-day? 5s. 3d.</block>

<p>[Laughter.] I thought the trouble of the Government was only mental constipation. [Laughter.] The Minister went on, and this was his attitude to one small part of the Orange River scheme at the time. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was said that 150,000 morgen could be irrigated in the Eastern Cape if this scheme is built. I do not know where they get that 150,000 morgen from, because it is absolutely foolish to think that with the limited amount of water we will have available for irrigation in future, one can afford to irrigate inferior types of soil with that expensive water. It just cannot be done. There will not even be enough water in the long run permanently to irrigate the best types of soil. Why should we build schemes to irrigate inferior soil which cannot produce good crops, and which is so far distant from the source?</block>

<p>Then he went on to show that this scheme would cost more than &#x00A3;1,000 a morgen. I think the House should note that. In Col. 2511 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now there is nobody who can tell me that our Estimate is wrong and therefore it is not only we on this side of the House, but also members on the opposite side and people in the Eastern Province, who realize that this scheme cannot be implemented. When I went there I thought it was high time, seeing that I was the Minister responsible, that these people should not be encouraged to have expectations which I personally knew were impracticable.</block>

<p>That is a remarkable statement by the Minister. When did he become converted? I have a suggestion later to make to the Minister. In Col. 2512 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">May I ask whether there is a single farmer in the Fish River Valley or in the Sunday&#x2019;s River Valley who will regard this as being economic? Is there any business man, is there anybody with sound common sense and with a sense of values who will be prepared to spend &#x00A3;1,000 per morgen just to bring water to that land? Of course there are no such people, because it would be totally uneconomic, and for those reasons I reject the scheme.</block>

<p>Yet the plan the Minister gave us in the beginning of the Session to irrigate the Fish River Valley is in essence the same plan as the Conroy plan.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member know that whereas that single scheme would have cost &#x00A3;1,000 a morgen, with this new planning in its multiplicity, which will also bring the water to certain land, will cost an average of only &#x00A3;375 a morgen?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank the Minister for the information he gave me. It was my intention to ask the Minister to tell the House how much less his scheme will cost than the Conroy scheme. He now gives us the figure of &#x00A3;375 a morgen, which is of course a ridiculous figure, and I will tell you why. The dam at Bethuli is shifted slightly towards Norvalspont, but the tunnel of 51 miles long is still the most expensive item in the scheme, and unless the Minister is willing to do an inferior job it cannot cost less &#x2026;[Interjections.] The tunnel which is the most expensive item, according <span class="col_8575-8576" refersTo="page_1534"/>to the speech the Minister made in March, 1959, remains unchanged, and all the other things the Minister mentioned are ancillary to the tunnel. They may believe that this scheme will only cost &#x00A3;375 a morgen. That suits me for the purposes of the argument I want to develop. But I want to remind the House that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) spoke of a scheme earlier to-day which in the planning stage we were told would cost &#x00A3;40,000, and now that it is being done it will cost &#x00A3;40,000 per farm. Knowing that, what value can I attach to the preposterous suggestion of the Minister that he can do the Conroy Scheme at &#x00A3;375 a morgen? Either the Department is making a wrong calculation now, or Mr. Conroy was right when he thought that his scheme would cost &#x00A3;18,000,000 and not &#x00A3;70,000,000. But that is not the point I want to make. The point is that the Minister should tell us when he became converted to the Conroy Scheme, which was so diligently kept alive for South Africa by the hon. member for Albany? The second thing he should have explained is: When did he decide to go ahead with the Orange River Scheme? When did they make that Departmental decision? Because unless the Minister can give us a satisfactory reply to that, South Africa has witnessed one of the most scandalous bits of exploitation of its citizens that has ever happened in our history. While the Minister on his own admission has decided to spend &#x00A3;375 a morgen to bring water to the Fish River Valley, during the last recess the Government arranged to buy the land from those desperate settlers in the Fish River Valley at &#x00A3;150 a morgen. Did the Government know that they had changed their minds about the Conroy Scheme and were going ahead with the development of the Fish River Scheme, and with the diversion of water from the Orange River into the Fish River? Did they know that they were going to spend &#x00A3;375 a morgen to bring water to that almost desolate land when they bought that land from the farmers for &#x00A3;150 a morgen? That is one of the most unjust practices of which they are guilty, when they deceived the farmers of the Fish River to sell their land at &#x00A3;150 per morgen when they knew that it would cost &#x00A3;375 a morgen to put it under water. [Interjections.] I think the Minister of Finance should tell us whether the Government knew that they had changed their minds and that they were going to divert water from the Orange River to the Fish River when they bought land from the settlers at &#x00A3;150 a morgen? Or were those people deceived? The member for Vereeniging now shouts at me, &#x201C;; Why did the Government buy that land?&#x201D;; I do not know. [Interjections.]</p>

The reason why they changed their minds about this scheme, which in 1959 was considered to be completely and utterly uneconomic, and which according to the Minister would have brought water to inferior soil&#x2014;has the soil become superior all of a sudden?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>How did they change the nature of the soil? We have to ask ourselves: Is the reason not that this water is not needed to rescue the irrigation farmers in the Fish River Valley, but it is needed for the border industries to implement the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Bantustan scheme? [Interjections.] To me, as a layman, who attributes the highest motives to the Government, that is the only explanation for this change of face. We all know that what is behind this change of face is not to rescue the farmers but to advance the Bantustan policies of the Prime Minister. [Interjections.] But I shall leave the Minister there, and I repeat that he should take an opportunity to tell us. He had an opportunity to-day to do so, but he should take an early opportunity to tell us two or three things. The first is: When did the Government change its mind? Secondly: Why did the Government change its mind, and thirdly, when the Government bought this land from the unsuspecting and desperate settlers in the Fish River Valley, did they know that they were going to spend more than twice as much money on every morgen to bring water to that land?</p>

<p>But now I want to deal with another matter. I have been dragged into this discussion almost against my will. [Laughter.] I had to do so because of the superficial manner in which the Minister dealt with this issue. I want to point out that we are now reaching the end of the Session, which has run true to the pattern of every session of Parliament since 1948. Parliament assembled to attend to the just government of men in South Africa, and we have spent more than half, at least 70 per cent of our time, on ideological matters, and hardly any time on the fate and the needs and the aspirations of the average South African.</p>

<p>I ask myself who initiates measures in this House. When it <span class="col_8577-8578" refersTo="page_1535"/>comes to Private Members&#x2019; Day, we of the Opposition have an equal opportunity with the Government. Without discussing the merits of any motions, let us look at the subject matter of the motions moved by us and by hon. members opposite while there were Private Members&#x2019; Days available to us. On 7 February I moved a motion asking the Government to attend to the interests of the white-collar workers of South Africa. On 16 February the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) moved a resolution drawing the attention of the Government to the plight of the farmers and the danger of surpluses. That was four months ago, and the same criticisms are still valid The Government has not thought about those issues, but they have thought a lot about ideological matters. On 9 March the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) asked for a voluntary medical aid system to assist the ordinary citizen to meet the problem of medical expenses. On the 16th the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) moved a resolution asking that Government Ministers should be restricted in their business activities. At that time it might have seemed not to be a bread-and-butter issue, but since then more than 40 Afrikaans journalists have been sacked as a result of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s participation in the newspaper business, and I realize now that that was a bread-and-butter issue, too. What did we get from hon. members opposite? The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman)&#x2014;I give him full marks for it&#x2014;moved a motion on the shortage of technicians. He wasted his breath and his time, but at least he did it. Then came the hon. member for Klerksorp (Mr. Pelser) with a motion that the jury system should be abolished. Then came the hon. member for Vereeniging with a motion in regard to the newly-appointed Minister of Information. All that had nothing to do with the bread and butter of the people of South Africa. Then, finally, as a climax, the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) came with a motion that the Government should initiate the wholesale destruction by clubbing of the fauna in the seas around our coast. The Minister of Finance will find that seven or eight times as much time was spent on ideological measures than on the motions we moved.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>We had the choice for 125 hours in the Committee Stage on the Budget, and by far the most of that time was spent discussing the interests of the people of South Africa. That is really the only time that we had the initiative. I want to give an example of what happened. When I moved on 7 February that something should be done for the white-collar workers of the country, the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs replied on behalf of the Government because not a single Cabinet Minister thought it worth while to be in the House while we were discussing the interests of the white-collar workers. The Deputy Minister answered and gave a solemn undertaking that this Session there would be a new consolidating and amending Shop and Offices Bill. That Bill was published, but that is the last we heard about it. About a week ago I asked the Leader of the House whether that Bill would come on and I was told no. There may be a good reason for it. I understand the reason is that certain interested parties have asked that the Bill should stand over, but why did the Minister of Labour not have the courtesy to tell us, after the promise we got on our initiative, that the Bill would come on? After all, we knew the Minister of Labour as a most courteous man. When he was in the United Party his courtesy was exemplary, and his degeneration could not have been so fast since he has been sitting over there. It is a great pity that we did not have a chance to discuss that Bill in detail. The Minister is not here, but I hope somebody will convey a suggestion to him. I want to suggest that this delay in bringing the promised Bill to the House could be usefully employed by the Government to investigate scientifically some of the proposed provisions of that Bill, especially where there are differences of opinion between employees and employers. I think, e.g., of a thing like minimum working hours in shops and offices. I notice that in the proposed Bill 46 hours is suggested by the Government. Some employers may think that is too short. All employees will tell the Government it is much too long. Could we not devote our time in the recess to a scientific investigation of what will be the most efficient working week in shops and offices? Industrial psychologists could give us most valuable information. There are a number of questions which should be solved. One must try to determine how long a person in the average office must work to maintain his optimum efficiency and his maximum output; at what stage will the curve of productivity of a worker begin to fall? We do know that as the result of long working hours it falls very rapidly, through fatigue. Errors are increased and so are accidents. We also know that productivity is affected by factors like noise and the type of work they do and the posture in which they work. Cannot we have a scientific investigation of this problem and find a norm, because that is all the Act can lay down, a norm, which may be exceeded by some people, and which may be made shorter for others. But at the moment the position is unsatisfactory. Employers will tell you that one of the major complaints about workers is absenteeism, and the fact that relations between employer and employee are not always happy. One wonders whether that is not perhaps due to the fact that the 46-hour working week is too long. I am not expressing a final opinion at this stage, but I do suggest strongly that the recess should be devoted to a scientific investigation of this matter, and I want to suggest generally that at least during the next session of Parliament the Government should take a little time off from its ideological preoccupation <span class="col_8579-8580" refersTo="page_1536"/>to attend to the needs of the ordinary people.</p>

<p>If I discuss the Vote of any particular Minister, it would be a single tragedy. I want to discuss accumulative tragedy, the policy of the whole Government. We in South Africa have to face the fact of the wrong assurances the Minister of Finance gave us a year ago, when he told us that our remaining in the Commonwealth would be completely automatic. To-day we are the most isolated and lonely nation in the world. The Minister told us that our remaining in the Commonwealth was automatic, and he tried to make my Leader look ridiculous because my Leader warned the Government that they would be surrendering our membership of the Commonwealth into the hands of the less friendly members of the Commonwealth like Ghana, and history proved that the Leader of the Opposition was right and that the Minister of Finance, as so often happens, was wrong. There was no truth or reality in his assurances. I say we are the most isolated country in the world. [Interjection.] The Minister for Coloured Affairs should not make these silly statements. Let the Minister mention to me one other country in the world which could not get a single vote in its favour at UN. As a last desperate resort of the Cabinet, when they are completely cornered, they retaliate by saying: Tell us what you would do. Sir, the United Party Government would not have given Ghana the opportunity of ousting us from the Commonwealth. Secondly, the United Party Government would not have set about converting every conventional way of life in South Africa into rigid race laws, with cumulative sanctions attached to every law. We would have left race relations in this country as they have been for 300 years, largely to the common sense of the South African people. We would not have made of this Parliament a cockpit to enforce the ideological extremes of the Government. We would not have given the world this unfortunate image of South Africa. We would have sent people to represent South Africa overseas, who by their history would have had the confidence and respect and the affection of many nations in the world.</p>

<p>A United Party Government would have sent people overseas to represent us who would have made friends with the nations of the world, but this Government sent people overseas who antagonized people by their attitude. [Interjection.] I think the time has come that South Africa should realize that all of us have to make adaptations because the world of to-day is not the world of 1948. I think the people of South Africa should have sympathy with the Prime Minister. He is making adaptations. His policy, which I do not intend to discuss, his Bantustan policy, is an attempt at adaptation. It is not the policy of the Nationalist Party of Dr. Malan or of Mr. Strijdom. I often wonder if the late Dr. Malan or the late Mr. Strijdom could be revived and could return to the South African scene to see what the present Prime Minister has done to the policy of the Nationalist Party, what they would do? I think they would rush back to the cemetery as fast as they could, and jump into their graves and say: &#x201C;; Maak toe, mense, maak toe&#x201D;!, because there is not the slightest doubt that the present Prime Minister has completely abandoned the past policies of the Nationalist Party. What is more, Mr. Speaker, there are many hon. members opposite who agree with me but who have not got the courage to say it. Any hon. member on that side of the House who honours the memory of Dr. Malan must feel as I feel that the present Prime Minister has repudiated him. I was in this House when Dr. Malan said that any person who suggested that total territorial separation would be a policy in South Africa was talking nonsense; that the Nationalist Party would not follow a policy which was impracticable. It was said over and over again that a Bantustan policy was impracticable. How many members opposite will recall Mr. Strijdom standing in this House and attacking the United Party for suggesting that he wanted to follow a Bantustan policy. He said that any United Party member who suggested that that was his policy would be a liar. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was saying when I was so unjustly interrupted, that we should have a certain amount of sympathy with the hon. the Prime Minister in his attempts to adapt himself and South Africa to the realities of the present world. I wish for one, Sir, that his proposed adaptations were practicable, were acceptable to reasonable people. I genuinely wish that his adaptations could offer some hope to South Africa and the people of South Africa. But the adaptations of the Prime Minister are similar to the adaptations which a fish makes when it is pulled out of the water. It flops around, it goes into all sorts of convulsions before it perishes. I am afraid, Sir, that the present Nationalist Party Government is unfit to govern any country in the present world. After all, Sir, they were returned to power in 1948 on an undertaking to the people of South Africa that they would retain the <i>status quo</i> in this country for all time. Their propaganda in 1948 against the Smuts Government was that the Smuts Government was a Government willing to face changes, to face adaptations.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) on his speech. I have seen many comedians in my time but Jerry Lewis at his best was not as good as the hon. member. I am not the only one who thinks like this. I am not alone in thinking that the hon. member was clowning. His whole party shares my opinion. I notice that during the first half of his speech he acted like a clown. Then he tried for a while to be serious and then he reverted to being a clown. When he was being a clown, he received the most vigorous applause from his side of the House but when he became serious he did not elicit any reaction from this side or his own side. When he saw that it was of no avail trying to be serious, because his own members do not take him seriously, he once again reverted to clowning.</p>

<p>The hon. member has referred to the Orange River scheme. I am not going to discuss the Orange River scheme to-night, because I do not know anything about it. However, I think I know more about it than the hon. member for Yeoville, but even with that knowledge I do not feel entitled to discuss the matter. I hope the hon. member will now show me the courtesy of listening to me. He has said that it is scandalous that this Government has bought land from certain farmers along the Fish River for &#x00A3;150 per morgen. He has also said that the Government already knew at that time that it would cost it &#x00A3;375 per morgen to bring the water to that land. He has said that the Government had deliberately misled these people in order to buy their land at &#x00A3;150 per morgen. I now ask the hon. member for Yeoville why he has not had the moral courage, why he has not had the honesty, to say that the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services offered to sell the land of any of those farmers who had sold their land, back to them at the same price? I ask him why he has not had the courage to say that? I ask him whether he knew this? He is now trying to induce his colleagues around him to talk to him, but I do not mind.

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, then I say that I am concerned about his honesty and about his morality. He has made this false accusation. And I now challenge him to show the courage to say that he knew that the hon. the Minister had offered to sell the land back to these people at the same price.</p>

<p>Why was it a worthless offer? Allow me to tell the hon. member this: The hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) was walking around here with a cheque for R26,000 in his pocket which the Government had paid to a person whose land it had bought. That owner simply endorsed the cheque, sent it back to the hon. member for Fort Beaufort and said: Return the money to the Government so that I can get my land back. The hon. member for Yeoville knew that the land could be bought back at the same price. Why is he so dishonest as not to say that here?</p>

<p>Very well, Mr. Speaker, then I withdraw it. I now ask the hon. member for Yeoville: Did he know of the offer by the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services? [Interjections.] I ask him if he knew of it or not. He does not have the moral courage to say that he knew of it. I am not interested in whether he regards it as a worthless offer. All I am interested in is this: He has said that this Government has bought the land of those people at &#x00A3;150 per morgen, while the Government knew that it was going to spend &#x00A3;375 per morgen to bring water to that land. He then added that the Government had cheated these people in a gross and scandalous way.</p>

<p>His argument would have substance if the Government had taken such a deplorable step as to offer &#x00A3;150 for the land knowing that in the near future they were going to take water to that land which would increase its value to &#x00A3;475. I say that would have been the meanest thing the Minister could have done. But after the Minister had announced his scheme, he said: I paid you &#x00A3;150 per morgen for land which will increase <span class="col_8583-8584" refersTo="page_1538"/>in value to &#x00A3;475, &#x00A3;400 and &#x00A3;500. Those of you who think that I have treated you unfairly can buy back your land at the same price as I paid for it. And those farmers are satisfied to-day. I now ask the hon. member for Yeoville whether he knew of that offer by the Minister. If he had a grain of courage, he would say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Did he know of this offer by the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services?</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should be ashamed of himself. The hon. member says that these people are in financial difficulties. How can they be in financial difficulties if the value of their land has suddenly risen from &#x00A3;150 per morgen to more than &#x00A3;400? How can they be in financial difficulties? Any bank would advance them the money they need to buy back their land. But he is now creating the impression that the Government has misused a bunch of poor farmers who did not have water on their land. People who adopt that attitude &#x2026;Mr. Speaker, you will not allow me to say that they are immoral &#x2026; but I do not believe that they have faith in their own morality. I now make this allegation against the hon. member for Yeoville: He has depicted a false picture in this House. He was fully aware of the fact that these people could buy back their land at the same price. But for the sake of scoring a debating point, for the sake of hearing the applause of his side of the House, he does not mind creating such an incorrect impression, he does not mind creating such a completely incorrect impression in this House. I now ask the hon. member for Yeoville: Where is his morality? Mr. Speaker, he is not an incompetent person. To tell the truth, he is one of the best debaters in this House. I must say that he makes an impression on his side of the House by the type of speech he has made here to-night. What causes me regret is that a man with his ability, a man with his talents, is wasting his ability and those talents on this type of thing. I now want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville this: It is not the first time he has made this type of speech. He has been making this type of speech for the past 14 years already. He has been making them in this House; he has been making them on the platteland and he has been making them in the cities, and, Mr. Speaker, they always bring retribution. If he holds two meetings in a constituency, his party loses that constituency. He is the most useful person from the point of view of losing constituencies. He has now done something here to-night; he has now scored a point for his party. It was the most worthless, the most monstrous speech he has ever made. He thinks that he has scored a point for his party, but when these farmers along the Fish River read his speech, they will see what untruths he has told here. He has not done so deliberately, but out of simple ignorance, political ignorance. I should like to hear that hon. member when one day he has a good case to defend, if he is so brilliant when he has to defend such a poor case. If he is so brilliant when he makes such nonsensical statements, then I should like to hear him when he has to defend the Nationalist cause, for example. I just hope, however, that he will not regard this as an invitation, because if that hon. member should join the National Party, then I shall despair for the National Party. He reminds me of the goat of which Dr. Malan always spoke: Every bush it eats from, dies. The attack which he has made on the Orange River scheme to-night is due to nothing but jealousy on the part of that hon. member. He knows that this announcement of the Orange River scheme has been the greatest economic infusion which the Republic of South Africa has ever had.</p>

<p>The hon. member needs another type of injection but I shall not say what. Science has made very great progress, Mr. Speaker; they now give injections for anything. They can thin one&#x2019;s blood; they can thicken one&#x2019;s blood; they can make one happy; they can make one less happy; but they have never yet found anything to stimulate a man&#x2019;s intelligence. Any injection which that hon. member may be given will not help him; science has not yet discovered anything with which to stimulate his intelligence, because he does not have intelligence to stimulate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville thinks he knows something about the Orange River scheme. The last rural constituency he represented was along the Vaal River where there are many schemes. But he knew so little about irrigation schemes that he had to flee to Yeoville. I understand that the water in the Vaal River will be inadequate to meet the needs of those people at some stage in the future, but then they will simply have to use that water twice. Consequently if the hon. member for Yeoville drinks a glass of water there, he will not know whether it is a second time he is drinking that water. Water is becoming very scarce and when he drinks it a second time, he will have to add something. I have heard this story about drinking water twice at some time or another from the Minister of Lands.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we started this Session, we did so under a type of economic cloud. What were our economic prospects? We knew that the Government and the Prime Minister together with the Economic Planning Council were trying to remedy matters, but all at once the economic climate in South Africa changed and to-night we stand on the threshold of the greatest economic development South Africa has ever seen. That is <span class="col_8585-8586" refersTo="page_1539"/>the worst setback that Party has ever suffered. The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) should not look so depressed already; he should see what is going to happen in a year&#x2019;s time. The announcement of this Orange River Scheme, the announcement of Iscor&#x2019;s development plans, the announcement of Escom&#x2019;s development plans, the announcement of Sasol&#x2019;s development plans and the way in which the rubber manufacturers are co-operating with them in starting this R9,000,000 rubber factory, have resulted in a revival of confidence in South Africa. And what does this revival of confidence in South Africa mean? Money has accumulated in this country. It has accumulated in the building societies and everywhere else but no one wanted to spend that money. Everyone was afraid until the Government achieved this break-through with this Orange River scheme. Then the public said: &#x201C;Good gracious, if the Government has such confidence in the future of the country, if Iscor has such confidence, if Escom has such confidence, if Sasol has such confidence, then we must have confidence as well&#x201D;;. The first person to react was Harry Oppenheimer. It was not three weeks after the announcement of this scheme that he started to announce large-scale development plans, first in connection with African Explosives and then the whole Anglo-American Company. He is now travelling throughout the world and borrowing money where ever he can. He has borrowed money in America; he is now in Switzerland. Why is he borrowing that money? To invest in this country with this rotten Government; to invest it in this country where there are no economic prospects; to invest it in this country which is on the brink of an economic collapse. It is not Verwoerd who is borrowing that money; it is Harry Oppenheimer. Every big business man, Mr. Speaker, if he is not borrowing money abroad, is trying to do so locally; if he is not selling shares locally he is trying to do so abroad, for the simple reason that confidence in the country has been restored. The share market is our barometer as regards confidence in this country; it is not always a very reliable barometer, but it is a very sensitive one. If one wants to know whether the world has confidence in South Africa, then one just looks to the share market. Take the days when there was no confidence in South Africa after Sharpe-ville. What happened to the Stock Exchange? It sunk to the depths; shares fell by nearly 37 per cent in value. Since that time attempts have been made to raise the level. The market climbed a little and then climbed a little higher, but during the past six months the Stock Exchange at Johannesburg has returned to where it was before Sharpeville. I want to ask the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. Van der Byl) whether this is not so? He has many shares. He has made a lot of money out of shares. He has confidence in South Africa. Every penny which he has, he invests in shares. Not only domestic confidence but foreign confidence in South Africa has been restored. That is why these members feel so frustrated. I want to say that this has been the most disastrous session the United Party has ever experienced in its history. Before they expelled Mr. Strauss, he said quite a few years ago: &#x201C;We have now reached rock bottom&#x201D;, but he did not take the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) into account; he did not take that hon. member and her spiritual comrades-in-arms into account. The United Party has become ever smaller. The hon. member for Green Point should thank heaven that there is not an election this year. It is not the National Party which must thank heaven for that; it is they who should do so. Because, Mr. Speaker, if we were to have an election this year, they would return with even fewer members than they did last year. [Interjections.] Yes, now they have Japie. That is why they are retrogressing; that is the reason for their frustration. They are frustrated because South Africa is faring so well in the economic sphere, better than she has for many, many years past. Why are they retrogressing still further? It is because of the policy which they are trying to force on this country and what is that policy? The hon. member for Yeoville very carefully avoided it to-night. On the Vote of the Minister of Labour I wanted to cross swords with him in connection with the so-called policy of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;. In terms of that policy of theirs of &#x201C;;the rate for the job&#x201D;;all they want to do is to throw the White worker of this country onto the open market with the Bantu worker. They know that with this policy of theirs they can achieve nothing but the reduction of the average wages of the White worker. I now level this accusation at the hon. member for Yeoville: Under the policy he advocates of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; only one thing can happen, namely the wages of the White workers must be reduced.</p>

<p>You are talking nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>We shall see whether this is nonsense. Under the policy of&#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;, that&#x201C;rate&#x201D; must be fixed. If that &#x201C;; rate&#x201D; is fixed at the level of the White worker&#x2019;s wages to-day, then it is the worst fraud in the world. Because if one fixes the wages at that &#x201C;rate&#x201D;, no Bantu would get employment. The &#x201C;rate&#x201D;which is fixed, is the &#x201C;minimum rate&#x201D;. Let us assume that we have to fix the rate for a fitter and turner. It has to be fixed at a level which is lower than the present level. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) will know what I am talking about. If it is fixed at a level which is lower than it is to-day, then every employer in this country will say that the Government is now permitting him to employ everyone, White and non-White, to do the work of a fitter and turner and there are probably 100,000 fitters and turners in this country. The employer will say: The &#x201C;; rate <span class="col_8587-8588" refersTo="page_1540"/>for the job&#x201D;has been fixed; the White fitter and turner is earning &#x00A3;15 per week. He will then fix his wages at &#x00A3;10 per week. And the Bantu fitter and turner will be only too ready to work for &#x00A3;10 per week because in all his life he has never earned &#x00A3;10 per week. The employer, and particularly the unscrupulous employer, will now have this weapon to use against the White fitter and turner. He will say to his White fitter and turner: &#x201C;;You are earning &#x00A3;15 per week; I can get a Bantu fitter and turner for &#x00A3;10 per week. If you are not prepared to work for &#x00A3;12 10s. per week, then you must simply get out&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, the pace is not set by the exemplary employer, not by the good employer; the pace is set by the unscrupulous employer. The unscrupulous garment manufacturer, the unscrupulous equipment manufacturer, the unscrupulous shoe manufacturer, etc., compete on the market and they set the pace. I therefore tell the hon. member for Yeoville this: What he proposes for the White workers in South Africa is to leave them to the mercy of the unscrupulous employers and to give the unscrupulous employers this weapon of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; in terms of which the Bantu worker will work for a far lower rate than the White worker. I say it will suit them; it will suit their masters; it will suit Harry Oppenheimer; it will suit industrialists and such people. Because the hon. member knows that his policy is not acceptable to the White workers, he indulged in the tirade to-night which we have just heard.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member says that we are isolated because we have left the Commonwealth, because we have been forced out of the Commonwealth. That is why we are now isolated. If we had remained in the Commonwealth, then we would have been in good company! The hon. member receives this newsletter from the &#x201C;British Information Service&#x201D;. Has he read the one which arrived to-day? Has he read what England says of its own Commonwealth? Has he read what England says about this motion on Rhodesia now before UNO? Allow me to read this to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Quite apart from the fact that the resolution asked Britain to take measures which she has said she has not the power by herself to take, the sponsors overlooked the fact that the present Southern Rhodesian Constitution was itself derived from an allparty conference held at Salisbury in 1961 to which African political leaders, including Mr. Nkomo, who is now busy behind the Afro-Asian scenes in the United Nations, set their hand to.</block>

<p>When I read about what Britain says Nkomo is doing behind the scenes, then I think of Luthuli, Sebukwe and those people. It then continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The sponsors of the Resolution include five members of the Commonwealth&#x2014;Ghana, India, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Tanganyika, an aspect that has received comment in the Lobby of the United Nations.</block>

<p>This is the Commonwealth; these are the people whom we should allow to prescribe to us! These are the people who forced us out of the Commonwealth. It is their requirements with which we would have had to comply if we wished to remain a member of the Commonwealth. And now Mr. Macmillan says that these are the people who are acting in this way against England at UNO. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is considered strange to say the least, that despite their own intimate knowledge of Britain&#x2019;s record in producing liberal constitutions and of the perplexities of political problems surrounding not only Southern Rhodesia but also certain other territories, these five Commonwealth members should be in the van of an operation which gives the impression of being aimed at discrediting Britain&#x2019;s intention.</block>

<p>These are the people who forced us out of the Commonwealth. And these are the people to whom England says she will no longer listen. She will no longer listen to them as far as Rhodesia is concerned. And these are the people to whom the hon. member for Pinelands wants us to listen so that we can remain in the Commonwealth. This innocent hon. member for Pinelands knows&#x2014;I do not know whether the hon. member for Yeoville knows it&#x2014;the hon. member for Pinelands could not do a dishonest thing even if he tried; unlike the hon. member for Yeoville who cannot be honest even if he did try. It is said that our isolated position in the Commonwealth and our isolated position at UNO are attributable to the apartheid policy of this Government. I do not want to discuss the old story which we all know so well, namely that these attacks on South Africa did not start under this Government. They started under the Smuts Government. They started when General Smuts was one of the founders of UNO; when General Smuts was the hero, the favourite of the West. He tried to defend us at UNO and Mrs. Pandit gave him the hiding of his life. She succeeded in having her motion accepted by a tremendous majority against General Smuts&#x2019; opposition. At that time there was no question of Dr. Malan coming into power. At that time there was not even any question of our applying a so-called policy of apartheid in this country. At that time already UNO adopted resolutions against us in the face of General Smuts.</p>

<p>That hon. member cannot get anyone to go to bioscope with him. I wonder whether his wife goes with him. He must ask the Minister to go with him and I shall be very glad if the Minister <span class="col_8589-8590" refersTo="page_1541"/>will show the same good taste as his wife. Why were those hostile resolutions adopted in 1946? What did they deal with? They dealt with nothing but the treatment of Indians in South Africa. And our treatment of the Indians in South Africa is based on their colour. It is not we who treated them in that way; it was Smuts who treated them in that way. The hon. member for South Coast was very concerned about the Indians in Natal when he was an Administrator, and it was because of his treatment of the Indians that this question was raised at UNO, the treatment which he accorded them simply because they had a certain colour and were of a certain race. In his time they were pegged to certain areas; they were told that they could not buy land in certain areas. Then the Indians were told that they could not have the vote. Then the hon. member for South Coast told them that they could not have the municipal franchise. And this is what Mrs. Pandit Nehru said, and the hon. member for Turffontein can invite Mrs. Pandit to bioscope and discuss the matter with her. It was at that time that accusations against us were made at UNO. It had nothing to do with the policy of this Government. But now we have further proof that the attacks at UNO in the Republic of South Africa have nothing to do with our policy. These attacks started long before the policy of apartheid was applied. We have further proof because they are now attacking Southern Rhodesia which follows the opposite policy to that of South Africa. Hon. members opposite are now urging that we should adopt the policy of &#x201C;partnership&#x201D;, of federation, call it what you like, just as long as it is not apartheid. And I assume that the policy of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is still far more conservative than the policy of Sir Roy Welensky and the policy of Sir Edgar Whitehead. Sir Edgar Whitehead&#x2019;s policy is far more liberal; he is making far more concessions to the Black man of Southern Rhodesia than the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to make to the Bantu of the Republic of South Africa. But what has now happened at UNO? Now they are making tremendous attacks on Southern Rhodesia, and I think that to date only one person has risen to plead on Southern Rhodesia&#x2019;s behalf, namely the representative of Canada. All the other countries have spoken against her, and they are now demanding self-government for Rhodesia within a year. And what has that got to do with our policy?</p>

<p>Yes, at one time we also had the support of 20, 30 and 40 delegates. In the old days when there was a small group of Afro-Asian States at UNO, we also had 25 and 30 votes. But the votes for us have become ever fewer in number, and last year or a year or two ago England would have received the majority, an overwhelming majority, if a motion similar to that now before UNO had been proposed at that time. But now she is clearly in the minority, and that minority is going to become ever smaller. England has lost the support of all her Commonwealth Black countries and the Asian countries, all the Afro-Asian countries. The only countries still supporting her are Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and if Mr. Diefenbaker remains in power for much longer&#x2014;and thank heaven it seems as though he will not be there for much longer&#x2014;then the question is how long she will still have the support of Canada. She still has the votes of a few Western countries. We also received the votes of a few Western countries for a long time. But the process is crystal clear. What is that process? It is to expel the White man from Africa, to expel him from Kenya, to expel him from Tanganyika, to expel him from Nyasaland, to expel him from Northern Rhodesia and, it is equally clear to expel him from Southern Rhodesia. And these are the same tactics as those being used against us: The White man must be expelled from Southern Africa; if not physically, then he must in any case be made subordinate to a Black Government in the Republic of South Africa. That is the process. It is so clear to anyone who is not too blind to see and to anyone who is not too deaf to hear that this is the process. England is prepared to give Southern Rhodesia a constitution which is far more liberal than the Leader of the Opposition would dare to give our Bantu. Britain is prepared to say:&#x201C;Just give us an opportunity; this Constitution is only the start; you will be given ever-increasing rights, and eventually the principle will be &#x2018;one man, one vote There is no one in England who denies that. And the British permanent representative at UNO does not deny that eventually they are prepared to grant the principle of &#x2019; one man one vote&#x201D;; to those people. All they ask is time. But the Afro-Asian countries, with the support of Russia&#x2014;and perhaps it will not be long before it will also be with the support of America&#x2014;are saying that Britain is not going to be given time. They say: &#x201C;We do not grant you 15 years and 20 years to make friends with those people and to establish a proper Government; we demand independence for Southern Rhodesia before the end of next year.&#x201D; And then hon. members opposite say that this is due to apartheid! They say that it is due to the fact that Dr. Verwoerd is in power. Mr. Speaker, it is only malicious people who can speak in this way; only people who do not see what is happening in the world in its proper perspective; only people who are prepared to tread our country underfoot if only they can succeed in one aim, namely to destroy this Government.</p>

<p>I want to make an appeal to hon. members, because it must be clear even to them that this direction which they are following is not in the interests of South Africa. But it is quite clearly also not in the interests of their party. They are losing support every day. More and <span class="col_8591-8592" refersTo="page_1542"/>more people are saying: &#x201C;We differ from this Government; we do not think they are following the right policy for South Africa, but by heaven we tell you that we are not going to be forced out of this country. If you want to do to us what you want to do to Southern Rhodesia, then we stand solidly behind Verwoerd&#x201D;. If the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would adopt that attitude and say: &#x201C;If that is to happen, we stand solidly behind Verwoerd&#x201D;&#x2014;they need not agree with his policy&#x2014;if they would tell the world that our country is not a police State, if they would tell the world that this is not a dictatorship; that this is not a State where the Black man is oppressed merely because he is Black, but this is a well-run State which we have built up over a period of 300 years with blood and tears and in which we have achieved a position where the Coloured man and the Black man are better off in the Republic of South Africa than the Black man anywhere else in Africa&#x2014;if they would adopt that attitude, it would at least mean something; then they would not only help us to defend the name of our country, they would not only help to restore confidence in South Africa, they would not only help to create the correct impression of South Africa in the world, the true picture, the picture which they know is the truth, but what would it not mean? The hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) not so long ago wrote two brilliant letters to the <i>Cape Argus</i>. All I ask of the hon. member for Green Point, and I do so as well, is that he should co-operate in making that his party&#x2019;s official attitude, that the spirit which shone out of those letters&#x2014;we know that the hon. member is very strongly opposed to this Government&#x2014;should be the spirit of the Opposition. Then nothing can stop us. But let me conclude by telling the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) this: South Africa is on the march. Economically we have broken through the sound barrier. There is no doubt about that any longer, and we are breaking through the sound barrier as regards South Africa&#x2019;s good name, as regards our relations with the Western world. And as regards our relations with the African States, I am also quite sure that we are gradually breaking through that sound barrier as well. Mr. Speaker, I do not ask any of the hon. members opposite to support the policy of this Government. There are faults in this policy. It can be criticized. I do not say that it is the panacea, that it is perfect. Nobody is so stupid as to say such a thing. No one denies that the type of policy the Opposition advocates has its merits. But I say to the hon. member for Yeoville: Throw yourself into this struggle and stand by the side of the White man in Southern Africa. The hon. member is a capable man. Let him say: I do not want to be seen any longer in the company of a Tom Mboya or a Centlivres, or a Patrick Duncan and such people. Let the hon. member pull himself free from those people and let him stand by South Africa. And I want to link a warning to this appeal to them. We want to do these things. We would rather do them with the Opposition, but without them or with them, the National Party will do these things, and I have never had more confidence in the future of the Republic and in the future of the White man in the Republic and also in the future of the Bantu in the Republic than I have to-night.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee; has concluded his speech with an attempt to make an appeal to this side of the House to stand by South Africa. But the appeal which the hon. member for Vereeniging has made to us to stand by South Africa has a hollow sound. Because are we not the people who have stood by South Africa? Are we not the people who do not want South Africa to be cut up into various States? Are we on this side of the House not the people who want unity between the Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking peoples in this country? Are we not the people who want to give the opportunity to our young people to get to know one another and, before we can think of playing our rightful part on the Continent of Africa and in the world, do we not want to achieve that close unity between Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans? The hon. member now tells us that we should not stand with Mboya and the Centlivres&#x2019; and that type of person. Incidentally the hon. member only vilifies people like a Centlivres. What do we on this side of the House want for South Africa? In the first place we want to see that there should be peaceful co-existence between all the various racial groups in this country. But what of the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee)? When he crossed over from this side of the House to the other side of the House, what was his attitude towards the Coloureds? The hon. member for Vereeniging should know that if we want to safeguard the White man and Western civilization in South Africa, then we must retain the goodwill and the friendship of the Coloureds. And what is the hon. member for Vereeniging doing? At that time, when he sat on this side of the House, he was one of the greatest champions of the Coloureds and their rights.</p>

He has forced them back into a position of political sterility, whereas they had the opportunity to take their place on the side of Western civilization. The hon. member for Vereeniging has made himself guilty of an act which has endangered the goodwill and the friendship of the Coloureds. Now, as Dr. van Rhijn has said, we stand alone in the world, and the hon. member wants to hold the United Party responsible for that. Mr. Speaker, we are not responsible. It is the actions of this Government during the past 13, 14 years which have resulted in South Africa no longer <span class="col_8593-8594" refersTo="page_1543"/>having a friend in the world to-day. We on this side should like to see South Africa having more friends abroad. We should therefore like to see that we retain our old friends, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said to-day, our old friends of the Commonwealth, and that we take action which will bring us closer to those people. What has the hon. member for Vereeniging said in this regard? Not a word.</p>

<p>The actual point to which I want to reply is the allegation by the hon. member for Vereeniging that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M.

<p>The hon. member has alleged that the hon. member for Yeoville knew this and did not say so. But what is the position as regards those people? The hon. member knows nothing about the conditions there.

<p>If that is the case, then it is an even greater scandal that these people had to come from time to time and plead with the Government to be given more water in their areas. But what happened?

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to go so far as to say that it was also the late Mr. Strijdoms policy. In 1951 at the Colesberg Conference to which was submitted a report by the Department of Irrigation dealing with all the schemes which would have been built along the Orange River (if the United Party had had the opportunity to continue governing the country the scheme would have been built sooner.) Mr. Strijdom also adopted that attitude. But does the hon. member for Vereeniging now want to tell me this: The farmers pleaded for 14 years for water and deputation after deputation was sent to the Government. People were completely ruined. What were people who did not have a nest egg at the bank, the building society or the Post Office, and whose debts were piling up to the tune of thousands of pounds each year, to do? What would the hon. member himself have done? I would have said to the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Please, buy my farm: let us get rid of this burden so that we can at least keep something with which to make a fresh start&#x201D; I go so far as to say that these people (and the hon. member for Somerset East knows this) who were bought out, not only had debts with financial institutions and insurance companies, but they also had debts with local shopkeepers; they also had debts with their farmers&#x2019; co-operatives. What happened? The Government said: Look, we are prepared to pay you &#x00A3;150 per morgen.</p>

<p>Very well, let it be more. Let us say &#x00A3;200 per morgen. But they did not get &#x00A3;375. Does the hon. member think that these people could have refused such an offer? Of course they immediately accepted it. But now the hon. member for Vereeniging has put up his smokescreen and said: &#x201C;The hon. the Minister has now given those people an opportunity to buy their farms back.&#x201D; What with? With sand, with stones, with the shrivelled lucern stubble that stands on their lands? The hon. member for Somerset East is not so stupid. He knows that those people could not buy their farms back. They were too glad to get rid of them. Let us take the position of a farmer who had, let us say, 200 morgen there. Let us say that he was paid &#x00A3;40,000. But over and above his mortgage bonds, he had diverse debts to the tune of &#x00A3;10,000 or &#x00A3;15,000 which he had to pay off after he received the money. Does the hon. member think that that person can go to the Government again and repay his &#x00A3;40,000? I shall tell the House a story. A year or so ago Mr. Harry Sieberhagen the vice-chairman of the Fish River Valley Irrigation Board was here in Parliament (the hon. member for Somerset East knows him well). He asked me what I thought was going to happen: whether I did not think they would get water. I then told him that as I saw the position, the Government would be obliged sooner or later to make better use of the Orange Rivers water. And I told him: &#x201C;Warn your people not to sell&#x201D;</p>

<p>I have already held many meetings in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency, but he of course does not come near mine. And a large part of the member&#x2019;s constituency falls in those areas. In 1958 there was such a water shortage amongst those people that the hon. member for Somerset East also had to take the then Minister of Irrigation, the present Minister of Lands, to those areas. What did they say at that time? They said: Look, because you are now suffering from such a tremendous water shortage, we are going to help you to pump water out of the Sundays River by means of pumping installations by means of subsidies, by means of allowances. How far did they get? That <span class="col_8597-8598" refersTo="page_1545"/>is a promise which was just left at that. This was a promise which was made because the hon. member for Somerset East and the then Minister of Water Affairs realized that the had to make such a promise to the voters in those areas because the prospect had been held up to them that water would be brought to those areas, but by 1958 nothing had as yet been done. I submit that because this side of the House through the hon. member for Albany has persisted in advocating this scheme every year&#x2014;not only for the Fish River and the Sundays River valleys, but for the sake of the improved utilization in general of all the water of the Orange River,&#x2014;hon. members opposite have got into difficulties as a result of the promises they have made and cannot carry out, and the voters in those areas are now beginning to take very careful note of the genuinely South African attitude of this side of the House in pleading for the improved utilization of our natural resources in that part of the country.</p>

He asked when the Minister was persuaded to do something about the Orange-Fish River Scheme. Was he aware of the intention to bring water to this valley before he gave those people an opportunity to sell? And if he was aware of the Government&#x2019;s intention and of the fact that it was the intention to buy up those parts of the country, why did he conceal that fact? Why did he not tell those people: &#x201C;Look, I am now telling you that I do not want to place you under an obligation, but I just want to tell you that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to take the water of the Orange River to these areas.

He will not tell me that this plan was drawn up only six months ago. Of course not. The Department of Water Affairs had already been engaged on this plan for years. This was also their intention, I fully believe, but it was this Government which did not think of the possibilities of this plan.

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East should know that there are many farmers who are only making a living out of their irrigable land with perhaps a little outside grazing, but it is only the people who had less than 300 morgen whom the Government has decided to buy out. Once again it is the small farmers. The hon. member should know that a man who has a piece of land of, say, 30 to 40 morgen which he can irrigate properly, can make a living out of that land. But if he doesn&#x2019;t have water and if he only has a little outside grazing? Then such a farmer must go under. But this Government could not take the people into its confidence, because the Government knew of all these plans. Does the hon. member for Somerset East want to say they did not know of these plans. Of course they knew it was the intention to continue with the scheme. But no, these people were only given this choice: They must sell. Because they were given no guarantee. What is more, I would have done so myself if I had been in the position of those farmers and I would have sold because I could not attach any value to the words of this Government. Was it not Mr. Strijdom who told them in 1951 or 1952, when the Mentz Lake wall was raised, that he hoped that he would still have the opportunity to bring water from the Orange River to those parts of the country?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the House will agree with me that hitherto we have had a very interesting and protracted debate, and it is only a pity that at the Committee Stage so few of our friends opposite made any constructive contribution in an attempt to improve this Bill. We have had certain loose allegations, and the Minister has also expressed certain pious wishes in connection with this matter. It is for this reason that this Bill at this stage still leaves so much to be desired.</p>

<p>This side of the House has tried hard and sincerely to make suggestions by which we could achieve changes in principle which would have been to the advantage not only of the Bill but also of the people whom the Bill must eventually serve. However, we have failed in our attempts to persuade the hon. the Minister or the Government to change or to improve in its essence the Bill or the composition of the Council which it is to establish; or, as I said at the Second Reading, to remove the seeds which it contains and which, if we are not careful, will work towards its destruction; or to remove its inherent weaknesses which are already contributing to its early demise. At the Second Reading, Mr. Speaker, I also said that if the Minister failed to make certain most necessary changes or improvements, his Council would have to succumb under the weight of its own weaknesses and deficiencies, and that it would die, as I have said, before it was born. In this regard I am referring particularly to Clauses 2, 5, 7 and 8.</p>

<p>The Minister has also seen fit to ignore my representations which, I want to say in all humility, are based on scientific principles and are educationally and psychologically sound, as well as the representations of this side of the House and of the education profession. The result of his refusal to accept any of our suggestions or the proposals made by the commissions aimed at making this Council the best possible body, is that the council which he intends establishing must, I say with all due respect, be his sole and exclusive responsibility. As regards the Minister&#x2019;s guarantees, I want to say in passing, Mr. Speaker, that if we could place on record and if the promises the Minister made to us during the Second reading and the Committee Stage actually formed part of this legislation, I would have felt reassured regarding the effect of the legislation as now before us. But unfortunately speeches by Ministers do not form part of legislation. Nevertheless, as a result of what he has said, we and I think this House will call him to account if this council of his is not a success.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the council provided for in this Bill has too many defects and the Bill contains too many vague provisions to be a success. In passing I feel it is my duty once again to refer to Clause 5. The hon. the Minister has already given an indication that he will reconsider Clause 5, that he will study it and see whether he cannot meet us. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that Clause 5 (2) (a) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, after consultation with the Administrator concerned and any other Minister concerned, on the recommendation of the council, appoint a committee consisting of a member of the council and two other persons to carry out such investigation in regard to one or more particular schools as the Minister may direct.</block>

<p>In other words, the Minister can approach the Administrator and then in consultation with him, instruct that such a committee shall be appointed to investigate certain aspects of matters relating to the school. Let us assume that the Administrator does not see his way clear to giving the Minister that approval, or to giving the council that approval. Then Clause 2 (b) continues and says that he can try to obtain that approval from the Superintendent-General of Education or the Director of Education. In other words, he will now go to the official, to the employee, and this subordinate officer must then give him the approval, i.e. grant him access to the school or schools. This is a completely wrong principle. It simply cannot work. Because the official can simply not grant that approval as he will only get into trouble with his own superiors. <span class="col_8601-8602" refersTo="page_1547"/>Mr. Speaker, this council still contains in itself the seeds of division and bitterness and possible disunity and discord and although I do not want to claim for one moment that this Minister will try to create any disruption in education with his council, this body as at present constituted can still be regarded as a body which can serve as a mouthpiece of the Minister, a body which he has appointed to serve him slavishly. And it is here that, by adopting a different method for constituting his council, he could so easily have placed his council above suspicion and could have assured the education profession that this advisory council would be free of any pressure, except the pressure of its own conscience and the pressure of its own convictions. It is a pity that this clause has not been so amended that it would be possible for this council to be placed above suspicion. The constitution of this council in my opinion carries in itself the seed of division with the result that it will not be a success. It is of course my sincere hope and trust that it will be a great success from the outset. But I repeat that as far as this clause and the method of the council&#x2019;s constitution are concerned, the result can be that this body will be stillborn.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister as well as the chairman of the Select Committee have testified that it is their sincere wish, their sincere aim, merely to use this council to serve education as such. Why then, may I ask with due respect, are they allowing this council, with reference particularly to Clauses 2, 7 and 8, to suffer a setback at birth as a result of the suspicion which these provisions create. Understand me, correctly, Mr. Speaker. I am not saying that the Minister will allow party politics or his own ideological ideas to be decisive factors in appointing these members. Nevertheless I feel very strongly that by directly appointing his members, as provided in Clause 2, he is bringing himself and his council under suspicion and placing that council in a wrong light from the outset. I repeat: It is a pity that this has happened. Nevertheless at this late stage I still want to express my confidence that the hon. the Minister will find it possible in the Other Place to change the system of appointment, even if only slightly. As matters stand at present, that is to say as far as the constitution of the council is concerned, both the Minister and the council will wage an uphill struggle, and together with the results which Clauses 7 and 8 could have, the professions, the provinces and the teachers associations will find it difficult to believe that the Minister&#x2019;s body is not a body which he can abuse for his own purposes&#x2014;I for not say that he will do so; or that it is a body which, and I am now quoting from his own Bill, &#x201C;shall endeavour to uphold and promote the prestige of the teaching profession and of persons engaged therein&#x201D;; or that he is establishing a body which will merely act as an advisory body.</p>

<p>As far as the legislation in its present form is concerned, all that remains therefore under present circumstances&#x2014;this is completely in the Minister&#39;s hands&#x2014;is for him to choose the members of his council so carefully, to choose people of such outstanding quality and calibre, that notwithstanding the suspicion which has arisen as a result of Clause 2 and which is still arising, the suspicion will disappear and it will be made easier for the public to accept this council; or he must by these means and by the calibre of the persons he appoints, establish a body which will enjoy the confidence not only of this House, but also of the teaching profession as a whole and also of the country. In other words all that remains is for the hon. the Minister to keep strictly to the terms of the Bill, and do what the Bill itself says, namely, that he will only appoint people who have distinguished themselves in the field of education or are otherwise specially qualified in some aspect in the work of the council. If he does this, then I think he can achieve success.</p>

<p>He cannot do better than to appoint me, but he will have to pay! Clause 8 is a provision which together with Clauses 2 and 7 will make it extremely difficult for the Minister, and for his council as well, to meet and to satisfy a lone-felt need in the education profession. This Clause is going to cause him and his council difficulty because what do we find here? In terms of Clause 8 the Minister is allowing a council not only to prescribe to him. He as Minister cannot submit any legislation to this House before he has consulted the Education Council. The Senate cannot submit any legislation before that council has been consulted. But the Minister has a way out. He can tell the council: Go to the devil! But who are really in difficulties are the less important bodies such as the provincial councils and the provincial administrations who, of they should refuse to listen to such a council, to the advice the advisory council gives them, will simply be in real difficulties. This Government. Mr. Speaker, already has the power to interfere in provincial matters&#x2014;not the Government but the State has that power. But it is a pity that we are creating the suspicion that this House is prepared to ignore Sections 84 and 114 of the Constitution in establishing this council.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, this clause has a further weakness, namely, that the council&#x2019;s activities or functions are limited to White schools. It is a pity that Clause 8 limits its activities to White schools. I want to repeat that the well-established principle throughout the world, and the Minister knows this as well as I, is that education in its essence remains education, no matter for whom it provides, no matter with which races or persons or language groups it may deal. And in our country where we have separate institutions for the training and education of White and non-White the principle of Education remains in essence education, and the principle does not change. It is a pity that <span class="col_8603-8604" refersTo="page_1548"/>in Clause 8 the hon. the Minister for example is giving the council to a certain extent the power to bind him and that he does not want to allow the council to bind other educational bodies as well. I am sorry he has done this. This is also a great weakness which will militate against its success.</p>

<p>It is clear, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to conclude with these words, that at this stage of the Bill now before us, the Minister&#x2019;s council is not only advisory, but it is also wider in scope than merely advisory. In the second place, it is clear that the council can interfere with educational institutions in South Africa. If this should happen it will be a great pity from the point of view of the co-operation we have to-day and the object which the Minister has in mind. Once again I want to say that the future of this council, its success or failure, the future of the good name of the professional man, Jan de Klerk, more than the future of the politician, Minister de Klerk, will depend on the council he is to establish. We on this side of the House can only express the confidence that for the sake of education which we all want to serve he will appoint a council which will enjoy the goodwill and confidence of the nation as a whole. For this reason I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is definitely a proud moment to be present at the birth of a new era in our education, particularly when one sees that the child, the mother and the father are all three well. I do not want to discuss the amendment; I just want to refer to one or two provisions of the Bill to which the Opposition have studiously not referred, not at any stage, but particularly not at the Committee Stage when they had the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>The crux of this Bill, the object of this Bill, is to take education out of party politics. The Opposition have not put it in this way. This was the course I adopted during the deliberations of the Select Committee. I always kept it out of party politics. The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) helped me and helped me very well, and I appreciate all the consultations I had with him, and he knows that our main object was to take education out of the political arena.</p>

<p>One of the matters to which I devoted a great deal of attention in drawing up this legislation&#x2014;and I worked on this legislation for eight years&#x2014;is embodied in Clause 1 which will result in certain of the private schools, 25 of them, sharing in the benefits and the service which this council will be able to give to education. In this clause it is laid down that all schools which received financial assistance out of public funds, will be &#x201C;schools&#x201D; under this Bill. Prof. Bingle said in reply to a question which I put to him: &#x201C;No one would be such a vandal as to destroy the private schools.&#x201D; I would certainly be the last to do so, or to draw up legislation which was aimed at harming the private schools. The legislation also makes provision&#x2014;and the Opposition have not been eager to mention this&#x2014;that minorities can also make their voice heard in two instances, that is to say, when advice is given, the minority can also give advice. This is surely reasonable&#x2014;not two-thirds, and not a majority of one, but the minority can also submit their advice. When the council submits its report to this House and the Other Place and to the Administrators of the provinces, the minority will also be able to attach its report to the other report. That is provided for in this legislation. But I must make haste. The crux and the basis of this legislation are to be found in Clause 7 (2) which specifically provides that the council must&#x2014;there is no option but this is an instruction&#x2014;endeavour to do its work in consultation with the Department of Education. Arts and Science, the provincial education departments, education bodies and organizations and persons who are concerned with education matters&#x2014;every parent in this country has the right to derive benefit from the deliberations and the advice of this council. But what is more, the council must endeavour&#x2014;it must do so&#x2014;to consult with those organizations. They can all approach the council, and in terms of the legislation it is obliged to consult them. The Opposition did not say a word about this. The Bill obliges the Minister to consult the other Departments and the provinces if he has legislation in mind. There must be consultation at all stages. The Minister must consult. The provinces must consult. The council and the provinces must consult. The provinces must consult one another, and one of the instructions to this council, which is laid down here specifically, is that by consultation and discussion it must bring together the provinces which arc so far apart at the moment. They must meet one another and discuss their difficulties. While this legislation embodies an absolute instruction that there must be consultation, there is no instruction that there must be legislation. Legislation is a last resort, and I have always regarded it as such and I have said at all times that legislation is a last resort, the <i>ultima ratio regis</i>.</p>

<p>There is something else which the Opposition has not mentioned and which is of the utmost importance, namely, the fact that despite the <span class="col_8605-8606" refersTo="page_1549"/>suspicion which is continually being aroused against this legsislation, the legislation embodies full guarantees that no one can suffer any harm. With all this in mind, I feel that the accusations and the suspicion regarding the contents of this legislation are not justified. There are many bodies which can undertake research and it is not stated specifically here that this council must undertake research because it must co-ordinate the existing bodies and its real task is to co-ordinate. That is laid down in the legislation. Hon. members have submitted that the council will take certain powers to coordinate and that this is unnecessary. I specifically provided in this legislation that the council would not have any executive power or functions. What powers can it take unto itself? That is provided for in the Bill; it does not have such powers, nor will it have such powers. It has no executive power but while it is coordinating it must take action, and this action will be to bring about consultation between the various interested authorities. The council does not have any statutory power to legislate. The De Villiers Commission recommended that if the Minister accepts its advice it should have the force of law. I immediately rejected this. The council cannot legislate at all.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect for which this legislation also provides, namely, that although the council will be an eminent, separate and independent body, a worthy and academically free council which will not be responsible to anyone, it will not be isolated, because the Bill specifically provides that the five Departments of Education will each have direct representation on that council. There is therefore no question of isolation. Nor will it be able to work in secret and devise all sorts of undesirable plans, because the Bill specifically provides that it must lay its reports annually upon the Table of this House.</p>

<p>I conclude in the full confidence that this legislation for which I am responsible, meets the needs which have been felt for many years already, that it is a good Bill, a strong Bill, a Bill of which no one need be ashamed. The parents will now be given a greater say and will appreciate their responsibilities to a greater extent. The parents will be given a part to play in furthering the interests of their children, whereas they have tried to stand on one side. But there is one potent factor which will be given a part to play, namely, the inspectorate, and this will be a very strong force in our education. The inspectorate will help in building up a system, not a Natal system, or a Nationalist system, or a Jingo system, but an education system. Let us assume that this great task of the council will not, as the hon. member has said, remain a pious wish, but that it will become a brilliant reality. I should like to express the hope that we shall now see an end to the discord over our children. Do not let us turn our schools into battlefields. Do not let us quarrel over our children. Do not let us make our children unhappy amongst themselves. This Bill makes provision whereby people of varying beliefs will sit down together, will express only their sacred convictions and will all have the opportunity to do so when the interests of the child are at stake. I was the person who deleted the word &#x201C;White&#x201D; and the hon. member knows it. To me a child is a child, whether he be White, Coloured, Brown or Black. He did not choose his parents, his language and the soil on which he was born. We are responsible for all the children in this country, and if there is anyone who wants to place obstacles in the way of such children it will be better if a millstone is tied around his neck and he sinks to the depths of the sea. My concluding thought is that I want to see our children happy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) has just told us that this is a very proud occasion for him, a proud moment in his life. It is certainly not a proud moment in my life. Towards the end of his speech the hon. member became Biblical in his quotations. To continue in a Biblical strain, I can say that he is the John the Baptist of this Bill. He preached to us seven years ago, &#x201C;Repent, for the Kingdom of Nationalism is at hand&#x201D;. He originally flew the kite; we knew that this Bill would follow; and it has come.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank tells us that on this Council the minority will be able to give advice. The minority on the Select Committee gave advice, and the minority in this House gave advice, but how did that help? The minority on the Select Committee gave advice to such good effect that they proposed 29 amendments, but not one was accepted. What has happened during the passage of this Bill through the House is that it has revealed our differences, and not that we have been able to understand each other and come to some compromise. We know that all the great achievements of government, and all the great things of life in human relations come through compromise, through give and take, through being prepared to make sacrifices in order to reach agreement, so that instead of having continual arguments about our differences we can live happily together. We have not been able to do that. The hon. member says that all bodies will be able to appear before this Council and state their points of view. Of course they will, but to what effect? Then he says they will be able to discuss their difficulties with the Council. They will. So did we, but it did not help us very much. He says the report will be tabled annually. How will that help us? <i>Post facto</i>, after everything has happened, they will publish a report.</p>

<p>Now, at this third reading I should like to say how I view the Bill. This Bill has come to its final stage, after three years of discussion, after three sessions. It was introduced in 1960, it appeared again in 1961, and it has now passed through all stages in 1962. It even went to a Select Committee where our differences were more clearly defined than they had been previously. The final stage of this Bill gives us an Act which grants the Minister absolute <span class="col_8607-8608" refersTo="page_1550"/>powers in education. The Minister can decide how many members there will be on this Council. The Minister can decide how many of those members will belong to the executive. He can also appoint every member. The same Minister has to give his assent if the Council appoints an <i>ad hoc</i> committee. The Minister can decide the members&#x2019; remuneration. The Minister can say that if any province wishes to introduce legislation, it will have to obtain the advice of the Council through him. The Minister throughout has these absolute powers. The serious problem the Minister has now is how he will exercise these powers. I sincerely hope he will see the great dangers that confront him. This is not the first Council which has been nominated in this way by a Minister with absolute power. We see the disastrous failure of the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation, where similar powers were granted to a Minister and where the Corporation failed absolutely to obtain the confidence of the public as a whole. The Minister, in making his appointments, may find a similar difficulty. At various stages I have put this question to hon. members opposite and to witnesses who support their point of view: What is your objection to having two Councils, one for English-medium education, and one for Afrikaans-medium education? People say we are one nation, but hon. members quoted the good example we tried to follow in some respects, the Butler Act, where it said: If you wish to have two councils, have two. And the Interkerklike Komitee, in putting up their proposals in 1955, said that in addition to this Council there should be another Council for Technical Education. Under this Act of course the Minister cannot establish two Councils, but it may be necessary for him to allow this Council to function in two sections. I think that would be a very good thing. If he obtains information from the Council in regard to English-medium education, he should give attention to it and apply his mind to their views, because they are not his views. The Minister and I have both been interested in education. We have both tried to give service to education, but we disagree about the fundamentals in South Africa, and we must recognize these differences because only in that way can we live happily and progress together.</p>

<p>The Minister has told us that he himself is full of confidence. He is prepared to stake his political reputation on this Bill. An unfriendly critic would say, &#x201C;What is that worth?&#x201D;. It depends on the market in which you bet. If you stake your reputation, where do you stake it? If the Minister stakes his reputation amongs the Nationalists, he will win, but if he stakes it with the English-speaking people he will lose; and if the whole Government were to stake their reputation in the only market in the world which is a world market, UN, their bet is worth nothing. No one will back them. The Minister tells us he is prepared to stake his political reputation. I do not think that matters a great deal. It only shows his excessive confidence. But I want to say this to the Minister. He is himself certain that he can make a success of the work of this Council. He is not at all modest in accepting these great responsibilities. There is no feeling of diffidence about him. He is certain that he can make a success of it. We shall observe it very closely, but I make this final appeal to him, to show a little more generosity of spirit than he has shown during the passage of this Bill. I made one very modest appeal over a minor matter, at the second reading, which he rejected. That appeal was in regard to 25 private schools out of 65 which receives a small subsidy from the provinces. I asked him whether he would be prepared to let them be associated with the remaining 40, and he refused. Because he did that, I do not view the future of this Council with any confidence whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this last stage of the Bill, I find great pleasure in saying that I am grateful that we have reached the point where we are entering this new era in our education. The objections which hon. members opposite have put forward are in most cases unfounded, and where they have in fact been well-founded they were based on suspicion and envy in a. certain sense, but mostly on suspicion because they refuse to trust the Minister and this side of the House. This legislation has been well drafted and with the best of intentions, with the object of truly taking our education out of politics and placing it on a pedestal because the future of our people and our country depends on the education of our children. I want to welcome this leglislation wholeheartedly and I want to express the hope that it will contribute towards giving our education in future that course and direction which are essential in every country. To-day it is 50 years since the establishment of Union, and it is certainly high time the legislators of this country took steps to ensure that this one matter, the education of our children, is also given course and direction and is no longer allowed to move in any direction it likes. This legislation will contribute towards that object.</p>

<p>I do not want to discuss the constitution of the council any further. I just want to point out to hon. members that to me the crux of the matter is to be found in the constitution of the council, that is to say, there will be five representatives of the various education departments. They must bp on that council. In other words, the fact that the Minister must consult them before he can introduce any legislation shows that there will be direct liaison between the Minister and such persons who represent education in their provinces. Such a person can immediately see the matter from the point of view of his province and this will contribute towards ensuring consultation at a high level. I agree with the hon. member for Wffbank (Mr. Mostert) that any legislation which flows from such advice will only be the last resort. This will be the last resort when all other methods have failed and the Minister will not enforce legislation for any piffling reason.</p>

<p><span class="col_8609-8610" refersTo="page_1551"/>But I want to give the Opposition a further assurance. As I see matters, this legislation constitutes a safeguard for the minority group in this country and not a threat to that group. The English-speaking people are suspicious of this legislation because they believe that they will always be in the minority and can therefore be overwhelmed by the way of thinking and the beliefs of the majority group, and that we may use this legislation as an instrument to indoctrinate the children in order to force our way of thinking upon them. But I regard the legislation as providing that very protection because we provide specifically that minority reports can also be submitted to the Minister and laid upon the Table so that the Opposition will have the opportunity to see what are the views of the minority group, and can then ensure that these views are brought to the notice of the public and the outside world through the medium of the Press, so that the interests of the minority group will not be neglected. This is the clearest possible proof to me that we only mean well and that we mean no harm. Nor would we be so foolish as to interfere with the traditions, the language, the culture or the rights of the minority group.</p>

<p>I am referring to the minority group. If we should be the minority group the position would be exactly the same in our case. My argument is that we would not be so foolish as to interfere with the culture of the minority group, because if we were to do so, we know from the experience of every nation and every country in the world that that is the best way of rejuvenating such a group. The moment one interferes with the rights of such a group, it gets up on its hind legs and it fights through thick and thin.</p>

<p>I want to welcome this legislation&#x2014;and with this I want to conclude&#x2014;because to me it places the child at the centre of our education. The child once again becomes the crux, the central figure in our education, and this Bill makes it possible and envisages that anything which interferes with the right and the privilege of the child to be the central figure in our education will be removed. The future, South Africa and the Republic belong to the youth and to the child. Only the very best is good enough for the child. If the child&#x2019;s interests are at stake, everything must make way&#x2014;I say everything. The authorities, all authorities if necessary must make way. To me the child remains the central figure in education. Education is therefore for the sake of the child and not the child for the sake of education. I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>I do not share the views expressed by the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) in welcoming this Bill. The same objections that I have had from the start of this measure, not only this year but in previous years, still obtain. I want to say this in reply to the hon. member for Randfontein that I think he places far too much faith in the power of minority reports to influence the course of education in the future in this country. I am glad that at least we have that concession that reports are to be Tabled, minority reports as well as the majority reports, but I do not think that simply placing those reports on the Table of this House is going to make any difference whatever in the course that education is going to take and that it is going to provide any real protection for minority groups. We have seen over and over again in the course of the political history of this country what happens to the reports of minority groups. They are shelved and no notice is taken of the suggestions made in those minority reports. I do agree with one thing that the hon. member for Randfontein says and that is that the objections to this Bill are based on suspicion. That is perfectly true; they are based on suspicion.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because unfortunately I share those suspicions, and there are very good reasons for it. The entire history behind this Bill, the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister and by other hon. members on the Government side, have aroused the suspicions of the entire English-speaking section of this country. There has been talks of one ideal for the country, of White consciousness being taught in the schools, of our children having to be moulded in a certain pattern, and all of us know that that pattern is not the pattern of the minority groups. That pattern is the pattern of the ideologists expressed by the ruling party, and whether we like it or not, this country is not made up of one people with one culture, one background and one outlook. There are vastly different concepts and philosophies between the different groups in this country, and every public utterance that has come from the Nationalist side of the House has been designed to change that different philosophy, that different outlook and that different culture into one mould, and that is the mould and the ideals expressed by the Nationalist Party. That, Sir, is the reason why there has been this suspicion clouding all the discussions on this measure, permeating the Select Committee discussions, and, of course, it has been the reason why there have been widespread protests against this Bill and why there have been petitions signed by thousands upon thousands of anxious parents. I would have been happy to have been able to say that I believe these suspicions to be ill-founded but I cannot say that because I too share the suspicions, largely because of all these utterances by responsible members of the Nationalist Party over the last few years.</p>

<p>Sir, no significant changes are now revealed in the contents of this Bill as we see it at the third reading. There were certain changes introduced after the Select Committee as between the original Bill submitted to the Select <span class="col_8611-8612" refersTo="page_1552"/>Committee and the Bill as it finally emerged for the second reading, but no really significant changes were accepted by the hon. the Minister at the Committee Stage. The Committee reported back to this House with a few changes, admittedly, some introduced by the hon. the Minister himself and a couple of minor amendments which were suggested from the Opposition side of the House, but no really significant change has in fact emerged from all the deliberations of the Select Committee and of the Committee of this House. The same objections unfortunately therefore still obtain. A body which is meant to be an advisory body, which the Bill itself says is to have advisory functions only, is nevertheless given powers far beyond those of a normal advisory board. Perhaps if the hon. the Minister had omitted Clause 5 entirely from this Bill, perhaps if it did not still contain Clause 5, the clause which gives the powers of investigation to this council into individual schools, one&#x2019;s suspicions might have been set at rest: then one would have been able to say that this is indeed an advisory board; that is its function: that is what the Bill lays down, but as long as Clause 5 is in this Bill, as long as it contains a clause giving these wide powers of investigation to the council, one can no longer assume that its functions are going to be advisory and that its functions are to raise the standards of education in South Africa, something with which I believe everybody would have concurred&#x2014;a council to give advice for the purpose of raising the standard of education in South Africa&#x2014;but the council&#x2019;s functions go beyond that. They enable the council to investigate schools, to go into what is known as the internal of education, to go into the actual running of the school by the principal, to go into the curriculum, the method of instruction, the way in which history, religion and science are taught by the teachers in that school. There is no doubt that this Bill as it stands will, I believe interfere with the initiative of the teaching proffesion in South Africa and will attempt to could our children into one set pattern. Sir, this might be to the short-term advantage of the political party in power, but South Africa as a whole is going to lose as the result of this, because we will turn out a generation of children who are fit to associate with each other but are not fit to associate with the world as a whole, children whose whole ideas have been moulded into one pattern, whose cultures and philosophy have been taught to face in one direction and one direction only. Sir, the hon. member for Randfontein used these very phrases, that education must take one course and one direction from now on, and I say that that is exactly what we do not want. We want to bring up children with open minds, children who can absorb what the cultures of other countries have to offer, and if you could your children&#x2019;s thoughts into one direction, if you teach them that other cultures are to be rejected &#x2026;</p>

<p>To me anybody who controls the direction of education or who attempts to control what is known vaguely as the basic principles of education and the policy of education, is controlling education, and this means that diversity goes by the board, that uniformity replaces it, and as I have said earlier we may find in this country that the political party in power will gain, but South Africa as a whole will be the loser.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that I can rise and, together with my hon. friends on this side of the House, congratulate the Republic of South Africa, the entire educational world and the child of the future on this Bill which is being placed on the Statute Book. I am glad that I do not share the pessimism and the condemnation that we have had from hon. members opposite and the suspicion with which this Bill is regarded. Mr. Speaker, I am a happy man to-day and I feel very contented, because while this Bill, as I think the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said, unwittingly gives the Minister absolute powers, with which of course I do not entirely agree, everything depends&#x2014;and these were historic words which he uttered&#x2014;on how legislation is administered. That is true in fact of all legislation. There is one Act of which that cannot be said. Legislation grants powers, as it inevitably must. In the age in which we live it is completely frustrating and it is harmful to any country if one has to work with a cumbersome machine, but there is also such a thing as responsibility and there is a place where the Minister concerned can be called to account, and that is this House. I am not afraid of the future therefore. On the contrary, this is one of the happiest moments of my life.</p>

<p>But I do want to reply just briefly to the main speaker opposite in the light of his party&#x2019;s amendment, because I think he has dealt with all the points. I want to congratulate him on having given a good summary of the Opposition&#x2019;s objections to this Bill. I do not intend replying to all these objections: that would be unnecessary repetition. But as far as the contents are concerned, the hon. member has said that if the promises I have made could have formed part of this Bill, he would have been satisfied. Mr. Speaker, I am unaware of any promises that I made! All I did was to interpret the legislation. I shall be the person and my party will be the party that will have to interpret this legislation, and while suspicion and prejudice rained down on this side of the House, I simpily tried as the mouthpiece of my party to place the correct interpretation on the provisions of this Bill. The hon. member saw fit to Say that this side of the House had made no contribution or only a very small <span class="col_8613-8614" refersTo="page_1553"/>contribution at the Committee Stage towards improving this Bill. That surely is not correct. We on this side of the House do not speak with two or three voices. We have an ideal which we are striving to achieve, and we are not here to delay the proceedings unnecessarily, and where my hon. friends on this side remained quiet, they showed their tacit agreement with the interpretation that I placed on this legislation. After the explanation given by the Opposition on the Select Committee, it was crystal clear what the motive was underlying their opposition and if a naughty child refuses to listen, it is unnecessary for two people to take two canes to give that child a hiding; one man can do the job, and that unfortunately was the task of the Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member has objected particularly to Clauses 2. 5, 7 and 8. I do not want to say anything further about Clause 2 which deals with the constitution of the council. But the hon. member has said something about Clause 5 which I must correct. He has referred particularly to what he regards as a weakness in the Bill, namely, that in terms of Clause 5 (2) (a) the Minister after consultation with the Administrator may appoint a committee to institute an investigation, but if the Administrator refuses, the Minister will give instructions to a subordinate official and say: &#x201C;Although your superior has refused, you as director of education must do this or that.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, surely that is not correct. Why create this incorrect impression? What is the actual position? It is this, that the Administrator who has control over the director, can say to the director of education after he has refused: &#x201C;Look, I have refused to permit such an investigation, and I do not want you to give permission to these people to visit any of your schools.&#x201D; The director of education simply has to obey that instruction. That after all is the general legal position.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*THE <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I made it quite clear in my reply to the second reading and during the Committee Stage that these people operate under a superior authority. Take my own position. The Secretary for Education, Arts and Science normally functions in terms of the Public Service Act and he does all the things he is allowed to do. But if I as Minister say to him, &#x201C;You may not do this and I shall not allow you to do that; I do not give you the right to appoint any non-White labourers at hostels: I want to appoint all the non-White labourers&#x201D;, then the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science does not have the right to say to me: &#x201C;Sir, I want to appoint them.&#x201D; If I were to be so stupid as to say to him, &#x201C;You must come and report in my office every morning and then I shall tell you what you must do to-day&#x201D;, then he must do so. But because in the first place the Administrator must be consulted and in the second place the people who are in charge of the schools must give their consent, a terrible fuss is now being made and it is being suggested that the Minister will use a back door and tell the Administrator, &#x201C;You go to blazes; I do not care if you do not want to give your consent&#x201D;, and that the Minister will then go to the director and say: &#x201C;Here I am and I want access to your schools.&#x201D; What a childish argument! Mr. Speaker, in accordance with my promise to the hon. member I have considered this clause very carefully. I have discussed it with my Department and the law advisers and what I am now saying is what they have said but just in different words. It is not necessary at all to amend this clause in any way because the dangers which the hon. member sees in it simply do not exist.</p>

<p>Clauses 2, 7 and 8, in the hon. member&#x2019;s own words, create suspicion, and because they create suspicion, this council will be stillborn. The reasons the hon. member gives are in the first place the fact that the Minister will appoint the members; that is why the council will be stillborn. This is his main objection. I just want to tell the hon. member and the country that if I were bound and if any of my successors were bound to appoint to the council people who are nominated by all the various bodies and associations which hon. members consider should have the right to nominate persons, then this council would be stillborn; it would be a basilisk. The danger I see is that we would then have pressure groups and that persons would be nominated who have absolutely no understanding of the real object of this council, namely, to give advice at the highest level, to coordinate and to build for the future on the basis of its sound knowledge of theory and practice, and of the background and the past. [Interjection.] I know the hon. member does not agree with himself; in his heart and mind he realizes that this is correct, but it is the party political game to say that this Minister will appoint a Nationalist council. That is all it amounts to.</p>

<p>I want to issue this challenge to the hon. member and I hope he will accept it. After the council has been appointed, we may get objections perhaps. There may be people who would have liked to see a certain person on the council because in their opinion he is a good person to have on such a council, but I am afraid that we have so many good people that we will not be able to appoint all of them to the council. But I challenge the hon. member to come and tell me after the council has been appointed: &#x201C;Here you have made a very bad appointment; this man is worth nothing. In terms of which provision did you appoint him? You are bound by Clause 7 as regards the functions of the council; and you are bound by Clause 2; you are fenced in. On what grounds did you appoint this man?&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="col_8615-8616" refersTo="page_1554"/>I issue that challenge to the hon. member and I hope he will be man enough, once the council has been appointed and when we meet next year, to congratulate me on the council as I have appointed it and that he will then withdraw these remarks which are aimed at creating suspicion. With reference to Clauses 7 and 8 the hon. member says that I shall not be able to convince the teaching profession that this council is not going to be misused. He does not say that that will be the position but he says that it may be the position. But he is a prophet and his prophetic insight tells him that I shall not succeed in convincing the teaching profession. I want to tell him that the teaching profession is convinced and thankful. I have not yet received one single objection from a teacher or anyone directly connected with education. I want to tell hon. members that the teaching profession is grateful that at long last an ideal is being realized. The hon. member knows how many commissions and conferences have recommended this National Education Council since 1911. Commissions sat in 1911, 1916, 1924 (Jan Hofmeyr&#x2019;s commission), 1934, 1935, 1937, and 1939. These commissions all sat during the time of the old South African Party and the United Party. Actually the child was born at that time, but to-day the United Party is turning it into a stepchild. We have long since adopted it and we shall bring it up.</p>

<p>We shall make it plump and healthy and we are going to give the country something of which it will be proud.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) has said that Clause 8 will cause us great difficulty because in the first place the Minister himself is bound by the advice of the council before he can introduce legislation, but the Minister has such overriding powers and authority that he can tell the council, &#x201C;I am not going to heed your advice&#x201D;. But the poor provinces do not have that power and the poor provinces will have to bow and say. &#x201C;Yes, my lord&#x201D;. That is not the intention. The hon. member was in favour of such an advisory council. He was only opposed to the coordinating powers and the other powers which the council has, but he has said from the outset that they also want an advisory council.</p>

<p>Of course we do.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*THE <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Well, here I only have an advisory council. And what advice has ever carried the element of compulsion with it? If I were to say to the hon. member, &#x201C;You must remember that if you do this or that, then this or that will happen to you,&#x201D; and if the hon. member then refuses to accept my advice, then he will be sending himself over the precipice. But there is nothing of a compulsory nature contained in Clause 8. The advice will be accepted or the advice will be rejected. But I believe that the advice will be of such a high professional standard that it will be accepted. We shall bring these people together, and when we bring them together we shall have cooperation, and if we have cooperation, we shall have coordination, and once this concept has been put into practice, we shall also believe in one another&#x2019;s <i>bona fides</i>.</p>

<p>As far as this amendment is concerned, it is a summary of the Opposition&#x2019;s problem. They have created an unnecessary problem for themselves. They have created an insoluble problem for themselves. Have they ever thought what sort of Bill we would have if their 29 amendments were to be accepted? I have rewritten the Bill with their amendments, and I just want to say that I admire the willingness of the Chairmen who presided in Committee even to allow the amendments. If their amendments had been accepted, it would have been a disjointed, ineffectual, stillborn body which would never have amounted to anything.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude and I want to give the country and the educational world five key words which I think it is necessary to remember at this stage. The first key word I want to give in conclusion on this historic occasion is the word &#x201C;gratitude&#x201D;. I think it is no more than right and just that we should express our gratitude to the educationists who throughout our existence at this southern tip of Africa and particularly since 1910 when we transferred certain educational matters to the provincial authorities, and even in the old republican days, brought the standard of our education and the training of our people to its present high level under difficult and restrictive circumstances. I should like to make it quite clear so that there can be no misunderstanding that the establishment of this council does not represent a motion of no confidence in our provincial administrations. On the contrary. The work that they have done must be praised because it is of a high standard. I also want to make it quite clear that this legislation does not represent an attempt to take away the powers of the provinces. On the contrary. We need far more agents in our country to be able to do our work. One of these agents is the private school. I regard the private schools as a very good agent in many instances&#x2014;not all of them, because there are some of them which do not serve the country. When they do make their contribution, however, I say that we need them as agents. We do not intend abolishing them because they represent an important agency. My second key word in connection with this Bill is &#x201C;fulfilment&#x201D;. In other words with this Bill we are on the threshold&#x2014;I only say &#x201C;on the threshold&#x201D;&#x2014;of fulfilling an ideal for which we have longed for 40 years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Which ideal?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*THE <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member had attended the debates he would have known what that ideal is. During these 40 years people <span class="col_8617-8618" refersTo="page_1555"/>have longed for co-ordination and co-operation. They have felt that many of the things that are wrong can be put right in this way. Now however, we are on the threshold of fulfilling this ideal. But this Bill gives me a third key word, namely, &#x201C;work&#x201D;. With this Bill the life and the work of great educationists, and not the life and work of party politicians, will reach fulfilment&#x2014;great educationists who have gone before us and educationists who are alive to-day and who realize the weaknesses of our system. They have complained all these years. To-day we can place the crown on the work not of a political party, but of these men and women who over the years have complained so bitterly to us as well as to the Opposition.</p>

<p>My fourth keyword is our &#x201C;future&#x201D;. With this legislation we can go forward to meet our future cheerfully. Our young Republic, as the hon. member for Randfontein has also put it, is only a year old, but we go forward to meet the future full of courage and enterprise because we feel that we are now creating for ourselves the weapons armed with which we can cheerfully face the future. My fifth and final keyword is &#x201C;confidence&#x201D;. We can now join hands, and here I want to refer to what the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said. He said that we must realize that our English-speaking friends have an approach to many of the principles of education and training which is perhaps somewhat different to that of the Afrikaans-speaking people. I agree with him wholeheartedly that unity of approach cannot be achieved by trying to force together things which do not belong together. I want to tell the hon. member that I do not believe that this advisory council will strive to achieve arid uniformity in any aspect of education&#x2014;whether it be the religious aspect, the syllabus or any other aspect. If such an attempt were made it would be the most uneducational principle that could possibly be applied and it would therefore be a failure. As a matter of fact I do not think that it will even be necessary to remind this proposed council of that fact. In fact unity can be achieved only by accepting the differences between us. The hon. member placed great emphasis on this, and I appreciated it. The Select Committee clearly showed where we differ&#x2014;and it is a good thing that we know where we differ because then we can respect and appreciate one another in the light of those differences. But we shall not make any progress in this country by taking someone who differs from us by the scruff of the neck and forcing him to do something.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that we can now face the future equipped with this legislation which will make it possible for us to give the child only the best. Everything hinges on the child. In this way we shall achieve greater unity and greater heights, and last but not least, we shall be able better to equip the young children who are entrusted to our care to meet the challenge of the times&#x2014;to equio them better than they have been in the past for the challenges presented by this era in every field, whether it be the technological or any other field. By so doing we shall be rendering a service to the present young generation and future generations in South Africa.</p>

<p>The aim is to put it beyond any doubt that the &#x201C;association&#x201D; to which reference is made, must consist of Coloureds or Asiatics. In addition to that provision is also being made regarding the bottle-store in Athlone. Because this person acquired established rights before this Bill was introduced, I want to make it quite clear that he is exempted from the obligation to provide on-consumption facilities. He can of course do so if he wishes, but he will not be obliged to do so.</p>

<p>Although it does not apply to this clause, I should like with the permission of the Chair to make a few remarks with reference to the Bill as a whole. In the first place I want to say that it is the intention to put the Liquor Act which Parliament adopted last year and which <i>inter alia</i> affected the Coloureds in the other provinces, but mainly the Bantu, into effect on 15 August of this year. Another point relates to the price at which liquor can be sold under this Bill. I have been asked <i>inter alia</i> by the hon. member for Durban (Point), whether Coloureds will be allowed to sell liquor at prices lower than the prevailing market prices. I have already told the hon. member that that is not the object, but that everyone will be treated in the same way. Hon. members know however that it has been recommended that in the case of liquor for the Bantu a margin of 10 per cent should be allowed&#x2014;in other words that they should be allowed to charge 10 per cent less than the prevailing market prices. I have reconsidered the whole matter, however, and have decided that the same market prices will apply to White, Coloured and Bantu liquor&#x2014;in other words, to the whole trade. There will no longer be any exceptions therefore.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the amendments which are being proposed by the Minister to Clause 5 will have the effect of improving the clause. In regard to the words &#x201C;holds more than forty per cent of the issued shares in such company &#x2026;&#x201D; proposed to be inserted in sub-section (9) of the proposed Section 100<i>sex</i>, I should like to point out that I do not believe there is any provision in this Bill which prevents a nominee from holding, or from acquiring and holding, shares merely with an authority. We know that there has been a lot of abuse in the Transvaal under the Asiatic Land Tenure Act in that persons used nominees and shares which ostensibly are the property of the person concerned but which in fact were held with a blank transfer form. I suggest that the Minister ought to give further attention to this matter in so far as this Bill is concerned, otherwise persons might be able to avoid the clear intention the Minister has in mind.</p>

<p>It is required by the regulations that these people must file an affidavit to the effect that they are not nominees, but the actual holders and owners of such shares. The Act also makes provision that in cases of fraud the licence of the person concerned can immediately be cancelled.

<p>I agree with what the hon. the Minister has said. Consequently, it is clear that the position is covered so far as the original application is concerned. But is that so in respect of agreements entered into subsequently? The cancellation of a licence is of course a real safeguard and if that is the <span class="col_8621-8622" refersTo="page_1557"/>method which is going to be used to deal with this I need not take the matter any further.</p>

<p>The amendments which the Minister is now proposing, meets the weaknesses to which I referred during the second reading debate. There are, however, a few further points I should like to raise. The authorities which the Minister will grant will, naturally, be under such conditions or restrictions as he may wish to impose. The first point I should like to establish is whether the Minister intends when granting an authority, to make similar provisions in regard to the supply of food with liquor as was done in regard to Bantu authorities.</p>

<p>Since the Bill was read a Second Time, it has come to my notice that a certain Coloured man has purchased a bottle store from a European and that advertisements have appeared, or are in preparation, for the transfer of that bottle store to a Coloured area. I wonder, however, whether this Coloured man is not being placed in jeopardy by this Bill. Consequently I should like to know from the Minister whether there is going to be any interference with legitimate businesses. I do not wish to see this particular Coloured losing anything or to find out after he has had the business for a year, that he cannot keep it.</p>

<p>I understand that there already is such an authority or that it is being obtained. But is this man not, in any case, taking a chance?

<p>Any Coloured person can of course negotiate for the purchase of a bottle store liquor licence in a European area. Before he will be able to transfer that licence to a Coloured area, however, he will have to get the permission of the Department of Coloured Affairs and the authority of the State President. I cannot visualize either of the two happening. Coloured people are, therefore, warned not to be misled by people wishing to sell licences to them, especially licences at exorbitant prices.</p>

<p>On Clause 6,</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I presume that it is the intention of this clause where reference is made to &#x201C;reasonable demand by the public&#x201D; that the &#x201C;reasonable demand&#x201D; should apply to the commodity itself namely malt liquor and not to three brands of malt liquor. In other words, Sir. I presume it is intended that licensees must keep three brands of malt liquor if there is a reasonable demand for malt liquor, not if there is a reasonable demand for three brands of malt liquor. I do hot think that is altogether clear. I understand that that was not the impression which certain people had had.</p>

<p>Secondly, will the hon. the Minister give the Committee some idea as to how many new manufacturers there are likely to be in the line of malt liquor. I understand there are only two at the moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am not entirely happy about the Drovnions of this clause but I do not intend moving an amendment in view of the discussion at the second reading. I feel it is not <span class="col_8623-8624" refersTo="page_1558"/>sound policy to pass a measure now demanding that something be done which it is not possible to do, in other words, laying down that there shall be beer from at least three different brewers when there are not three brewers in existence. But as the Minister says there is another one coming into the field shortly and a forth contemplated in the foreseeable future. What I would like to ask the hon. the Minister in regard to this is that if he is adamant that there should be three, whether he would consider delaying the application, the coming into effect of this clause. In terms of Clause 14 he is entitled to proclaim different dates for different clauses. I want to ask the Minister to postpone the coming into force of this clause until these two additional breweries are operating and their goods are on the market. Because unless he does that he is creating an artificial market for the existing two breweries and the first one to come into the field. Whether a person likes it or not he is going to be forced to buy their beer. It does place those breweries in a position of being able to dictate to hoteliers. They can be as difficult as they like; they can demand any conditions that they like; they can say &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got to come and fetch it&#x201D;; they can demand cash in advance or cash with order; they can impose whatever conditions they like to impose. They will have a stranglehold over the licences because, in terms of this Bill, they must accept whatever conditions may be imposed by the brewers. If the Minister will postpone the coming into force of this clause until there is a choice, until there is at least one more brewer than the number laid down, namely three, in other words, until the two brewers have come into the field, then at least there is a choice and free competition. You will not get the position where any one of the brewers can lay down conditions and regulations which he can force on to every licensee.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, the person would have the money to pay. Assume I am a brewer and I say to a licensee: &#x201C;You must pay cash on order and I will deliver the goods in two weeks&#x2019; time because I have not got it in stock at the moment&#x201D;, then I will have the use of that money for that period, interest free. All sorts of personalities are always involved in business. A licensee clashes with a supplier over something that may have happened in the past. Although that may be the position, in terms of this Bill, every licensee is forced to deal with each of the three brewers who will be available. I do think it is an unreasonable situation where in private enterprise you are forcing a person to purchase from a particular source. It goes against the whole principle of private enterprise.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*THE <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is a principle accepted by Parliament.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it has been accepted in regard to wines and spirits where there is a choice. A minimum is laid down but there is still a choice because the number of brands which must be stocked is less than the number of suppliers. Therefore there is a choice to every licensee. He can buy from the person whom he wishes to buy. Under this clause in regard to beer no option is given whatsoever. There is no choice given to the licensee. It is creating an artificial market for the existing two and the first one to come into the field. I think the hon. the Minister must agree, even though he may not accept it in this measure, that that is not a sound principle, that it is not sound policy to give no choice. I accept the fact that you must offer a choice to break any monopolistic tendencies which there may be. But I do feel that that choice should be reasonable. The word &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; appears in the definition, but although it appears in the definition I do not think we are being reasonable in the condition we apply as legislators.</p>

<p>The other point I wanted to raise here, Mr. Chairman, was also in regard to the question of reasonableness raised by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell): The clause reads &#x201C;In reasonable quantities and at reasonable prices&#x201D;. Now that is a very broad definition. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to confirm that if any brand of beer is uncompetitive by more than a cent or two, that that would not be regarded as a reasonable price. Because again where there is no option given, where there is no choice given to the licensee, any brewer can change the price knowing that he has a forced market at least for the initial order. It gives him an opportunity, for a short term admittedly, of making additional profit. The purchaser has no option but to pay that higher price. I would like the Minister to confirm that where reasonable prices apply to the retailer they will also apply to the brewers who supply the beer in the first place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>There is one other aspect of this clause with which I should like to deal very briefly and that is the ability of licensees in various provinces to obtain the product of a brewery in another province. At the moment the licensees in Natal buy exclusively from the Lion/Castle combine for the reason that that is a brewery in Natal. It is therefore a financial proposition to them to <span class="col_8625-8626" refersTo="page_1559"/>buy from them. The Stag beer is brewed by the Old Dutch brewery which is situated in the Transvaal. You do not get Stag beer in Natal because of the high cost of railing it down to Natal. I do not know where these new breweries will be but it does seem to me that it would be unreasonable for a licensee in Natal or in the Cape to have to buy and stock the products of a brewery which only operated in, say, the Transvaal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>If the brewery does not operate in Natal, the licensees do not fall under this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>They can get it by rail. I do not agree, Sir. I think they can fall within the ambit of this clause. When we come to Clause 14 I will move an amendment in this respect.</p>

<p>The position which arises when breweries operate only in one province, is that you not only give an unfair advantage to the particular brewer but you also place the consumer and the licensee in a very unfair position as well. So far as this is intended to be a protection to brewers other than the Lion/Castle combine&#x2014;I think it is an excellent principle that a monopoly in this field should be broken&#x2014;I think it gives an unfair advantage to the brewer in another province. Because under this clause he will be able to market his product in, say, Natal or the Cape whereas if he were in proper competition with the Lion/Castle combine he would not have been able to do it. When we come to Clause 14 I will move the amendment which I have referred to.</p>

It does seem reasonable that the hours of restaurants should in appropriate cases be the same as those of hotels.

<p>The whole Liquor Bill will be before the House. It will be a non-party measure. Each member will, of course, have the opportunity of putting forward his point of view. Nobody will be caucus-bound in regard to that Bill, as I have already stated at the Second Reading.</p>

<p>With regard to the question raised by both the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) and by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), it is true that we have only two beer firms, if I may put it that way, the Lion/Castle firm, and then there is the Old Dutch firm. It is also true as the hon. member has pointed out, that Old Dutch has never sold anywhere except in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. I believe they do not sell in the Cape and they do not sell in Natal. If they do not sell there then, naturally the licensee need not stock that beer because that will be a circumstance beyond his control. Anyway, there seems to be substance in some of the points raised by hon. members. I will consider this matter and have a discussion with hon. members afterwards, and if necessary, if there is substance in their argument, I am prepared to move an amendment in the Senate, although I am making no promise. I have already said there are two beer-brewing firms. Apart from the two, there is a third one which I am informed has already been granted a licence. So in fact it will be five firms, and if that is the position a great deal of the argument of the hon. member for Durban-Point falls away.</p>

<p>On Clause 9,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I think this is an improvement on the previous arrangement, whereby now a person, instead of being subject to police control and his licence being in jeopardy if he should offend against the provision in regard to compulsory stocking, it merely becomes a simple offence unless he can prove his innocence. But there is one objection to this, and that is that it has been made an offence in the highest category of fines. The fine for this offence is R1,000, whereas when a person commits an offence against an authority the maximum fine is R400. So where an authority is granted for selling liquor to Bantu, Coloureds or Asiatics, any person committing an offence against the provisions of that authority can be fined a maximum of R400, whereas a normal licensee who is found guilty of having only two kinds of beer can be fined R1,000. I would like to ask the Minister <span class="col_8627-8628" refersTo="page_1560"/>whether he has considered that, or is it just a simple way of putting it?</p>

<p>When the House adjourned, I was pointing out that the remark by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) that these people in the Fish River Valley had been given the opportunity to buy back their land from the Government was only a hollow invitation to them, as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has also said, because those people to-day, as a result of the gradual deterioration of their economic position, are simply no longer able to buy that land back. If there are farmers here and there who wants to buy that land, I believe that they would only be people who have come from elsewhere, who are already big farmers, and who want to buy a piece of land so as to be able to build up their own fodder banks. But I do not think that many of the people who live there can buy back their land.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I have here a large number of cuttings from the <i>Burger</i> and the <i>Oosterlig</i> of the past year or two setting out, the gradual deterioration of the position of these people. I just want to quote what Mr. L. Vosloo, the chairman of the Afrikaanse Sake-kamer of Cradock, said. He considered that the scheme to buy out the farmers which would result in nearly 200 families leaving the Cradock district, would not represent a serious setback to the town&#x2019;s commercial life, because as a result of the prolonged droughts those people have had no purchasing power in recent years. I think the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) knows this Mr. Vosloo. I feel therefore that we have made out a good case to show that the Government cannot believe that these people will be able to buy back their land because they are not able to do so.</p>

<p>In the second place we have made out a case to show that the Minister of Water Affairs has changed his policy. But there is a very important matter which I want to raise here. I refer to something which has appeared in the Press in recent days. There has been a telegram from Mr. Robey Leibbrandt to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). It is not my duty to defend the hon. member for Houghton. I think she can do so better than I, but what I want to emphasize are the important implications of this telegram. May I read out the telegram&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mordegai alias Karl Marx. The father and the creator of modern Communism was an accursed Jew.</block>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will also say that this is a scandalous statement by Robey Leibbrandt. Who is Robey Leibbrandt? What does he tell us? He says he is cooperating with the Minister of Justice and his Security Branch. According to the <i>Cape Times</i> of yesterday he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of course we work hand in hand with the Security Branch and we will continue to do so.</block>

<p>Then he made the following significant remarks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Leibbrandt said that for Mrs. Suzman&#x2019;s information he knew more about Communism in this country than even the Security Branch.</block>

<p>On the 5th May in reply to a question, the Minister told us in this House, that they were prepared to accept all the assistance which outsiders <span class="col_8629-8630" refersTo="page_1561"/>could give them in combating Communism. But he did not want to comment on this matter because it was not in the public interest to do so and he said this with reference to Leibbrandt. But now it is Mr. Robey Leibbrandt who is speaking. Does the Minister not think that the time has come for him to repudiate Mr. Robey Leibbrandt and his O.A.S. organization? This is the worst form of anti-Semitism we have had in South Africa since the last war. I repeat that the implication of this telegram is that no Jew in South Africa can feel safe in expressing his political convictions. Hitherto the Jews have never associated themselves with any particular political party. They have voted as they liked, whether it be for the Nationalist Party, the United Party or the Progressive Party. But the implication of this telegram is that all our Jewish families must be careful because they are suspected of communistic activities. It is the duty of the Minister of Justice to rise and repudiate this telegram and to repudiate Mr. Leibbrandt and his organization. Mr. Leibbrandt says that this organization of his is very strong. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our job is not to create chaos but to prevent it.</block>

<p>And he says he has 1,000 men and they are giving the Minister&#x2019;s Security Branch information. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Heilbron should know that one can get no stronger force than 1,000 people carrying stories to the Security Branch. But what else is at stake? What is at stake is the good name of the Security Branch. We acknowledge at once that the Security Branch of the Police are doing a very important job. They have to preserve the security of the State. We fully believe that it is essential that they should have people to provide them with information. But when the Security Branch obtains information from another secret organization which founds its political opinions on a racial basis in South Africa, then I believe that the good name of the Security Branch is also at stake. The hon. the Minister of Justice must tell us that this telegram sent by Mr. Leibbrandt does not meet with his approval and that the Security Branch will no longer have anything to do with an organization such as this.</p>

The hon. member for Houghton has always been quite capable of looking after her own affairs and championing her own cause in this House, but what surprises me is that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) felt called upon to put forward the case of the hon. member for Houghton in this House.</p>

<p>No, but at that time I was not editor of the United Party Newsletter either. What reasons did the hon. member for Yeoville give as to why they could not take action against Communists? They have told us that they are the people who can take such firm action against Communism. What did he say in this newsletter? They had already begun to notice in 1947 that there were communist dangers, because the heading to the newsletter was &#x201C;Communist Dangers&#x201D;. They pointed out how in recent times communist dangers had made themselves evident. The newsletter was published in the first place because the then Government had information that there was large-scale communist activity in South Africa and in the second place because the ordinary members of the United Party wanted action to be taken against Communism. That is why the ordinary members of the United Party are so grateful that I have now taken such action. But I leave it at that. Let me quote from this newsletter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is perhaps necessary that we should point out that the Government of the Union is not closing its eyes to the activities of the Communist Party.</block>

<p>The Government to which he refers is the late Government which was still in power in South Africa in 1947&#x2014;</p>

<p>As I have said I did not want to take part in this debate. I am tired and I did not want to undertake this as well. But the hon. member has forced me to take part in the debate.

I also want to read what the hon. member for Yeoville wrote in 1947 and I might just add that he also played the part of a prophet on that occasion. He wrote this&#x2014;</p>

<p>The position is that I am sometimes wrong, but the hon. member is always wrong. The hon. member wrote about the attitude of the United Party and the actions they had taken against Communism. That was in 1947. We were told the other day that they were the people who had done such a great deal to fight Communism. The hon. member said this on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is perhaps necessary to point out that the Government of the Union does not close one eye to the activities of the Communists.</block>

<p>That was in 1947 when the United Party was in power, and I agree with the hon. member that they did not close one eye, they closed both eyes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nor does it underestimate the danger which these people constitute to the country, Unfortunately the communist party occupies a unique position in South Africa because it is shielding behind the skirt of Havenga&#x2019;s Ossewabrandwag, the Broeder-bond and the Nationalist Party.</block>

<p>That was what the hon. member wrote in 1947&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The leaders of the communist party know very well that the Government of South Africa have to deal with organizations and political parties which pretend to be cultural societies and official opposition parties&#x2026;</block>

<p>They regarded the communists as a cultural society&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026;but which in reality were aiming at a revolution and that it was very difficult for the Government to take action against any one of these groups unless it was also prepared to take similar action against the others.</block>

<p>Do you see the philosophy of hon. members. Sir? In 1947 they washed their hands of the communist party. Let us forget about the Ossewa Brandwag and the Broederbond, but in 1947 the hon. member, as propagandist of the United Party, washed his hands of the communist party and said that he could not take action against them otherwise he would also have to take action against the National Party.</p>

<p>No, we are only anti-United Party. We have the same story at the end of every sitting. On this occasion they have used the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) to try to raise a boy, and that is why I am taking part in this debate, because the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) has once again gone out of his way to hang the anti-Jewish label round the neck of the National Party and the Government. I want to tell the hon. member that he will not succeed in doing that. I want to state it very clearly that just as little as this Government is anti-British, just as little as it is anti-Bantu, and just as little as it is anti-Coloured, just as little is it anti-Jewish. I say that in a full realization of my responsibility and in spite of the provocation we have sometimes had from quarters where we have not deserved it.</p>

<p>I want to repeat what I said by way of a question to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), that as far as the Security Division is concerned, I do not intend either to-day or in the future to say from whom we get assistance, or to deny or to admit it where people allege that they have assisted us. That is a matter which I will not discuss in this House, not to-day nor in future. Hon. members must please accept it just like that. What has happened to have made the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) commit this blunder of trying to hang this anti-Jewish label round our necks? The only thing that happened was that the hon. member for Houghton made a very sharp attack on a Mr. Leibbrandt. I hold no brief for him, I have never done so nor do I wish to do so. However, the hon. member for Houghton directed certain sharp words at him and he apparently in a fit of anger reacted to that in a private telegram. That is a private fight between that hon. member and him and I do not want to interfere. What did he say and this is really where I want to blame the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West). The attack made by Mr. Leibbrandt was on Karl Marx, not on the Jewish community. No, the attack which he made was on Karl Marx. I am surprised that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth is so sensitive that he reacts in this House when anybody says anything about Karl Marx. It surprises me, Mr. Speaker. I wish to repeat that, in spite of provocation, I have stated my attitude clearly. I just want to repeat that, as far as the Government is concerned, and as far as I particularly am concerned. I who am responsible for law and Order. will carry out the law in all circumstances where one group, in contravention of the provisions of existing laws, incites racial feelings between races and who harms those groups in that way. That is how I regard my duty and that is how I will carry out my duty. However, hon. members must not cry and complain, when they look for trouble themselves, and then have personal experiences which have nothing whatsoever to do with the law and the contravention of the law. Above all, I want to say this to the Opposition: If you are looking for a victim by trying to hang an anti-Jewish label round the neck of the National Party, you are making a very big mistake.</p>

But on the other hand, if hon. members expect me to conduct a witch hunt where the law has not been contravened, they are expecting too much from me.</p>

<p>I have stated my attitude very clearly. In the National Party, as a matter of fact in all parties, there are people who subscribe to all sorts of beliefs and of all sorts of races. As far as I am concerned that is how I see South Africa. Particularly in view of this new era which we have just embarked upon, I do not see South Africa as a country in which the population consists of this or that race. I see South Africa as consisting mainly of two groups. The one group is the conservative group, the group which consists of Afrikaans-speaking, English-speaking, Jewish-speaking, Greek-speaking and so forth, people who are conservative and who wish to save and bring stability to White civilization here. On the other hand I see the liberal section who does not want that, the section who tries to destroy those things in which we believe. The tragedy is that in between those two groups, the extremely liberal group and the conservative group, you find the United Party, not knowing whither he must or whither he wants to.</p>

And do you know, Mr. Speaker, a political party can exist if people get annoyed with it; a political party can exist when people swear at it; a political party can continue to exist when people are cross with it; but a political party can never exist when people lose their respect for it. In that case it simply cannot continue to exist. [Interjections.] I want to say this to the hon. member for Yeoville. I should like to see him for many more years in the Opposition benches, but if the hon. member is not careful, those extremely liberal elements will take their seat in this Parliament, and the day that eventually happens will be an evil day for South Africa.

<p>The Minister of Justice has chosen to throw the blame for Robey Leib-brandt&#x2019;s telegram and anything which may eventuate from that on the shoulders of the Opposition.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister had the opportunity of repudiating it. Instead of that he accuses the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) of saying things in this House that can incite bad feelings between racial groups. He did not attempt to accept the fact that telegrams of this sort are definite proof of that very activity on the part of Robey Leibbrandt. That is the position, Sir. There we have definite proof of a man doing his utmost to create bad feelings between the races in South Africa. The Minister does not repudiate that but he makes an attack on the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) for <span class="col_8641-8642" refersTo="page_1567"/>drawing it to his attention. That is not what we expect from a Minister of Justice. It is not what we expect from a Minister who claims that he is determined and sincere in his fight against this sort of racial prejudice in South Africa. With all the powers which this Minister has taken unto himself in recent legislation, what are we to think if, when he gets a first class example of the type of thing that can do us so much harm in South Africa, he refuses to accept responsibility on behalf of the Government and to repudiate this sort of thing. What are we to think? I say, Mr. Speaker, this incessant argument of the Minister&#x2019;s that he and his Government are determined to fight against Communism, makes me think that they are prepared to fight against Communism with legislation only; with words and not deeds. When this side of the House were called upon and did produce the deeds when we had to fight against Nazism, you can depend upon it, Sir, that we will present the necessary deeds if and when we have to fight against Communism. It will not be words only. I do hope that the Minister will understand that with the almost 40 minutes he took to defend Robey Leibbrandt, he has in effect also been defending Communism. That is the position. Because there can be no difference between a communist who says things like that and Robey Leibbrandt who put those words into a telegram. I hope, Sir, that the Minister will understand that we do not appreciate the manner in which he has intervened in this debate.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I am also glad that the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) is in the House. Last evening he attempted to bring me in forward as a witness in what he was saying about the application of the Industrial Conciliation Act in South African labour matters. I want to make it quite clear, Mr. Speaker, that job reservation has done less to protect White workers in South Africa than any other legislative measure brought in by this Government. I want to remind that hop. member that when we as an Opposition say that we are in favour of the policy of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;&#x2014;I want to make this point quite clearly&#x2014;there is greater protection for the thousands and thousands of White workers on the basis of the rate for the job than there is in the policy of the Government of job reservation. I want to illustrate that point, and in doing so I want to ask the Deputy Minister of Labour whether he will give us the comparative figures, if he enters this debate, of how many White workers in South Africa have been protected as a result of the application of job reservation as against the considerable numbers of White workers that are and will in future obtain complete protection by the application of the rate for the job.</p>

<p>Complete?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Complete. The only thing that will interfere with that complete protection are the actions of this Government, firstly, by interfering with the trade union movement in the machinery which they have set up for the protection of all of their members. I am now referring to the splitting up of the trade unions which made it possible for racial groups to undermine the living standards of the Whites. That has happened and the hon. the Deputy Minister knows of it. Particularly in Natal in the furniture industry where, because negotiations were able to take place between the Asiatic employers and Asiatic employees, a wage rate was determined which was less than that applied by the European trade union in negotiating with their European employers. The result is that to-day the furniture industry in Natal is almost completely run by Asiatics. The Whites have been eliminated. This Minister must know that to try to apply job reservation under those conditions is almost impossible, because he has to face this position that if he were to reserve a certain number of occupations in the furniture industry for Whites, those Whites would have to work at the rate laid down in the determination for that industry, which will be a lower rate than that applicable to the Europeans. I hope, therefore, that the Deputy Minister of Labour has no intention of amending the Industrial Conciliation Act in respect of Clause 25 where proviso (ii) reads &#x201C;provided that no differentiation of discrimination on a basis of race or colour shall be made&#x201D;. That is the rate for the job and that is the policy which is being pursued to-day in respect of every industrial conciliation determination that is made. It is the rate for the job which is controlling labour wages in South Africa to-day. Job reservation deals with work.</p>

<p>While I am on this point, Sir, what is happening in South Africa that is endangering the White standard? It is that work is being taken away from the areas under the jurisdiction of industrial council agreements, and being placed in the areas which fall outside that umbrella.</p>

</speech>

<p>Who fixes the rate?</p>

</speech> <speech by="#eaton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>The rate is fixed as far as industrial council agreements are concerned, by employers and employees. It has nothing to do with the Government. But the rate as far as the border industries are concerned, is fixed by the Government. The employees do not come into it. The result is this&#x2014;I raised this matter under the Labour Vote&#x2014;that the garment working industry, particularly in Durban is facing the fiercest competition from the border industries, particularly at Hammersdale, because the wages which are paid to the Bantu workers there are lower than those being paid in Durban to the White, Indian and Coloured garment workers. There is no point in introducing job reservation if the Government&#x2019;s actions take the jobs away. That is the issue we are facing, not only in respect of the garment workers industry but we also have it in the motor industry. There the same sort of difficulty is arising. I hope the hon. member for Vereeniging will go into the question of labour legislation a bit more carefully before <span class="col_8643-8644" refersTo="page_1568"/>he rises in the House and condemns the rate for the job which is the basic principle governing all our wage determinations to-day. That is the principle.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>If it is the most dangerous thing to the White workers, this Government has done nothing to amend it. It is still the basic principle. The trade unions have accepted it and employers have accepted it. I do hope that the Deputy Minister, if he takes part in this debate, will make it quite clear that he has no intention of interfering with that basic principle in our labour legislation. [Interjections.] Well, they seem to think that job reservation is going to answer the whole problem. But immediately you have a differentiation of wages for the same work, then you are in difficulties. And that is what this Government is doing by encouraging border industries. That in turn is undermining the whole of the European position in South Africa. Had it been possible it would have been interesting to get the views of the former member for Germiston, Mr. Du Pisanie, in this regard. He has first-hand knowledge of what is happening as far as the garment workers&#x2019; industry is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to move over to the second leg of the amendment moved by my leader. What has gone before in this debate has indicated quite clearly that the Government&#x2019;s responsibility in regard to what I call the lower-income group and the middle-income group, is a very grave one indeed. I am glad that the hon. the Minister for Social Welfare and Pensions is here this afternoon, because I intend to deal in part with the report of the committee of inquiry into family allowances. It does have a considerable bearing on what we are attempting to bring to the attention of this Government in respect of those who are not by any means finding it easy to make ends meet in this country to-day.</p>

<p>To give the correct perspective and background in respect of those for whom we are attempting to elicit some sort of support, some sort of interest on the part of the Government, I have gone to the trouble of extracting some figures so that members on the opposite side will not be encouraged to quote at us the savings of the people by way of Post Office deposits. That is not the answer to the problem which I want to present to the House this afternoon. I will just give the figures so that the House will get an idea of the type of citizen for whom we are particularly pleading in the second leg of our amendment. Firstly, the unemployed workers in terms of the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics for May, 1962&#x2014;I am only dealing with Europeans at this stage&#x2014;were 16,139. Old age pensioners, according to the latest report of the Department of Social Welfare, 86,869: war veterans, 29,393; disability grants 10,590; blind pensioners 1,122: maintenance grants 6,834 and war pensioners 24,323; making a total of 175,310 people. On top of that family allowances are being paid to 265 families. On top of that we have Public Service pensions being paid to 12,044 persons, and railway pensions to 15,278. That is a group which by no stretch of imagination, can be described as wealthy South Africans. These are Europeans who are having the greatest difficulty in making ends meet to-day. If you add the other two this number of 175,310 will be almost 200,000, and the vast majority of them find it extremely difficult to make ends meet to-day. Anyone who represents a constituency such as mine, will have the necessary evidence to support what I am saying here this afternoon. That is as far as Europeans are concerned. Because of the very low income which this group receive we have to include in these thousands which I have mentioned the vast majority of our Bantu, the vast majority of the Indians and the vast majority of the Coloureds. There you have the group Sir, to whom we refer in the second leg of our amendment. If an examination is made of the survey of family expenditure&#x2014;it was prepared in November 1955&#x2014;you will find that 54.4 per cent of all European families&#x2019; income is under &#x00A3;1,200 i.e. R2,400; in the case of 9.86 per cent of all European families their income is under &#x00A3;750, i.e. R1,500. So that we have this position, Sir, that there is a considerable number of South African citizens who are up against it to-day in no uncertain way.</p>

<p>I have given the background so that there will be no misunderstanding as to the people we have in mind in the second leg of our amendment. I now want to come to the report to which I have referred earlier on. I want to ask the Government and the Minister responsible for this Vote, what he intends doing about this very, very, distressing report of the committee of inquiry into family allowances. It is distressing because of the evidence which it gives to this House. I want to start off by quoting what it says&#x2014;and here I am supporting what my hon. Leader has said in connection with the agricultural section of the amendment. On page 81 it deals with the distribution and marketing of vegetables, fruit and other foodstuffs. Paragraph 314 says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wide gap between producer and consumer prices: In the United States of America it is estimated that the producer receives on the average a little more than 33 per cent of each dollar spent by the consumer on fruit and vegetables. In South Africa the producer receives about the same percentage on each rand spent by the consumer.</block>

<p>So we have this position that in South Africa the consumer is paying 10s. for what the producer receives 33c.</p>

<p>The same as in America.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I assume that the interjection <span class="col_8645-8646" refersTo="page_1569"/>means that the hon. member condemns both as being bad or does he approve of it? According to this report the United Party Government appointed a distribution costs commission and the report says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is evident that the machinery of distribution in the Union as in other parts of the word, are subject to many imperfections. The root causes of all these are not easy to diagnose nor a cure easy to prescribe. Moreover, because of its dynamic character, it is constantly presenting new problems or old problems in a new light. It follows that if greater efficiency and a gradual lowering of the cost is to be obtained the field of distribution should be subject, not to spasmodic but to continual survey and investigation.</block>

<p>And I ask what has the Government done since 1948 to keep this position in mind? From the reports we received yesterday it is quite clear that no one can be happy about this tremendous gap between what the consumer has to pay and what the producer receives. The other aspect which is tied up with this problem and one which I think the whole House should be most concerned about is malnutrition.</p>

<p>Paragraph 316 says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Probably a large proportion of the children in South Africa are malnourished because of an inadequate supply of the protective and protein foods&#x2014;milk and its derivatives, eggs, fruit, vegetables and meat. As a consequence, a population is being produced which is physically unfit. This physical unfitness means greater susceptibility to disease, as indicated by the rapidly increasing demand in South Africa for hospitalization, mental deterioration and, as the result of both the physical and the mental unfitness, diminished citizenship value.</block>

<p>This is not the United Party speaking, but a Commission appointed by the Government to go into the question of family allowances, and this is their report, and I think that the Minister should give some indication of what steps will be taken, belatedly, to deal with this problem because it affects the whole of our future. The Minister of Labour left today to go to try to get immigrants to come here, and yet we are not taking the necessary steps to protect the citizens we have, and it is not because we have not the means. The picture I get from this report is of mountains of surplus foodstuffs of the very type mentioned here being wasted, whilst thousands of malnourished South Africans are prevented from getting that food by the policies of this Government. I ask what the Government is doing about it. On the one hand we have these surpluses of essential foodstuffs and on the other hand those hungry mouths trying to get to them, and the Government is talking about fighting Communism with legislation. Here we have the means for fighting Communism. These protective foods given to these hungry people will make it impossible for Communism to thrive.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>What I mean is that the availability of this food and this huge consumer market which is being neglected is the crux of the matter. Instead of giving them that food, we are spending millions on building hospitals, as reported in paragraph 317&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would surely be logical to subsidize staple foods for our lower income groups rather than to spend vast sums in an attempt to cope with disease resulting from nutritional deficiencies.</block>

<p>Yet we continue to spend money on hospitals when we have a surplus of the necessary foods. [Interjections.] I also want to quote paragraph 318&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surveys and an accumulation of clinical evidence leave no doubt as to the seriousness of malnutrition. It is due to the shortage and relatively high cost of the protective foods. The bulk of the poorer sections of the population subsist largely on cereal-starch with a shortage of proteins, minerals and vitamins.</block>

<p>I do not believe even 10 per cent of members opposite have read this report, but I have read it and it will be worth while if only we get some reaction from the Government. They give the reasons why our hospitals are like they are. I have already indicated that there are 10,000,000 lbs. of butter and hundreds of thousands of eggs which are surplus, and oranges and bananas are being destroyed, all foods which can do so much towards building up the South Africa which will be capable of fighting Communism in the real way. But what is the Government doing to meet this problem? Paragraph 319 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problem facing the country is that of supplying these people, and particularly their children, with adequate amounts of protective foods, viz. dairy products, eggs, meat, vegetables and fruit.</block>

<p>Those are the things we have surpluses of, but we cannot get them to the people who need them. Paragraph 320 states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">State subsidy must be so applied that it not only induces the farmer to produce more of the necessary foodstuffs, but that these foodstuffs are also freely bought by the local consumer. The consumer must receive the benefit of the subsidy so that householders can buy cheap protective foods.</block>

<p><span class="col_8647-8648" refersTo="page_1570"/>What comment have we on that? We have had very little reaction from the Government on this report, to indicate whether they accept the findings of the Commission.</p>

Judging by the Government&#x2019;s reactions and the response to this report, we will be able to judge whether or not the Government is serious when they say they want to combat Communism.

<p>I do not propose following the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) in his speech. The hon. member said that he was speaking to the second leg of the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, and of course there will be people after me who will reply to him. Only this reply: If the hon. member refers to the big difference between the producer&#x2019;s price and the consumer&#x2019;s price, I should like to say this only, that there has never been a Government in South Africa which has paid so much in subsidies on all our staple foods as this one has, or which has encouraged production to the extent that this one has, but at the same time tried to keep the consumer&#x2019;s price as low as this one has. So I leave the hon. member there.</p>

<p>Now I have to express my disappointment that where I am now rising to reply to charges made here last night and this morning by the hon. members for Yeoville and Port Elizabeth (West), those two hon. gentlemen are conspicuous by their absence now. We had trusted that they would be present in view of the fact that they knew we would reply to the matters they raised, and in view of the fact that I requested the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) to be here, and I think it is contempt of the House of Assembly that not one of them is here now, but I hope that the few remarks I wish to make will be conveyed to them.</p>

<p>The United Party reminds one of a flock of vultures. I do not know whether you have noticed how they operate, Mr. Speaker. They fly up into the skies and soar around looking with their keen eyes whether anything is happening on the ground that may provide something for them, and they are not too fastidious either. Frequently they watch whether birth is being given to anything, or whether something is dying, and then they descend and try to pick up what they can get. The Opposition has heard now that there is a large maize surplus that has to be exported and that there will be great losses as a result of the difference between the home price and the world price. They have also heard that <span class="col_8649-8650" refersTo="page_1571"/>there is great over-production of dairy produce and bananas etc. and now they are attacking these lower producers&#x2019; prices. Now they have also heard that in my vicinity in the Fish River Valley there are people who have had a very trying time so that it has been necessary for the Government to assist them. Now they think there is something they can prey upon too. I suppose one should not blame them, for they are people who are misled by any rumour or report. So the hon. members get hold of the <i>Evening Post</i> of 24 March, the day after the Minister had announced the Orange River Scheme, which had the following headlines on its front page: &#x201C;Irrigators who sold to the Government are indignant. Eastern Cape land prices jump&#x201D;. Now these two hon. members have come here and told us that in the first place the Minister had changed his policy, and he should tell them when he did so. In the second place, they say that the Minister, knowing that he was going to change his policy, and knowing that he was going to spend &#x00A3;375 per morgen in the Fish River Valley, then went along and bought up the land at &#x00A3;150 because and that is the reason given by the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;he intends establishing Bantustans there.</p>

<p>No, the hon. member referred to Bantustans. I have his Hansard here. But he said this also, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has witnessed one of the most scandalous bits of exploitation of its citizens that has ever happened in its history, because while the Minister on his own admission has decided to spend &#x00A3;375 per; morgen to bring water to the Fish River Valley, the Government arranged to buy land from those desperate settlers.</block>

<p>We shall come to the question of the Bantustans in a moment. [Interjections.] The hon. member made this allegation that things were going so terribly badly in the Fish River Valley. But on 11 May, a Friday evening, the hon. member went to Somerset East to address a meeting. The people from the Fish River Valley tried to attend that meeting, because it had been well advertised and it had been said also that he was one of the best speakers in the House of Assembly. One should have thought that he would have told the farmers that evening what the Opposition would have done for them. The Nationalists were very keen to go to that meeting. Many of my supporters wished to hear the hon. member, who is such a very much better speaker than I, but on arrival there they had to discover, to their disappointment, that they were not allowed to attend the meeting the hon. member for Yeoville came to hold for the irrigators. No, it was a meeting for their own supporters. These now are the people who make these allegations, but they are not prepared to meet the public. Why is he not prepared to meet the public of Somerset East on this matter, and to ask the people whether they are so dissatisfied and whether the Minister has treated them so scandalously? No, it is for this reason, because every one of them who shows his face there knows that he gets a motion of no-confidence and that is why the Nationalists are excluded and the farmers may not attend their meetings. The hon. member has denied his words, but here it is written in Hansard: &#x201C;We all know that what is behind this change of face is not the rescue of the farmers but to advance the Bantustan policies of the Prime Minister&#x201D; and five minutes ago the hon. member denied it.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Let us just leave it at that. Then they come along with the charge that the Government has changed its policy, and they say the land was bought because the Government had a sinister object and that it was unnecessary to have bought up those lands. They said the Government had changed in this House, he rejected the old Conroy scheme alias the Bowker scheme of the United Party, and then the charge was laid against the Minister that on 13 March 1959 in this House, he rejected the old Conroy scheme, and that on 9 March 1959, the Monday evening, at Cradock, he rejected the old scheme, and then it was said that this scheme, which has been announced now, also included a tunnel and therefore it must be the Conroy scheme which the Minister accepted. What did the Minister say on 13 March? He did not refer to the scheme to which the hon. member for Yeoville referred. I am referring to Hansard of 13 March 1959, Col. 2511&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But I went further and said that this does not mean that I or the Government were simply turning our backs to the needs of the irrigators in the Eastern Cape. All it means is&#x2014;and I repeat what I said there&#x2014;that I do not for a moment believe that this is the only possible way out to assist those people, or that this is the only possible scheme through which water could be brought to the Fish River Valley from the Orange River &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>The Minister then proceeds and says why he does not see his way clear to accept the old Conroy scheme, which was urged by the hon. member for Albany from year to year&#x2014;that scheme we have always opposed because it only included water for the Fish and the Sundays Rivers from the Orange River.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member will be a little patient, he will get everything he wishes <span class="col_8651-8652" refersTo="page_1572"/>to know. The hon. the Minister then continued; after telling the people also that surely there was nobody who wanted him to build a scheme that would cost R2,000 per morgen and for which they would have to pay, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For those reasons I reject that scheme, but I foresee, and I hope that it will progress so fast that before I retire I will be able to announce it in the House, a much more effective and cheaper scheme than this one we have been hearing about for all these years for the Eastern Cape.</block> <p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition then asked him: &#x201C;What is that scheme? and the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hope it will also have the blessing of the Opposition if I do so.</block>

<p>Here the Minister announced that he wished to build a great scheme, a grand scheme. That was on 13 March 1959. But in the meantime a terrible drought struck the Fish River Valley and its environs and those people had a terribly hard time. In the meantime the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) was busy scavenging to see whether he could derive any benefits from the distress of the people. The Minister proceeded with the investigation he announced here, and on 12 May 1960 he was able already to go further and announced here that he intended building the Pongola scheme, but at the same time he also announced that he was going to tackle the Orange River project and build the Orange River scheme. That was on 12 May 1960. That hon. member is shaking his head; he knows about it and everybody knows about it. Mr. Speaker, I wonder whether it is necessary to quote it for I have so little time&#x2014;but he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now the Government has decided that we are going to begin building the Pongola-poort-dam, but this does not mean that it will be done at the expense of the development of the Orange River scheme. We can develop the Orange River and the Pongola River simultaneously.</block>

<p>Then the Minister proceeds and he tells how he is going to build the Orange River scheme. But I think what is important is this: He said here it would consist of several schemes. Then Mr. Abraham asked him: &#x201C;How many schemes will it be?&#x201D; and he replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Four schemes. The fourth one is a complex actually; you can almost say five schemes.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) asked: &#x201C;Does that include the Orange-Fish scheme?&#x201D; and the Minister replied : &#x201C;Yes. As I say, the cost of all these schemes that have been investigated run to approximately &#x00A3;100,000,000.&#x201D; There already the hon. the Minister was announcing this scheme, and then the hon. members for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) and Port Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) and I went along and told the people that the Minister was going to build the Orange River scheme, but that the Minister had told us on 12 May that he was still engaged on certain investigations; he did not have all the information as yet, and as soon as the investigations were completed, he would make his announcement. Mr. Speaker, I have the further information here, but I do not wish to quote too much for my time is short. Then a telegram came from that source saying it was drought-stricken and that the people were having a terribly trying time and that the water supply had become exhausted. They said they were unable to wait until the Minister makes this announcement and they asked whether the Minister would grant an interview to a deputation consisting of Mr. Harry Sieberhagen (who the hon. member is so fond of quoting here; and Mr. Johan Troskie and Mr. Toob Lochner and Mr. Trollip.</p>

<p>Yes. Mr. Sieberhagen is a supporter of the United Party but he is one of the United Party supporters who will possibly vote National Party now after these people have been treated properly by the National Government. They again came to see the Minister and they said: Look, we are not able to wait any longer; you have to give us some other form of aid. Then already it was suggested&#x2014;and the first man who came along with this idea was Mr. Kobie Coetzee&#x2014;that this Government should buy up the farmers&#x2019; land. He had already suggested it to Minister Sauer. They then came to the Minister with their troubles. It was not confined to this Minister alone. It went to the Agricultural Committee of the Cabinet, and it went to the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and to the Minister of Lands, and they decided to have an economic survey made in the Fish River. That survey was made. After the Minister had announced this scheme of his, this economic survey was made in March 1961 knowing that the projected Orange River scheme that was going to be built had already been announced. The Committee which conducted the survey brought out its report and this Cabinet then decided that exceptional circumstances prevailed in the Fish River Valley that required to be dealt with in a special manner. They came along with a proposal that no Government has ever made in the past, and which I believe no Government will readily make in future again. They said they were prepared to buy out those people who were hardest hit. They fixed a limit and said they would buy out the people who were hardest hit. But do you know what that limit was? It would not only be the small farmers that would be bought out; that is to say the people who had little grazing land. It <span class="col_8653-8654" refersTo="page_1573"/>was immaterial whether a man had 2,000 morgen of irrigable land; then the Government still bought him out provided he had less than 300 morgen of grazing land. It was immaterial whether a man was a large farmer or a small farmer, and the allegation made by hon. members here last night, that the Government had bought out the small farmers, is as untrue as an allegation could be. We who represent those constituencies were concerned about the offers that would be made to these people who were unable to wait for the further Orange River inquiry. Here I have their telegram, dispatched on 17 November 1960-</p>

<block name="quote">Re economic situation in Fish River Valley: Board requests you make arrangements : for deputation to discuss matter as soon as possible with the Prime Minister as it is impossible for the irrigators to wait for the result of further investigations. Deputation will consists of Messrs. Sieberhagen, Coetzee and Lochner. Letter follows.</block>

<p>Mr.Speaker, I think I should rather tell you the facts of this matter. The Government came forward with offers. Perhaps I am anticipating myself when I tell you that of those approximately 400 farmers&#x2014;there are a few more than 400&#x2014;who were in distress in the Fish River Valley there were only about 120 who had less than 300 morgen of grazing land, who were eligible to sell. Those 120, with the exception of a few, offered their land for sale to the Government, but what is more, quite a number of them who had more land, also came along and offered their land and said: For God&#x2019;s sake, please buy our land too, even though it is bigger. The National Government sent the Land Board there: The valuations were made and we had an election without one single person knowing what his valuation would be. Where were those hon. members then with their meetings; where was the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) who now turns his back on me when I address him? I thank him for that method of courtesy. Next time I shall know how to deal with them.</p>

<p>Where were they then? We took Somerset East unopposed. We gained Fort Beaufort with a bigger majority than ever before and we took Cradock unopposed. Those are the people who now want to live and prey upon the dissatisfaction and the distress of a poor lot of people afflicted by drought. But the election was past, the results were out, and then the first offers came. Mr. Speaker, if ever there has been joy and amazement and bewilderment, then it was when they received the offers for their land. Immediately after that I hardly ever had a day&#x2019;s rest. Then all the people who did not qualify came to me daily to ask me please to persuade the Minister to buy their land also, knowing that the Orange River scheme was going to be built, but not knowing when the waters of the Orange River would be coursing down the Fish River. Parliament met and we waited; everybody knew that the Minister was going to make an announcement on the Orange River scheme, but on 21 February I once again had a deputation here to meet the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, the Minister of Lands and the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. And do you know what their request was? Their request was: Please buy up more land in the Fish River.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>It is no use the hon. member shaking his head so. I shall tell you why the people are anxious that their land should be bought. It is because this scheme has a dual purpose. It was not only to save the people who could introduce the least stock-element in their farming operations. It was also to make more water available to the people who had remained, and that is why, the more land is bought up the more water there will remain for these people who are still in difficulties at the present time; they are not out of the wood yet. Surely the mere announcement of the Orange River project has not given them extra water as yet. That water will be coming in a few years&#x2019; time only. The hon. member over there last night referred to five years. It may be seven or ten years before the water will be there, and in the meantime you are stuck with people who have problems, and whom you must try to help to overcome their difficulties. That is why they came along and begged that more land should be purchased.</p>

<p>They are always sorry about everything this Government does. They do not want this Government to do good; they want things to go badly.

The Nationalists of the Somerset East, Fort Beaufort and Cradock constituencies are not the ones who are dissatisfied; it is because the United Party supporters are defecting from them one after another, and I am prepared to mention names. I am going to mention their names across the floor of the House because they are people like Mr. Bob Dower, whose support they have lost, and because they have made people such as Mr. Harry Sieberhagen dissatisfied.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I do not see my way clear to repeating my speech from the commencement. Now it is said by hon. members opposite that we accepted the Conroy scheme. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) refers me to the report on the proposed Orange River development project, page 14. I should like to refer him to page 9. If he reads page 9, he will see that what I have said here is the gospel truth and that the Conroy scheme always was the diversion of the Orange River into the Fish and the Sundays Rivers. Let me quote it to the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The possibility of diverting the Orange River to the water deficient Fish River valley, by means of a tunnel from a point near Bethulie to the Brack River, a tributary of the Fish, was first mentioned in 1928 by Dr. A. D. Lewis, the then Director of Water Affairs. The need for a scheme of this nature became more urgent with the passage of time. A start was made with field surveys in 1944 &#x2026;</block> <p>I concede to hon. member that it was during the United Party government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026;and culminated in a technical report which was presented in 1948 and proposed a project consisting of a diversion dam on the Orange River, a diversion canal and tunnel to lead the water through the divide into the Fish River, followed by diversion to the Sundays. Test borings with a diamond drill were begun during 1947 and the initial surveys and investigations were mainly completed by 1953. During this stage of the investigational work a site upstream of Aliwal North, where the Orange flows through a narrow gorge was considered for the main storage dam, but the site immediately downstream of the Orange-Caledon confluence was ultimately selected for a detailed investigation. In all the development proposals up to this stage emphasis was laid on the diversion of water from the Orange to valleys outside its watershed and proposals for development within the Orange River basin itself were by comparison of a minor nature.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when one reads this to indicate to hon. members which surveys were made at the time, and what the projects were at the time, they sit and talk, but as soon as you resume your seat, they repeat it was a Conroy scheme. This scheme differs from the Conroy scheme if anything in the world can differ from it. [Interjection.] What good will it do me to say it is not so? I may quote it to the hon. member again, and when I have finished he will again say, like a difficult woman, &#x201C;All the same&#x201D;. Surely one cannot argue with anybody who argues that way. I may argue with the hon. member until I am blue in the face, and I shall get only one &#x201C;All the same&#x201D; after the other. The hon. members come along with quotations and they try to sow suspicion against me personally and against my candidature in Somerset East. I should like to say this to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West). He has a lot to say about the Somerset East constituency. I think he knows where Middleton lies in the South and I think he knows where Baroda lies in the North; he knows were Bedford lies in the East and he knows where Somerset East lies in the West. I now challenge him to select any point between those four places, or any one of those four places, and then he can come along and meet me on a public platform before the Fish River farmers, and then we can discuss this thing and he can come and tell them how concerned the United Party is about the interests of the irrigators. That evening we can discuss that with the public and with the irrigators themselves, and if there is a shred of manliness in him, he will now tell me: &#x201C;I shall let you know what date; you can make the arrangements&#x201D;. I myself shall arrange for transport for him to get there. He will not accept it. If he quotes here what Mr. Era Venter has said, then I say I shall quote what Mr. Venter told me.</p>

<p>The hon. member can be <span class="col_8657-8658" refersTo="page_1575"/>very pleased about that. Mr. Era Venter writes in a letter dated 5 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This letter serves to convey to you my personal thanks and appreciation and that of this Association for the tremendously valuable and hard work you and the other Eastern Cape Members of the House of Assembly have done to have the above-mentioned scheme passed by the House of Assembly (the Orange, Fish and Sundays River scheme). Herewith then our congratulations on the great success. All the members of our association also thank all of you for your ready co-operation and the assistance given to this association in every possible respect in its efforts to persuade the Government to build the above scheme. The building of the scheme soon will undoubtedly be of inestimable value not only to the areas concerned but also to the Republic as a whole. Our Association also wish to thank the Minister concerned and the officials of his Department and the Government for the careful and sound policy recently announced by the Minister of Water Affairs in connection with the development of the Orange River.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what more can I say than has been said by the best witness, Mr Era Venter, the president of the Cape Midlands Development Association? But here I also have the letter of the Secretary of the Great Fish River Irrigation Board. What better evidence is there on dissatisfaction or satisfaction in the Fish River Valley than the evidence of the Board itself which represents those people? The letter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Mr. Vosloo, the Orange River development scheme having been announced, and the development thereof being awaited with great excitement, this Board remains mindful of all the friends and interested persons who have fought for this national matter throughout the years. So it affords me great pleasure, on behalf of the Great Fish River Irrigation Board and all the irrigators they represent, to express our sincere thanks and appreciation of the very active share you had during the prelude to this great undertaking.</block>

<p>Time does not permit me to read all the letters. Here is a telegram from the Secretary of the Irrigation Board of Klipfontein; here is a letter from the Secretary of the Farmers&#x2019; Association Klipfontein-Thorngrove, Mr. van der Merwe; the telegram I have referred to came from Mr. Jopie le Roux. Here is a letter from Mr. A Louw, the Secretary of the Middleton Irrigation Board. Mr. Speaker, let us rather leave it at that. There is gratitude to this Government in the Fish River Valley for the manner in which they have been treated by this Government. There may be people who will rightly say to themselves: &#x201C;If I had not sold my land, the price might have been a little higher to-day, and I am now disappointed that I sold&#x201D;. That is why the hon. the Minister went to Cradock again. Yes, he is not afraid to go there; he can go there at any time; you merely have to invite him and then he comes, if time permits him to do so. As I have said, the Minister proceeded to Cradock again and the people said to him: &#x201C;Now that you have announced the scheme we are sorry we sold our land; perhaps we could have had a little more&#x201D;. The Minister&#x2019;s immediate reply was: &#x201C;All right, if you wish to buy back the land, then we will sell it back to you&#x201D; And then the hon. member comes along here and he has the audacity to say that I was stupid when I told him that those people may buy back their land. He says those people had debts at the shops and Land Bank loans. But if their land is worth so much more now, surely then they can now obtain a bigger loan on that land? It is elementary economics the hon. member should first of all go and study. If only he will keep quiet one could argue with him, but his mouth is open continually and his reason is shut out; that is his trouble. Mr. Speaker, those people were in financial difficulties and that is why they sold out. The price was attractive; the price was excellent. The Government cannot make Bantustans of those lands. In the meantime the Government has withdrawn the water rights of that land, and it has given the water rights to the remaining people who did not sell out. The figures of the hon. member were wrong also. He must not quote my cousin Mr. Lootie Vosloo, and then think his figures are correct. Only about 90 farmers sold out. If my figures are correct, 94 of the approximately 400 farmers sold out. The hon. member says it is 200 families. No, it is not. [Interjection.] The hon. member must be quiet now and think a while and register this figure. Not more than 98 sold out. The majority of those families are still living on those lands, for the State has let those lands to them at a nominal, reasonable price to keep them there. The State is not exterminating the people. They do not have water rights now because they received a good price for their land. The water rights have been given to the other people who did not offer their land for sale, and so have little water. Those who did not sell now have more of the available quantity of water. On behalf of the Fish River farmers, but also on behalf of the farmers of the Sundays River, I should like to express to this Minister, and to the National Government and the Department of the Minister, my cordial thanks. As long as the farmers&#x2019; interests are looked after in this manner we shall see to it that we keep the National Government in power. We appreciate the development that, as the English Press also says, will take place there. Perhaps I should quote the leading article in the <i>Evening Post</i> of 24 March&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is refreshing nowadays to have good news about South Africa, particularly about <span class="col_8659-8660" refersTo="page_1576"/>The Eastern Cape. The Minister of Water Affairs, Mr. P. M. K. le Roux, gave us such news when he spoke in the Senate yesterday, and the effects of the plan for the Orange-Fish-Sundays River scheme must be beneficial.</block>

<p>I am unable to find the little piece to which I wanted to refer now, but it amounts to this, that as regards the Eastern Cape, there is nothing but bewilderment about this development, the end of which we simply cannot determine, this development that could go on for years and which will be of as much importance to South Africa as a whole as to the Eastern Cape. Notwithstanding the fact that the hon. members for Yeoville and Port Elizabeth (West) have come forward here with allegations and remarks that are not worthy of the United Party, I am sure that not one of them will dare set a foot on a public platform in that area. When they go there it is a branch meeting or an invitation meeting; that is the way in which they come there. As long as the Government treats the irrigators of the Fish River and the Sundays River the way they have treated them in the past, and the way it has promised to treat them in future, we shall see to it that the United Party never gets into power again.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) is a farmer of course; I am not a farmer. He apparently knows something about irrigation. I want to admit readily that I am not an expert in that sphere. I do think, however, that a few facts have been stated in the course of the debate which even the layman can perhaps understand and interpret. The first fact is that the impression was created one way or another&#x2014;no matter how we read Hansard, no matter how we read the newspapers&#x2014;by the hon. the Minister himself in 1959 that those people on the Fish River settlement would not get water. That impression was created, and it was as a result of that impression that the hon. the Minister undertook to buy out those farmers. Why else did he buy them out?</p>

<p>It will be said that those people had to sell because they were having such a difficult time, but in that case, Sir, I wish to remind you of the argument advanced by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B.

And when this side of the House said that the farmers could not buy back, that side of the House said it was nonsense. We now have had precisely the same excuse from the hon. member for Somerset East that the farmers had to sell, not because they would not get any water, but because they had no option. I do not think both sides can be right.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Speaker, I am not a farmer.

Within a day or two hon. members will return to their constituencies and they will have to report on what has happened in this House during the past five months. Those hon. members who are farmers, like the hon. member for Somerset East, will be able to tell them about the Orange River scheme, and those hon. members who are active in the industrial field will be able to tell them what has been done for industry. But I, as the Member of Parliament for Maitland, will be asked what the Government has done during the past five months for the worker if South Africa, and that will be a reasonable question.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Vereeniging that he tells many things to the people; he obviously does not know equally much about all of them. However, there is a reasonable question that will be put to me, and I will have to give a reply. I want to submit this matter to the House this afternoon in the greatest humility and ask hon. members what has really been done for the workers of South Africa, with specific reference to the less privileged workers, those in the lower income groups. A great deal has, indeed, been said on the subject. The matter was raised by this side of the House, but I think that nothing has specifically been done for the worker.</p>

<p>I will not allow myself to be diverted by the hon. member. I will put the position this way to the hon. member: What have they suggested that has not been done and in that case they can ask the Deputy Minister of Labour. He suggested that the Shops and Offices Act should be amended, and we are still waiting for that. If I had to reply to that question this afternoon, I would say that very little, if anything, has been done for the worker. Had the position of the workers been so wonderful, I would have understood it, but is there one hon. member who will put his hand on his heart this afternoon and disagree with me when I say that, <span class="col_8661-8662" refersTo="page_1577"/>throughout South Africa, there are thousands of workers in the lower income group, who not only eke out a living, but who, in many instances, live in the greatest poverty? I am not the only one who is concerned about this position. I am convinced that hon. members on the other side of the House are just as concerned about it, because the people in the lower income group are having a difficult time. We travel blithely along the top of De Waal Drive, but we never go down to the little side streets, the back streets, where thousands of South African workers struggle to make a living. I am convinced that hon. members on the other side of the House are just as concerned about the matter as we are.</p>

<p>A few days ago the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;I think it was at the opening of the celebrations on the occasion of the jubilee of the Defence Force&#x2014;told us how sound our economy was. He said that South Africa had a great industrial potential. He said the country had unlimited natural resources. Those were winged words; when we listen to those words, and when I think of the high level which our reserves have reached, and the tremendous increases which have taken place in salaries over the years, and when I hear how our national income has doubled, and that there is only 2.4 per cent unemployment, when I hear these things and I walk out of this building into one of the little houses in my constituency and I see the poverty which prevails from day to day, I ask myself what do all these statistics and all these figures mean&#x2014;statistics and figures which represent South Africa as a country in which wonderful conditions obtain&#x2014;whereas we know that there are thousands of our fellow South Africans who barely make a living and where poverty knocks at the door. If I can take you to one such home, Sir, I can take you to tens of such homes in my constituency, practically in every constituency in the northern suburbs of the Peninsula, the homes of lorry drivers, homes of shop workers, homes of railway workers, the unskilled labourer, the tarpaulin repairers in the employ of the Railways, and those people who have to wash and clean the passenger coaches and trucks, and last, but not least, the homes of numbers of pensioners, old people in the eve of their lives, who barely make a living, whereas they should have been in a position to live happily. We in this House are occupying ourselves with wider visions, we are travelling along the slopes of the mountain, and we are forgetting the people who are living down below in the side streets and those workers of South Africa who find it hard to make a living, those people in the lower income groups. Many of those people are not single, but have families whom they have to keep. That father has to work to maintain his wife and children, and the tragedy is that that father and that mother longingly wait for the day when they will be able to take that son or daughter out of school&#x2014;Std. V. VI, VII&#x2014;to go and work and earn extra income for the family.</p>

Within a few years he is in the same position as his father with his Std.VI or Std. VII certificate. In that way a vicious circle develops in the case of those people who are in a groove, people who cannot get out of it, who have been forced into it by economic circumstances. Nobody can get them out of it unless the State takes them by the hand and lifts them out. Sir, if you go to the labour office here in Cape Town, and you study the people who stand in front of those doors waiting for work, you will find that 65 per cent of those people are people who did not go beyond Std.VII and that is why they are unemployed. You find that process developing daily in numbers of homes in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, we are actively engaged in looking for immigrants, people with technical knowledge and training. Do you know that numbers of boys and girls of those people who are forced to work long for the further training which they cannot get.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish the hon. member would be serious for once. Those people long to be trained, but they cannot get it and in the meantime we have to import those people at high costs. I do not want to exaggerate but I must say that in some respects we are scandalously wasting valuable material, human material in South Africa. I am not only referring to the Whites but also to the Coloureds. Not only do these people require training, but they need guidance as well. That boy who wants to study must be shown how to get into the school if he does not know himself, or if his father cannot tell him or if his father does not have the money to send him there. If we wish to make the best possible use of our human material in South Africa the State will have to make provision. The people are finding things difficult because they do not earn a civilized wage. By a &#x201C;civilized wage&#x201D; I understand that that man should be in a position to live with his family in a little home, not a palace, but a decent little home; secondly he should have sufficient nourishing food. He. as a worker, is entitled to that. Over the past few days we have heard about surpluses in South Africa, but at the same time I have heard in this House that the consumption of agricultural products has not increased since 1952-3. I, therefore, ask myself this question: If we can lift these people out of the groove of poverty and uplift them, will we not be able to dispose of a large amount of our surpluses while at the same time making it possible for those people to live decently? We hear about the Orange River scheme. I do not want to go into that but we already read <span class="col_8663-8664" refersTo="page_1578"/>in the daily Press that voices are being raised at the Orange River Agricultural Union which ask: Why place more land under water and encourage extra production if we already have surpluses? They are already beginning to worry about a scheme which ought to enrich the whole of South Africa. They are getting worried because they hear about surpluses, surpluses which I think ought to be much less if the people of South Africa were placed in a position where they could feed themselves properly with the products from our own soil. There is a third point, namely sufficient clothing. Only last week a notice appeared in the <i>Government Gazette</i> about the additional duty to be placed on materials which are imported. Let us translate it into language which the man in the street can understand. Do you know what that means, Sir? That shirt, the very shirt which the worker probably wears, which costs him 19s. 11d., to-day will cost him 5s. more if the additional duty is added. That is what the additional duty means to the worker. Mr. Speaker, he ought to be able to clothe himself properly, he ought to be able to educate his child properly. He should be in a position to travel to and from his work, he should be able to enjoy a little entertainment occasionally and he should be able to go on holiday perhaps once every two years. He should also be able to build up a small cash reserve. Those of you who are perhaps children of the depression&#x2014;I believe those people who were children in those lean years are called that&#x2014;will know what a wonderful source of security that &#x00A3;5 in the bank was. Do you know there are thousands of people who do not have &#x00A3;5 in the bank, who have nothing. I think we should place the workers in a position to build up a reserve, even if it is only a small reserve. I think I have mentioned eight points, eight prerequisites for people to maintain a civilized standard of living. Those are the things which a civilized wage ought to ensure to them. I do not think there is one person in this whole House who will tell me that the worker is not entitled to that. Let me tell you, however, Sir, that there are numbers who cannot afford those things. How can you do it if you earn &#x00A3;40 or &#x00A3;50 per month and you have a family? I am not even talking about the Coloureds. For every White man who struggles there are two and three Coloureds who struggle twice and three times as hard.</p>

<p>I want to state it very clearly that there are numerous people in South Africa who cannot afford these things. It is not surprising that there has been an increase in the number of summonses. It is not surprising that people have to take their children out of school to earn their own bread. It is not surprising that there are families in my constituency where the word &#x201C;holiday&#x201D; is no longer part of their vocabulary.</p>

He will admit that the lower income groups find it difficult to make ends meet. I think we all sympathize with those people. If that is the position, are we going to allow the position to continue? May I, in all humility, appeal to hon. members opposite to have this matter investigated and that we stop travelling only high along the slope on De Waal Drive but that we come down to the suburbs, to the narrow streets, and see the conditions under which those people are living.</p>

<p>I am fortunate in this respect that I can usually tell a man&#x2019;s fortune in politics. Unless the hon. member who has just spoken undergoes a change of heart, I predict that he will not remain long in politics. The language which he used came from his heart, but the language which he used conflicts with the interests of those at the head of his party. If he continues to speak that language he will be outwitted one way or another one day and will no longer be here. [Interjections.] Hon. members should not get perturbed. Time will tell whether I was right or not. I want to tell that hon. member his political fortune to-day in all sincerity. He will have to change his opinion and refrain from placing in the foreground to the extent that he does the love which he cherishes for the people for whom he has pleaded. I find no fault with that, but he will have to cease doing so if he wishes to remain within the ranks of the party opposite. I wish to reply to a few of the questions before I deal with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton). The hon. member has asked a number of important questions to which I want to reply, although he asked them in a very general way. The hon. member asked two questions. He wanted to know what has been done in particular for that class of person whom he mentioned? I want to go so far as to say that nothing in particular, but in general those people for whom he has pleaded have been kept in a position where you can still say that almost every White man in South Africa has been provided with permanent employment. The biggest catastrophe that can ever hit these people will be if they have to walk the streets and ask for work, while various Natives do their work. And that is the policy of the hon. member for Yeoville. That will be a very great catastrophe. I believe the hon. member spoke with great sincerity but he will realize that those people would have found themselves in much more distressing circumstances if they had had to march through the streets and if, according to the policy of the United Party, Natives had had to come from the Bantu reserves to do their work here. That would be the worst catastrophe <span class="col_8665-8666" refersTo="page_1579"/>that could hit them. The second question which the hon. member asked I will answer in this way: This Government, in spite of the fact that the price of food has risen considerably in the world outside, has in particular done this for that man, it has kept the price of food low by subsidizing food to a greater extent than ever before in South Africa. That is something which cannot be argued away. I say that the hon. gentleman will have to be careful in future. When he meets those people he will have to say to them: Look, we notice that the main United Party speaker on labour matters said in Parliament that a policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; should be followed. They will ask the hon. member what that means. This will in due course bring me to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, but it is partly also a reply to the hon. member for Maitland. If the policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; of the United Party were accepted, it would be impossible for the Whites and the Coloureds to keep their head above water, because the policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; has never succeeded in supplying one single White man in South Africa in the lower income groups with work or in protecting him. I am now replying to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. He asked how many Whites had retained their work in South Africa as a result of job reservation. My reply is this that job reservation, to which he referred specifically, in terms of Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, forms part of what we regard in this country as the major pattern of job reservation. There are three ways in which jobs are reserved in South Africa. I do not want to concentrate on the one part, because I want to deal with all the three different methods which are mainly followed in South Africa to reserve jobs for Whites. The most important one is the conventional method of job reservation. The hon. member opposite and many of his colleagues will probably be the first to protest if anything is done which conflicts with the conventional method of job reservation. If he asks how many have been protected by conventional job reservation, I say the entire Public Service, the entire police service (as far as the Whites are concerned) your entire military service in South Africa, your entire Defence Force. That is conventional job reservation.</p>

<p>I know, but in that case the hon. member only spoke about a section of a section. Job reservation should be seen in its entirety. He dealt with an essential part of the three bases which I am talking about. That part is just as essential as it is for a wagon to have a wheel or for a motor-car to have a wheel&#x2014;every wheel is just as necessary as the other three. Job reservation in terms of Section 77 is an absolutely essential part of our job reservation pattern in South Africa. If you remove one wheel from a motor-car you cannot travel with the other three. Conventional job reservation is the most important, and even those hon. gentlemen in the Press gallery &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. I hope the hon. member follows what I mean when I talk about a part. I say that unfortunately most people who make a living as a result of this conventional colour bar which exists in the South African pattern, are unaware of its existence. I go so far as to say that 99 per cent of the gentlemen in the Press gallery are unaware of it. If conventional job reservation were to disappear it would be possible to replace every newspaperman in South Africa by a Black journalist from Africa, ten times as many as you need. You would be able to get qualified people from all parts of the Continent of Africa to take their place. But as the United Party sees the pattern, they think that they will probably be able to maintain the White man in the professions, but when it comes to the trades, where the artisan will be affected, they do not care one iota what happens to the White man. Time and again over the past 50 years, in season and out of season, onslaughts have been made on the trades in South Africa. They did everything in their power to place them in the hands of the non-Whites in South Africa. That was why they carried on like evil spirits when the first real colour bar was introduced in South Africa, Act No. 25 of 1926. They held protest meetings to protest against the proposed colour bar legislation, an Act which stands as steadfast as a rock. Because of that Act the mining industry is still following that pattern to-day and that is why the mining industry is one of the most effective in the world to-day. There you have job reservation, Sir, not only as between Black and White but even as between various Bantu races. But if they could, the United Party would even undermine that to-day. Had it not been for the fact that the mining industry would collapse if you removed the White man, Mr. Oppenheimer would tell them to-morrow that they should rather do away with job reservation. As a matter of fact he does that himself. I am referring to the report of a speech made by Mr. Oppenheimer a few days ago when he said: &#x201C;Look, you must not attack the colour bar in Parliament, leave that to me.&#x201D; It is clear from the report which occupations will be affected in the mines as far as the colour bar is concerned. There has been an agitation afoot for the past 30 years and more. They are conditioning certain trade unions in South Africa to abolish the industrial colour bar in South Africa one of these days, more particularly in the mining industry, in such a way that they will be able to place those Bantu whom they are training to-day in certain staff positions in the mining industry instead of Whites. He is fighting the battle for them. He does it so neatly, it is stated so subtly in the report, that unless you are trained in these matters and unless you are a first-class detective you would never guess what Mr. Oppenheimer meant in this report, and what he was fighting for.</p>

<p>I now come to Section 77 which the hon. <span class="col_8667-8668" refersTo="page_1580"/>member for Umhlatuzana attacked so strenuously at the instigation of the hon. member for Yeoville. Ever since the existence of that section they have been fighting against it every year and to-day they come forward with &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; as an alternative. Let us explain it clearly to those who are not conversant with what the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; means. For example, whereas we are no longer faced with a mass of completely illiterate Bantu, but where thousands of them already have their matriculation certificate, the application of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; will mean that you will be able to replace more than half the White workers in the White industries by Bantu and Coloureds, if the policy of job reservation is not applied.</p>

<p>You will not be able to maintain the position if the White man and the Black man receive the same pay. I am astounded that the hon. member cannot understand that. I have been asking that question ever since those days: Wherever in South Africa have you found the White man and the Black next to each other where the same wage was paid for the same job? The result of that policy is that the White man has to go. That has happened. You no longer find Whites in the building industry in the cities. They were no match for the Coloureds and the Coloureds in turn were no match for the Bantu. The Bantu replaced the Coloureds by their thousands. Do hon. members opposite think that they can continue to tell the White man how wonderful it will be for him to occupy a higher position, that they want the White to get promoted and that the Bantu should fill the inferior positions? That is the pattern which they advocate. That is a deceptive pattern, because whether the Opposition accepts it or not, South Africa is gradually following a road, as far as the Republic is concerned, of gradually making the White areas more and more White also as far as the industries are concerned. There will be room for the other races and in the case of the Bantu they will find refuge in those areas which are being developed for them. It must be accepted once and for all that no State and no nation can continue to exist if it has to be dependent on the citizens of another country to work in its trades. Every State which wants to be healthy and sound must be able to fill all its posts from the highest to the lowest with its own citizens. That policy of the United Party of only keeping the highest and the most attractive positions for the White man is all very well if you approach it from the angle that the White man is only a temporary so journer here. But if you are determined that the White man should continue to exist here for all time and at all costs, you have to build on the pattern of the National Party, namely you should retain the White man and the White women in the highest and the lowest strata of your economic structure, the lower levels of labour in particular should not be dependent on the labour and citizens of another country, as is the position to-day with the Bantu from the Transkei and elsewhere. If we want to develop the pattern, namely that of a State, we should concentrate on placing our own people in all the shelves, if I may put it that way, Sir, of our national life. The people should not adopt the attitude that they are only a nation of shopkeepers, as hon. gentlemen opposite apparently want them to; we should not merely wish to be the buyers and the sellers and the profit-makers. The profit-making section has never as yet maintained a nation. The profit-making section is that section of a nation which should be able to move from one part of the country to the other. The profitmaking section is that section which is responsible for the hostility which exists in the world to-day, namely in Central Africa. That is the section which is responsible for it that the White man is hated in Africa, because it followed the pattern there which the United Party want to follow here, namely that the Whites should only occupy managerial positions, and the lower strata of positions should all be filled by non-Whites. We can no longer even allow that policy to be advocated in South Africa. The time is long overdue that the Opposition realized that of all the fatal doctrines which they have preached from their platforms, namely that the White man and the Black man should stand at the same workbench and earn the same wage, that is the most fatal and the most deadly one. That is also the reason why that party is losing more and more seats in the workers&#x2019; constituencies and that is why they emerge from every election with flea in their ear as far as the workers are concerned. That is why I hope the United Party will accept this pattern which we are discussing and which we are applying in practice. They will have to accept it because if they do not, they will continue to follow a policy which is in conflict with the policy which we are following and which will attract more and more non-Whites to the White areas. We are often told that wages should be increased and made attractive in South Africa. I am in favour of it that the highest possible wage should be paid to every person on earth. Everybody is in favour of that. It is not necessary to argue about that. We should not forget one thing, however, and it is this: If we increased wages in industry, in those sections where the wages of the Bantu would also be increased, we would again be creating an irresistible attraction not only to our own Bantu for whom we are to-day making provision in the Bantu areas, but also for the Bantu in our neighbouring and other states and that is one of the main reasons why we are to-day still saddled with practically half a million foreign Bantu in this country. He works here for a year and then he goes home <span class="col_8669-8670" refersTo="page_1581"/>and he lives there for five years on the wage which he has earned here over the period of a year. Where we are in favour of an increase in the salary and wage scales we should also take this aspect into account. We create a most irresistible attraction and then we want to know why those people come here. They come here in spite of the fact that it is said at UNO that South Africa is a hell for the Black man. They come here because there is no better place in the whole world for the Black man than South Africa, because we are already paying them wages here which enable them to work for one year and then to return to their own areas on holiday for a considerable number of years. We cannot get away from this. That is a fact which we have to face up to.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I talk in this vein it is not my intention to give the impression that we wish to cause disruption to any extent. Far from it. We also want our friends opposite to realize that where the Bantu and the non-White worker has so far played an important role in our industries, they will remain there as such and that the process of their removal will take place at the same tempo and pace as the tempo at which the development of the Bantu areas takes place. We envisage that for years to come, for decades in the future, we will have a very large number of non-White workers in South Africa. But let us clearly remember this that when they come here, we accept them because we need them, because we cannot supply all the labour in the lower strata and also because we want to help them because they have a great need for working facilities. That is a position which will obtain for all time to come. But in that case we should be sufficiently sensible not to regard that state of affairs as a pattern which should be developed further, as is suggested by the United Party, namely to integrate non-White labour more and more in the White areas. It is there where we clash and where we differ so widely. As I have already said, the policy of the United Party is perfect if you approach it from the angle that the White man&#x2019;s presence in South Africa is of a temporary nature, as it was in the Congo, as it was in the Gold Coast, etc. But that is not the position. Thanks to the National Party policy, the world is fast beginning to accept that nothing will drive the White man from South Africa. No threat or no falsehood which is propagated at UNO or anywhere else will any longer be a means of bringing about the eventual disappearance of the White man from South Africa. One festering sore remains to be removed and that is this evil doctrine of the United Party. The time has arrived when we should destroy those doctrines of the United Party in the political field with greater force and greater vigour, so that every White man and woman will realize that if they were to follow the way of the United Party, South Africa must sooner or later follow the same road which was followed by all the other countries on the Continent of Africa. That is where we clash.</p>

But no one on earth will be such an idealist as to think that we will reach a position where we will erect a barbed wire fence with the Blacks on the other side and where anybody who climbs through will be shot. We will not have that position. My reply to my hon. friend is that for all time, or for many years, the economy of South Africa will be dependent to a great extent on non-White labour from our Bantu areas, just as Germany and France obtain labour from Italy and other parts of Europe. You will always have that pattern. Similarly we will have it here. Industry and the mines are to a large extent dependent on labour which is simply migrant labour. But when they are immigrants it does not mean that they should enjoy what the United Party has suggested in the case of the Bantu, as the hon. member for Yeoville has said, namely that they should become land-owners in Johannesburg. He says we should develop a big strong economic and land-owner middle class Bantu community there. You do not find it in Europe that the workers become a great, strong land-owner class in the country where they go to work</p>

That is not the position. I have already proved to you, Sir, that the industry, namely the mining industry, in South Africa which stands out in the world as the most efficient, is based 100 per cent on the principle of job reservation.

The United Party imprints certain things on the mind of the industrialists which you cannot remove with a hammer. That was also how they imprinted certain things on the mind of U.N.O. The United Party is continually imprinting certain harmful things on the minds of certain industrialists until the industrialists eventually believe them. As the hon. the Deputy Minister said the other day, if there is nothing left for them to talk about, they talk about job reservation. No, Sir. we intend to continue to build on that policy and that pattern, and job reservation in terms of Section 77 is only a part of the whole pattern, part of the conventional job reservation pattern just as Act No. 25 of 1926 is. They all form part of the whole pattern.

Furthermore, job reservation is subsidizing incompetence and encouraging lack of initiative. That is the position which has been brought about by job reservation as between Coloureds and Whites. That is how far I want to go on that aspect. It has been dealt with; it is the policy of the Government.

They can accept my challenge at any time; I will not withdraw it. It remains open.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I did not intend to take this line in this debate. It was my intention to refer in more detail to the position of the Coloured people in relation to their living conditions. The Government rightly boasts to-day of the amount of our reserves; it has reached its peak. Because the reserves have sky-rocketed to the figure at which they stand to-day, they claim that the country is indeed a prosperous country. In my opinion, Sir, a country is only as prosperous as the people in the country are. If the people in a country are not prosperous that country is not prosperous, notwithstanding the wealth which it may have in the form of reserves, gold or anything else. If we wish to boast, therefore, of a prosperous South Africa we must see that the people of South Africa are prosperous in every phase of life. I refer particularly to the position of our Coloured people.</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee)&#x2014;I am sorry he is not here&#x2014;asked certain questions about minimum wages. I have dealt with that before.

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is quite right, but I merely wanted to answer the hon. member for Vereeniging. I have answered him before but it has apparently not sunk in, so I want to reply to him again. In some industries where Coloured people are employed the minimum wage is as low as &#x00A3;1 6s. 0d. per week. I say that any Government which permits such a low minimum wage in certain industries does not deserve to have the confidence of the Coloured people to whom I am referring. It is because of the low wage which the average Coloured man earns that we have malnutrition&#x2014;and this applies also to White people in the lower income groups&#x2014;in South Africa.</p>

<p>I believe the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) has already referred to the report of the committee of inquiry into family allowances. He referred particularly to page 81 under the heading &#x201C;Malnutrition&#x201D;. I would just like to remind the House what it says. Paragraph 316 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Probably a large proportion of the children in South Africa are malnourished because <span class="col_8673-8674" refersTo="page_1583"/>of an inadequate supply of the protective and protein foods&#x2014;milk and its derivatives, eggs, fruit, vegetables and meat. As a consequence, a population is being produced which is physically unfit.</block>

<p>I do not want to quote any more, because this has already been referred to. An attempt was made in the Provincial Council by a United Party member, in a somewhat different form, but with the same object in view, to try to get the Government to distribute surplus food amongst the poor people. What happened? When that hon. member, sincerely and honestly tried to put forward a well-thought-out plan, whereby the poorer people of South Africa would benefit, he was laughed at; they jeered at him. The <i>Cape Times</i> rightly came out with this heading: &#x201C;Nats Attack Food Plan for the Poor: U.P. Member Urges End of Dumping.&#x201D; The report then goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nats laughed. They laughed and they jeered when a suggestion such as this was brought forward.</block>

<p>Mr.Speaker, I want to show that the surpluses in South Africa are sufficient in every way to assist the poor people. May I also refer to an article written by a man who has devoted a considerable number of years to working amongst the poor, Dr. Oscar Wollheim. He wrote a long article on this question, and he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These disease rates are obviously mainly the result of an enforced elimination of expensive protective foodstuffs in the diet, and the substitution there for of cheaper stomachfilling starches. The resultant malnutrition lowers resistance to such an extent that disease is easily able to take its toll.</block>

<p>When you read the annual report of the Department of Health of 1958, Sir, you will see to what extent the Coloured people suffer as a result of malnutrition and disease compared with the Whites. The 1958 report is the latest which is available to me. I do not know whether there is a later one. The hon. members says it is not true what I say. Let us take the case of tuberculosis. I read from page 39 of this report, and it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tuberculosis: Forms which caused death in children under five years of age: year ended 31 December 1958.</block> <p>I am not going to go into the specific types of tuberculosis, but, compared with 12 Europeans who died, 510 Coloureds died. If the hon. member wants to know what is wrong with these figures, I do not know. There is only one answer: These people do not get sufficient protein foods in order to keep them alive, and they die prematurely. On pages 37-8 of this report it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tuberculosis: Distribution of cases and deaths, by race and age, reported during the year ended 31 December 1958.</block>

<p>They give the whole table of deaths up to four years and so on. Let me take the case of children between five and nine years. Whereas there were only three deaths in the case of the Europeans, 61 Coloured children died. In the age group 10 to 14 years, as many as 2,741 Coloured children died as compared with 31 European children. Now, Sir, these figures must indicate something. It must indicate that these people do not get the food value which is necessary to keep them alive.</p>

I have no intention of going into that aspect. But I do want to say this in answer to the hon. member&#x2019;s interjection that, if you will feed the school children as you have done in the past, you will go a long way towards helping those people in their health. If the hon. member does not accept what I say, let me read some of the reports which we receive from medical people. As soon as the school feeding scheme was stopped we had reports from doctors. I want to read one or two of them in order to satisfy the hon. member that, if they could only revert to school feeding, it would help considerably.</p>

<p>I am coming to that point. I want to read a few letters. I have one here from Dr. Sym of Knysna&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is to place on record that I have noticed, since the abandonment of the former school-feeding scheme, a considerable increase in the number of school children in that area who appear to be suffering from a certain degree of malnutrition, with a consequent increase in the incidence of illness among them.</block>

<p>That was written by a doctor. I have another one here from a principal of a school at Queens town, which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most of the non-European children attended by me in my private capacity, and as a member of the Honorary Medical Staff of the local hospital, show some evidence of both protein deficiency, as well as vitamin deficiency, in their diet. The same applies, to a lesser degree, to the European children of poorer families.</block>

<block name="quote">In my opinion school feeding is essential in many cases and the authorities should be prepared to resume a modified form of school feeding.</block>

<p>I have seen other letters signed by medical people throughout the country, that, as soon as the authorities stopped feeding the children <span class="col_8675-8676" refersTo="page_1584"/>at school, both Coloured and European, there was an increase in the incidence of malnutrition and consequent illness amongst these people. What is the remedy? The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) gave some details.

<p>I have no doubt that they will. I want to impress on the Government that these large surpluses&#x2014;there is an outlet for it. As far as butter is concerned, there is a considerable surplus, and also of cheese and eggs. I remember some years ago local authorities were prepared, and I am sure they would still be prepared, if the Government would send the surplus butter and eggs to them, to distribute them to the poor. I myself, as a member of the City Council of Cape Town, have had a system for many years. The surpluses were sent to us and we used the old Drill Hall, and, by a scheme of identification cards, these people used to come and receive their butter at 6d. a lb. Where there is a will there is a way.</p>

<p>What difference does it make who pays for it? Those hon. members would rather spend more money on hospitals and fighting tuberculosis than to spend money on the distribution of these surpluses. My plea to them is this: Let those hon. members go out with me to the areas occupied by the Coloureds and see the state of their roads and houses and the poverty they live in, and there will not be one of them who will refuse to accede to the request I make on behalf of the Coloureds whom I represent. Do not waste your surpluses. Send it to them. Make it incumbent upon local authorities to act as your distribution agents. I have not the slightest doubt that you will get complete acceptance by every local authority. They will only be too glad to help these people.</p>

<p>I want to conclude on this point. The Minister of Coloured Affairs made a very important statement about Coloured education. I do not want to discuss it, except to say to the Minister of Finance that, if the Government has to carry on Coloured education instead of the provinces, I sincerely trust&#x2014;and I make this appeal to him, that he should make available sufficient funds to make it possible for there to be compulsory Coloured education with the same facilities in every sphere. I sincerely hope that, not only will they give them equal facilities, but, for the sake of all the schoolchildren in South Africa, Coloured or White, the Government, I hope, will reestablish the school-feeding scheme and will get the local authorities to act as their distribution agents for the surpluses, and you will be repaid millions of and in the health of the population, and you will save on hospitalization. [Interjections.] But, you see, Sir, you get the same reaction that you get in the Provincial Council. They laugh and jeer when a serious motion in regard to food is introduced, and I say that the way they behave to-day shows that they are not in any way concerned with the position of the poor people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) and Maitland (Mr. Hickman) have made a plea on behalf of the middle and lower income groups. The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) has made a special plea on behalf of the people he represents. I am surprised that there has been no reply from the Government side to the charges made by those hon. members. We had a long speech from the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg), in which he mainly defended job reservation. The question put to him was how many White workers are protected by Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, but he did not answer it, and it is quite clear that the hon. member spent most of his time justifying job reservation and justifying the cause of unequal pay for equal work. If we are to lighten the many financial difficulties that beset the lower income groups, we have to maintain the rate of economic progress, in order to have full employment. The Minister, in his introduction, spoke briefly about the new method of financing. He referred to Dr. de Kock, but he gave us no other information in regard to the reserves and I would like to ask him, first of all, whether he has the latest figures in regard to the Revenue Account and the Loan Account, the final figures. He gave it to us a few days ago, but I would like to know whether he has the final figures. Then I would like the Minister to say something in his reply about his intentions in regard to the present position of the reserves. To-day the reserves are at their highest level for the past 14 years. That is due to the strict import control, but also to the exchange control introduced last year, which had the effect of prohibiting the repatriation of funds from this country. The whole country wants to know what the future position is going to be, whether the reserves are now in such a state as to justify any relaxation of import or exchange control. It is quite clear that the amount of our present reserves is due to the fact that we are not allowing the overseas investors who have funds in this country to repatriate their funds. It is very easy to boast of the high figure of the reserves, because it is just the same as a person who boasts about how much money he has in the bank but he has not paid his accounts. I do not want to be interpreted as saying that we do not pay our foreign obligations, but as long as there is exchange control this high figure of the reserves may mask the real position of the reserves. We have seen recently that there has been a narrowing of the margin between the London prices and the South African prices <span class="col_8677-8678" refersTo="page_1585"/>on the Stock Exchange, and I would like the Minister to give us some further information on that. This is a matter on which the Minister has special information, and he is the one who can give us that information. No member on this side would be so foolish as to suggest a remedy without having all the information available. The Minister has the information available and I think it is time we had some indication from him, because there is no doubt that the present position in the country is patchy. [Interjections.] I think the Minister will be the first to agree that the position in the country is patchy. In some industries there is prosperity and in others almost a depression, or tending towards a depression, like in the building industry. Numbers of building workers are unemployed. In certain towns we have a surplus of flats, but on the other hand we have a shortage of suitable accommodation. Whilst we have too many flats, we find in another part of the city slums of which no one can be proud. We have the position that there is a hesitancy on the part of the ordinary working man to invest in a building, and instead he keeps his funds intact. We find a hesitancy on the part of business to invest. This patchy position is clouded to a certain extent by the uncertainty of industry, and industry is uncertain because they do not know what the future is going to be with regard to our position should Britain enter the Common Market. It is that uncertainty which is making industry uncertain. For the last four years, in the main, secondary industry development has been slacking. The over-all position shows that our exports have increased. There have been increases in our wool and maize and gold exports but in our secondary industries, which employ a large number of people, there is a downward trend in employment. Recently Dr. van Eck said that the Common Market was the political and economic event of the century. The European countries are getting together and trying to find points of agreement. We in this country are bent on a policy of fragmentation. Let us examine what was recently said by Mr. Hans Middleman, the President of Assocom. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are we breaking down, or are we erecting trade barriers between ourselves and the outside world?</block>

<p>If we examine the position in this country, we find no resolute attempts being made to widen our markets to the North. The Minister of Economic Affairs is overseas now endeavouring to get the best conditions possible, but we have seen no tangible results in the expansion of our markets, apart from the recent agreement with Japan. The second question which Mr. Middleman posed was whether we are advancing or retreating in trade and labour relations with the adjoining territories. We are making no adequate progress either in trade or labour relations with the neighbouring countries. Are we increasing or hampering the freedom of movement of the economically active population and their right to choose their occupation? It is quite obvious to anyone listening to the debates in this House that the Government is determined to restrict still further the movement of people in regard to choosing their occupations. The Government is determined on a policy of having two economies, one for the Black areas and another for the White or mixed areas. So we have the pattern developing of unequal pay for equal work. Recently a visiting professor, Prof. Enke, wrote an analytical article on the South African growth, and he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The extraordinary low gross domestic product figure for the reserves becomes plausible if the role of migratory labour is considered. According to informed opinion, between 400,000 and 500,000 migratory labourers are always working outside the reserves. They are excluded from the population of 4,300,000 in the reserves, and they earn from R150,000,000 to R200,000,000 per annum, of which a large amount is remitted to their families. The next problem is to allocate total wage income within the modern sector between European and non-European labour. To the extent that the number of European and non-European workers in this sector increases annually by about the same proportion, which seems to be roughly the case (unless a long period is considered), it is not essential to distinguish these two groups as two different factors of production. However, because of job reservation and unequal pay for equal work, it seems realistic not to combine these two labour forces. Given the sorts of jobs each group holds, there is considerable difference in their productivity, both in an average and marginal sense.</block>

<p>Here we have the fact that there is a grave risk in having these two economies. Not only are we paying different rates of pay for the same work, but that also tends to increase the cost structure, because by reducing the over-all output and reducing these factories to small units of production, a unit of production in the White area, as contrasted with a unit of production in the Black area, it tends to increase costs in both areas.</p>

<p>We come to the further question posed by the president of Assocom, whether the freedom to invest is being widened or narrowed. There has been no restriction on investment in South Africa, but there is a tendency on the part of the Department of Commerce and Industry to encourage industries to go to border areas as a matter of Government policy and virtually an industrialist coming to this country is put in the position that unless he takes the advice of the Department, after being referred to the I.D.C., it is very doubtful whether he can expect any assistance either administratively or in any other way from the Government. There is a shyness on behalf of new investors to invest easily in this country, because of the implied difficulties they will experience if they do not comply with Government policy.</p>

<p>The greatest threat to the economy is inherent in international policy and inter-racial attitudes, and private investors will postpone their investments in order to wait and see, and as Professor Enke says, this could have catastrophic effects on national income in the absence of suitable and prompt intervention by government and constitutes one reason for restraining partisan influences on some of the very real external dangers and internal difficulties of these times. There is no doubt that the present financial tension is due to the restriction on the repatriation of capital and the Minister is by no means certain that a major capital inflow can be expected. Only a day or two ago Sir George Albu, addressing the annual meeting of the General Mining and Finance Corporation, said that if the various embargoes and controls on the movement of capital from South Africa were to be dispensed with, a very rapid withdrawal of most, if not all of the foreign capital, would result, and he attributed this to the present political situation in the country, and while emphasizing the need to attract fresh capital from overseas for the well-being of South Africa, every effort should be made to make the policies of this country more acceptable to the world at large. He said that this did not mean that the country should pander to the more extravagant and often ill-considered demands, but there should be more reasonable attitude to some of the controversial issues dealing with human relationships which would assist in restoring overseas faith and confidence. The importance of attracting overseas capital was supported by another economist whom the Government have frequently quoted with approval, and it is clear that if the Government expects to attract capital from overseas there will have to be some amendment of its policies.</p>

<p>This economist whom the Government frequently quotes said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Historically the opening up of the new countries of the world by the nations of Western Europe was associated not only with the transfer of capital, but of population, skill, ideas and technical knowledge. To a certain extent these things still go together. Technical progress, in particular, cannot be relied upon to occur automatically, raising real incomes by about 1 per cent a year, in an isolated economy. The only way in which we can seriously hope to keep abreast of advances in Western technology is to attract foreign participation in our industries. If this much is granted, the question arises as to the best way of incorporating it into the formal structure. It seems clear that we should make the rate of technological advance depend in some way on the rate of capital inflow. If we do this, we need make only very mild assumptions about the nature of the relationship to obtain the result that the rate of growth is extremely sensitive to changes in the pace of foreign investment.</block>

<p>To satisfy the curiosity of hon. members, that statement was made recently in an article in the <i>Economic Journal</i> by Mr. Jan de Villiers Graaff, an economist whom hon. members opposite are frequently prepared to quote. If we examine the position in this country over the years, we see to-day that the proportion of the White population is lower than it was in 1910. The White population is now 20.9 per cent of the total population, whereas in 1910 it was 21.4 per cent. Even the recent Reserve Bank statistics disclosed that the position is patchy. The Bulletin of the Reserve Bank published recently shows that the total number of persons employed in manufacturing and construction is lower and that the economic development of the people is not keeping pace with the growth of the population. This trend is seen not only in the Reserve Bank statistics, but in the recent report of the Department of Census and Statistics. We find that there is a pattern developing in this country which is manifesting itself in the present difficulties we have. During the course of the debate we have had members on this side referring to the farming industry and the difficulties experienced by the workers in the towns. It is due to the policy the Government has followed over the years. People have left the rural areas and gone to the towns, and when they come to the towns most of these people get employment either in Government posts, where job reservation is automatic, because they go to White people only, or they have got employment in industry, and I want to deal particularly with those employed in industry. The man in the country leaves it because the farm can no longer support him, and he goes to the towns hoping to find a new way of life there. In some cases men have got work in the Railways or some other Government Department and the womenfolk have found jobs in the factories. When they came to the towns they had no training at all; they were unskilled employees. Over the years they acquired skills, becoming semi-skilled and then fully skilled. We find particular examples of this in the footwear industry and the clothing industry. These people, having obtained this employment, have a new standard of living, a new pattern of life. In many cases they have built their own residences, frequently on the borders of towns, because they want to have a patch of ground where they could bring up their children, where they could have their own garden and their own fowls and a little bit of stock. They have altered their whole pattern of life; they have given up the idea of ever being farmers again because they find that the land cannot support them and they have gone to the towns. And what has happened now? The Government in pursuance of its policy of border industry development <span class="col_8681-8682" refersTo="page_1587"/>have now established industries on the borders, and to-day in our large cities people who formerly worked in our clothing and our footwear factories are out of work or have to make a fresh start late in life because of the change of Government policy, and now we have this position namely untrained, unskilled non-Europeans brought into industry and being paid a wage much lower than that being paid in the European factories. We have virtually two economies and two standards of living, and we find uncertainty in the minds of these Europeans who have to change their whole way of life. They cannot go back to the farms. At this time of life they cannot start a new type of work, with the result that they drift into caretakers&#x2019; jobs or take jobs in the commercial and distributive trade. Having had ten or 15 years&#x2019; experience in industry and having acquired a particular skill and become useful members of society, they now come to various Members of Parliament on the Government side and on this side and say &#x201C;The factory in which we were formerly working has closed down; please, can you find us a job in some Government Department to give us some kind of security?&#x201D; Their whole pattern of life has been changed and the tragedy of it is that it costs money to train a worker in industry. The experience, the training, of these people extending over ten to 15 years is discarded. Those people can no longer go back to that particular kind of work; they have to make a fresh start in life, and all this adds to the cost structure of the country. We are moving these factories to the borders of the reserves; we are working with a new type of employee and we have already found that the standard of work there is not as high. We also find that the labour turnover in these border factories is far greater than in the old factories where these people formerly worked. I have met people who have done a foreman&#x2019;s job in some of these clothing factories in Johannesburg who have transferred to one of these border industries. They have been amazed at the speed with which these people have acquired these new skills, but they have found that they lack the ability to concentrate for any lengthy period, and they have also found that they are much more inclined to demand new terms and conditions and to go on strike for trivial matters and that they are much more difficult people to control. I know of foremen who have said: &#x201C;I would far sooner go back to Fordsburg and deal with all the people I had to deal with then at a higher rate of wages; they are people who co-operated better and people with whom I could get on and associate with.&#x201D; New difficulties are arising not as a matter of natural evolution but as the result of determined Government policy to alter the whole pattern of this country. Is it surprising that we find a hesitancy on the part of people to invest, that we find a hesitancy on the part of the worker himself to invest in his future? What is taking place is that the worker who formerly lived in the town and who knows that his labour is on short time or out of employment as the result of the fact that the factory has moved elsewhere, leaves his savings in the savings bank. It is all very well gloating about the high savings, but this man does not invest in a new house. Our young people who should be building their own homes are not doing so. Sir, we are a country of home-builders, or we were in the old days. We were proud of having built our own houses and our own homes. We were proud to put down a deposit and then look forward to the years when we could pay off the purchase price. We were proud to ensure that our children had a future and eventually a house in our old age. What is taking place to-day is that more and more our young people are living in flats. They are not taking the risk of building homes because they have seen their neighbours thrown out of work or put on short time, and so the vicious circle continues. As the result of their being on short time, as the result of unemployment and uncertainty, they too are not investing in buildings, and because they are not investing in buildings, the building workers are unemployed, and, with the building workers unemployed, the building workers&#x2019; assistants, the Africans, who have acquired skill in the building industry, are out of work, and when they have no employment they are endorsed out of town and, once that happens, they have little hope of coming back again. When the builder gets new contracts he has to start with new, raw labour, which is classified in the building industry as unskilled labour, but which is not unskilled. A good building boy, who has worked five, ten or 15 years in the building industry, while he may be classified as unskilled, has acquired a very real skill, and can contribute to an amazing degree to the lowering of costs and to the efficiency of the job. This whole pattern runs right throughout the South African economy. The hon. members for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) and Maitland (Mr. Hickman) have referred to the difficulties of the ordinary man. The policy of the Government, the way in which it has disrupted the whole of the economy is accentuating these difficulties, and we must expect these difficulties to continue until such time as the industrialists believe that they can look forward to ten, 15 or 20 years of certainty, and until there is certainty in the mind of the ordinary worker that his factory is not likely to close down, that he has a future to look forward to. While hon. members on that side may quote the high production of mealies and mealie surpluses, we are faced with the fact that many mealie farmers are experiencing difficulties. While we see big farmers enjoying big profits, we find that the small farmer is going to the wall, and here, in a land of plenty on the one hand, we are finding increased poverty on the other, all due to the uncertainty created by the policy of this Government, a policy which is not planning, but Government bungling. Until such time as we have proper planning, and not so much talk of ideologies, so long will this country continue in the state in which it is to-day.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LUTTIG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has <span class="col_8683-8684" refersTo="page_1588"/>just sat down is the second Opposition speaker on financial matters. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition dealt with the second leg of this aspect and the hon. member who has just sat down enlarged upon it. But I want to say right at the outset, having listened attentively to the hon. member, that his speech was in sharp contrast with the speeches made from that side of the House towards the end of the last session last year when our reserves had reached the record low figure of approximately R142,000,000. What we had from hon. members on that occasion was the greatest pessimism, no faith in this country and no hope for the future. I say that the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down was in sharp contrast with the extreme pessimism revealed by the Opposition last year.</p>

<p>The hon. member jumped from subject to subject in an attempt to reveal weaknesses in our economy, but he was by no means convincing in that attempt. I must, however, reply to one point made by the hon. member before dealing with his other points. I refer to the accusation which he made against this side of the House that if industrialists wish to establish industries in South Africa to-day, they will not get the necessary assistance from the various departments or even from the Industrial Development Corporation unless they are prepared to follow a pattern dictated by the Government, and that is to establish their industries on the borders of the Bantu areas. Where the hon. member gets hold of that is something that passes my comprehension. The Government has never dictated to industrialists where they should establish their industries. It is only certain industries which are selected and which are suitable for the border areas, which are advised to go there. This is typical of the many examples of all sorts of attempts on the part of the Opposition to frighten future investors unnecessarily, without being able to mention a single example where the Government has dictated to the industrialist concerned where he must establish his industries. I think that statement made by the hon. member is a reckless, irresponsible one.</p>

<p>To come back to the second leg of the amendment moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, namely that the tempo of our economic development has slowed down so much that we will not be able to provide opportunities of employment for the normal growth of our population, that is the theme which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition touched upon and which was enlarged upon by the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell). The Leader of the Opposition stated, and the hon. member tried to emphasize it here this afternoon, that the slowing down of the tempo of our development was attributable to the uncertainties in the minds of investors as the result of the policy followed by this Government. The uncertain factors mentioned by them are allegedly the policy of Bantu homelands&#x2014;the Transkeian Territory specifically&#x2014;the uncertainty with regard to the border? of the Bantu homelands and the uncertainty which surrounds these border industries. That is the aspect on which the hon. member for Pinetown in particular concentrated. In addition to that, of course, there is the factor which they also mentioned in the third leg of their amendment, namely the so-called policy of isolation followed by this Government. That is their accusation against us, and I think it is high time we analysed this accusation a little more closely. It is argued that the tempo of development has slowed down to such an extent that we shall not be able to provide the necessary opportunities of employment for the natural growth of our population, and that this is attributable entirely to the uncertainties which arise from the policy of this Government. That was what the Leader of the Opposition stated when he dealt with the second leg of his amendment, a statement which has now been re-affirmed by the hon. member for Pinetown. I want to start by saying that it is true that our gross domestic capital formation declined last year; we accept that. That is clearly borne out also by the Budget which the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced this Session, and we accept that that is so. But let us analyse the position on purely economic grounds to see whether that slowing down in the tempo of development and the decline in the formation of internal capital can be attributed to the uncertainties which, according to hon. members on the other side, flow from the policy of this side of the House. In the first instance it is clear on closer examination that this reduction in internal capital formation is due to a decrease in supplies whereas fixed investments have actually increased. That is my first submission. In the second instance, investments in our secondary industries have increased by R30,000,000 in the past year. I concede, as I have said, that over the past year there has been a decrease in our internal capital formation in comparison with the previous year, but in the industrial sector, the very sphere to which we must look for an acceleration in the tempo of our economic development, we find that there has been an increase of R30,000,000. We should like to see the industrial sector developing more rapidly. That was also stated in the clearest terms by the hon. the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech. But to say that the position has been stagnant or that there has been a general collapse, is not true in the light of the fact that an extra R30,000,000 has been invested in our industrial sector.</p>

<p>In the private sector?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#luttig">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LUTTIG</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in the private sector. In the third instance there is one general fact that we must acknowledge, and that is that industrial expansion takes place step by step; it is not an even, continuous process which would show a gradual rise if drawn on a graph; it is not a continuous, even process; and in this connection authoritative bodies like the Chambers of Commerce themselves declare that we still have unused capacity &#x2019;as the result of the almost too rapid development <span class="col_8685-8686" refersTo="page_1589"/>and expansion that we had in the early &#x2019;fifties and particularly in the late &#x2019;fifties. We still have an unused capacity as a result of this rapid development that we had in the &#x2019;fifties. Surely it stands to reason that until such time as this unused capacity is fully used, there will be no great incentive to embark on further expansion. We believe that we are rapidly reaching the stage where that unused capacity will be fully used and that we are therefore on the threshold of a further economic boom.</p>

<p>In the fourth instance we feel convinced that we are approaching a period of great economic prosperity. In the first instance we read in the daily Press about enormous overseas interest. Four or five weeks ago a whole page in the <i>Sunday Times</i> was devoted to new industries which are going to be established in South Africa. In a sense it was a prospectus showing the economic boom that lies ahead of us in the future. It is significant that a great deal of the capital that is going to be invested in those industries is internal capital, but a considerable portion of it represents foreign capital. The second aspect that we must not lose sight of is this: The latest dividends on our industrial shares in particular provide the clearest proof of confidence in our economy. When we find this boom in our industrial shares in South Africa, I feel that we can justly be proud of the knowledge that there is confidence in our economy, in comparison with what happened a few weeks ago in America, when, as the result of the attempt made by President Kennedy to combat inflation and when he refused to make further concessions in respect of increased steel prices, there was a collapse of industrial shares on Wall Street, and 15,000,000 small shareholders had to sell out.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, now that our reserves have reached these heights&#x2014;this matter was also raised with the Minister of Finance this afternoon by the hon. member for Pinetown&#x2014;great pressure is being brought to bear on the Minister to make some attempt to relax our control measures. The hon. member did not really plead for this in so many words, but from the way in which he put his question one can only draw the inference that he would like to see some relaxation of import control measures. In this respect I want to urge the greatest caution. In the past we always felt, when our reserves stood at approximately R300,000,000, that we had a safe margin. That may have been the position in the past, but we are living in entirely different circumstances, and it is because that is so that it is necessary to bear in mind that the yardsticks of the past cannot always be applied to modern times. It is generally recognized by international authorities to-day that if you want a reasonable safety margin, provision should be made for approximately four to six months&#x2019; imports. That is accepted to-day: I think the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) will agree with this statement. If we accepted the yardstick that we must make provision for four to six months&#x2019; imports, it would mean that our reserves would have to stand at approximately R500,000,000. Our reserves, which at the moment stand at R398,000,000, have by no means reached that level. Under these new circumstances, therefore, hon. members will see how necessary it is to be cautious and not to propagate the premature breaking down of control measures in view of the fact that it is accepted internationally that provision should be made for four to six months&#x2019; imports. Furthermore, in connection with this same subject, we must not forget that we have certain foreign obligations to meet in the next few years. In 1963 we have obligations to meet amounting to R62,000,000 and in 1964 we have obligations to meet amounting to R72,000,000. I mention these few points only to show that we are dealing here with a matter that has to be approached with the utmost caution if we want to keep our economy sound and if we do not want to gamble with our financial future. These loans that I have mentioned, which have to be met in 1963 and 1964, may possibly be renewed, but I think it is much wiser to make provision for every contingency. Then I just want to say this in connection with another aspect of the reluctance that we see on the part of investors and which hon. members of the United Party lightly ascribe to uncertainties created by the policy of this Government; we still have many investors in South Africa who until recently have not realized that the winds of change which swept throughout the world also affected South Africa and that of necessity they must adapt themselves to the changed circumstances. There was a time when investors, generally speaking, always adopted this attitude, &#x201C;Let us first see what happens overseas and then trim our sails accordingly.&#x201D; During this Session the hon. the Minister of Finance has come along with a Budget which will give a tremendous impetus to our economy. He has set an example to the private sector by making the necessary investments in our economy, and I believe that it is essential at this stage in particular that the investor should no longer ask himself what is going to happen overseas but that he should show the necessary confidence in the economy of our country and actively proceed to make the necessary investments. I think there are signs on our economic horizon that this aspect is receiving much more attention from investors than it did in the past. It was announced by the Government recently that the State was going to invest a sum of nearly R2,500,000,000 in new projects and projects which are to be commenced in the course of this year, which will be of enormous benefit to the private sector and the effect of which we will only see in our economy in the years that lie ahead of us. What is important is that here we are dealing with a psychological problem more than anything else&#x2014;not with uncertainties which, according to hon. members on that side, flow from Government policy, but with excessive caution on the part of the investor who is inclined to watch circumstances overseas and to forget that the safest form of investment of his capital and the best security for his own <span class="col_8687-8688" refersTo="page_1590"/>capital is to stimulate our economy at this stage by making the necessary investments. I believe that that is a problem which will still be solved in the course of this year. We have the fullest confidence that it will be solved, and that confidence is borne out by the fact that our industrialists in South Africa have become export conscious. As the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs announced in the Press only yesterday again, this has been stimulated, of course, by the fact that there is greater interest overseas in our economy, but it is most certainly also true that the period of recession that we had in South Africa is something of the past.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you saw yourself that when prices on all the share markets of the world dropped, the Johannesburg share market was the only market where price levels were maintained. If that is not clear proof of faith in our country, then I do not know what one could regard as proof of that fact, because we can always accept the share market as the barometer of the soundness of the economy of the country. Sir, these are not my words; they are the words used by the President of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange when he gave his address last Sunday evening about the position of the Stock Exchange. Another reason why I am so optimistic is this: We in South Africa are producing two-thirds of the gold of the free world. Does that fact in itself not justify our optimism? Our coal reserves of 75 billion tons constitute one-third of the total reserves of the Southern Hemisphere. We can meet our foreign obligations with only eight months&#x2019; production of gold. Furthermore, we are very rapidly becoming the workshop of Africa with our unlimited supplies of iron ore, coal, manganese and chrome. And as far as the development of this important sector of our private economy is concerned, that is to say, our industries, we have the authoritative opinion of a writer who is not unknown to this House, Dr. A. J. Norval, in a book which he wrote recently, &#x201C;A Quarter of a Century of Industrial Progress in South Africa.&#x201D; On page 111 he predicts a very, very bright future for our industries. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The development of manufacturing industries in South Africa should thus in future be able to obtain all the financial resources necessary for their development along sound lines.</block> <p>Here we have an absolutely unprejudiced opinion and the views of an authoritative person&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No sound project should experience any difficulty in obtaining the necessary financial means for its exploitation. This is a great step forward in the expansion of the country&#x2019;s economy. The fact that South Africa is now in a position not only to provide the greater part of its capital requirements for industry, but that it is institutionally well organized to do so, should go a long way in attracting capital from abroad.</block>

<p>He concludes his chapter on industrial development in South Africa over the past 25 years on this very optimistic note. I should very much like to recommend this book to hon. members of the Opposition. It may make them more optimistic about our economy and, secondly, give them more confidence in their own country&#x2019;s economy. In spite of this justifiable optimism we find one discordant note, however; I might almost say that we find one thistle in this rose garden of optimism, and that is the attempt that is continually made by the United Party to sow distrust in our economy. I have before me a copy of the <i>Weekblad</i>, which is known to most hon. members. It is the official mouthpiece of the United Party. I think this is last week&#x2019;s edition. On the front page we find these banner headlines: &#x201C;Shock awaits South Africa: United Party&#x2019;s warning was definitely not in vain.&#x201D; I saw this placard as I was walking down the street and for the first time in my life I invested 5c in the wisdom to be gleaned from this United Party publication. And on the front page we find this remarkable statement by the economic correspondent of the United Party&#x2019;s mouthpiece&#x2014;</p>

<p>We have never said that we will have no problems if Britain joins the Common Market. Just two weeks ago, on the Vote of the Minister of Economic Affairs, we had a debate here on this particular aspect, and here is the interpretation of the economic correspondent of the <i>Weekblad</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Government leaders are increasingly concerned and this week the Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. Diederichs, is flying to Europe to see how a great loss can be recouped. A great shock possibly awaits South Africa.</block>

<p>I think it will be advisable to get a little more information first about the precise conditions on which Britain will join the Economic Market before we predict shocks for our economy. I say that notwithstanding the fact that we have great cause for optimism, the United Party adopts this attitude. In the debate which has taken place so far&#x2014;and let us compare this with the jeremiads, the pessimistic prophecies, that we had last year towards the end of the session&#x2014;the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) has had to jump about from one subject to another this year in an attempt to scrape together a few arguments to show that the tempo of our economic development has slowed down to such an extent that we are facing the greatest unemployment. I say that <span class="col_8689-8690" refersTo="page_1591"/>the United Party would have been well advised to wait until we knew definitely on what conditions Britain is going to join the Common Market. I believe too that once that has happened our relationship with the Federation will be much clearer, because there is another aspect about which the United Party is terribly concerned, and that is what the outcome is going to be if Britain joins the Common Market and the Federation then becomes an associate member of the Common Market. I do not want to make any prophecies, but I think it is necessary that we should mention the basic facts in connection with this matter in this House. There is a possibility that if the Federation joins, it will be as an associate member. I saw in the Press recently that the Federal Government was considering the possibility of such a step. This can be done in terms of Article 131 of the Treaty of Rome. That will mean that Britain will have to share with the other countries of the Common Market the preferences that she enjoys in respect of the Federation. In those circumstances it is possible that the Federation will make use of this opportunity to increase the Federation&#x2019;s import tariffs so as to give protection to her domestic industries. How would such a development affect us? Our existing trade agreement with the Federation falls outside the scope of the imperial preference system, and that is a very important fact to bear in mind. The mutual trade relationship between ourselves and the Federation need not be affected at all therefore by the Federation&#x2019;s association with the Common Market. The Federation is not bound, in her own external trade policy, by the Common Market&#x2019;s import tariffs which are determined by the Common Market for full members. Everything will depend on what the Federation itself decides to do. In these circumstances it is my considered opinion that the Federation will buy in the market where it is able to buy most cheaply, and it will be our task to see that our industries are placed on such a competitive basis that we shall be able to meet those problems. I mention these facts because we have been hearing wild rumours lately about the terrible disaster that will overtake our growing economy if in the first place Britain joins the Common Market and, in the second place, if the Federation becomes an associate member of the Common Market. Well, we have sufficient reason to meet these problems coolly and calmly, and with our very capable Minister of Economic Affairs attending the Common Market discussions, we have the fullest confidence that the interests of this country will be well looked after. There is one further fact that I might mention in this connection. We must not lose sight of the fact that the Republic constitutes a very great market for the Common Market countries.</p>

<p>As I have already said, in the financial and in the political sphere, as well as in the international political sphere, we are concluding this Session, in contrast with last year, on a note of optimism. Underlying that optimism is the knowledge that this country&#x2019;s economy is basically sound, that our country is blessed with a population which has the necessary perseverance, the necessary will to survive here and to develop the whole of this country&#x2019;s potential in every sphere, irrespective of the dangers that threaten us. Far be it from me to minimize these dangers, but I have full confidence in the spirit and in the perseverance of the population of the Republic</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig) started, I thought he was going to disprove what has been advanced on this side, particularly by the previous speaker, that our economy in recent years simply has not provided sufficient jobs for our rapidly increasing population that is in fact he said he would disprove. The simplest way of disproving that, would be to point to official figures of employment, to show that we are talking nonsense on this side. But how did the hon. member set about it? He set about quoting how our reserves have increased, and how share prices have gone up. Mr. Speaker, it is a clear coincidence that just this morning I happened to read a little sentence in a publication which I think describes very aptly the type of argument that this hon. member put up. It is published in an economic journal and says &#x201C;as the medieval metaphysicians showed, an arm-chair statistician can prove anything, and economic theories are most rewarding in this respect&#x201D;. I think that was the type of argument the hon. member put up. He advanced a whole lot of theories which probably quite satisfy him, but he never got to the fact of the matter. I will tell him now why we say that the economy in the last four years particularly has simply not provided sufficient employment for our rapidly increasing population. The hon. member must be aware that our population is increasing at the rate of about 2 per cent a year, and so one must assume that one&#x2019;s labour force increases by two per cent a year, and that one must provide extra jobs every year for an extra 2 per cent of people. In other words, over a period of four years, if we have consistent development and balanced development in respect of all industries and all economic sections of the community, they should have provided 8 per cent extra jobs compared to four years ago. Now what are the facts on the official figures that have been published? These are not assumptions, these are official statistics of employment, published by this Government, as far as they are available. Now we find for instance that in the <i>Monthly Bulletin of Statistics</i> for April 1962, they point out that as far as total employment is concerned, that whereas total employment in 1956-7 was 111.9, in December 1961 it was 113.9, in other words it had gone up 2 per cent instead of 8 per cent. So total employment over that whole period only increased by 2 per cent. It is even more interesting if we see where that increase took place. The hon. member for Mayfair will agree with me that if we really want to raise our standard of living rapidly, the one sector <span class="col_8691-8692" refersTo="page_1592"/>of our economy that should develop rapidly is industry, because industry pays the best wages. Let us have a look at what is happening to our manufacturing industry. Everyone is agreed that in the long run the welfare of our society will primarily depend on the rapid development of industry. What do we find in respect of the manufacturing industry? That whereas in 1956-7 (four years ago) the index was 114.2, in December of 1961 it was 113.4. Stagnation in the manufacturing industry as far as employment is concerned! Let us have a look at mining. That is the one industry that has had a fair development. If you look at the figures for all races in mining, you find that it increased from 108.3 to 119.6. But we know that the great bulk of that labour is foreign Natives who come from outside, because for some reason which hon. members probably know more about, our Native population is not keen to work in the mining industry. But if you look at White employment in the mining industry, you also find that it increased from 107.8 to 109.5. If you look at &#x201C;construction&#x201D;, you find that there is an alarming drop of employment from 110 to 99.5. In transport and communication there was a drop from 114.9 to 108.3. That is the type of argument the hon. member must use and not the argument that because our reserves are going up and our share prices are going up, therefore there cannot be any unemployment in this country. I think he has totally failed to prove that what we are saying on this side is not absolutely true, namely that our economy in the last four years has simply not generated enough jobs for our rapidly increasing population&#x2014;not for any intrinsic reason, because inherently we have one of the strongest economies in the world. We entirely agree with the Government on that aspect, but unfortunately we have not one of the strongest governments.</p>

<p>The other point the hon. member touched on was that he said that he would like to see our reserves go up to R500,000,000.</p>

We know that a year, even six months ago, and even three months ago, their general attitude was that the Common Market would not affect South Africa at all and that it would not affect our South African trade. I think one can put it in a nutshell by saying what the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs now said overseas, &#x201C;Provided you treat it as if we are still in the Commonwealth you won&#x2019;t run a risk&#x201D;. My point is that if we had remained in the Commonwealth, this risk would not have existed.</p>

<p>That is what I say: The uncertainty in an uncertain world has been made far more uncertain by the policy of withdrawing from the Commonwealth. It is one of the penalties we are beginning to pay for having left the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Mr.Speaker, in a recent publication I see that the Prime Minister said (Fact Paper No. 98)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ultimately racial peace in South Africa and our survival will depend on whether we are able to make our country prosperous.</block>

<p>I think that we, on this side, have always adopted that attitude that our difficult racial problems could be solved far more easily in a context of prosperity, and the Government, on the other side, must ask themselves whether their policy is leading to this desired state of affairs or not. We have already pointed out how, in the last four years at least, our economy has not been generating sufficient employment, and we could not possibly have had full employment. I know hon. members on the other side will come and say: &#x201C;Look at our official figures of unemployment.&#x201D; They are just misleading themselves if they attach too much importance to our figures of unemployment. What are our figures of unemployment? Our figures of unemployment simply reflect registered unemployment, all the unemployed people who go and register at the unemployment exchanges. We know that it excludes the Bantu population, we know that it only registers a fraction of the unemployment amongst Coloured and Indians, and we know that even, as far as the Whites are concerned, there are large numbers of unemployed who are not registered, and therefore are simply ignored by the Government when they pretend that we have not got a problem of unemployment at the moment. Mr. Speaker, and then they make international comparisons, and probably we will get them again here, and compare our figures, for instance, with the unemployment figures in the United States of America. But hon. members on the other side should realize that the figure in the United States of America is a real unemployment figure; they have sample surveys of the population every month, and they register every <span class="col_8693-8694" refersTo="page_1593"/>person who is unemployed, whether he draws unemployment benefits or not, and whether he is registered as unemployed or not, and if the American figure of unemployment is 5 per cent, it has been calculated, for instance, that that is probably equivalent to an official English figure of 2 per cent, because the English, like us, only register those persons who are on the unemployment register. And the difference is this: that a far larger percentage of English workers do register because of the extensive unemployment benefits they get. So, in making these international comparisons, the Minister is misleading himself if he attaches too much importance to those official unemployment figures. Until he makes an actual sample survey of what the real position is, he cannot attach too much importance to those figures. As I have said, we agree wholeheartedly with the hon. the Prime Minister that our survival and racial peace ultimately will depend on whether we can make this country prosperous</p>

<p>As some indication, but you cannot accept it as an absolute measure. The figure shows a tremendous increase in unemployment, but surely the figures the hon. the Minister should look at are not the figures of unemployment, but of employment. In any event, inherently South Africa has one of the strongest economies in the world, and, given good government and given good administration, there is no reason at all why we should not prosper; in fact, why we should not be one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and why our economic growth should not be one of the fastest in the world. As hon. members have pointed out, we have already reached a high degree of economic development, we are saving a large percentage of our income for investment, and we can compare in that respect with any country in the Western world, and, on top of that, South Africa has certain special advantages, some of which were mentioned by the hon. member for Mayfair. For instance, we produce two-thirds of the gold in the world, a commodity that always has a sale whether there is a depression or a boom. We might not always be satisfied with the price, but at least we have an insatiable market for it. In addition to that, our exports are amongst the strongest in the world, in the sense that, just like gold, if you take many of our exports there are very few impediments or restrictions in respect of any market in the world. That is why the Common Market will not affect us as much as it might other countries, for the fact that we are basically a strong exporting country. The Minister must also realize that gold production and exports are strong stimulators of the economic growth of any country; they have a multiplying effect on the national income. The Minister knows that. Now let us see what has happened since this Government came into power, how these two special factors that operate, and that should make South Africa grow more rapidly than almost any other country in the world, have developed over the past 14 years. If you look at the gold production, you find that, between 1948 and the present, the volume of production has doubled and the value has trebled. That has had a tremendously stimulating effect on our economy. We find that our exports, and in particular gold production, during the last few years have risen very considerably, but we have had a very poor performance as far as creating employment opportunities are concerned. The production of gold has, in fact, increased from R425,000,000 in 1957 to approximately R600,000,000 this year, an increase of nearly 40 per cent, which should have had a most stimulating effect on our whole economy. Our exports, other than gold, have, over the past 14 years, almost trebled. I therefore say that no Government in the whole history of South Africa has governed in such a fortunate economic climate as this Government had. If we had had a good Government, we should have been one of the most prosperous countries in the world.</p>

<p>Sir, it has no relevance to their policies, whereas out flowing capital has relevance to their policies. That is the simple point we make.</p>

<p>What is the performance of our economy as compared with other Western countries in countries <span class="col_8695-8696" refersTo="page_1594"/>in the in the world? Whenever one raises this question as to how fast we are growing compared with other countries in the world, the Minister always comes back and compares us with the slowest growing countries in the Western world. He always comes back and says: &#x201C;Well, at least we are doing as well as New Zealand, Australia and Canada.&#x201D; But those three countries themselves admit that they are growing much too slowly to-day. But the hon. the Minister never makes a comparison with the rest of the world. Even an old country like the United Kingdom, which is supposed to be one of the laggards to-day as far as economic growth is concerned, has a more rapidly growing economy than South Africa. The hon. the Minister need only look at the survey by the Stellenbosch Institute, and here he will find that it is so in respect of the last eight or nine years, and, if he compares us with other Commonwealth countries, he will find that many countries without these special factors which stimulate our economy are growing two and three times as fast as South Africa, and that applies especially too in respect of old countries in the Common Market. It is a very difficult matter to establish, but I think most economists to-day admit that the communist countries are growing at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent a year, which is two to three times as rapidly as we are growing.</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>I started my speech, which was interrupted by the dinner adjournment, off by quoting with approval the statement of the Prime Minister that racial peace and our very survival in this country depend upon whether we can become a prosperous society and how fast we can reach that stage. The question, therefore, which I should like to analyse now is how fast we have, in fact, prospered under this Government. The official national income figures show in theory that the real income per head, i.e. the rate at which the standard of living has been increased in the past decade, is in the order of about 1&#x00BD; per cent. I have already pointed out that that places us amongst the slowest growers in the Western world. Ours is in fact only one-half or one-third of the rate at which other Western countries are advancing.</p>

<p>The Minister should know that the United States is one of the slowest growers in the world. They are, in fact, very worried about it because they feel they are losing the race against Communism. Their intention is, consequently, to double the rate.</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>I have quoted that already and the conclusion one must arrive at is that we are amongst the slowest growers in the Western world. The great United States itself is, despite its wealth, worried about its slow rate of growth.</p>

<p>But this is a very abstract calculation. It could only be applied to the mass of the people whom we want to make more prosperous if the benefit of this economic growth which we, undoubtedly, have had are fairly and equitably spread. The question, however, is whether it has been fairly and equitably spread? Have the great masses of our non-European peoples as well as many of our Whites benefited equally from this? The hon. member for Umhlatuzana has quoted figures to show that there is not the slightest doubt that non-White wages should be increased. Also the Prime Minister pointed out in a recent statement the desirability and necessity for an increase in the wages of non-Whites and that this was emphasized by studies made of the average incomes of non-White families in Johannesburg, Durban and Pretoria. &#x201C;Whilst certain findings of these family studies might be criticized it can hardly be denied that they have revealed extreme poverty towards which neither the employer nor the Government can adopt an attitude of indifference.&#x201D; This according to the statement of the Prime Minister. So I do not think I am wrong if I say that the great bulk of our non-White population, as also the hon. member for Umhlatuzana showed earlier on, is living at subsistence levels in this country at the moment. The question is whether their standard of living has increased? It is no use having an abstract figure if the masses do not share in that increase in welfare.</p>

<p>I admit it is awfully hard to decide whether the welfare of the masses as well as their standard of living is increasing rapidly in this country or not. I suggest, however, that there are indirect, though real, tests to show whether our welfare is really increasing at a sufficiently rapid rate. As regards our prospects in this country, I have already said that we are all agreed that inherently this country has great capacity for economic growth. I do not want to retrace all the arguments to this effect. One of the things which every one in this House knows, is that when the income of the poorer classes increase, it is usually manifested in an increase of their consumption of food. Every one is, I think, agreed on that. If, however, any further proof is required thereof, I can refer to a survey which has recently been conducted by the University of South Africa and which shows that families living at a subsistence level spend R2.3 of every R10 by which their salaries are increased per month, on food. In addition, something like 90c are spent on clothing. It is a widely recognized fact that as the income of the poorer classes increases, so they spend more on food and clothing.</p>

<p>On this basis, i.e. if the standards of living of the masses in South Africa have risen lately, one must expect that the consumption of food <span class="col_8697-8698" refersTo="page_1595"/>will have increased as well. It is most alarming, therefore, to read in a publication, i.e. <i>Agrekon</i> of January 1962, of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing what the Secretary of that Department writes on &#x201C;Moeilike markte en surplusse&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Binnelandse verbruik van die meeste land-bouprodukte het &#x2019;n gestadige per-kop-toe-name getoon vanaf die begin van die Eerste Wereldoorlog tot ongeveer 1952-3.

<p>The Minister is anticipating my speech because I will come to that in a moment. Every one in this House is agreed on the fact that we have a tremendous capacity for rapid growth and, consequently, for standards of living to rise rapidly as well. It has been advanced as one of the essential requirements if we are to maintain racial peace and ensure the survival of Western civilization. But is it then not alarming that for the first time since 1941 the consumption of food has remained constant during 1952-3?</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister wants to sidetrack me because that is not relevant at this stage. Surely the position is that if the standards of living of the impoverished masses in South Africa are rising, they should consume more food per capita? I have already referred to the study &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>You said only 23 per cent was being spent on food. Where does the 77 per cent go?</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; by the University of South Africa showing that a large proportion of any increase in their income are spent by the masses on food. The Minister is assuming that there has been an increase in the standards of living of the masses. My point is that there has not been an increase. There has been maldistribution, however, because the increase in the national income has not been spread evenly. That is the only conclusion one can come to.</p>

<p>But it is not only the fact that the food consumption of the poorer people is not rising which is causing alarm. It is also the direct cause of the position in which the agricultural industry finds itself to-day. Production in the world is booming and while that should also be the case in South Africa, we find that the Government has to cut prices to farmers and that despite the fact that costs of production have increased! The condition in which the farming industry finds itself to-day is directly attributable to the fact that the standards of living of the masses are not increasing rapidly. And it is not only a static food consumption which points to that. Let the Minister look at the official figures of retail sales in this country. He will then find that between 1957 and 1961, the value of retail sales has increased by 3 per cent whereas retail prices has increased by 9 per cent. This also points to a static position as far as consumption is concerned. But what is more, it is this static condition which has led to creation of surpluses not only in our agricultural industry but also in the industrial sector. Industrialists are, generally, agreed that we probably have a 20 per cent over capacity in our industries. Consumption has simply not kept pace with the production of agricultural and industrial products. Now the Minister asks whether I blame the Government for that. Of course I do! In every well-regulated society, it is the prime function of government to see that if there is an increase in national income that income is spread evenly amongst all sections of the people. That has, obviously, not been done in South Africa, unless all these official figures are wrong.</p>

<p>And there are many reasons why the Government can be blamed for this state of affairs; time compels me to deal with only three of them. But that will be sufficient to prove that it is the result of this Government&#x2019;s policy that South Africa is not growing as rapidly as it should and as its inherent capacities demand and that the standards of living of the masses are not increasing rapidly. It is due, in the first place, to the racial policies of this Government. I am not going to spend much time on this because it has been argued over and over again in this House. It is amazing that these racial policies which hon. members on the other side claim are to maintain Western civilization in South Africa, are rejected by the whole of the Western world. They are only supported by hon. members on the other side. [Interjections.] It is no use hon. members on the other side telling me that that is only my opinion and not theirs. They must also take into account what the opinion is of the businessman who makes the investment and thereby creates rapid economic development. Hon. members know. <span class="col_8699-8700" refersTo="page_1596"/>surely, that the greater bulk of businessmen in this country are not communists? They believe the policy of the Prime Minister and of this Government in respect of racial affairs to be utterly impracticable and futile. It is not believed by them that these policies are going to solve any of our problems. But I should like to read a quotation from the <i>Economic Review</i> of the Republic of South Africa issued by the Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd. This is a publication which the hon. the Minister knows is being distributed amongst many important industrialists in England and all over the world. In this publication the racial policies of this Government is discussed. After having stated the viewpoint of the Nationalist Party in regard to separate development quite fairly it goes on to deal with the weaknesses of that policy. These people cannot be said to have any political interest in South Africa. They could not care less who governs in South Africa as long as their investments are safe. This is what they have to say about this Government&#x2019;s policies on racial affairs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Almost everybody outside the Nationalist Party considers this policy a fantasy. The reasons why they do so are important, for they are also the reasons for the general lack of confidence in South Africa&#x2019;s future. The area covered by the proposed Bantustans is 13 per cent of the land surface of South Africa. It is agricultural and desert land. The Tomlinson Commission stated that the area might be able to support a population of 4,000,000 Africans: the total African population is now 11,500,000. This means that the majority of the Africans would be living in White areas and, prosperous or not, they would undoubtedly expect to enjoy the same rights as their fellows in the Bantustans or the Whites around them. The problem would therefore be unchanged, and possibly aggravated, for the concessions made in the Bantustans would sharpen the African appetite for more concessions. In addition the cost of setting up the Bantustans will be enormous&#x2014;R114,000,000 is to be spent on them over the next five years&#x2014;and even if such expenditure is in fact forthcoming, the areas are so poor that they will never be more than cheap labour reserves. Whites are forbidden to start enterprises for profit within the Bantustans and instead industry is to be encouraged in the perimeters, making the reserves a workers dormitory. The whole theory has been evolved by Whites and at no stage is it proposed that the African people shall be asked for their approval. The Government is, therefore, embarking on a scheme which will involve a major rearrangement of the economy at great expense and which cannot provide any answer to the problems which it is designed to solve. So far from being stifled by separate development, the flames of African nationalism are likely to be fed by it.</block>

<p>The Minister of Finance is, at any rate responsible for the more direct financial and budgetary policies of the country since he has become Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>I should like to suggest another reason why consumption has lagged so far behind&#x2014;as a matter of fact to such an extent that it has become an encumbrance of our economic development. This other reason lies with the Ministers budgetary policies in terms of which he has allowed the people to be consistently overtaxed to the extent of hundreds of millions of rand. The Minister has apparently not grasped the point that the condition of static consumption, <i>inter alia</i>, is holding back economic growth. The Minister seems to think that there is something virtuous about a balanced budget and more so with a surplus. But that is an old fashioned idea. If you have over capacity in agriculture and industry like there is in this country at the moment, there is no virtue in a balanced Budget or in a surplus. In this connection. I should like to recommend that the Minister should, before introducing his next Budget, read a very interesting article in the Economist of 19 May, page 690, under the heading &#x201C;deficits pay&#x201D;. In this article the very slow growth of the United States is compared with the Common Market countries and points to the fetish which is in vogue in America of being able to submit a balanced Budget, or better still, to show a surplus. That is compared with the approach in the Common Market countries and in this way the writer comes to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the one big reason for continental Europe&#x2019;s success story is the way government policy has affected total demand. By avoiding surpluses in their Budgets by means of rapid rises in spending and occasional cuts in taxes, by keeping the supply <span class="col_8701-8702" refersTo="page_1597"/>of money expanding constantly, European governments have given Keynes in heaven (or at least in purgatory) the satisfaction of having been right. They have shown that a fiscal and monetary policy aimed, above all things, at high demand&#x2014;when necessary created through bigger budgetary deficits and never curtailed by surpluses&#x2014;is the way to make an advanced economy work well.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) has once again played his old role of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde here. When he attends a meeting of the board of directors of the Netherlands Bank, then he tells an entirely different story from the one that he told here this evening. I have here a little pamphlet issued by the bank, namely the economic bulletin of the bank for April of this year. This bulletin deals with the same Budget as the one which the hon. member talked about this evening. But whereas he alleges that the Minister&#x2019;s budgetary policy is responsible for all the misery that he sees&#x2014;I say it is a figment of his imagination&#x2014;the bulletin concerned had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Budget introduced in Parliament on 21 March by the Minister of Finance, bears the stamp of South Africa&#x2019;s strong financial position. In spite of increased expenditure, mainly for Defence purposes, no appreciable tax increases were proposed, nor was it necessary for the Minister to resort to the expedient of budgeting for a deficit &#x2026;There is no doubt that the net effect of this year&#x2019;s Budget will be expansionist without jeopardizing the monetary balance.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes must please stop coming along with his Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde stories.</p>

<p>He, and other members on his side, talked about our policy with reference to border industries which they allege will produce no results. But let me say this: Sir, the Rosslyn border area was only proclaimed the other day, but already there are 25 undertakings which are prepared to start there. Does the hon. member know that at Hammersdale there are already four textile factories operating in that border area? Does he know that others are still coming? Does he know that the I.D.C. is erecting a big building at Rosslyn, entirely for industrial purposes? In many respects the hon. member does not know what he is talking about.</p>

<p>Apart from this point, he also dealt with other points, the last of which is the racial policy of the National Party Government. He says that the reason why we are faring badly is to be found in our racial policy. I have said before, and other members have also said, that the National Party is not going to depart from its racial policy. We would rather struggle economically than abandon our racial policy. In that way we are maintaining White civilization in South Africa. I deny, however, that our policy in this connection affects this country adversely in the economic sphere. It is true that there have been temporary, minor setbacks as the result of distortions of our real attitude. This had its effect overseas particularly and prejudiced us temporarily. That position is coming to an end, however. The hon. member says that the commercial people are not communists, but look how they criticize the policy of this Government! In this connection he quoted the opinions of a certain person. I had an interview the other day with a few of the executive members of the Chamber of Industries and the Chamber of Commerce. Sir, do you know what attitude they adopted? Their attitude was that there was no permanent future for the Whites in South Africa and that we must therefore follow a policy which in the next 25 years &#x2026;[Interjection.] I shall be glad if the hon. member for Jeppes will listen to me. We all listened to him very courteously and we expect him to do the same thing. That is an old dodge of his. Hon. members opposite sit there chatting, highly pleased with their own ignorance! In any event, the businessmen to whom I have referred here say that the best thing for South Africa to do would be to see how much money we can make in the next 25 years so that if it looks at that stage as though we have to clear out of this country, we shall have sufficient money to be able to go and live in some other country on our interest. That is the only inference that one can draw from the policy of the United Party, and that is why I say that they support that sort of attitude when they come along here and say that our racial policy is responsible for our economic position.</p>

<p>Another point that the hon. member raised was that the standard of living of the lowly-paid, particularly that of the non-Whites, was too low. He says that that is borne out by the fact that there has been no increase in the consumption of food. Sir, I replied to this very same argument just the other day when the Vote of the Minister of Economic Affairs was under discussion here, but the hon. member again comes along and says that since 1952 there has been no increase in the consumption of food. Is the true position not, however, that since 1952 there has no longer been underfeeding in South Africa? If there is no underfeeding, why then should people eat more?</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>No. I have not. I would urge the hon. member to go and look at the sort of clothing worn by the non-White workers to-day in comparison with 10 years ago. Whereas in those days their <span class="col_8703-8704" refersTo="page_1598"/>cinemas had to close down because of lack of support, nowadays they remain open the whole day and there are always queues waiting outside. Go to any place of amusement for the non-Whites and you will see that to-day they have many more supporters than they did previously. Let the hon. member tell this House where the money comes from in deposit-receiving institutions, whose deposits over the past ten years have increased fourfold. Four times as much money is being invested annually in savings accounts to-day as 10 years ago. Where do those savings come from? Instead of listening the hon. member for Jeppes is beginning to converse again. I want him to reply to these questions. I put these questions to him in the previous debate. Apparently he will never dare to reply to them.</p>

<p>I have here the figures with reference to the funds of building societies. I do not propose to weary the House by quoting figures, but the hon. member for Jeppes did so and I must reply to him. Deposit-receiving institutions such as building societies, trust banks, the post office savings bank, etc., show an investment tempo equivalent to nearly 20 per cent of our national income. No other country in the world can make this proud boast. I have already said that in recent years we have no longer had underfeeding amongst our population, hence the static consumption of food. But let us assume that increased salaries for these people would be justified; why then does the hon. member say that to the Government and not to the employers concerned? Every year at conferences of the Chamber of Commerce we hear this story that the non-Whites are being paid too little and the allegation is made that it will promote business if the non-Whites are paid more. But to-day hon. members opposite come along and put forward pleas from which one can only draw the inference that those employers cannot pay their non-White workers more unless the Government so decides! Surely that is nonsense. After all, the wages which are fixed are minimum wages, not maximum wages, and employers are free to increase those minimum wages. One of these people told me that he was surreptitiously paying his workers a bonus with the result that he attracts the best non-White labour. Let the other employers do the same thing; then they will retain the services of their good workers. But they want to make the Government responsible for this. They say that the Government should increase minimum wages, and if there is any trouble, then they blame the Government for it.</p>

<p>Another point which the hon. member made his main theme was that opportunities of employment have only increased by 2 per cent over the past four years while the number of work-seekers has increased by 8 per cent. Of course, the great mistake that the hon. member makes is that he does not take into account the improvements in working conditions, nor does he take into account mechanization and automation. He probably never heard of that. On the basis of figures that he quoted in respect of our mines, our factories, transport, etc., he says that there has been no increase in avenues of employment in those undertakings. But surely the hon. member will concede that there is such a thing as an improvement in working conditions and that labour can be used more economically, thus increasing production although using a smaller labour force. Or has that never occurred to him? I want to show him that he is completely wide of the mark. As far as the gold mines are concerned, the labour position has been constant over the years 1959 to 1962; as a matter of fact, there has been a slight reduction in the number of workers. In spite of that fact, the production has increased from 20,000,000 to 24,000,000 ounces, that is to say, by 20 per cent! But that is a fact which the hon. member does not disclose when he makes his submissions here. Profits have increased from R172,000,000 to R214,000,000, while wages and salaries have increased by R20,000,000. That means that the mines have a bigger income; they have an increased salary bill and they have been more economic in their production; and where they have not increased their labour force, as the hon. member wants them to do, by the percentage by which they have increased production, work has been found for those people in other avenues of employment. Our statistics do not incorporate all the different types of employment in South Africa. The hon. member thinks that the position is static but it is not. In 1947 salaries and wages in the various occupations which the hon. member mentioned amounted to R197,000,000 in the mining industry; in 1961 the figure was R251,843,000. In the case of the manufacturing industry, where he says the position has been static over a number of years, salaries and wages amounted to R513,000,000 in 1957. and in 1961 the salary and wage bill was R604,864,000. In the construction industry salaries and wages increased from R74,000,000 to R76,500,000. In transport, in the Railway Service, salaries and wages increased from R205,000,000 to R225,000,000. I could give the hon. member a long list in respect of base metals to show how wages have increased. The hon. member wants to make us believe that these things have remained static. These increases are all 20 per cent or more. Look at production. In 1959 we mined 3,185,000 tons of iron ore and in 1961 4,473,000 tons, an increase of more than 30 per cent. The production of pig iron in 1957 was 1,499,000 tons and in 1961, 2,352,000 tons, an increase of about 40 per cent. In 1959 the total sales of the mining industry amounted to R671,000,000 and in 1961, R785,000,000. I could give the hon. member the figures in respect of industrial milk. From 1959 to 1961 the figure increased from 250,000,000 to 308,000,000; fruit products from 131,000,000 to 164,000,000; footwear from 100,000,000 to 107,000,000; oil-cake from 137.6 million to 194,000,000; fish-meal from 162.8 million to 228.1 million. This represents a colossal increase varying from 20 per cent to 40 per cent <span class="col_8705-8706" refersTo="page_1599"/>within the space of two or three years, but the hon. member says that our economy is static, particularly in the manufacturing industry. The figures which I have mentioned here are all in respect of manufacturing industries. No. the hon. member must not give us only one set of figures which suit him and which are by no means scientific either. He ought to know as well as any other economist that there has been development in every sphere. These developments have all tendered to bring about a saving of labour and a greater use of more skilled labour, with the result that manpower has been saved, and the labour thus saved can then be used in other spheres of employment.</p>

<p>The hon. member made another submission here. He says that as far as the Common Market is concerned, we would have been better off if we had still been in the Commonwealth. We have often heard that story from them, but the question that I put to him by way of interjection was this: &#x201C;What is your party prepared to do; what concessions are you prepared to make so that we can remain in the Commonwealth?&#x201D; But he refuses to reply to that question; his party dare not reply to it, because that would spell their doom in South Africa. He says that our racial policy is entirely wrong, but they will not change our racial policy, because that too, would spell their doom; the electorate would not give them an opportunity to do so. I shall be glad if the hon. member will follow some good advice for a change and talk more scientifically about economic matters.</p>

<p>I think South Africa has cause to be highly satisfied with our economic position. We do not believe a word of the hon. member&#x2019;s story that we are doing very badly. He says that our unemployment figure is wrong. I want to ask him this: Assuming that figure is wrong, what right has he then to accept that our employment figure is correct? If he rejects the one figure, what right has he to accept the other figure? No, the hon. member must be more scientific. But let us look for a moment at the United Party&#x2019;s amendment. They moved a &#x201C;tricycle&#x201D; amendment to the Minister&#x2019;s motion, but that tricycle has three flat types, and the faster they pedal, the more they fall behind. In enlarging upon their amendment they dealt with every subject in the whole of the Republic, starting with the Orange River scheme and ending with the employment position on the Rand and in Pretoria, without being able to make any impression anywhere along the line, and the reaction for that is that whereas last year they were the cock of the walk and said that South Africa was in a very weak position and that we would never get out of those difficulties, they have nothing to say this year, but they nevertheless take days and days to say it. I do not want to dwell on this matter at length. I want to say a word or two in connection with our currency reserves.</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear to me that we have now reached the stage where our exchange position is very sound. There is no country in the</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear to me that we have now reached the stage where our exchange position is very sound. There is no country in the world, and there never has been a country in the history of the world, except South Africa, which has been able to treble its currency reserves within the space of 12 months. But if we deduct the amount which the Minister has deliberately repaid overseas, then our currency reserves have more than trebled in the past 12 months. That is something on which we can only congratulate this Government, and that is why members of the Opposition look so glum, because that is not what they wanted. The outcome of this position is that rates of interest in South Africa are dropping. In January short-term Treasury bills stood at approximately 4 per cent; to-day the figure is between 2 per cent and 3 per cent and we find that much more is still being offered regularly at this low rate than one could get a few years ago or even six months ago. It seems to me that we are moving towards a lower interest pattern in South Africa, which is a good thing, because one of the reasons why there has been a certain amount of investment resistance in the past few months is that there was a small number of people who said that they were afraid to invest because they did not know what would become of the non-White problem, but that is a problem which is disappearing. One of the things which deterred people to some extent was the high rate of interest on long-term loans, but since we have this drop in short-term rates of interest to-day, and since I notice that the commercial banks are going to follow the example of the Reserve Bank and lower interest rates further, I want to ask the Minister what his intention is and when the Treasury is going to start following this lower interest pattern in the case of long term loans. [Interjection.] Would the hon. member like that or not?</p>

<p>I feel that if we can reduce long-term interest rates to a certain extent, it will give a tremendous fillip to business and to the whole of our economy. After all, that is what we expect the building societies and other bodies to do. In a previous debate I referred to the fact that the rates of interest of deposit-receiving institutions should be brought into line, and I hope that the Minister will see to it that legislation is introduced not later than next year to make this compulsory. [Interjection.] Let me put this to the hon. member for Kensington who says, &#x201C;That will be the day!&#x201D; Surely if building society rates of interest are reduced to conform to the rate of interest of commercial banks, it means that building society interest rates on loans would also have to be reduced. If a building society lends money to the hon. member to build a house, surely it is a long term loan, and if that rate of interest is lowered, then surely the rate of interest must also be lowered on Treasury long-term loans? Surely that would be the logical outcome of the present position. I want to put this to the Minister in connection with our whole interest <span class="col_8707-8708" refersTo="page_1600"/>policy. It seems to me that the feverish rush that there was to get rid of foreign shares or rather South African shares held by foreigners in South Africa is something of the past, because I notice that to-day the outside world is buying South African shares not only in London but even in Johannesburg. Taking all these factors into account and taking into account the fact that every year since the war we have had a drop in our currency reserves between January and June but that this year we have had an increase of no less than R120,000,000&#x2014;a wonderful achievement which nobody thought was possible&#x2014;the question that occurs to me is where we are heading with our exchange reserves? It seems to me that our exchange reserves are going to reach great heights, and I just want to put it to the Minister that we should encourage industry and that the State should help to encourage industry to make productive investments as soon as possible. The position in every country in the world is that if there is a great deal of idle money which is not productively used, it has inflationary tendencies. I know that the Government will guard against this, and that is why I visualize enormous economic development in the next few months and years, because we have the money for it. I want to say to these people who complain that we are not getting sufficient foreign capital here and that we need foreign capital for development, that South Africa has sufficient capital to-day to undertake developmental projects. Foreign capital would be welcome, not on foreign terms but on our terms. In former years we had to take it on whatever terms we could get it, but that is no longer the position. It has been stated by the brother of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr. Jan Graaff, that we have reached the position to-day where we can pay off R100,000,000 per annum abroad and still finance all our capital development. I do not propose to go into the merits of that argument, but I just want to point out that I am not the only one who thinks that we can meet our own obligations if it becomes necessary to do so.</p>

<p>I want to point out to the Minister of Finance that when he became Minister of Finance he said that he wanted to bring about certain reforms in our taxation system. He has almost completed his reforms now. There is still one reform left, the pay-as-you-earn system. I do not want to go into the merits of it now but it looks as though that that system is going to be introduced next year. In this connection I just want to warn the Minister and ask him please to look after the interests of the wage-earners if that system is introduced. One of the difficulties that we had on the Select Committee is that the formula of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue works out in such a way that all wage-earners will be paying too much and will then receive a refund at the end of the financial year. Sir, the wage-earner is not a man with surplus money in his pocket, and before this scheme is introduced I should prefer the Minister to devise some scheme, which we were unable to devise in the Committee, to ensure that the wage-earner is not called upon to pay too much and that he then has to be given a refund later on. If the formula goes through as it stands now, we are going to have a great deal of trouble. I am glad that the Select Committee accepted a motion of mine to amend the wording of the resolution as originally passed to ask the Government to look into this matter. I want to bring this matter specifically to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. I may say in passing that according to the Select Committee&#x2019;s report the farmers will be excluded from the application of this system.</p>

<p>In connection with the Minister&#x2019;s further reforms for the future, I want to suggest a few more, and one of them is this: I do not think that capital formation is promoted, either in the case of the individual or in the case of the State, by using taxation derived from capital sources for current account purposes. I think the Minister will agree with that. Unfortunately our Budget is so designed that a certain amount of revenue derived from this source is still transferred to the current account, and I want to ask the Minister to go into that aspect and to see that in the future that type of revenue is automatically transferred to the Loan Account. I am thinking, for example, of estate duty. A certain portion of estate duty is still transferred to the current account. It has not been necessary to raise this matter in the past because year after year we have transferred large amounts from current revenue to the Loan Account, but for the first time this year that is not happening, and I feel that the time has come when we should lay down a scientific basis to feed the Loan Account systematically with the necessary funds so as to keep our country economically sound, without an unduly large burden of debt.</p>

<p>The second matter that I want to raise is this&#x2014;and here I may be treading on somebody&#x2019;s corns: Our company taxation system is based on 6d. in the &#x00A3;, but we are taxing the gold mines much more heavily than that in some cases while in other cases the tax is lower again, but on an average the tax on the gold mines is a little more than 6d. in the &#x00A3;, that is to say, 30 per cent. The reason is this: Our attitude, and quite correctly too, is that the gold mines represent a wasting asset and that we must build up other things to replace the gold mines eventually as a production factor. That is a very sound attitude that we, the National Party, have always adopted, and even Mr. Harry Oppenheimer said in his last year in this House that he admitted that money should regularly be transferred from the revenue account to the Loan Account, but he said that we were rather over doing it. [Interjection.] I am not talking now about mining rentals. The mines are the State&#x2019;s property; the State leases those mines to people, and that has nothing to do with the submission that I am making here. I want to ask the Minister to consider the advisability&#x2014;he cannot do so at once&#x2014;of gradually introducing the principle that any amount paid by the gold mines in excess of their 30 per <span class="col_8709-8710" refersTo="page_1601"/>taxation should automatically be transferred to the Loan Account. This is something that can be done gradually as the country is able to afford it, and I hope that within a few years this will be our firm policy. If we did this we would have a much sounder position than we have to-day, where we vote R50,000,000 one year for the Loan Account, the next year R20,000,000, the following year R30,000,000 and then nothing the next year. These are the reforms that I should like the Minister to bear in mind for the future.</p>

<p>The other matter that I should like to touch upon in connection with the goldmines is the question of the price of gold. It seems to me that there is a great deal of speculation nowadays as to what may happen to the price of gold, and I want to make an appeal to the Minister once again to do everything in his power this year, when he goes overseas, to try to get an increase in the price of gold, an increase that we deserve. Although the hon. member for Jeppe has said that you can always sell gold, we have been selling gold for the last 30 years at the same dollar price&#x2014;and that is not realistic. I want to ask the Minister whether we cannot advance the argument that actually America is already paying a subsidy on their gold to those countries to whom she is lending money and which then have to buy from America&#x2014;a subsidy not on gold that they produce themselves but that they may have in their possession, because if you sell something to a person for R100 and you only make him pay R50 for it, or nothing at all, you are subsidizing his currency to that extent. In this way they are making those countries economically dependent on America, and although an increase in the price of gold is actually essential they are doing nothing about it. I feel that the position that obtains to-day is altogether unsound and that something should be done about it immediately. I hope that when the Minister goes overseas he will succeed in having this matter rectified.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I come to what I want to say, I would just like to focus attention upon this fact, that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) attempted to answer the tremendous indictment that the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) brought against the Government, by quoting a lot of figures. Anyone who knows the old joke about the bikini will realize the limitations of figures. And I want to say that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) has certainly, with his bikini, not managed to hide the fact of the rising unemployment in this country, or the failure of South Africa&#x2019;s standard of living to rise at a rate comparable with our resources; and he certainly has not been able to hide the fact that our standard of living has not risen comparably with other comparable Western countries. The hon. member for Jeppes quoted this passage from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement on 15 March Of this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The desirability and necessity of increasing non-White wages were emphasized by studies made of the average income of non-White families in Johannesburg, Durban and Pretoria. Whilst certain findings of these family studies may be criticized, it can hardly be denied that they have revealed extreme poverty towards which neither the employer nor the Government can adopt an attitude of indifference.</block>

<p>Everybody in this House knows how correct was the speech of the hon. member for Maitland, when he drew attention to the extreme poverty among many of the White people in this country. I want to say that it will be small comfort to all those people to hear from the hon. member from Pretoria (Central) that no matter what the sacrifice is economically, the Government will not in any way depart from its policies. He inferred that this alone would save White South Africa and ensure its continuance. I say that all those people who are already suffering and will suffer in future from this Government&#x2019;s racial policies will not be comforted, particularly when they know there is another policy, namely that of this party, which has always been able to preserve the position of those who are the bearers of Western civilization.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this year I was able to introduce a Bill to consolidate the Income Tax Act and that consolidation has now become law as the Income Tax Act, 1962 (No. 58 of 1962). The Income Tax Amendment Bill which I am now dealing with will bring about extensive amendments to the new Income Tax Act. In passing, reference may also be made to the consolidation of the Stamp Duties and Fees Act, 1911, as the Stamp Duties Act, 1962, and the Consolidation of the Licences Consolidation Act, 1925 as the Licences Act, 1962. This year for the first time it was possible for the Commissioner to publish for general information and comment almost the full list of the proposals for the amendment of the Income Tax Act. The <b><i>Gazette</i></b> notice resulted in only three of the proposals being commented upon.</p>

<p><span class="col_8711-8712" refersTo="page_1602"/>A further proposal by the Commissioner was contained in the <b><i>Government Gazette Extraordinary</i></b> of 12 January 1962, and concerned the possibility of the introduction of a system of payment of income tax by instalments in advance of final assessment of liability, or the P.A.Y.E. system. That proposal was referred to a Select Committee for consideration, and the Committee&#x2019;s report is in the hands of hon. members. The Government has decided to adopt the Committee&#x2019;s recommendations, and I intend to follow the course proposed by the Committee. In accordance with one of the recommendations, provision is made in Clause 36 of the Income Tax Amendment Bill to permit the Commissioner to proceed with the registration of employers. The Committee also recommended that the scheme should be introduced, but that the original proposals should be modified in certain respects. Revised legislative provisions will accordingly be published as soon as possible to facilitate the introduction of a Bill early in 1963 in order that the scheme may be brought into operation with effect from 1 March 1963. In the interim of course suggestions in regard to the proposal which will be published, and which is more or less what the Committee recommended, will be accepted. Any suggestions can be made and they will be considered before the final form is introduced next year.</p>

<p>I turn now to certain clauses of this Bill, and I will deal firstly with the three matters I mentioned previously, and which invited comment when the proposals were published in the <b><i>Government Gazette.</i></b> The first request was that something should be done to prevent an exporter of farm produce from losing his right to claim the allowance in a case where, after considerable expenditure on market development, some catastrophe seriously curtails or makes it impossible for him to export his product. As the proposal for an exporters&#x2019; allowance is in the nature of an experiment, I do not at this stage intend to do more than is set out in the clause. The allowance will be granted for the first time in respect of the 1963 tax year and if any serious deficiencies in the present proposals are brought to my notice there will be an opportunity for amending the law during the 1963 session.</p>

<p>The second matter was really a plea for the continuation of the present basis of taxation of the income of a divorced or separated person. The proposal to amend the basis of taxation, as contained in the Bill, stems from the incontestable fact that alimony is not an expense incurred in the production of the income of the person by whom it must be paid, that it is an expense of a private and domestic nature and that apart from the provisions which, over the years, have been incorporated in the law, any claim for the deduction of alimony would have to be disallowed under Section 23 of the Income Tax Act, 1962. In the higher income groups the splitting of income means a very considerable saving in tax, and, at the top of the scale, over 50 per cent of the amount of the alimony would be funded from the tax saved by the person who earns the income and pays the alimony. Apart from the direct saving in tax resulting from the deduction of alimony, the present provisions of the law as interpreted by the courts, have made it possible for both parties of a dissolved or broken marriage to retain all the benefits of a classification as married persons. Amendments to the existing provisions would in any case have been necessary. It is considered that the amendments now proposed result in an equitable solution of the problem. Because it was desired to cause as little hardship as possible, the new provision will not be applied in those cases where the order of divorce or of judicial separation resulted from proceedings instituted before 21 March 1962, or where the written agreement of separation was entered into before that date. In cases where the new provisions apply, each parent will be entitled to claim rebates for the children of the marriage, and the parent who is actually maintaining a child out of his own income will be entitled to a special rebate of R16. In those cases the recipient of an amount of alimony or allowance will not pay tax thereon.</p>

<p>The third proposal commented upon concerns the taxation of interest derived from banking institutions. Because of the restriction to institutions registered in the Republic, the fear was expressed that deposits outside the Republic would be transferred from branches of locally registered banks to branches of banks which do not carry on business in the Republic. The proposals have been amended so that they should apply to interest derived from any bank or from any branch of a bank outside the Republic as well. In the case of banking institutions which are managed and controlled in the Republic, the agreement entered into with the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland for the avoidance of double taxation will have the effect of exempting the interest from Federation tax if the interest is taxed in the Republic. If the South African resident is carrying on business in the Federation and has made his deposit in that country for the purposes of that business, the interest on the deposit will be exempt from South African tax if it is taxed in the Federation.</p>

<p>Last year when I introduced what has become the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act, of 1962, in respect of awards from pension, provident and retirement annuity funds, I hoped that it would not be necessary to amend those provisions for some time. After a full investigation of a complaint, it is now proposed, with effect from 15 March 1961, to make the following further concessions in order to increase the tax-free portion of an award from a provident fund &#x2026;</p>

That is the date of the previous Budget; we <span class="col_8713-8714" refersTo="page_1603"/>are now making it as if it resulted from the Budget of last year &#x2026; in order to increase the tax-free portion of an award from a provident fund (a) to increase the amount of the exemption determined from the application of formula A by an amount equivalent to the taxpayer&#x2019;s contributions to the provident fund and (b) to provide that the minimum tax-free portion of an award from a provident fund on the death of a member shall be either the amount of R10,000 presently permitted or an amount equal to twice as much of the salary of the member at date of his death as does not exceed R10,000, whichever is the greater.</p>

<p>In my Budget speech I indicated certain matters which would be included in this Bill. They have all been included and it is not necessary for me to mention them again. I have not dealt with all the clauses of the Bill. They are fully covered in the Memorandum and, in addition, the absence of comment on those which appeared in the published proposals, lead me to the conclusion that the provisions contained in those clauses are fully understood and approved by the business community.</p>

<p>We support the second reading. Sir. As we have in the past raised our objections to the fact that the Minister has not had a consolidating Bill, I think it is only fitting that we should say that we are very pleased indeed that we have at last got a consolidating Bill after 20 years. The Minister has also made reference to the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. this year and I would like to couple with it a reference to the consolidation of the Income Tax Act and the P.A.Y.E., a tribute to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue and his staff who have had a very busy year. They have attended to the consolidation of that Act. They have had to deal with the many memoranda which have come in in connection with P.A.Y.E. They had to publish a Bill dealing with this matter and at the end of those proceedings they have had to publish an amending Bill giving effect to all the matters dealt with during the course of the deliberations of the Select Committee. All that has been an additional load on the Commissioner and his staff and I am quite sure the Minister agrees with me that it is only fitting that we should pay tribute to the Commissioner and his staff for their services.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before dealing with the clauses of the Bill in general, I would like to deal with one matter in particular and that is the question of public companies and private companies as defined in Section 32 of the Act. We have the unfortunate position of the Stock Exchange to-day listing companies which are regarded as public companies on the Stock Exchange and yet are regarded as private companies by the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. The Stock Exchange is now issuing to its members a list of companies so classified Only a few weeks ago, Sir, the Minister was talking about open end trusts and his open end trust legislation. The Minister was enjoining the members of the public to invest in South African equities. Yet we find, as a result of our taxation policy and our taxation revenue, a discrimination. The position is this, that the predominant proportion of the business of the Republic, business covering every facet of the country&#x2019;s activities, and including in particular mining of every description, manufacturing, distribution and transport, is conducted by our public companies. They are the arteries of the country&#x2019;s economic system and the harvister of the foreign currency which the Minister so badly needs. They are the source of livelihood of the mass of the public. It is, therefore, essential, Sir, that the administration and control of our public companies should be and remain in the hands of the responsible citizens of the Republic. The danger of the passing of control, always a contingency, I submit, Mr. Speaker, has been aggravated by the unhelpful provisions of Section 33 of the Income Tax Act, of 1941, as amended. The provisions stipulate, <i>inter alia,</i> that to retain or gain recognition as a public company, for the purposes of income tax, a company must satisfy the Commissioner that (a) the Memorandum and the Articles of Association contain no such restrictions on the right to acquire or transfer any of its shares as are likely to preclude members of the general public from becoming shareholders in any class of its shares; (b) the general public, throughout the year of assessment in question, were interested either directly as shareholders in it or indirectly as shareholders in any other public company in more than 50 per cent of every class of equity shares issued by it. Mr. Speaker, these two stipulations shatter the preservation of vital proper control. Not only must the general public hold directly or indirectly in a particular manner, more than 50 per cent of the shares, but in addition the general public must have the unfettered right to acquire shares. Many of the companies whose shares are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange meet all the relevant requirements of Section 33 of the Income Tax Act and it is a cause for alarm that they are so vulnerable to change of control. Many other important listed companies meet all such requirements except the requirement as to the interest of the general public and are now being degraded to the status of private companies. As I said earlier, Sir, that degrading is being circulated to members of the Stock Exchange. It is in effect notice to them to take this fact into account when advising their clients to invest in companies. Certain of these companies quoted on the London and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges are held in high investment esteem. I do not want to particularize, Mr. Speaker, it would be invidious to do so, but if the Minister would examine the list I have here of some 46 companies, he would find amongst them the names of some of the leading companies in this <span class="col_8715-8716" refersTo="page_1604"/>country, companies which have a reputation for sound business administration which they have earned over a long period of years. It is possible that a number of such companies may be compelled by force of circumstances, to redistribute shares as to join the vulnerable group. On paper the disabilities flowing from degradation to the status of a private company are not insupportable being (a) liability to undistributed profits tax (b) shareholders liable to tax on bonus shares unless issued from share premium account. You have this position, Sir, that not only do they suffer a dangerous disability, but they can make themselves vulnerable to take-over bids. Sir, I do not want to digress and go into the whole question of take-over bids; it is a matter which will probably be dealt with by the Minister of Economic Affairs when discussing the Companies Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if we want to maintain the soundness of our companies, the soundness of their shares as marketable securities, I think the Minister should give consideration to the whole question of the definition of public and private company. Because I submit that in the anxiety of the Department to close all the holes in the net so as to collect the maximum amount of tax, they have created a state of affairs which is unwholesome in the share market to-day. It is unwholesome from the point of view of the investing public. We want the investing public to know that the Johannesburg Stock Exchange&#x2014;to which an hon. member referred to earlier to-day as one of the leading stock exchanges in the world&#x2014;list only public shares. It is invidious to have to mark the list, as I can see happening if this position continues, so as to discriminate between private and public companies. I suggest, Sir, that the Minister should give earnest consideration to this matter. There are many cases which are the subject of controversy at the moment, There are many cases where the persons concerned have submitted their case to the courts or to the Income Tax Special Appeal Court and in some cases the matter is already before the Appellate Division. This is a matter which has been receiving the attention of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue and the Minister&#x2019;s Department for some time. I suggest, Sir, that the whole question of the definition of public and private companies should be taken under review and the Minister should see whether in the coming year a new approach cannot be made in this matter. When we come to discussing the Bill in Committee, I think we can deal with some of the matters more adequately there such as, for instance, the question of alimony, and the question of investments in South West Africa.</p>

<p>In connection with the question of exporter&#x2019;s allowance, the Minister has indicated in his remarks that this is an experiment. We accept that it is an experiment but it does seem that we need some guidance from the Minister. If the Commissioner for Inland Revenue is going to interpret this very strictly indeed, he will see that the minimum expenses are allowed; if he interprets this rigidly then the benefits to exporters which the Minister suggested might flow from his Budget statement, might be negligible. On the other hand, Sir, it does seem to us on an examination of this Clause, that it helps the newer exporter rather than the person who over many years has had a traditional export market. It seems to us that it will give opportunities to the exporter who has had a comparatively short experience in the export market to gain more intrinsic benefits than an exporter who has had experience of developing the export market over many years and has established a series of deductions for tax purposes under the normal deductions provided for in Section 11 of the principal Act. I appreciate that it is an experiment, but we will have to watch this matter very closely in the coming year, because I suggest that from an examination of this Bill, it does appear to us that this does contain more benefits for the newer exporter than for the older exporter.</p>

<p>The Minister has referred to Clause 31 in so far as it deals with pensions. It also deals with pensions to persons employed by local authorities. Clauses 3 and 31 deal with that. I am not going to ask the hon. the Minister to explain to us at length the reason why we have to substitute for the expression z = c&#x2014;d the expression z = c + e&#x2014;d. I think the Minister might explain that to us at a later stage. I do suggest to the Minister that when he considers the pensioners employed by local authorities he might also consider persons on university staffs as well. Representations have been made in that regard. There will possibly be an opportunity of discussing that in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The only other matter to which I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention is in respect of temporary employment overseas, Clause 7. This is to close an old gap. There has been an income tax evasion, or an income tax avoidance&#x2014;nobody evades income tax, the Commissioner gets them in the end. There has been a practice in recent years for persons going overseas to regard their temporary absence overseas as a period when they are not earning income in South Africa and in that way they have attempted deductions. The Minister&#x2019;s remedy will certainly close the gap but it may have the effect of imposing hardships on genuine cases of persons who visit countries with which we do not have reciprocal taxation agreements. I do suggest, Sir, that in the Committee Stage the Minister might consider his definition of &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; so that there can be no doubt about it that persons who visit countries with which we do not have reciprocal taxation agreements will not be subject to double taxation, namely taxation in South Africa and taxation in the country where they are temporarily employed.</p>

<p>This Bill comes at the end of a busy session; it is an attempt to close the gaps which have revealed themselves in the course of years. To a certain extent it breaks new ground and we hope next year when the Minister comes with his amending Bill, it will not only provide <span class="col_8717-8718" refersTo="page_1605"/>for the closing of any further gaps which have been discovered but that it will also provide for the incorporation of the whole scheme of P.A.Y.E. which the Minister proposes to proceed with and that more time will be given to the discussion of the Bill, although I must say this that while in the past we have criticized the Department for publishing Bills so late, after many years&#x2019; insistence we have got the co-operation of the Minister and we have had the advantage of having timeous notice of the Bill this year.</p>

I submit, Sir, that it is better to have more sound legislation in this House so that anomalies can be eliminated in the early stages rather than to protract the matter over a period of years.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I was going to discuss this question of divorced persons etc. in the Committee Stage, but I think I would have found myself in a most extraordinary difficulty because the White Paper says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This amendment should be read with the amendments to the principal Act introduced by Clause 4, Clause 7, Clause 10, Clause 16 and Clause 26.</block>

<p>So I think it is better if I say in the Second Reading what I want to say in connection with this matter</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Minister in his introductory remarks to-night in regard to these new provisions affecting separated and divorced people, said that those in the higher income groups would save money. He said those in the highest brackets would save a lot of money. I would ask the Minister how many people, what proportion of people, are in the higher brackets and the highest brackets. I am not saying that he ignores the lower brackets; that would not be fair. I want to advance a reasonable argument. I think he has been misled on this matter. I do feel that he has not given sufficient consideration to those in the lower brackets of income. He said he thought this was an equitable decision.</p>

<p>I maintain it is one of the most inequitable decisions that I have ever come across. But then when one deals with Finance Ministers one often feels like that.</p>

<p>This Bill deals amongst other things with those unhappy and unfortunate people who have not found the happiness which they expected to find on the day that they got married. There are three classes affected by these proposed amendments. There are those separated by written agreement. Now the husband is to be treated as married and taxed on the joint income. The second category consist of those who have been separated judicially and now the alimony is not allowed as a deduction from the husband&#x2019;s income. The main change is that they will now both be taxed as single persons; they will both get children&#x2019;s rebates, with an extra one to the one who is maintaining the children. At this stage, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister would clear up something which has been suggested to me is not quite clear. In the case of a judicial separation the alimony paid by the husband to the wife is still taxed in the hands of the husband. But it does not seem quite clear that her personal income will not be taxed in his hands. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could give me a reply to that now because it may affect my argument. She has a private income of her own; they are judicially separated; he pays her alimony; he pays tax on that alimony, it is not allowed as a deduction. The hon. the Minister made a big point of it that it was not expenditure incurred in the production of income. But it seems to be a little bit obscure. I do not think that he pays on the wife&#x2019;s personal income if they are judicially separated but I would hate to see a lot of lawyers make a lot of money out of an obscurity of this nature. This is not quite clear; I would just like some clarification from the Minister.</p>

<p>The third category consists of divorced people who will now be taxed ignoring alimony. The husband will pay on all his income. There will be no deduction for alimony. The wife pays on her income, if any, and both will be taxed as single people. Again this question of children&#x2019;s rebates come into the picture. Both parties in the case of a judicial separation will receive children&#x2019;s rebates &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I think that is the Clause you are referring to. In the <span class="col_8719-8720" refersTo="page_1606"/>case of a judicial separation each party remains taxable on his or her personal income. The wife&#x2019;s income is not added to the husband&#x2019;s income or taxed in his hands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you. There was no doubt in my own mind, but certain doubts were expressed to me and I thought it best to clear up the matter here.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, as I have already said, both parties to a judicial separation are going to receive children&#x2019;s rebates but they will both be taxed as single persons and not as married persons. Quite frankly I cannot follow the reason for this. I want to ask the Minister to compare the position of a widow or a widower who is assessed as a married person, getting children&#x2019;s rebate, of course, with the position of an innocent party in a divorce also maintaining children and being taxed as a single man. It is beyond my comprehension. I cannot agree that there can be a sound reason for a finance Minister to tax people on that basis, because money is saved by certain people in the very high bracket who have a judicial separation. The Minister&#x2019;s reply in the previous debate was that he was giving the guilty party in a divorce a rebate and that that sort of balances out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Do you realize that the State, i.e. you and I, the taxpayers, are really subsidizing the alimony which a husband in the higher bracket, the R20,000, bracket, is paying to his wife.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Of course we are, Mr. Speaker, but how many are there in that bracket?</p>

<p>Even if there is only one, we are subsidizing that one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>But you are penalizing 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 people, no matter to what degree, even if it is only &#x00A3;1 or &#x00A3;5, because one man earns R20,000. Mr. Speaker, I would not like to be a Minister of Finance. He must always have a guilty conscience. The main trouble with finance Ministers is that they are always following their Commissioners for Inland Revenue. Outside the office these are ordinary charming people but inside the office it is sometimes very difficult to agree with them. Obviously the Commissioner has found one or two people who got away with plenty. Because one man got away with something we must drag into the net all the little people in the country. I cannot agree with that reasoning. It is no use being as tough and hard as that Mr. Speaker, you are still dealing with human beings. I wonder how many more people there are who are going to be prejudicially affected than those gentlemen with R20,000 or R40,000 a year. This to me, Sir, is one of the most unjust proposals I have ever come across. It is quite obvious that enough attention has not been given to this subject. It is really Alice in Wonderland legislation. There has been no outcry yet, Sir, because there has been no publicity, the hurt has not yet been felt. If the Minister has given the thought to this matter which he should have given, he must surely realize that when people realize what he is doing to them, there will be such an outcry that he will be forced to alter these provisions.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that the majority of those people who part and do not divorce, are people who cannot divorce because of their religious observances. We all know that to be the position. And to handle this matter in this manner, because somebody has got away with something, is beyond me. There must be another way of dealing with it, Sir. How can you deal with the matter in this way if the question of religious observance comes into the picture? It is a fact which definitely should affect the Minister&#x2019;s decision. And don&#x2019;t shake your head, Mr. Minister, you know I am right. You have not given this enough thought. I am leaving that, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>I want to bring another point forward. Where people separate under written agreement&#x2014;that is the first one where the man is still taxed as a married man on all the income&#x2014;it is surely most usual for the wife to go to work. I am not referring to the man with R40,000 a year. I am referring to ordinary people, those people who also find unhappiness in this life. What happens in their case? The wife goes to work. What else can she do? And now this Minister makes the husband pay on the wife&#x2019;s earnings? She has to work. That is the position; it is in the White Paper. Let me tell the Minister that where somebody is separated by written agreement, that agreement is ignored entirely for taxation purposes and the wife&#x2019;s income becomes taxable in the hands of the husband.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I have spoken long, Mr. Speaker, but I think I have stated my case. I think the Minister has rushed his fences in this matter and has not given due consideration to the people who are going to be affected.</p>

<p>Lastly I would like to associate myself to the remarks of the hon. member for Pine town (Mr. Hopewell) who suggested that that in considering pensions to people employed by local authorities, consideration should also be given to university staffs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The point raised by the hon. member for Pine town (Mr. Hopewell) in regard to the definition of a public company, is something which has exercised my mind and I am sure also the minds of my predecessors and the minds of all the commissioners for a very long time. The classification of companies as public and private is a problem which bristles with difficulties. Here in South Africa it has caused trouble since 1917 and no satisfactory solution, no satisfactory permanent solution, has ever been found along the lines of the Provisions which seeks to define what shall be a &#x201C;controlling interest&#x201D;. Similarly it might be found that no satisfactory permanent solution is possible on the lines of the provisions contained in Section 38 of the Act. The primary object <span class="col_8721-8722" refersTo="page_1607"/>of the provisions in regard to the classification of companies is to ensure that companies which are not public companies declare adequate dividends out of their profits. That is obvious. Else the shareholders will be able to escape the payment of income tax by becoming a private company and not paying out dividends. That is the primary object.</p>

<p>The secondary object of this classification is to ensure that no company shall be classified as a public company unless its equity shares are widely held by living persons directly or indirectly through their share holding in the equity shares of public companies and that no small group of natural persons in fact controls the policy of that company. That is the secondary object.</p>

<p>As I say, it is a very difficult matter which has exercised the minds and tested the ingenuity of successive commissioners and Ministers, but I am prepared again to give it my attention, and I intend that the whole question will be thoroughly investigated with a view to amending legislation. I want to warn hon. members, however, as I see things at present, the possibilities are only twofold. I may become wiser in the next few months, but at the moment I see that the choice for us would be between maintaining the continuation of the present system of classification and using what is bound to be proved to be an unsatisfactory definition. Perhaps from time to time I can do a little bit of tinkering to the definition. That is the one side. The other side, as I see things at present, is the substitution for the present system of a system where under the rate of company tax is increased and the gross income of a company is defined as including receipts and accruals of a capital nature. If this substitution is adopted, it means that we will be able to do away with the undistributed profits tax, will be able to do away with the non-resident shareholders tax, and the present provisions in regard to the award of bonus shares will cease to be important. It has those advantages that we can do away with certain taxes. On the other hand, as I say, it has the disadvantage that it would mean an increase in the tax. So I am warning hon. members that those are the two alternatives, as I see things at the moment, and unless some other fertile mind invents some other alternative, those will be the two alternatives from which I will have to choose. I am warning them, because the fact that I am going to have it investigated does not mean that it is going to be an easy matter, or that the solution is going to be one that will satisfy everybody.</p>

<p>In regard to export benefits, it is, as I have said, an experiment at the moment. What we must try and prevent is that the export benefits which we are granting now, should be used as a means of swelling tax exemptions and thereby having avoidance of taxes. We have to see how it works. At the moment it is quite true that the older exporter who has already built up an export business will not be able to get the same benefits as the newer exporter. We also considered the other alternative, but the cost of it according to the information that we have was really incalculable. Therefore we started on what we knew were fairly well-chartered seas. We can more or less frame an estimate of what the cost to the country will be of granting this concession. In regard to temporary employment overseas, the hon. member for Pine town has truly remarked that it has been a means of avoiding tax in the past. They have deducted it from their incomes here and usually the countries in which they work temporarily have not been able or had the time to pick them up for taxation. Where we have double taxation agreements the matter is now fairly simple. We have double taxation agreements with the Protectorates and with Rhodesia. Those are the most likely ones. There we have the agreement that if they go and pay taxation here, then they will be able to avoid taxation in Rhodesia or the Protectorates. There we have defined &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; as 183 days. If they go there for longer than 183 days, then they pay tax there and not here. Where we have no double taxation agreements&#x2014;we have with the United Kingdom, with the United States, with Canada, with Sweden, but we have not got one with France&#x2014;one of the ways is to send somebody as a buyer to Paris and then the salary earned while he is there, is then deducted here. It is very unlikely that the French people will pick him up if he goes there for a short period, and what we have in mind for the definition of &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; is the same as we had in the other case, viz. 183 days.</p>

<p>As far as next year&#x2019;s legislation is concerned, I want to say that we won&#x2019;t be able to do away with two Acts, next year. The one will be introducing the P.A.Y.E. system early in the session before we have fixed the rate of income tax; that will be an amendment of the Consolidated Income Tax Act. Then after Ways and Means, we will have to come with an amendment of that amended Act. So we won&#x2019;t be able to escape having two measures next year again, but again, as this year, I will see whether we cannot publish as much as we possibly can in advance of the Ways and Means proposals, publish as much as possible of the amendment to the administration of the Act before the time, as we did this year. I hope we will be able to do that again.</p>

<p>I want to say that I received with gratitude on behalf of the Commissioner and staff the tribute to their hard work this year. It has really been a hard year for them to do the consolidation, this important consolidation, and at the same time to have all the additional work, apart from the normal work, of the P.A.Y.E. investigation. I thank the hon. member for the tribute on behalf of the staff, and I want to say that I fully agree with the tribute.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni has raised a matter with great fervour, even a certain amount of heat, with which I do not want to deal in detail. But the fundamental thing about which he has not said a word, is that <span class="col_8723-8724" refersTo="page_1608"/>the whole idea of alimony paid being deducted from the payee&#x2019;s income is something which runs counter to the basic principle of income tax laws, and that is that only money spent on the production of income is deductible from your taxable income.</p>

<p>I would like the hon. the Minister just to tell me if I am right in my reading of the amendments which he is including in respect of deposits in building societies in South West Africa, viz., that if they are deposits which are made by persons who are resident within the Republic or companies in the Republic, then that interest will be taxed in the Republic, notwithstanding that it is earned in South West Africa, and conversely if the deposits are made by South West residents in South West Africa, or by companies controlled in South West Africa, then that interest or dividend, as the case may be will be taxed only in South West Africa.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the proposed new Section 21:</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that for the purposes of this section any order of divorce or judicial separation which supersedes such order of judicial separation or written agreement of separation and does not vary the amount of alimony, allowance or maintenance payable there under, shall not affect the rights which any person may have under this section, and in the case of any such person and the spouse or former spouse of such person the provisions of this Act shall apply as if the amendments introduced by paragraph (h) of Section 3 of the Income Tax Amendment Act, 1962, and by Sections 4, 5 and 26 of that Act had not been effected, and as if the provisions of paragraph (u) of sub-section (1) of Section 10 had not been enacted.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister in his second reading speech made the point that the proposals in regard to taxation of alimony would not be made retrospective to cover financial arrangements that have been made in divorces or separations where proceedings have been instituted before a definite date. We on this side of the House support that contention fully and appreciate the attitude the hon. the Minister has taken in this matter. We have, however, asked the hon. the Minister whether he will not give the same protection to persons who have entered into judicial separations or written agreement of separation prior to 21 March and subsequently get divorce, provided that the alimony or the maintenance is no higher under the divorce proceedings than they were under the separation agreements. You will see, Mr. Chairman, that the same principle applies, and I hope the hon. the Minister will give consideration to this matter, because it would alleviate many hardships.</p>

<p>Yes, Natal once again is a little different from the rest of the Republic, but this time it is not the fault of Natal, it is the fault of the Government, because there exists a discrepancy in our law relating to divorce in that in Natal if you sue for a divorce on the ground of malicious desertion and the husband of the marriage is domiciled in Natal, the desertion has to be continuous for 18 months. Now in any other province this is not so. If your wife maliciously deserts you to-day and there is clear enough evidence, even if she was summonsed to-morrow, the matter can be before the courts within a week or two. Unfortunately you cannot institute proceedings&#x2014;that is the relevant factor in this clause&#x2014;in Natal until the expiration of 18 months. The hon. Minister when he spoke in the Committee of Ways and Means&#x2014;and that is the reason why he should accept the amendment of the hon. member for Park town&#x2014;said that where agreements have been made before the specified date (21 March) those persons have made arrangements about their financial relationships before that date and those who are separated after that date, will just have to fall under the new law. That may be fair enough. Now in Natal there are many people who if they had lived anywhere else would have got a decree of divorce on the ground of malicious desertion, but because of the 18-month rule they were not able to do so. But the majority of those people nevertheless have, during the course of the separation, especially where children come into the picture, entered into an agreement, a written agreement as a rule, relating to the maintenance of the wife and the maintenance of the children. Now the courts encourage such agreements, because it is a waste of money and a waste of time for litigants to go to court to get a court order for maintenance <i>pendente lite.</i> The court always asks the parties to try and agree amongst themselves. Now, Sir, these are agreements and they adjust the relationship of the parties. The desertion has occurred, the damage has been done; they have made an agreement; they have arranged their lives and adjusted their financial position before 21 March 1962.</p>

<p>Yes, you can get it made an order of court, but it is only <b><i>pendente lite.</i></b> The hon. the Minister of Justice has raised a very important point here. It is not a separation agreement as is envisaged in this clause.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but then the decision in Johnston&#x2019;s case, which is very well known to the Minister of Finance, says that a subsequent order of court in which an agreement is made an order of court, supersedes entirely the original agreement. Now the amendment of the hon. member for Park town will cover those cases where there was an agreement of separation, and a judicial separation order of court, but it does not cover the case in Natal where there is no order whatsoever relating to the marital status of these individuals. It does not give them the power to live apart, but nevertheless they have entered into an agreement or had a court order relating to their financial position. Now, Sir, it is no fault of the persons who are domiciled in Natal that they cannot be divorced for 18 months as they can anywhere else. It is no fault of theirs that they cannot avail themselves of the same opportunities and the same rebates as anyone else in the Republic. I therefore propose to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 27, after &#x201C;1962&#x201D;, to insert &#x201C;or any order of divorce where the cause of action is malicious desertion, and the husband is domiciled in the province of Natal, in consequence of proceedings instituted not later than 21 September 1963&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That will provide that so far as Natal is concerned, the date fixed (21 March) will be extended for 18 months, to put them in precisely the same position.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Park town (Mr. Emdin) has consulted me and given me a copy of his proposed amendment, and subject to a few changes I agreed to accept that amendment. He has incorporated those changes and I am happy to say that I think it is a fair amendment, a little bit unlike the hon. member for Durban (North)&#x2019;s amendment! He himself showed the distinction between the two cases. The case he mentioned may never go to divorce. If this agreement is not carried out, one party cannot sue the other for specific performance. I think that is the position. If the aggrieved party decides not to proceed, what can happen then? In any case, as I said in the Ways and Means Committee, I cannot be expected to legislate for each province which has its own little ways, departing from the common pattern of the Republic as a whole. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s remedy lies in bringing Natal into line with the Republic, and not to try and make the Republic get into step with Natal. For those reasons, I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>This is, of course, the annual Bill which is known as the omnibus Bill. If I had to make a second reading speech on this Bill I would have to take up a great deal of the time of the House, but since there is no principle contained in this Bill and since it deals only with minor matters affecting the different departments, I believe that hon. members will agree with me that this is a Bill which should be dealt with exclusively in the Committee Stage. That is also how hon. members on the other side view the position, and I do not propose therefore to explain this Bill at the second reading.</p>

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 1 deals with a very thorny problem, which is known to all attorneys, and that is that in the case of divorce the custody of the children is granted to one of the spouses in terms of an Order of Court. There is a continual tug-of-war because the parties do not obey the Order of Court; there is a constant kidnapping of the children and there is fighting between the parents. Hon. members know, of course, that it amounts to contempt of court not to obey such an Order, but because it is a very expensive process, most people cannot afford to go to the Supreme Court to have the Order enforced by way of a sentence for contempt of court. That is why it has been urged for years by welfare organizations and others who are concerned with this matter&#x2014;amongst others, by an ex-member of this House, Mrs. Bertha Solomon, who has made particularly great efforts in this connection&#x2014;that jurisdiction should be given to the magistrates&#x2019; courts in respect of this matter. This clause now seeks to make that possible with a view to eliminating the tug-of-war that takes place in that connection. Not only hon. members but all welfare organizations, and at least this one former member of this House, will greatly welcome the introduction of this new measure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We all agree that this is going to be a much more inexpensive and much easier way of enforcing the orders relating to access where one parent has custody, but I hope the hon. the Minister does appreciate that there are many cases where one spouse has the custody and the other spouse wants access, and where the one spouse can be completely unreasonable as regards demands to see the children. Unfortunately I think the experience of anyone who has had anything to do with these matters, has been that after a divorce order is granted, the acrimony which caused the divorce continued, and one so often finds these people being completely unreasonable. I hope the hon. the Minister will have it in mind, and that he will inform his Department along these lines that in the cases where a complaint is made by a complainant spouse, the police should be very circumspect before prosecuting somebody for the offence which is here set out.</p>
