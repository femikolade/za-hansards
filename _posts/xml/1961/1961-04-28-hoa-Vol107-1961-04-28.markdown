<li>(b) that the Blyde River was one of the more important rivers in the Eastern Transvaal the potential of which still had to be developed and that interim planning would have to be based on the general picture of the area, that when the canal had been concrete lined the benefits derived from the elimination of water losses would have to accrue to the irrigators, that in view of the potential of the Blyde River a Government water work would eventually have to be constructed, initially probably a canal system, with a dam at a later stage, that such a canal system could be commissioned within a period of six years at the earliest, that a great deal of investigation, including intensive contour and soil surveys, would be involved, and that for the time being irrigators would have to be satisfied with the present system and existing works, that the Blyde River Irrigation Board should meanwhile, in terms of the provisions of Section 89 (1) (h) of the Water Act, 1956, acquire the Driehoek Canal and carry out the necessary betterment works to ensure that the irrigators receive their water allocations, that I was prepared to consider the granting of an irrigation loan for this purpose, that the betterment work would not necessarily have to comprise the complete lining of the canal, that only essential betterment work be executed and that my Department would render technical services to the Board and would plan the betterment work;</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) no, control over the various works still vests in the Blyde River Irrigation Board which has been established in terms of Section 73 of the Water Act, and to which Board all the functions, powers and duties under Section 89 (1) <span class="col_5517-5518" refersTo="page_1355"/>of the Water Act have been assigned; (a), (b) and (c) consequently fall away;</li>

<li>(3) yes, a Govern Water Control Area has been proclaimed by Proclamation No. 276 of 1957; under this proclamation the Minister controls the abstraction of water from the Blyde River in terms of Section 62 of the Water Act;

<ol>

<li>(a) existing works which, at the time of proclamation, were being lawfully and beneficially used have been recognized and permits for the use thereof have been issued in terms of Section 62 (1) (b) of the Water Act while permits for new works have been issued in terms of Section 62 (2);</li>

<li>(b) to promote the proper development of irrigation by use of the waters of the Blyde River and because I felt that the Blyde River was of national importance and that the time was ripe to institute control measures as envisaged by the Water Act;</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(4) no;</li>

<li>(5) no; because, in terms of the proclamation of the control area, riparian rights were revoked and were replaced by rights conferred by the Minister by virtue of Section 62 of the Water Act, because the Water Act empowers the Minister to proclaim, in the public interest, a river such as the Blyde River as a Government Water Control Area by virtue of which riparian rights, as such, lapse, because this is in accordance with the principle of <i>dominus fluminis,</i> because the Act requires the Minister to recognize existing lawful and beneficial development, as previously mentioned this has been done and because the Act does not provide that the Minister should offer compensation to riparian owners who have abstracted more than the fair share in terms of their riparian rights.</li>

<speech by="#warren">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite obvious to this side of the House that the hon. the Minister wants to rush this legislation through the House to meet specific demands. Those demands came from a section of the milk producers in the Transvaal and also from the banana producers. It would appear that those demands were quite urgent judging by the correspondence that has been received by many of us. I do not think, however, that there was such urgency that this Bill should not have been submitted to the scrutiny to which it should have been submitted in its earlier stages. Sir, while the Minister may meet the demands of those people in this Bill, he has taken powers which are far in excess of the powers that we think he should have taken. He may apply this legislation to products that we feel it should not be applied. Applications may be made from time to time for this legislation to be applied to such a product. These were our fears then and they are still our fears. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that these extreme clauses should not be applied without the necessary consultation and with- out the closest investigation. These cases demand special attention because they may cause grave dissatisfaction and they may certainly cause financial commitments that may be embarrassing to the producers. There is also the fact&#x2014;and it has been admitted by the Minister&#x2014;that in some instances sufficient consideration is not being given to the cost of production of various commodities before applying these schemes. The application of these schemes might reasonably eliminate the production of very useful commodities or foodstuffs in areas which lend themselves to their production. I can give the Minister an instance where you have practically the complete elimination of a superior quality of beef as a result of the application of the meat scheme to that particular area. That area produced that product for a period of time to meet the shortage of meat in the whole of the Western Province. That area has now been practically eliminated as a superior beef-producing area. I want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for having given me the undertaking to investigate the anomalies, the irregularities and the prejudices that exist in the distribution of certain dairy products. I want to express the hope that when the Minister has made that investigation, he will at least apply those quotas more equitably than they have been applied in the past.</p>

<p>There is one other important clause in this Bill, and I make no apologies for referring to it again&#x2014;it was referred to by an hon. member over here&#x2014;and that is the clause under which monopolies may be established, either by cooperative societies or boards. Sir, we have examined the particular clauses in this Bill, and it is quite obvious that they are in conflict with the Monopolies Act as it exists now. At no far distant date the hon. the Minister will either have to amend this legislation that we have before us to-day or the Monopolies Act, because he cannot go on in this way. Under the old Act there was still a prospect of cooperative societies and boards establishing monopolies against the producers and the consumers. In view of the granting of these additional powers I think it is our duty to ask the Minister to see to it that the recklessness that we have had in the past is not experienced in the future; that he will at least put his foot down and stop that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Sir, we are going to vote against this Bill. We feel that we are justified in doing so, because it is a rushed measure that is being put through without the necessary investigation having taken place and the Minister has refused to allow it to go to a Select Committee &#x2026;</p>

Sir, the position is <span class="col_5523-5524" refersTo="page_1358"/>simply that there is a lot of uneasiness to-day amongst organized bodies. There is a feeling that the Marketing Act is going further than it should. Only yesterday a lengthy report appeared in the Press asking for the control of certain of the control boards and of the application of their measures to certain parts of the country. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will take due notice of the fears that have been expressed by sections of organized agriculture for the future.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House support the Marketing Act; we stand for orderly marketing in the country and we therefore feel that it will be a sad day when the Marketing Act is watered down to such an extent that it will no longer have any force. We know that the chambers of commerce have been trying for years to water down the Marketing Act to such an extent that it will be of no further use. The hon. member referred to monopolies. The co-operatives, as you know, do not fall under the Monopolies Act. We have fought hard for the exemption of the co-operatives and are very sorry to see that the hon. members opposite are now trying to destroy the good work which the co-operatives have done in South Africa. My hon. friend, through the remarks he made here, is destroying the farmers&#x2019; organizations, like the Marketing Council and the co-operatives, to such an extent that the commercial people could again come along with their old cry of cheap food. I do not want to say too much about this matter. The hon. the Minister has put his case very clearly. I am sorry that my hon. friend in mentioning monopolies did not name the monopolies which he thinks exist. If he did that then we would have had a beautiful fight among their own ranks, but the hon. member did not name them; he just spoke in general but still he attacked the co-operatives. I just want to say that this side of the House stands by the Marketing Act and supports the Bill. The hon. the Minister did not ask for any powers which he did not have before. The whole purpose of the Bill is to set the matter beyond all doubt and to correct small mistakes which exist at present. I do not want to say any more in this connection but I repeat that this side of the House supports the hon. the Minister and the farmers. We stand by the Agricultural Union and by the Marketing Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cope">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COPE</person>:</from>

<p>I think that the remarks just passed by the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) ar&#x00E9; most unfortunate. They will create a very bad effect throughout the whole country and among people who should be his friends and who wish to be his friends. Sir, the whole system of marketing stands on a tripod, and this tripod is the producer, the distributor and the consumer. The goodwill of the distributor and the consumer is as important for the happy working of the Marketing Act as the goodwill of the producer. We must all try to get on a basis of good relationships, and remarks such as those passed by the hon. member for Cradock are not conducive to that. I feel that with the passage of this Bill to amend the Marketing Act, the time has come to say to the hon. the Minister that a red light is shining to-day, and the hon. the Minister has a great responsibility upon him to heed this light. The responsibility upon him is to hold the balance fairly between the three legs of the tripod that I have just mentioned. I feel that the effect of this Bill will be to throw this tripod a little off balance. Sir, it is significant that none of the recommendations put forward to the Minister in regard to this Bill by the Associated Chambers of Commerce have been heeded&#x2014;not one. Those recommendations were put forward in a spirit of complete sincerity in order to improve the workings of this very complex business of marketing primary produce, and not one has been heeded.</p>

<p>The effect, for instance, of sub-sections (a) and (b) of Clause 7 will be, when this Bill goes through, to open the road to discrimination between one group of producers and another. Then the effect of sub-section (g) of Clause 7 will be to allow the boards to purchase and resell packing materials. This will have the effect of opening wider the door to trading by co-operatives, and it is necessary, Sir, to keep a check on the extent to which cooperatives are allowed to trade. Then as regards Clause 8, the effect of sub-section (1) (b) will be to provide exemptions from one-channel schemes, and while commerce does not like the principle of one-channel schemes, if they have to be applied, it is feared that through the system of exemptions provided here, the door will be opened to favouritism. When the element of favouritism comes in, a very grave danger is created. Commerce feels that it is a great pity that this clause has been introduced. Then there is sub-section (1) (b) of Clause 8 which gives powers to certain of the boards to prohibit the storing of produce in cold storage. We know the reasons which were advanced by the hon. the Minister and we know the difficulties of the special case that he has in mind, and we sympathize with him. Nevertheless, the point now is that this power is of a widespread kind, and it can <span class="col_5525-5526" refersTo="page_1359"/>lead to a restraint on private enterprise, a restraint in a very important sector of the economy, Sir, and I feel that is most unfortunate. Then there is the effect of sub-section (b) of Clause 19. That is also very unfortunate. Here the principle is introduced of the seizure of machinery in the case of a transgressor. Commerce does not like that. It feels that this is a power which is going too far; it feels that if transgressors have to be punished by the courts, other means of punishment should be sought, and this principle of seizing machinery is something commerce does not like. It could even kick back ultimately on the producer if the same principle is extended to the producer, and I wonder how many farmers would feel happy if the principle of penalties for certain offences was the seizure of their machinery. Commerce certainly does not like it and is unhappy that it should have been included.</p>

<p>So, Sir, in conclusion I want to say once again to the hon. the Minister that he has the great responsibility of holding the balance fairly in a private enterprise economy, and I would say that this Bill starts the red light shining. The hon. the Minister who has a wider responsibility than just to the producer, who has a responsibility for the whole economy, must heed that light. On his shoulders falls this responsibility and he must see to it that there are not further and unwarranted transgressions upon the field of private enterprise.</p>

<p>It is now becoming very clear what hon. members opposite fear and what they are fighting for. We on this side of the House, who to a great extent represent agriculture and who perhaps see the position more from the point of view of agriculture and of the producer, feel that this amendment to the Marketing Act is not only essential because it will improve the Act considerably and facilitate its smooth implementation, but we are glad that it is being amended in this way because it will mean greater stability for us. Because hon. members opposite have said so much and yet so little&#x2014;I am referring to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) who unfortunately would not reply to a question from me which sought greater clarity about a statement he made&#x2014;I find it difficult to express in words what the hon. member actually meant. I do not want to attribute incorrect words or motives or ideas to the hon. member because I do not want to do him an injustice, but when he says that &#x201C; recklessness in certain instances must be eliminated &#x201D; I am not quite clear as to what he means. Does the hon. member mean that certain co-operative instances have overstepped the mark?</p>

<speech by="#schoonbee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>If that is so then I want to state that no organization, whether it is commerce, agriculture or mining, has any hope of success in South Africa unless it has the right to organize its business properly, and what the hon. member is referring to now is something which does not concern us in the north so much as may be the case here in the south, but I would like to point out that the principle remains the same throughout South Africa, and it makes no difference whether it is a control board or a co-operative. If it has not got full control then it cannot achieve any success. But what the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Cope) said was even more revealing. One is easily misled so and I am impressed by the sympathetic manner and the sympathetic words of the hon. member for Parktown time and again. I was very impressed by the moderation with which the hon. member treated agriculture. But in that was hidden an ominous sign of what was revealed here this morning. There is a dangerous sting in what the hon. member advocates. Mr. Speaker, year after year an annual dinner is held in the northern provinces by the Federated Chambers of Industry in Johannesburg to which certain Members of Parliament are invited and among others I was also invited, and year after year one attack after another is made on organized agriculture as represented by the co-operatives.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if you will permit me I wish to reply to what the hon. member Said, &#x201C; the red light js now shining&#x201D;, and I want to ask what red light can shine if organized agriculture is protected by this Bill. The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has stated so clearly that this side of the House supports the Marketing Act and it is a favourite phrase of the hon. member there that &#x201C; the Marketing Act is the Magna Charta of the farmer &#x201D;, and so it is. It cannot be repeated often enough. Now we have before us amending legislation to strengthen the implementation of the Marketing Act and when we hear that &#x201C; the red light is now shining &#x201D;, we would like to know what red light it is. When one comes down the street and the red light is shining one knows that it means danger and that one should stop. Now the hon. member wants to indicate that we should stop in regard to the Marketing Act and that this Bill should not be adopted because &#x201C; the red light is shining &#x201D;. The danger signs are there. What danger signs? I think it is time a warning should be issued to organized commerce in this country that the producer feels more and more that the time has come for him to organize himself completely. I do not think it is unbecoming for me to say that throughout the length and breadth of South Africa the farmer feels all the more that the time will come for him to organize himself completely, so much so that when I go to my co-operative in the morning <span class="col_5527-5528" refersTo="page_1360"/>I should be able to buy there whatever I require for my farm. I do not want to go to a half-dozen places when I go to town; I want to go to my co-operative and there I want to get whatever I require. The time will come when the farmer will insist on it because commerce is talking about co-operatives being favoured. Let us compete with each other on an equal basis, and do not let it be in their favour. I do not think the hon. member for Parktown did organized commerce a service by his utterances here this morning. Why are the people in organized commerce scared? Allow me to point out that there was a time in the history of our country when the farmer was really the hewer of wood and the drawer of water in South Africa, when he could not hold his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with respect, do you not want to see the Marketing Act have the effect of a general improvement in the position of organized agriculture? Is that not what is envisaged in the Bill? And that is what I am pleading for. As a young boy I witnessed the ceaseless struggle of the farmer to make a living. That was the position not only in South Africa but throughout the world until the farmer also learned to organize himself, and it was during the time that this Opposition was in power that legislation was introduced to protect this important section of the economy of South Africa, namely agriculture. Agriculture is a huge industry to-day, larger than the mining industry, and the income the State derives from agriculture and the number of people who are employed in it and who earn their livelihood from it is far greater than that received from the mining industry, and one so often hears that the mining industry should be protected. I therefore repeat that the hon. member for Park-town has not done organized agriculture as such a service at all and I think the time has come for us to state that we stand by this legislation and that we want to organize the economy as well as possible and that we want to streamline marketing as far as possible, and thereby acknowledge the principle that the farmer has the right to control the marketing of his own product. That time is coming and commerce should not be so quick to find fault with our activities, as interpreted by the hon. member for Parktown. We welcome this legislation. We do not see any &#x201C; red light &#x201D; shining. On the contrary, we see the green light for the farmers in South Africa. Their position will continue to improve as they get more and more control over the marketing of their products. They will have the say over their own business and it does not behove hon. members opposite to try and influence legislation of this nature in such a way or to try and obstruct it. We welcome it, we are happy.</p>

<p>We will vote against the third reading of this Bill because the effects of this Bill when applied take away the right of the primary producers to having complete control of the sale and marketing of their own produce. We have managed to get the hon. the Minister to put in some words to protect the primary producer if a pool is being run by a marketing board, in Clause 8 (1) (e) (i) where we proved to the hon. the Minister that the Bill as it was worded at the second reading created a hardship on the primary producer if owing to climatic conditions he fell short in the delivery of his product to that pool on an estimated quantity of crops, or a number of stock to the meat market. The hon. Minister met us in that, but I am very sorry that other points which affect the primary producer having full control as he has under the Marketing Act as it stands to-day, that is that any scheme shall be accepted by the specific organization representing the primary producers of a specific product, is now taken away and vested in the Minister. The Minister under this Bill can recognize other agricultural bodies or agricultural boards, other than the one representative of the producers dealing with a specific product. Therefore this Bill as it is now before us definitely takes away the rights of the primary producer to control his interests in his product and to see that any marketing scheme which controls his marketing is in his interest. That should be a matter over which he has a full say. It can now be vested in other people. This amending Bill actually goes so far that where a scheme has been put before the producers under the present marketing scheme, has been voted on by the producers and where the producers have turned it down, now under this amended scheme the Minister has the power to ignore that voting. Mr. Speaker, I think that is definitely very serious interference with the rights of the producers under the Marketing Act which was brought into being to allow the primary producer to protect his own livelihood and to control his own product. Mr. Speaker, I want to deal entirely with the effect of the Bill as it is before us now. I want to warn the hon. the Minister that if he applies these provisions and if he takes full advantage of the provisions of this Bill, he is running a great risk. I cannot see the hon. the Minister introducing a Bill and asking for powers unless he intends to apply them under certain conditions, and I say that the hon. the Minister is going to make the producer feel that the Marketing Act with these amendments is now to be used against him and not in his interest. I have no objection to co-operatives bring forward a scheme, because under the present Marketing Act a scheme must be submitted to the producers. Under the present Act, without the amendments, I cannot see how a scheme can ever be applied where the producers themselves do not want such a scheme. But here the Minister is given specific powers to ignore all votings in respect of any of the schemes which have been turned <span class="col_5529-5530" refersTo="page_1361"/>down by the producers. That is the main point here. There are other minor points in regard to rights given to the Minister. There is, for instance, a retrospective clause about which I am not very happy, because it gives the Minister the right to do certain things retrospectively. But I do not want to go into the details, I wanted to confine myself to this major point, because to my mind this is under-mining the whole of the principles of the original Marketing Act. The hon. Minister shakes his head. Why is he taking these powers? Why does he require the right to ignore the voting of the producers in relation to schemes that have been submitted to them? I ask the Minister specifically whether he will give an undertaking that no milk scheme is to be introduced which was voted on and turned down in an area where the producers of fresh milk have shown that they do not want such a scheme applied to them because voluntary schemes were working satisfactorily in their interest, without the high cost of a control board. Will the hon. the Minister give us that undertaking? Then I will feel very much happier about it. The hon. Minister does not want to give us that specific undertaking. Therefore he intends to use these rights. I say therefore that he is undermining the whole of the principles of the original Marketing Act and the rights enshrined there to protect the primary producer to control the marketing of his own particular product under the Marketing Act. Therefore we are voting against the third reading because in our opinion its effect on the present Marketing Act is not to the benefit of the agricultural community and the primary producer of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I found it interesting to listen to hon. members opposite, and in particular to the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Cope), when they laid so much emphasis on the desirability of good relations between the producer and the consumer.</p>

<p>I do not think that one could have put up a poorer case in connection with the sympathy towards farmers than was advanced by the hon. member here this morning. The effect of this measure was repeatedly pointed out here, particularly in respect of the milk producers. Mr. Speaker, we are living in an age of controlled economy, and if there are still people who think that the country&#x2019;s economy could be controlled and developed soundly without proper control, then I am afraid that they are living in the wrong country. The real object of this Bill is to restore sound control where the balance has been disturbed, and, in this connection, I refer to the marketing of milk in particular. Experience has proved that good control is absolutely essential as far as milk is concerned, and that is why the farmers urged the hon. the Minister to apply it. I am sorry that the hon. member for Parktown is not here at the moment, because I want to refer to one of the three branches of marketing which he emphasized so much, namely distribution. I just want to show what sense of duty and sense of responsibility has been shown by distributors recently in connection with this industry. As far as the marketing of milk on the Rand is concerned, there was the situation where some distributors bought milk at 1s. 9d. per gallon, while the fixed price was 2s. lid., and now I challenge the hon. member for Parktown to prove that the consumers derived any benefit from it. Here was a case where, not only the farmer and the producer were harmed in practice, but where any possible benefit of price competition was not granted to the consumer either. Here we now have the example where the hon. the Minister, urged by his sense of responsibility, feels that it is the moral duty of the State towards its commercial community that where a disturbance in connection with the prices of consumer goods takes place, an unhealthy disturbance, he should act in order to restore the balance. When the position was that milk was distributed by depots situated, perhaps, a quarter mile apart and the one can purchase the milk at 1s. 9d. per gallon and the other at 2s. lid., but it is being sold at the same price, then it is an immoral deed which such a commercial group is committing towards the producer and the consumer, and it is then the duty of the hon. Minister responsible to step in in such a case and to restore the balance. These sweet sounding words like balance and free competition and socialism should rather be coupled with the facts and less with generalities as was done by hon. members opposite. The object of this Bill is to impose control in the interests of all groups concerned with such an article. I repeat that it is the moral duty of the hon. the Minister to ensure that prices of goods do not vary every 24 hours or from month to month as the controlling group may decide, and in this instance I refer specifically to the distributors of milk. I think the consumers are very grateful to the hon. the Minister. In this regard he has not only got our full support, but we eagerly look forward to his further steps in this direction, namely, to impose more efficient control in respect of the marketing of agricultural products. I want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will also devote attention to the idea of decentralization which has been expressed, particularly in regard to perishable goods on the Johannesburg market. In this connection I want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will give his fullest attention to this matter because there is utter chaos&#x2014;and I can advance irrefutable proof in regard to the marketing of perishable fruit and vegetables, just as strong proof as in connection with milk. I do not want to waste the time of the House by giving proof in connection with fruit and vegetables. I want to conclude by expressing the hope that when the hon. the Minister gives attention to the moving and the development of the Johannesburg market, which handles fruit and vegetables in the main, he will give particular attention <span class="col_5531-5532" refersTo="page_1362"/>to the possibility of giving the consumers, who are to-day the prey of buyers&#x2019; monopolies, the opportunity of having the exclusive right of making private purchases for a stipulated period each day, from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. or from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m., and that buyers will only thereafter be given the opportunity of buying in bulk. In practice the individual and the consumer has no chance today of buying fresh fruit and vegetables on the Johannesburg market at a competitive or a reasonable price. The principle of decentralization, in order to bring the market to the consumers, is a sound one, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will consider it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>There is something that struck me very much in connection with the criticism of this Bill which is now before the House, viz. that objection is now being raised to practices which have been accepted, which have been generally accepted, since the passing of the Marketing Act. Registration was limited to prevent over-trading; schemes were introduced in regard to which no voting took place because the 1951 Act provided for that. For all these years certain boards were allowed in specific circumstances to purchase boxes and containers to sell to their producers. For all these years the South African Agricultural Union was regarded as one of the bodies which could submit a scheme. These things have always been done, and there was never any criticism by any hon. member opposite to those actions in terms of the Marketing Act. Because we now have a little doubt as to where those powers were specifically provided in the Act, we now insert those provisions in the Act in order to provide for what has been done all this time under the Marketing Act, so as to legalize those practices. That is all this Bill does, except for one other minor principle. Now hon. members opposite pretend that a whole series of new powers are being granted to the control boards, powers which they never had in the past. That is not the case.</p>

<p>I just want to come back to the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Cope). It seems to me he is the shadow Minister of Agriculture of the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown objected to registration being limited, and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) also referred to it. He said that the farmers now wanted to force this limitation of registration on to commerce. It has never been the farmers who asked for limited registration of butcher shops, bakeries and mills. It was always commerce itself which asked for it, because in some of these industries there was such keen competition amongst traders that they could not make a living. It is they who want this limited registration, and, because we think that it is in everybody&#x2019;s interest that in certain respects registration should be limited, therefore that practice was adopted. All we are doing in this Bill is just to make sure that the Act in fact provides for it. That practice has always been followed.</p>

<p>Now hon. members talk about monopolies, and they say there is a difference between the policy of the Minister of Agricultural Economics and that of the Minister of Economic Affairs. Commerce, which the hon. member says he represents, continually goes to the Minister of Economic Affairs to persuade him to limit registration in order to avoid overtrading, e.g. in the case of petrol filling stations. They ask for it every day. They have just sent a special deputation to him to ask him to do so. They under-cut each other to such an extent that the business becomes uneconomic to them. The Minister of Economic Affairs said that he would consider it and would do so. Now the hon. member says that this is a monopoly. But this limitation of registration, in order to prevent overtrading, has been in existence since the Marketing Act was amended in 1951. What monopolies have developed in recent years? If, e.g. there are two butcher shops in a certain place and the one buys out the other, the Control Board immediately grants registration to another to open business. There is no question of monopolies as the result of limiting registration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) has been voicing the same objections for days already. I just want to deal with one of the objections raised by the hon. member in connection with the implementation of this Act. He again objected to the S.A. Agricultural Union submitting a scheme, and secondly, he objected to the abolition of the provisions in regard to voting. If the Minister now wants to institute a scheme on the advice of anybody, and he wants to go contrary to the interests of the farmers, as the hon. member alleges, if the Minister wants to use the S.A. Agricultural Union to submit a scheme so that he can act contrary to the interests of the farmers or those of particular producers, then I want to point out to the hon. member that as the Act reads now&#x2014;not this amendment, but the principle Act&#x2014;provides that the Minister may allow a scheme to be drafted and have it investigated by the Marketing Council. He can then ignore the provisions in regard to voting, and if he is certain that it is in the interest of the industry and that the majority of the producers want it, he can introduce a scheme. Now the hon. member does not want the S.A. Agricultural Union to have the right to submit a scheme to the Minister, because he is afraid that the Minister will use the S.A. Agricultural Union to act contrary to the interests of the producers. But he is not afraid that the <span class="col_5533-5534" refersTo="page_1363"/>Minister will use the power he himself has, without consulting the S.A. Agricultural Union, to institute a scheme which will be contrary to the interests of the producers. I really do not understand those hon. members. Hon. members should study the Marketing Act and notice what tremendously wide powers it gives to the Minister. To some extent those powers are being limited, because it is now being provided here that the Minister should rather consult with the S.A. Agricultural Union instead of submitting such a scheme himself. No, the hon. member says that this now gives the Minister dictatorial powers to do something which is against the interests of the farmer.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Even without amending this Act, the Minister can to-day institute any scheme. We are just not sure on this point of whether it can be the same scheme in regard to which voting has already taken place. But the Minister can have any new scheme drafted and submit it to the Marketing Council for investigation. If he is then convinced that the producers are willing to accept that scheme and that it is in the interest of the industry, he can institute it without any voting taking place. All that this amendment means is that a scheme in regard to which voting has already taken place can be instituted without any further voting. That is all the Bill now provides for.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asks whether the Minister intended enforcing a scheme on the fresh milk producers of Natal. But the Marketing Act is not there to enforce people to come under control. The Act provides that the producers themselves should decide whether they want control. The Minister must make sure that the people want it and that it is in their interest. He must cause meetings to be held and call the producers together. He must judge according to those meetings whether the producers want it. Surely it is inconceivable that the hon. member should now ask whether I will force a scheme on the producers, whether they want it or not. I suppose the hon. member thinks that neither the Minister nor the Marketing Council have any sense of responsibility. He must think that all these bodies are irresponsible. The majority of amendments contained in this Bill refer to practices which were followed in the past. The intention is merely to make certain that when cases go to court the Act will specifically provide these powers. I hope hon. members will accept it like that. If they now want to vote against the third reading and against the interests of the producers, they must just do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, last night when this Vote was being discussed, we experienced something in this Committee which puzzled me. I was so taken aback that I could not react immediately to the attitude adopted by and the behaviour of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Plewman). There was an atmosphere of peace in the Committee and one compliment after another was paid across the floor of the House. It was very pleasant, because the previous debate had been carried on on a very high level. It was introduced on that level by the Opposition and that is how it concluded. Then this debate came on end the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) thought this was the opportunity for him to raise a matter and to try to embarrass the Minister by discussing the Bantu Education Account, something for which the Minister is not wholly responsible because that account is controlled by the Treasury. What the hon. member tried to do was to continue the Budget debate. Now, if somebody does that because he does not know any better, I would forgive him. But it was repeatedly pointed out to the hon. member that he should not discuss the matter, and he repeatedly said that he was not discussing it. He repeatedly told the Chairman that he was not discussing it; he was just raising certain points. The attitude adopted by the hon. member was strongly deprecated. I think it is one of the most deplorable speeches I have ever heard. It was an attempt to evade the rules of debate in Committee.</p>

He did not say anything about the policy of education; he continued making an analysis and tried to quote figures and he gave a false picture of the position.

<p>If only the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) had known what Vote he was discussing, it would have been better, but he never had the dignity of Bantu education in mind and he said things here which derogated from the standard of the debate.</p>

<p>But I go further. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) pretended to be na&#x00EF;ve. He discussed the matter, and I had every confidence, as I have always had, that he would keep it on the level on which education should be held. He, for example, tried to indicate certain methods by which the Department is supposed to save money, because the expansion is greater than is provided for by the funds voted. He mentioned, for example, the saving on the food fund. He said that the choice was put to the parents: You can have food or you can have education. And then the parents very bravely said: We choose education. The food he referred to is that penny orange per day per child which we had. It was such a ridiculous thing when one thinks of the penny per child per day! But that is not all. An official visited one of the schools and found four pots of mealies and one pot of meat. I suppose it was &#x201C; kaboe &#x201D; mealies. The mealies were distributed to the children but not the meat. Then the official asked the principal who was present: What about that meat? The principal replied: No, the ox which treads the sheaves should not be muzzled. The staff take the meat. But the same question which arose in the minds of the parents, which was mentioned by the hon. member for Kensington, arose in our minds when we took over Bantu education. We asked ourselves: What is the best way of utilizing these funds? And the first reply, which was Priority No. 1, is that the Bantu child should be educated and be properly educated. That was the standpoint of the parents, and that badly controlled school-feeding system was sacrificed in order to give <span class="col_5537-5538" refersTo="page_1365"/>the child an education. There was no attempt &#x2014;I strenuously deny it&#x2014;to get expansion and large numbers of pupils at the cost of the child&#x2019;s food. That was not the intention, nor was it the motive at all.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member goes further and says we employ married women on the staff. The White schools also employ married women. I do not want to discuss the question of staff now. But where we use women up to std. 5, in the Bantu school it is only up to Std. 2. Let the hon. member for Kensington deny that. But last night he pretended to be na&#x00EF;ve. When these matters were being discussed he adopted a childish attitude, and that derogated from the debate. Four hon. members jumped up one after another, and not one of them said half as much as any hon. member on either side of the House said in a previous debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) has confined himself to making an unjustifiable personal attack upon the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Plewman), but he has not attempted to reply to any of the important financial issues that were raised by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) in his very able contribution to this debate. I think it is quite obvious that the hon. member for Witbank did not understand the financial implications that were involved, so I shall leave the matter there.</p>

<p>When the House adjourned last night, I was dealing with the lack of qualified teachers in Bantu schools and colleges and the danger of the suggestion that has been made that the department is planning to take over the matriculation for Bantu students in about two years. Now I wish to ask the House to let us look at what is happening in the two Bantu university colleges at Ngoya and Turfloop, which are referred to in Item N of the Estimates. The future progress of these two university colleges is interlocked with the secondary schools and the training of teacher-students with which I have already dealt. In the first place these colleges should never have been established where they are, stuck away in the Native reserves, far from the main urban centres from which most of the post-matriculation students have hitherto been drawn. Ngova is 100 miles from Durban, and Turfloop is 750 miles from Johannesburg, and what students there are are cut off from all academic contacts with the European universities and all their advantages, and the danger is that these Bantu colleges, without the leavening influence of the White universities, will become breeding-grounds for dissatisfaction and African nationalism. At the Natal University, when Bantu students were admitted there, the intake was approximately 30 a year. In 1959 the figure was 34 In 1960, as the result of the change in policy, not a single Bantu student was allowed to go there, but only six went to Ngova. What happened to the remaining 24 may be left to the imagination. The fact is that the situation of these two colleges makes university study for most Natives financially impossible. Hitherto, with the university facilities at their doorstep, they undertook part-time employment and their earnings enabled them to pay their way at the university, but by siting these colleges many miles away in the reserves, the Minister has deprived these students of any further opportunity of acquiring higher education. The results at these colleges for the first-year degree courses have been as disquieting as those of the matriculation classes at the secondary schools. According to the figures supplied by the Minister and his Department, at Ngoya, with 41 students, only two passed. Of these 41 students only 23 are matriculated. At Turfloop, of 41 students only six passed. These colleges are costing immense sums of money, not only in capital outlay but in running costs. The capital outlay at Ngova and Turfloop amounts to a total of R800,000. The cost of salaries and other current expenses for 1960 came to R268.000, and the estimated cost for 1961, according to the Minister&#x2019;s figures, is R464.600. That means that for 1960 the cost per student, apart from capital expenditure, was in the neighbourhood of R7.400, and for 1961 it is estimated roughly at R3.800 per student, thirteen times as much as it took to educate a Bantu student at the University of Natal.</p>

<p>In answer to a question put by the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp), the Minister gave the figure as R1,724 per student. I think his calculations are wrong, but in any case that is bad enough. Little wonder that one of our most eminent educationists should have described these colleges as &#x201C; huge ideological <span class="col_5539-5540" refersTo="page_1366"/>white elephants run at an exorbitant cost to the taxpayer before making sure that there would be the necessary intake of students all due, I would add, to the fact that in their haste the Department did not provide for adequate trained staff. I am afraid the position is likely to remain as it is for a long time to come. What has happened is this. Under the missions secondary and teacher training institutions at places like Lovedale and Adam&#x2019;s Mission, they were largely staffed by experienced White mission teachers, men and women who had devoted their lives to their work. Since then, as the result of the Government&#x2019;s policy, many of these White teachers have left and the gap has been filled by Bantu teachers who do not possess the necessary background. Added to this, the supply of graduate Bantu teachers is being reduced to a minimum by the Government&#x2019;s prohibition against Bantu students being trained at the Universities of the Witwatersrand and at Cape Town and in Natal. The money that is being spent on the Government&#x2019;s featherbrained scheme of ethnic colleges, could, I submit, have been much more usefully spent in laying better educational foundations in the secondary schools.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to a statement made by Prof. J. J. Ross, the Rector of Fort Hare, in regard to this state of affairs. He gave an interview to the Press as reported in the <i>Evening Post</i> of 25 February, and this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Professor J. J. Ross, Rector of Fort Hare, said to-day there was obviously something very wrong somewhere in the present system of Bantu education. Prof. Ross commented on the drop in the last few years in the number of African students who obtained matriculation exemption certificates &#x2014;28 at the end of last year, compared with 164 in 1956. He called for a thorough and scientific research into the causes of the high percentage of failures. The Psychology Department at Fort Hare was already preparing for such research. &#x201C; We are naturally very disappointed in the small numbers who obtain exemptions. This obviously indicates there is something very wrong somewhere. We are very worried&#x2014; this is a serious position,&#x201D; said Prof. Ross. &#x201C; One of the main reasons for the sudden drop was the fact that examiners for the Joint Matriculation Board were not in sufficiently close touch with the schools, the teachers and the tuition received by the pupils. Before Bantu schools were taken over by the Department of Bantu Education, pupils wrote the different provincial senior certificate examinations. These examinations were set and marked by men who were either teachers or who had been teachers in the schools. They knew intimately what the pupils had been taught. It is obvious the Bantu fared better under the provincial system,&#x201D; Prof. Ross said. Another contributory difficulty was the finding of suitable Bantu teachers to replace the many White teachers who withdrew from Bantu schools during the last few years. There were not sufficient suitable qualified Bantu teachers to take their places. Prof. Ross said pupils also faced the big hurdle when they were required to take either English or Afrikaans in the &#x201C; A &#x201D; grade for the matriculation exemption. They found it very difficult.</block>

<p>That is a very grave indictment against the system which is carried on by the Minister and his Department. It is a grotesque pattern of education, another apartheid muddle due to the hasty elimination of the missionaries and the European staffs before sufficient Bantu teachers had been trained to take their places.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat delivered a tirade here last night in connection with the matriculation results, and again this morning in regard to the tremendously high costs connected to the Bantu universities. To deal with last night first, it is obvious and logical that any small university finds that the unit cost per student initially is higher than in the case of the large universities. All the facilities and the staff have to be provided, the courses have to be offered, and the number of students is small in the beginning, and that is the difficulty of all our small universities. If only the hon. member would have the patience to give these universities a few years&#x2019; time, I am convinced that he himself will be able to quote figures here to prove the opposite of what he said to-day.</p>

<p>In regard to the matriculation results, which I really want to discuss, I want to say immediately that, on the face of it, these results are certainly not encouraging, but there are many reasons for it, and there is no necessity to appoint a commission or to do research into the underlying reasons for it. The reasons are purely practical ones, as I shall try to show. I want to compare the matriculation results last year with the Std. VIII results last year, and I want to give the following facts in that connection. I really want to take three years, 1954, 1958 and 1960, and I want to take the junior certificate results for those three years. We find the following. In 1954 7,130 students wrote. Of these, 3,340 passed, or 46.89 per cent, of whom 323 passed first class, or 3.25 per cent. That was in 1954, one year after Bantu education took over. In 1958, four years later, we had the following position. There were 9,680 candidates, of whom 4,797 passed, or 49.56 per cent. Of these 346 passed first class, or 3.58 per cent, which is already an appreciable improvement. In 1960, the year in which the matriculation candidates fared so badly, there were the following results for Std. VIII. There were 10,562 candidates, 5,490 passed, or 51.98 per cent, and there were 371 who passed first class, or 3.51 per cent. Now I want to put this very clearly to the hon. member in regard to the matriculation <span class="col_5541-5542" refersTo="page_1367"/>results about which he is so concerned. The first reason for it is that the matriculants in this year were not the responsibility of this Department right from the beginning. The foundations for those students were laid in the years before Bantu education took over. They were in Std. Ill when Bantu education took over in 1953. It is therefore logical that the foundations were laid in the private schools, and the foundation on which the building had to be erected later was not strong enough to bear it.</p>

<p>But I want to make a different comparison. I want to compare the same results of 1959 and 1960 of the Bantu education examination with those conducted by other examining bodies, and I find the following. Under Bantu education in 1959 6,807 students were entered, and under the other examining bodies 2,436 were entered. In the first-mentioned case, 3,031 passed and in the other case 926. The percentage of passes under Bantu education was 44.4 per cent, and for the others 38 per cent. But in 1960 the picture was very much worse. In 1960, last year, the year the hon. member found so dark, 8,725 students were entered for the Bantu Education examination in Std. VIII, of which 4,900 passed, or 56.1 per cent. As against that, 1,837 were entered with other examining bodies, of whom only 590 passed, or 32.1 per cent, as compared with 56.1 per cent under Bantu education. Under Bantu education 4 per cent passed first class, as against 1.1 per cent with the other bodies. These figures show the opposite side of the picture painted by the hon. member.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further reason why these conditions arose. In 1958 the Department decided that the standards of the joint Matriculation Board would be adopted as the standard of matriculation, in order to raise the standard and to make it uniform. This higher standard resulted in further failures over and above the average for previous years.</p>

<p>But I want to mention another reason why the results last year were not so good. Formerly, when they were private schools, it happened in many places that educational institutions, in order to maintain their reputation, in order to have the reputation that the school achieved very good results, did not allow a child to pass Std. VIII or Std. IX unless they were convinced that he could pass Std. X. That was the general practice in those days and it is still being followed in some schools, that if a student, in the opinion of his teacher, will not be able to pass Std. X he is not allowed to continue and to go in for matriculation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Do you say they are being kept back in Std. IX?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>To keep the reputation of the school high, he is not allowed to enter for the examination. It is possible, by means of this process of sifting, to achieve brilliant matriculation results, but where the Department now adopts the attitude that the student who passes Std. VIII goes on to Std. IX and then he is given an opportunity to prove that he can pass matric, and if one of those students now passes matric, when they thought he would fail, then I say the Department&#x2019;s policy is perfectly correct not to sift them out beforehand, because we are not interested in institutions; we are interested in the results achieved and in what the child can do. We are not interested in upholding the reputation of a school; we are interested in seeing how many students we can give education to. Does the hon. member want to tell me that he advocates this sifting? In Std. IX he has to pass judged by the ordinary Std. IX standard, but he should not be judged by the ordinary Std. X standard, and he should not be kept back for the sake of the reputation of the school. That is an injustice to the child.</p>

<p>There is another argument, the question of the low standard of the staff, something which the hon. member for East London (City) is continually emphasizing. Let me say that the Minister immediately admits that he finds difficulty in obtaining the right staff, but there are many good reasons for this. Since the passing of the Bantu Education Act in 1953 school boards were appointed and school board secretaries had to be appointed, and who qualified for those posts? The most suitable people to be appointed as secretaries were some of the good teachers, and they were taken out of education and appointed to those posts to exercise control there. That attracted an appreciable number of teachers. In the meantime sub-inspectors were appointed for all the schools throughout the Union, and the best teachers became sub-inspectors. It is, therefore, logical that there was a drainage of Bantu teachers, and it is, therefore, obvious also that in the meantime we do not have the necessary teachers available. But in the meantime Bantu education was dependent on teachers who had to be trained at the so-called open universities and teachers&#x2019; colleges, and what courses did the open universities offer them? What did they receive bursaries for? For practical subjects which they could teach in order to help their own people? No, just the opposite. They were offered bursaries in political science so as to become agitators against the Whites, rather than to get a practical background by means of which they could render services to their own people. I, therefore, say it is the task of these Bantu universities which have now been established to educate practical educationists, with practical subjects which will enable them to go back and to help to uplift their own people, and then this problem will gradually solve itself. But in the meantime we have this shortage of teachers because the open universities did not make that provision and trained very few people to educate the Bantu. We admit that at the moment only one-third&#x2014;and I still think that is high&#x2014;of the teachers in the high schools are graduates, but let us immediately take the <span class="col_5543-5544" refersTo="page_1368"/>other situation. It is that in the community schools in the White area, in the location, where there are only non-White teachers and the Whites have nothing to say, the results are even much worse than in the reserves and in the other areas where the Whites still have some control over education. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I will not spend much time on what the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) has said, except to say that when we quote the results of internal examinations they mean very little, because an internal examination is subject to the usual variables. The standard is set by the people who have done the teaching. Therefore the results cannot be compared with other external results. When the hon. member tells us that at the university colleges to-day the Bantu will be able to become useful teachers, he is admitting what we said in the beginning, that these colleges will just become glorified teachers&#x2019; training colleges.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<p>Nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>That is what we said in the beginning, but apparently the hon. member thinks they are producing good teachers. Those teachers could have been produced in the training colleges without establishing these tribal colleges for the Bantu.</p>

<p>But I want to refer to a matter which has been touched upon by the Minister in an address he delivered at a graduation ceremony in Pretoria. He spoke about the necessity for obtaining leaders amongst the Bantu, and, of course, we are all agreed on that. I would like to quote his words, because they show that he is aware of the difficulties in our system to-day. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sonder matrikulante kan ons nie studente vir die universiteite lewer nie. Sonder studente aan die universiteite kan ons nie die leiers wat nodig is lewer nie. U het seker gesien dat die Transkeise gebieds-owerheid gevra het dat blanke inspekteurs deur Bantoe-inspekteurs vervang moet word. Soiets sou heeltemal in ooreenstemming met die Regering se beleid wees, maar in die lig van wat ek nou net ges&#x00EA; het, kom die vraag by my op of die tyd vir so &#x2019;n vervanging van blanke opvoed kundiges in Bantoe-onderwys reg is. Is die regte weg nie dat die Bantoe sy onderwysstruktuur eers van onderaf moet reg opbou nie?</block>

<p>Leading up to that, the hon. the Minister gave the examination results which the hon. member for East London (City) has given to-day, and I think he made a good case. I would like to say that in building up Bantu education we have to rely on the Bantu people. That is the intention. I put a question on the Order Paper, referring to page 5 of the intimates, that hon. members have before them. My question was to ask the Minister how many of (a) the 30 higher administrative and (b) the 70 higher professional posts in his Department are occupied by Bantu persons, and the answer was: None. Not a single post, a higher post, in the whole Department is occupied by a Bantu. It is not enough to say that they cannot hold the posts down. Some of them could, although not all of them. Now I want to know from the Minister whether he is applying the system that he has applied to the staffing of the university colleges, that there will be a White Senate and a Black Advisory Senate, and that until the Black Advisory Senate is able to take over there will be no mixture and no &#x201C; Molo &#x201D;. It seems to me that the Bantu to-day want to have a greater share. To say that he must start at the bottom and occupy the junior posts for an indefinite period will not answer the demand. We must give him an opportunity to occupy better posts. What we are doing to-day is educating these people, and well-educated people are looking for better posts. In the Government&#x2019;s publication, &#x201C; The Progress of the Bantu People &#x201D;, we find this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A number of South Africa&#x2019;s professionals, mainly teachers, have been lured to other states in Africa.</block>

<p>Sir, they are not &#x201C; lured they go there to better themselves.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>And they come back regretting it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps they do. All the better if they come back. I do not mind. But they are not lured away. And why do we stop their passports? I can understand the argument that if a man has been trained in South Africa, he should give service to South Africa. I am all for that, for White teachers and doctors and lawyers whom we have trained. Our universities pay more for the training of a doctor than for the training of a teacher, but do we say to a doctor that he must stay here for ever to serve South Africa? I would say that the answer is this. We should say: If you train a teacher in our Government institutions at this exorbitant price in the Bantu Colleges we ask you to serve South Africa for five years. After that you can please yourself and we will not stop your passport. I would say the same for doctors, but I would make the period for them seven or ten years, because it costs more to train them. Therefore to say that these people are being &#x201C; lured &#x201D; to other countries and that they are &#x201C; drifting &#x201D; into commerce is wrong. They do not drift into commerce; they go into commerce because they are better paid there and there is more security. Now I come to this question: What are we going to do about it? Are we going to give them these opportunities? I ask the Minister what opportunities there are in his Department? There is not a single inspector of schools who is a Bantu. <span class="col_5545-5546" refersTo="page_1369"/>There are sub-inspectors and assistants, people in inferior positions, but we must give them a share in the higher posts and encourage them. That is one of the reasons why in the Transkei to-day they are asking for self-government. We must give them this opportunity. They are not satisfied. I want to quote what a leading member of the Bantu community whom I know well has to say about the Bantu Education system. He is a man who has lived his life in South Africa and he is a doctor with a good practice. Many hon. members here will know him. Now the Minister of Bantu Education had said in Welkom on Saturday, 22 August 1959&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every law concerning the Native which the Nationalist Government had passed or is passing has been passed with the object of protecting the White man in the social and economic spheres, and also to ensure the supremacy of the White man in South Africa. Further and future relationships between European and non-European would depend on the schooling given to Natives. It was wrong to create the impression that the education he received would be the key which would give him the job which the White man has.</block>

<p>Referring to that statement, this is what a moderate member of the Bantu community has to say, and anybody who knows this man would never dream of saying he was an extremist. We all know he is not. This is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This, like the previous one, was the most revealing policy statement as to the aims and motives behind Bantu education. That leaves no doubt in anybody&#x2019;s mind. It confirms the almost instinctive suspicion and subterranean opposition of the Africans to Bantu education. They have not accepted it. They tolerate it only because they can do nothing about it at present. Anyway, these are the motives behind and underlying Native education.&#x2026; It seems that whatever progress or advance the Africans make educationally beyond and above the prescribed limit, it will be in spite of Bantu education and not because of it.</block>

<p>We have to remove that suspicion from the minds of the Bantu people. We have to approach it in a manner which will give them a bigger share in the education of their own people. If there is to be job reservation, for whom should the job be reserved in Bantu education? Should it be reserved for Whites? Surely if there is any job reservation it should be for Bantu. I am not speaking about White education now but of Bantu education. They should have the first claim if they are qualified for the job, and I want to make this suggestion to the hon. the Minister: We hear a lot to-day about advisory boards in education. I would suggest to him that he appoint an advisory board of leading Bantu to advise him on Bantu education. [Time limit.]</p>

I do not want to follow him in his discussion of the provisions of the Acts which established and control the Bantu Education Account. I assume that what he really meant when he said that the Bantu Education Account &#x201C; is in a tangled financial mess &#x201D; is that proper control is not being exercised over the Account. If that is what he meant&#x2014;because what else can it mean&#x2014;then I say that it is a clear reflection&#x2014;and here I agree with the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert)&#x2014;on the work of the Auditor-General.

<p>I shall have an opportunity to deal with the hon. member for Parktown as well. Mr. Chairman, what the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) has said means in effect in my opinion that as a result of the policy which I and the Department of Bantu Education are following, commitments are being imposed on the Bantu Education Account which it was not originally intended should be so imposed, and as a result of this policy the Bantu Education Account is heading for a position where it will not be able to meet its commitments. If he had said so in those words, we would all have understood him clearly, and then his speech would have been quite in order.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out that the position of the Bantu Education Account was very carefully examined some years ago by an interdepartmental committee and that a programme for the future up to approximately 1964-5 was drawn up, a programme which took both the expenditure and the revenue into account. That committee decided what the possibilities were. There is therefore proper advance planning. In undertaking this advance planning, the committee calculated the number of Bantu in the country who are liable to pay taxation on the basis of a Bantu population of 8,500,000, but it now appears from the latest census that this was a complete under-estimate of the number of Bantu in the country and that in actual fact there are far more taxable Bantu than that committee estimated. In other words, the income of the Bantu Education Account should be far higher than that committee considered it would be. When this came to my notice, I hoped that this higher revenue which should be collected, would give us the opportunity to do something about adjusting the salaries of Bantu teachers which has definitely become necessary in certain respects. But unfortunately our experience over the past year has been that the Bantu are not paying their taxes as they should&#x2014;in this regard I shall take the necessary steps in the near future in consultation with my colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x2014;and instead of an increase in revenue as a result of the increased number of persons liable to tax, less revenue has been collected. This was the result of conditions which prevailed during last year and there has already been a noticeable improvement But I am not yet quite satisfied that the Bantu public in general are making their proper contribution as regards Bantu taxation. I want to make it quite clear that they must realize that much can be done to further the development of the Bantu and to improve the salary structure of Bantu teachers, but that this can only be done if the Bantu who are liable to taxation pay those taxes. I therefore hope that the teachers who often complain to me about their salary structure and ask for increases will persuade the Bantu public to pay the taxes which they are legally liable to pay because only then shall I be able to make the necessary improvements.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Of course not. Nor is it my task to collect these taxes; that is the responsibility of another Department, but just as I expect of the hon. member for Kensington that he will use the influence that he may have in his circle to persuade people to fulfil their obligations to the state as they should, so I can expect of every teacher that in the circle in which he has influence, he will use his influence to make the public realize that they have a responsibility to the state and thereby a responsibility to their own community as far as the development of that community is concerned. That is all I ask of the Bantu teacher. But I want to add that the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) need not fear that as far as the Bantu Education Account is concerned we shall land ourselves in financial difficulties because the Act contains a certain provision which can be utilized if problems should arise, namely that if the Bantu Education Account reaches a stage where it cannot meet the expenditure, advances can be obtained from the Treasury until the steps required to put the position in order are taken.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I say: If such a position should develop. But at the moment there is no such position. At the moment there is a credit balance in the Education Account and the expectation is that if these taxes are collected as they should be, there will still be a credit balance at the end of this year and that we shall consequently be able to continue for another year or so with the account as it is, but before the stage is reached where the expenditure overtakes the revenue and wipes out the balance which has been carried forward, arrangements will be made for the following period. That has been made clear in the past. It must also be remembered that it is not advisable to change Bantu taxes every year. Bantu taxes have an influence on the Bantu Education Account and for that very reason it has been provided that while revenue has exceeded expenditure during the initial stages, but expenditure will gradually overtake revenue, we can continue for another year or so by drawing on the Treasury so that we shall at least have a period of some years during which it will not be necessary to change Bantu taxes. The policy which we are following as regards Bantu education has been determined in the light of those arrangements. In the light of these circumstances we <span class="col_5549-5550" refersTo="page_1371"/>decide what can be spent and what cannot be spent. The hon. member for Kensington has enlarged on this question of the revenue and expenditure of the Bantu Education Account, and he has said that he simply cannot understand how we can succeed in providing education to ever more children while revenue remains the same.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that quite well. I have given the reasons.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>He cannot understand how we can do this and still comply with sound educational principles&#x2014;let me put it in this way&#x2014;and on that basis he then criticized the methods which we are using to effect economies in the Department and the methods we have used to reduce the unit cost per student. But he has not mentioned one of the most important methods which we have used to reduce the unit cost, namely improved and more centralized administration. Instead of spreading the administration over four provincial departments, it has now been centralized and this has resulted in tremendous savings. But allow me to analyse the hon. member&#x2019;s criticisms of what we have done. In the first place, he has said that we have reduced the unit cost by introducing dual sessions and this, he has said, has turned Bantu education into third rate education because where have we ever heard of dual sessions with a teacher taking one group in the morning and another group in the afternoon? This, he has said, is a violation of the rights of the teachers and as a good ex-teacher he must plead for the teachers in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>For the rights of the children. They are only being given a half-day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>He has discussed the teachers as well. He has said two things. In the first place, he has said this is turning Bantu education into third rate education because the children are only given half a day&#x2019;s schooling instead of a full day. In the second place, he has said that this is a violation of the rights of the teachers because the same teacher must now teach in the morning and in the afternoon. He has said that as far as he knows, wherever dual sessions have been provided in the past, one set of teachers have taught in the morning and a different set in the afternoon as a result of limited accommodation, and that is the only type of dual session education of which he approves. But let us examine the position. Let us first see whether the child is being harmed by this dual session education. The dual session system under which one teacher first takes one class and later another class is a system which is only used in the lower primary schools and then only in the sub-standards, namely Sub A and Sub B. In those schools the Bantu child is given three hours schooling per day, In White schools the child is given 3&#x00BD; hours per day in the sub-standards. In other words, the Bantu child in the sub-standards is given half an hour less schooling per day than the White child, despite these dual sessions. But I now want to say that this educational system gives the Bantu child more than adequate compensation because from Std. I to Std. VI which in the case of Bantu education still forms part of the primary school, the Bantu child is given 5&#x00BD; hours per day while the White child only receives 5 hours per day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>That includes the breaks as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in both cases. Actually, without the breaks, the Bantu child receives 2 hours schooling per day in the sub-standards. In the case of the White child the actual period of schooling is three hours. There is therefore in actual fact a difference of a quarter of an hour. But if one takes the total, the White child receives 32 hours in the primary schools as compared with the 39 hours schooling received by the Bantu child. In other words, it is quite wrong to say, as the hon. member for Kensington has said, that we have reduced the schooling period in the case of the Bantu. In actual fact, once the Bantu child has completed his lower primary education, he has received in total far more hours of schooling that the White child, and in addition the Bantu child attends the lower primary school for eight years while it is seven years in the case of the White child. I therefore say without the slightest hesitation that the Bantu child is not suffering. The hon. member has also objected to the fact that we dare use a teacher to teach two groups per day. He has said that this is unknown and unheard of. I want to point out that it is only in these sub-standards that the teachers are expected to take one class in the morning and another class in the afternoon. In total these teachers therefore teach for 2 hours plus a half-hour period before taking the next class for another 2 hours, that is to say, they teach 5&#x00BD; hours per day. But the teacher who takes Std. I, teaches in any case for 5&#x00BD; hours. In other words, these sub-standard teachers have the same day as the Std. I and the Std. VI teacher because the Std. VI teacher must also teach for 5&#x00BD; hours per day, and we must remember that the teachers in Stds. I to VI have to do an ever-increasing amount of revision and preparatory work. They consequently have more work to do after school hours. In other words, my standpoint is that the teaching load carried by the teacher in the sub-standards is still less than the teaching load carried by the Stds. I to VI teachers, judged by the amount of work which they must do. No injustice is therefore being done to the teacher in this regard. I hope that I have said enough on that point. But the hon. member then made a second point. He has said that to reduce the unit costs we have introduced female teachers into the <span class="col_5551-5552" refersTo="page_1372"/>primary schools instead of men. That is so; we have done so. We have laid down that in the lower primary schools, that is to say, in the classes from Sub A to Std. II, the teachers should be women throughout. A man who is teaching in those standards can remain and his salary is protected, but we shall try to employ him elsewhere. The male teacher who wants to teach such classes can do so but he will then receive the same salary as a female. What is wrong with that? In the White schools here in the Cape it is the policy to-day that only the principal of a primary school which goes to Std. V, will be a male, and all the assistants will be women. In the case of White education we may do so but we may not do so in the case of Bantu education. I believe that it is educationally sound to say that in the case of these young children from Sub A to Std. II a woman teacher is far better able to handle them and to educate them than a male teacher.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>That is the argument I have used; that is why you have required more teachers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the hon. member cannot eat his cake and have it. He must choose between the two. Our experience&#x2014;and it is for this very reason that we also retain married women&#x2014;is that women teachers remain in service long enough to justify fully the cost involved in their training. We require the males for other aspects of the development of the Bantu. The male teachers who become available are required partially for teaching in the higher primary grades since it is our aim to have male teachers in at least 50 per cent of the higher primary classes, that is to say from Stds. Ill to VI, and mainly male teachers in the lower primary schools. We require them for that purpose and if we had not trained women teachers to take these lower classes, we would not have been able to succeed to the extent that we have succeeded in meeting the requirements of the higher education of the Bantu. But I just want to tell the hon. member what our experience was when we took over Bantu education. When we started with Bantu education, we found teachers with degrees, even with M.A. degrees who were teaching at lower primary schools scattered all over the Bantu areas, merely because it was easy for them to do so. On the basis of his qualifications such a teacher received the same salary as he would have received in a high school, but it was far easier for him to hide away in a lower primary school in the veld and to draw his full salary on the basis of his degree. We put an end to that. We require these people with degrees for work where they can be utilized to greater advantage, and we have consequently removed them from these primary schools and we are using them where they can make a really useful contribution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington has gone further and said that another step which we are taking in order to economize and to reduce the unit costs has been to sub-divide farm schools which develop to any extent into two schools and to make them junior farm schools so that lower salaries are paid to the teachers. Here he is of course quite wrong. I do not know where he has come by those facts. The position regarding junior farm schools is as follows: While it was formerly the practice that a farm school could only be subsidized if it had 25 students, in view of the fact that all over the platteland there are places where farmers would like to provide school facilities for their workers&#x2019; children but find it difficult to get 25 children together, we have introduced the junior farm school. As soon as there are 12 scholars, such a school can be started and a subsidy can be paid on the junior basis. In other words, it does not represent a division of existing schools, but merely makes it possible for us to start other schools in order to further the development of farm schools. In the fourth place the hon. member has referred to school feeding which he says we have abolished. We did not abolish it; the hon. member says that we said to the Bantu: Look, you must now choose between schools without food or food without schools. What they were given under the former school feeding system was not food. In those places where this system existed, it worked out that they were given food to the value of approximately 1d. per student. How much food is that? We have found that the effect of this system was often that the parents who were responsible for the feeding of the child, said to him: &#x201C; But you can get food at school &#x201D; and they then sent their child to school in the morning without giving him anything to eat at home. The child then had to manage on half an orange or a slice of bread; that is all the child was given. But allow me to add that he was only given that food when the scheme worked properly. In the case of many schools in the Bantu areas we had the position that there were no transport facilities. The bread or the oranges had <span class="col_5553-5554" refersTo="page_1373"/>to come from far away by bus; they were unloaded somewhere along the road at a bus stop, and the teacher who was under the control of a missionary who lived another 50 or 60 miles away, never went to fetch that food at the bus stop. Thousands of pounds&#x2019; worth of food lay and rotted at bus stops in the Bantu areas under the old feeding scheme. That is why we said that this was a scheme which really meant nothing to the children, while that money could be used to greater advantage for the development for education.</p>

<p>In the urban areas better use is made in general of school feeding. But in principle we could not abolish school feeding in the platteland areas and allow it to continue in the urban areas because this would have represented discrimination against the children in the platteland areas. We must provide school feeding everywhere or we must not provide it at all. Where the school boards themselves have asked for the school feeding system to be abolished we have done so, but where they have asked that it be retained, it has been retained. Allow me to say at once that if other organizations such as welfare organizations, which are interested in the feeding of children, are prepared to do something about the malnutrition of the children, I have no objection to their co-operating with the school boards and establishing a feeding scheme under the control of the school boards. But in principle the provision of food is not the function of a Department of Education.</p>

<speech by="#williams">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAMS</person>:</from>

<p>Then why do you do so in the case of White school children?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>In the Cape Province the Provincial Administration abolished school feeding at White and Coloured schools in 1958; the provinces are therefore also moving in that direction. This is in essence not the function of a Department of Education; this is in essence the function of a welfare organization or of a Welfare Department or of a Health Department. It must be remembered that the children come to school when they are seven years of age, and if the child has suffered a setback through malnutrition, then it has suffered that setback long before that stage. Then the penny or 3d. per day which the child is given does not help in the least to feed him properly. If we really want to do something about the malnutrition of the Bantu child in South Africa, then we must start with the expectant mother, with the child and the mother, and we must then build on that basis. In other words, it is quite pointless spending a small amount which provides each child with a penny&#x2019;s worth of food at a stage when it is no longer of any help to them. If we want to do something worth while then we must introduce a scheme which starts from the beginning, and that is not the task of the Department of Education, but is a task which rests in the first place on the welfare organizations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has also discussed the cost of university education. I shall discuss that aspect later. I would prefer to deal now with the matter which has been raised by the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Cope). But allow me just to say that when I re-enter the debate at a later stage, I shall discuss the subject of examination results and university training again because I think these are two closely connected matters. But the hon. member for Parktown said yesterday that in replying to certain of his questions, I had misled the House. Mr. Chairman, in all the replies I have given the hon. member, I have given the absolute facts as they had been supplied to me. There is nothing contained in my replies to his questions which does not reflect the actual position as reported to me. Of course one cannot deal with the whole history of a matter in such a reply, and it may be that the hon. member has information which is not apparent from the replies, but then the hon. member never asked for that information. For the sake of the record allow me to set out the whole position regarding the school at Joubertskop. The school was situated on a two morgen site which was the property of the Methodist Church. This site formerly formed part of the farm &#x201C; Rondawel &#x201D; which is 1,056 morgen in extent. The farm &#x201C; Rondawel &#x201D; belongs at present to a Mr. van Rensburg. The school at Joubertskop has been in existence since 1955 and was registered as a farm school because the previous owner of the school entered into an agreement with the Methodist Church which made it possible for us to register the school as a farm school. But apparently the new owner did not agree with the person who was appointed as manager of the school. A new manager was appointed, and apparently a difference of opinion then arose between the owner and the manager. Whether or not the owner can agree with the manager is a matter between the manager and the owner of the farm and I have no control over that. In addition the hon. member must remember that in the case of all these farm schools it is my policy that the children who attend such a farm school must obtain letters of consent from the owners of the farms from which they come that they are allowed to go to the school, and the owner on whose farm the school is situated, must give his permission that the children can come on his farm in order to attend the school.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cope">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COPE</person>:</from>

<p>Do you do so in the case of all schools?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I do so in the case of all farm schools, and there is a particular reason, or rather two reasons why I do so. The basic reason is <span class="col_5555-5556" refersTo="page_1374"/>that the owner of the farm is the master of his farm and I am not entitled to allow children from all over the neighbourhood to go to the farm of that owner to attend the school without the permission of the owner of that farm. Nor am I entitled to allow the children of the employees of a farmer to go and attend such a school without his permission. He must give his permission. Basically the principle that the farmer is the master of his farm is therefore the reason for the arrangements I have made. But I have also done so for a particular reason. I have done so because amongst many White farmers throughout the country&#x2014;and I am now not only referring to Afrikaans-speaking or Nationalist farmers, but to all farmers&#x2014;there is opposition to children attending these farm schools. Many farmers have simply said: By your schools you are simply taking these children who should work for me from the farm and you are bringing in teachers who are nothing but agitators and who are creating problems amongst my workers. We found this attitude amongst the farmers. As a result the number of schools in the platteland areas remained at a very low figure and the Bantu children on the White farms were provided with school facilities to a far lesser extent than the children in the urban areas or the Bantu areas. The result was in term that the workers began to leave the farms of the White farmers or that they sent their children away. There were many farms where one only found the father and mother, the old Natives, still working on the farm, but all the children of school-going age had left and they never came back to the farms. As a result I have introduced this system under which I am building up the farm school system with the co-operation of the farmers. In 1957 there were 1,400 farm schools and by 1960 the figure had increased to 1,750, an increase of 20 per cent over this three year period. The number of children was 143,000, and it rose to 172,000. I only achieved this because I gained the co-operation of the farmers by means of this system and because I upheld their basic principle that they were the masters of their farms. If I had not done so, I would not have been able to make this progress. That is why I have applied this principle, and in the case of the Joubertskop school, the parents of the neighbourhood, the parents on the farms in the vicinity, have refused to continue sending their children to that school. I do not know what the reasons are.</p>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s reply to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Plewman), the detail into which he went into the question raised by the hon. member and also the fact that he admitted that there was a possibility of things going wrong with the Revenue Account, shows how justified the hon. member was in raising the matter and it also shows how little the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) knew of the matter when he made his speech the other night.</p>

<p>Sir, I was only replying to the hon. member for Witbank and said that I thought it was an uncalled for attack that he made on the hon. member for Johannesburg (North).</p>

<p>With regard to the Department itself, I want first of all, to deal with the running of the Department, and my complaint, and the complaint of the teachers as a whole, is the inefficiency displayed in the Department. It is quite wrong that teachers, or any employee of the State for that matter, should have to work without being paid. When the Bantu Education Department first started, it was understandable that the organization was not quite what it should be and that there was some delay in the payment of teachers, but I submit that after all these years there is no longer any excuse for what is happening. And it is not a question of isolated cases. There are numerous cases where the teachers come to me and complain that they are not getting their pay. I had occasion to write to the Minister&#x2014;I phoned the Department&#x2014;and on the last occasion when I wrote to the hon. the Minister. I referred to a case where a teacher was appointed on 25 April 1960, and by February this year, she had not yet been paid, nearly a year after her appointment. This teacher was working without salary for nearly a year. Now the Bantu are the people who can least afford to go without their pay. They have got no means in the majority of cases and they have to rely on their pay for their existence. This girl had to be supported by her father, who also is a man of small means and he had to borrow money to support his daughter while she was teaching. He had to borrow money for her train fares to get her home for the holidays. I submit that the Minister must pay more attention to what is happening in the Department. This is a genuine complaint, and I submit it is a justified complaint by the teachers.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>When we adjourned for the luncheon break, I was dealing with the inefficiency of the Department and mentioned the delay in the paying of the staff. Sir, that is not my only complaint against the Department. The whole administration is bad. Native teachers are dissatisfied, the White teachers are dissatisfied. The White teachers are dissatisfied about promotion in the Department, about frequent transfers, and the transfer of others over their heads. Obviously they do not want their names mentioned because they are afraid of further victimization, but the hon. the Minister must know that there is this dissatisfaction. The Department in fact is being ridiculed by the officials, they talk in terms of ridicule about the Department, the same as they ridicule the Minister&#x2019;s instructions to his White officials not to shake hands with the Bantu. The hon. Minister gave a reply to me the other day about the policy of shaking hands, and I read through that statement several times, but I can&#x2019;t make head or tail of it. Either they are allowed to shake hands or they are not allowed to shake hands. Either they must be encouraged to extend the normal courtesies to the Natives, or they must not be encouraged. I would ask the hon. the Minister if he won&#x2019;t circularize the picture of the Commissioner-General, lifting his topper and shaking hands with Natives as an example to his officials as to how they should treat the Bantu. Sir, the whole instruction of the Minister in that regard was ridiculous, and the sooner he withdraws that instruction the better for him and the Department.</p>

<p>The Bantu parents are dissatisfied. They complain about the school boards. The hon. Minister will know that rumours of corruption amongst members of the school boards are rife. I can only talk of the Transkei, I do not know what happens in the rest of the country, and the commission of inquiry appointed by the Minister of Bantu Administration <span class="col_5559-5560" refersTo="page_1376"/>and Development to go into the troubles in Pondoland confirmed that and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration told the House that he had asked this Minister to go into the question. I would be glad if he would tell us what he has done about that matter, because that state of affairs cannot continue. I also want to talk about the policy of the Minister&#x2019;s Department in regard to language medium instruction. We know that it is the policy of this Government that the medium of instruction in the primary standards should be the home language. That policy does not find favour with this side of the House and we have criticized that policy of the Government. But it is finding less favour with the Bantu, and we know that the Western Pondoland Regional Authority made representations to the Department some months ago asking that the medium of instruction in the primary standards be altered to English. We know too that at the recent sitting of the Territorial Authority of the Transkei resolutions were passed on the same subject. The Bantu do not accept it, and if in fact the policy of the Government is that the Bantu should control themselves through their own regional authorities or territorial authorities, then I submit the Government should give heed to their request. The Department did take some action. They held a meeting at Umtata at which the Territorial Authority was represented by executive members, and also present were principals of the schools in the area, parents and chairmen of the school boards. Dr. van Zyl, the Under-Secretary went there to address them. My information, reliable information, is that after he addressed them on the policy of the Government to insist on home language instruction and after he had pointed out to them the advantages of home language instruction they still said to him: &#x201C; We have heard what you had to say, but we still want our instruction to be in English.&#x201D; They said, and quite rightly so, that the English language is the window through which they see the world. They do not want instruction through their own language. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is giving any consideration to changing the policy in regard to the Bantu, giving them the right to choose the language in which they want the instruction. Is he going to accede to the request as set out in the resolutions passed by the Territorial Authority and as requested by the Western Pondoland Regional Authority? I also want the hon. the Minister to tell us what his policy is in regard to handing over Bantu education to the Territorial Authority. We have seen statements in the Press that Bantu Education is to be handed over. I want to know from the Minister on what conditions it is going to be handed over and when he expects to do that. We know from the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration that the Transkei may get its independence in two or three years&#x2019; time. Is it only the intention to hand education over to the Transkeian Territorial Authority, or does he intend to break up his Department and hand over the authority in each area, in Zululand and wherever else authorities are already established? I think the hon. the Minister is running into so much trouble with his Department, there is so much dissatisfaction amongst the officials and from the parents that he probably would like to get rid of his portfolio. I am sorry that I have not got any more time to go into the details, but I hope the hon. the Minister will give us a detailed statement on his policy.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>After listening to this debate to-day, one forms the impression that the attitude adopted by the United Party towards this important matter is completely negative. It is almost impossible to believe that there are educationists on that side of the House and that they cannot see nor emphasize the positive aspects of Bantu education. When we examine the development of Bantu education in South Africa, we find that it has progressed both as regards extent and standards, a fact which is reflected by the increasing expenditure on this education and the legislation which has been adopted from time to time aimed at making these standards more comprehensive and effective. In 1926 &#x00A3;452,800 was spent on Bantu education while in 1944, one year before the 1945 legislation was adopted, &#x00A3;2,055,798 was already being spent. The increase in the expenditure over that period was therefore five times as rapid as the increase in the taxation resources which had to finance that education. As result of the 1945 legislation there was a further increase. In 1945 the amount was &#x00A3;2,248,529, but by 1954, once again a year after the important legislation of 1953 had been adopted, the figure already stood at &#x00A3;8,016,247. But during this period the standards were also raised, because by 1945 &#x00A3;3.83 per annum was being spent per student, while by 1954 the figure was &#x00A3;8.54. In other words, seeing that so much more is being spent per individual student, one can assume that the standards must necessarily have been raised as well. In 1958 the Department of Bantu Education was established and this is further proof of the tremendous progress which has been made as regards Bantu education. What has been the effect of this legislation? In the first place we can say that it made the Bantu parent realize that he had to do more and that he should contribute more himself&#x2014;which he is also doing with pride and gratitude&#x2014; towards the education of his children. It has made it possible for him to make an increased contribution to the education of his child. But it has also made it possible for the Bantu parent to play a more direct part in the education of his children, because since then approximately 500 Bantu school boards have been established, to which the hon. member for Transkei&#x00E0;n Territories (Mr. Hughes) has referred so disparagingly. Plus minus 5,000 <span class="col_5561-5562" refersTo="page_1377"/>school committees have been established. That is to say, there are approximately 55,000 Bantu parents who previously had no say over the education and training of their children, but who have now been given the opportunity to play an active part in this educational programme. Furthermore there has been an increase in the number of children attending these schools. In 1949 there were 19,901 secondary students. We must remember how this legislation was attacked and how it was said that Bantu education was going to be ruined completely. By 1960 there were no longer 19,000 but 48,984 Bantu students in the secondary schools. The total number of children attending school has increased. Over the four years preceding 1953, that is to say from 1950-3, the average annual increase in the number of students in the schools was 31,000. During the four years following 1953, that is to say 1954-7, the average figure was 82.000 per annum. In other words, this legislation has made it possible to provide increased facilities. While I am discussing facilities, I want to point out that in the case of the Bantu children between the ages 7 and 14 years&#x2014;the school going ages&#x2014;1,767,009 were attending schools in 1953, and there was only school accommodation for 800,000 of them, that is to say, for only 45 per cent. But in 1960 the figures were far higher. There were 2.161.000 such children and accommodation could already be offered to 67 per cent of that large number. In other words, this indicates that there is a tendency which will result in primary education being available within a few years to all Bantu children between the ages of 7 and 14 years, which is indeed a tremendous achievement and something of which the outside world must take note, something which must be emphasized in this country, and something which people who have the cause of Bantu education at heart must emphasize.</p>

<p>But when we also examine the progress which is being made, we find that for the first time something is being done in the direction of providing special education and vocational education to Bantu children, which was never the position in the past. This is something which should receive attention. We also know that for the first time there is a research unit which is undertaking psychological research in respect of the Bantu child and which is undertaking the necessary I.Q. tests and aptitude tests, with a view to providing vocational guidance. Is this not a magnificent step which should be emphasized? Is this not something which should be noted with appreciation? Mr. Chairman, on the basis of inspection reports and the evidence of authorities, we can say that the standards of education have risen appreciably. Although there may be weaknesses, as certain hon. members have indicated, weaknesses which should still receive attention, we must nevertheless admit that the credit side overshadows these weaknesses and does so to such a great extent that any one who only emphasizes the negative aspect and does not say a word about all the positive steps which have been taken to raise the standards of Bantu education, can only be obsessed with a feeling of animosity.</p>

<p>Before lunch this Committee listened to the hon. the Minister waxing furious because it had been suggested by an hon. member on this side of the House that the Bantu Education Account was in a financial mess, or was coming into one. He suggested that this was a slight on the Auditor-General. But quite clearly no such slight could be implied from the words of any hon. member on this side, let alone the words of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Plewman). I am surprised at the hon. the Minister being as annoyed as he was, because when he tried to explain the financial difficulties in which he finds himself because of his failure to realize the implications of running this separate account, he confirmed every word which was said by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North). He said that his Department was run on the basis of planning which would stretch through to 1964. This was the long term plan for Bantu education. Then he proceeded to say that they had made a grievous mistake because they had made their estimates on the basis of the wrong number of Bantu in South Africa. Now any Government which bases its long term planning on a basis of incorrect data must deserve all the criticism it gets from the opposite side of the House. And then if that was not bad enough &#x2026;</p>

<p>Those were not the words, Mr. Chairman. He said they had made a mistake. They now found that there were many more Bantu in South Africa than they thought there were and that this meant that it could be estimated that they would get much more money from Bantu taxation. One would think, then, that this would be the new basis for the allocation of money for long term planning. But having said this the hon. Minister then proceeded to cast a slur and a reflection on his colleague the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. He said that although we know there are more Bantu and although we believe there should be more taxation available, his colleague and the department he is responsible for are falling down in their job of collecting this taxation.</p>

<p>That is not what I said. You are misrepresenting me.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister said this was not something for his <span class="col_5563-5564" refersTo="page_1378"/>Department, it was something which fell under another department, and that other department was the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. So far from the, hon. member for Johannesburg (North) casting reflections on the Auditor-General of South Africa, here we find the Minister of Bantu Education casting a very serious reflection on his colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>As if that were not bad enough the hon. the Minister then suggested that the way out of this difficulty, the way in which the obligations should be lifted from the shoulder of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was to say to the teachers &#x201C; If you want higher salaries &#x2026;&#x201D;&#x2014;because he conceded that in the case of very many Bantu teachers a good case existed for raising their salaries&#x2014;then it was for them to use their influence with their own people to pay their taxes so that they themselves could receive those higher salaries. What a sorry state we are coming to in South Africa when civil servants, employees of the State have to encourage people to pay taxes so that the salaries of civil servants can be raised! And when one analyses what the hon. the Minister said one finds he said exactly that.</p>

<p>Nothing that the hon. the Minister has said, none of the facts and figures given by hon. members on the other side of the House can conceal the fact that the standard of Bantu education is not only deplorably low but that it is becoming lower all the time. If one looks at the figures there can be no doubt that while there has been a quantitive improvement in the number of non-Whites going to our schools the quality of the education and the quality of the students coming out of these Bantu schools is lower than ever before in the history of this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is. Look at the figures in the reports of the various departments. Look at the figures given at the end of last year of the number of students even now passing their matriculation examinations, or the proportion that is failing in these examinations as compared with previous years.</p>

<p>The problem with this Government is that it seems to believe that the important thing is not to have education based on the sound principle of a pyramid with education being given to people not only at the lower levels but to see that sufficient people are being educated simultaneously at the higher levels to provide the leadership for these people. This Government has virtually undone the opportunities for decent higher education for the Bantu people of South Africa. They seem to think it suffices to provide primary education for a large number of the Bantu people. Unless one can provide adequate facilities to ensure that people drawn from the Bantu can lead their own people, can lead in the field of education, then we are going to remedy the position. And of course all of this is quite unnecessary because if they had not squeezed out the mission schools the Government would still have had teachers of high quality available for Bantu education. If they had not tried to take away all contact between the Bantu and White people other than the Department of Bantu Education, there would have been very many White people still available to assist at this stage in providing the Bantu with the necessary leadership and education, which the Bantu cannot at this stage, provide themselves. So that this Government has failed miserably, although it might have extended the broad basis of education to the very low standards, they have failed lamentably in educating sufficient Bantu to give the lead to their own people in the field of education and so it is that the quality and the standard of Bantu education has become lower. One has the example of the hon. the Minister saying that he finds that one of the reasons why many of these people have failed in their matriculation is because of their failure in English Higher, Mathematics and Commerce. And his answer to this is to say in future that perhaps they would not need English Higher.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, because these people are not getting an education of the quality which can enable them to pass the normal matriculation standard, it now becomes the policy of this Minister to say: &#x201C; Let us lower the standard in order to make it possible for these people to pass.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Well I want to see the quality of Bantu Higher which the Minister envisages. When one considers the vast resources available in English and Afrikaans literature to set a standard which is the equivalent of a higher examination in either of these languages for matriculation, I want to see the resources for Bantu Higher. I do not believe it is possible for his Department to devise a syllabus Bantu Higher which, at this stage could qualify with English or Afrikaans for the school-leaving or matriculation exemption certificates in either of those languages.</p>

<p>I want to raise, very briefly, the question of the dismissal of teachers from Bantu schools, and the denial of opportunity to go to private schools run by private organizations which are <span class="col_5565-5566" refersTo="page_1379"/>subsidized by the Government. I think the important thing about this is that when Bantu teachers are dismissed it is not necessary for the Department to give them any reason for that dismissal. Very often the Department might have good reasons; very often the Department might have reasons that may be bad, but because no reasons are given, because the person does not know why he has been dismissed, he must consider all these decisions with suspicion. And the people concerned cannot know whether the reasons are good ones or bad ones. So one has the position that very many people are being dismissed, for what the Minister might believe is a good reason. But because these reasons are not being disclosed the general public and the people concerned are not aware either of his <i>bona fides</i> or his good intentions in this matter. I believe that far more good would be done and much suspicion would be removed if reasons were to be given why persons are dismissed from this service.</p>

<p>Since the Bantu Education Act was introduced, only one teacher has been dismissed. I want then to deal with what is obviously the one Bantu teacher. This Bantu teacher is apparently a gentleman by the name Stephen Kgame, and his is the case to which I wish to refer. Here is a teacher who was dismissed from the Naledi Bantu Community School; a person who, according to all the testimonials and all the references, both from teachers in his own school, from the parents of the children in the school, from the mission station to which he belonged, from certain private employers and from certain other people with whom he had dealings&#x2014;and I mention only the Christian Publishing Company&#x2014;in respect of this gentleman, Mr. Stephen Kgame, everybody had good reason to testify not only to his character but to his ability. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Eglin) has made a whole series of allegations here, all of which are devoid of truth. Let me start at once with the teacher to whom he referred. That teacher was not dismissed by my Department but by the school board in whose employ he was. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) has just asked me what I propose to do to give the Bantu greater responsibility in controlling their own affairs. The Bantu school boards are responsible for the employment of their teachers and for the discharge of teachers if they do not do their work properly. The Bantu school board and the Bantu school committee who are on the spot know those people much better than a mission worker, who was miles away perhaps and who only came into contact with the teacher occasionally, could ever get to know them. They know much more about the conduct of that particular teacher. I do not interfere with the work of school boards as far as the appointment and discharge of teachers are concerned, except when there is very good reason to believe that there has been corruption. In a case of that kind I make certain inquiries and see to it that the matter is rectified. But where there is no question of corruption I leave it to the school boards because they themselves are sufficiently responsible to regulate their own affairs in this connection. The hon. member comes here and holds me responsible for the fact that a school board has discharged a certain teacher and I cannot help wondering, since that hon. member comes here to plead for him, whether this is not a case perhaps where the school board found that that particular teacher was misusing his position to introduce politics into the school. In the course of my reply I shall deal with other matters that the hon. member touched upon because they link up with matters which other hon. members have mentioned.</p>

<p>I want to start by referring to the question of university colleges to which various hon. members opposite referred. They objected to the high cost per unit at these university colleges. Let me say at once that they probably know that even before the University College of Fort Hare was taken over, it was the practice of the Department of Education, Arts and Science, in terms of formulae which had been laid down, to subsidize Fort Hare on a special basis because even at that time the cost per unit at Fort Hare was higher than at other universities. The reason for this is simply the limited numbers at this university. If you have few students, particularly in the initial stages while you are building up a university college, and staff has to be provided for all the various subjects, without having a full class for every subject, the cost per unit is necessarily very high. Our White universities had the same experience in the early years. But according to those hon. members it is perfectly in order for a White university to have that experience during its period of growth, but in the case of <span class="col_5567-5568" refersTo="page_1380"/>the Bantu it is not in order. They prefer to put him with the Whites, where he can never achieve his own identity, where he will never be able to rise to the position that he ought to occupy in the academic and in the scientific life of this country. For the first time today this expenditure on Bantu Colleges, for which the Bantu themselves are largely responsible, represents an investment made by the Bantu for the future of their own people, because it is only in those university colleges, particularly once they have been built up into full-fledged universities, that they will have an opportunity to enjoy full academic freedom. Because they can only attain full academic freedom, not when they are merely students but when they can also become lecturers in those universities. And that opportunity is given to them only at these separate university institutions. This higher cost per student that they have to bear is an investment on their part to make it possible for their own people to obtain full academic freedom in their own area and under their own circumstances. In other words, what we are dealing with here is a transition stage. In the initial stages we have to face higher costs, but these higher costs are necessary for the balanced development of the Bantu in his own community and in his own service.</p>

<p>Let me also add that this expenditure is essential in order to be able to meet the existing need for Bantu teachers throughout the whole country. Because what happened at the Universities of Cape Town, Natal, the Witwatersrand and others, in regard to which hon. members opposite felt so strongly that Bantu students should rather have been admitted there, was that throughout all these years Bantu students studied there in certain directions, without the slightest planning and without guiding them in directions in which there was a real need for their services. The result was that those universities never produced Bantu teachers for us. The only institution that produced Bantu teachers was Fort Hare. To-day we have three institutions producing Bantu teachers. Let me tell hon. members immediately what the result has been. The total number of students enrolled at these university colleges this year is 515. Of those 515 students, 148 are studying for the teacher&#x2019;s diploma this year. In other words, this is the first time in our history that we are training such a large number of potential teachers in order to meet what is the greatest need of the developing Bantu.</p>

<p>In this connection the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has said that apart from the fact that these university colleges entail heavy expenditure, it is also a fact that they are really nothing but &#x201C;glorified teachers&#x2019; training institutions &#x201D;. Those are the words that he used, if I understood him correctly. But, Mr. Chairman, you must remember that the teachers who are being trained at these university colleges are all teachers who are taking a post-matriculation diploma course or a post-graduate diploma. Those who take a post-graduate diploma course in education, take a one-year course after having acquired the B.A. or the B.Sc. or the B.Com. degree. That work appropriately falls under a university. The same position obtains at all other universities. These university colleges are the proper institutions for those taking the post-matriculation diploma in education because it is essential, in order to be able to pass this course, to take a certain number of degree subjects. This is being done in order to provide teachers for post-primary education. We still have a great deal to do in that connection, and it is essential therefore to make that provision. I say therefore that this high cost should not be viewed as the cost per student but as meeting an essential need so as to be able to make the necessary provision for education as a whole. [Interjections.] The post-matriculation diploma course is the same as the former Union Education course.</p>

<p>I now come to the charge that has been made by various hon. members, amongst others by the hon. member for Pinelands, that we are providing inferior education. In support of that argument they quote the matriculation results of the past two years. Let me say this for the information of the hon. member for Pinelands that after the publication of the syllabuses of the Department of Bantu Education, all educationists in South Africa&#x2014; and here I am not talking about the hon. member for Pinelands&#x2014;all educationists of repute, including the educational experts of the Institute of Race Relations, referred to those syllabuses in laudatory terms as the best educational syllabuses in South Africa, even better than those followed in White education. But the hon. member for Pinelands now comes along and says that this is inferior education, and he bases that entirely on the results of the matriculation examination over the past two years. That is why I want to deal with it specifically at this stage. Other hon. members, including the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. D. L. Smit) also referred to this. It has been argued by various members, including the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder), that one of the reasons for these poor examination results is the fact that there has really been a drain on our staff of qualified teachers in the higher classes with the result that there has been a very great shortage of teachers who are graduates in the higher standards, in the matriculation schools. That is so. The reason for this is the establishment of approximately 190 new secondary schools; secondly, the creation of sub-inspectors&#x2019; posts; thirdly, the appointment of 150 supervisers of schools, the creation of 500 posts of school board secretaries&#x2014;all new posts, new possibilities for the Bantu in his own service which represented a drain on the best teaching material. But the hon. member for East London (City) was altogether wrong &#x2014;I repeat he was altogether wrong&#x2014;in saying that we created additional secondary schools <span class="col_5569-5570" refersTo="page_1381"/>without having had the necessary qualified teachers. The majority of these new schools that were established are junior certificate schools, and for these schools there are sufficient trained teachers. We had no problem in getting qualified teachers for them. These people are matriculants with a diploma in education, for which they took certain university subjects. But they have no degree. This drain is due to the fact that in many of these places the principal was drawn from a matriculation school or from the ranks of Bantu graduates, because as principal of such a school he can get a higher salary than as an assistant at one of the ordinary schools. That is why, as far as principals are concerned, this meant a drain on the staff of the existing high schools, but the establishment of new Junior Certificate schools did not mean that they were left without staff. As a matter of fact, the results of the Junior Certificate examinations, to which the hon. member for Randfontein referred, show that in spite of the fact that we enrolled 61 per cent more children for the Junior Certificate during this period, the number of successful students, on a percentage basis, is greater to-day than it was a few years ago.</p>

<p>I shall come to that if the hon. member will only exercise a little patience. Before I come to the actual reason for the difficulties and the drop in the number of successful candidates, I just want to refer again to the fact that the hon. member for East London (City) said in the course of his speech that he had learned that the Department of Bantu Education was going to set its own matriculation examination in the near future and that this was an indication that the standard was to be lowered. I want to point out to the hon. member that a few days ago in this House I replied to a question put to me by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). The question was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether it is the intention of his Department to introduce a new standard for the matriculation examination for Bantu scholars, and, if so, (a) in what respect; and (b) in what subjects will the new standard differ from the present standard?</block>

<p>My reply to that was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No, it is not the intention of my Department to introduce a new standard for the matriculation examination for Bantu scholars. The standard of all matriculation examinations, including the National Senior Certificate and that of the Provincial Administration, is determined and controlled by the Joint Matriculation Board. A change of standard therefore does not rest with my Department. Should my Department at any time introduce a departmental Senior Certificate examination, the standard of the syllabuses and of the examination will still have to meet the requirements of the Joint Matriculation Board.</block>

<p>I now come to the true reasons for the poor results in the matriculation examinations. It has already been mentioned here by hon. members that the reason for the poor results in the past two years is the switch-over from the provincial examinations, the Senior Certificate examinations of the various provinces, to those of the Joint Matriculation Board, because it is well known that although the Joint Matriculation Board controls all the examinations and ensures that the standards comply with their requirements, the examination of the Joint Matriculation Board requires a higher standard in certain respects, and particularly in English Higher, than the provincial examinations. I have now had an analysis made of the 1960 examination results.</p>

<p>I was saying that I have had an analysis made of the results of the examinations over the past few years, and I hope the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) will listen, because then he will see that what I have just said is correct. I have had an analysis made of the examination results in matric in 1959 and again in 1960, not of the number of candidates who wrote and passed, but of <span class="col_5571-5572" refersTo="page_1382"/>the number of successful candidates in each subject. I give the number of successful candidates in 1958 in English A, because that is important. In that year 50.1 per cent of the candidates who wrote English A as a subject passed, but look what happened in 1960. In that year 21.9 per cent of the candidates who took English A passed. But look at the results in the other subjects. In Xhosa A the pass figure was 100 per cent, in Zulu A 68 per cent, in North Sotho 79.4 per cent, in Latin 57.2 per cent. This is the poor Bantu education and the lowered standard to which the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Eglin) referred! In Latin the pass figure was 57.2 per cent, in mathematics 46.5 per cent, in physics and chemistry 43.7 per cent, in chemistry 71.4 per cent, in biology 75.1 per cent, in botany 80.3 per cent, in zoology 54.5 per cent, in history 67.2 per cent, in geography 76.9 per cent, in commerce 89.9 per cent, in agriculture 60 8 per cent, and in domestic science 100 per cent. These are the other subjects that were written by Bantu candidates for the Joint Matriculation Examination. It will be seen therefore to the failures are due to the standard of English A in the examination of the Joint Matriculation Board. Hon. members must not tell me that it is because we introduced mother-tongue education into the schools that the results in English are poorer to-day, because these candidates who wrote English Higher for matric this year and the previous year are all products of the old set-up they are pupils who started in the English medium and who were taught throughout their school career through the medium of English. This is also my reply to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hushes) and to the Bantu who strongly insist that pupils should be taught in English because they say that English opens the doors of the world to them. But even instruction through the medium of English did not help to get these candidates through the examination, because they failed in English.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The inquiry that I instituted into the pass figures revealed another fact, and that is that the percentage who passed at schools where the staff is White is much higher than the percentage of passes at schools where the staff is made up of Bantu only. In the case of schools where the staff consisted partly of White teachers, the total pass figure was 20.5 per cent and where the staff consisted of Bantu only, it was 11.3 per cent. The inquiry also revealed that at schools which have hostels the pass figure is considerably higher, namely, 21.1 per cent, as against a figure of 12 per cent at day schools. As a result of this it is my firm intention to give more attention to hostel facilities, particularly in the Bantu areas, and I shall also have to go more slowly than we have done in the past in substituting Bantu for White teachers in the matriculation schools. As a result of the insistence of the Bantu to take over the teaching more and more themselves, we started concentrating a considerable time ago on replacing more and more Whites by Bantu in the high schools, but it is clear from the results that we shall have to apply the brake in this regard.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). He talked about &#x201C;job reservation in Bantu education &#x201D;, He says that some time ago he put a question to me about the number of senior posts in the Department of Bantu Education &#x2014;something like 70&#x2014;and he wanted to know how many of those were occupied by Bantu.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Thirty administrative and 70 professional.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Why did he draw the line there specifically and not a little lower? Because he drew the line just above the Bantu. In my reply I pointed out specifically that there was provision for Bantu posts just below the posts that he mentioned. But the insistence that inspectors of Bantu education should be Bantu persons comes from the Bantu and, <i>inter alia,</i> from the Territorial Authority of the Transkei. He then quoted what I had said on some occasion or other, namely that I agreed with it in principle, but that since we had this state of affairs that there was a shortage of qualified teachers with degrees, insufficient to staff the high schools, their numbers could not be further depleted by appointing more inspectors from their ranks, and that it was necessary therefore to retain the Whites. But we have in fact, for the first time in our history, made provision for 50 sub-inspectors. Every White inspector has a Bantu sub-inspector, and whereas the White inspector, apart from certain administrative work, confines himself mainly to inspection work in the high schools, the sub-inspectors are already employed partly at the senior schools, at the Junior Certificate schools, but in the main they do all the work in the primary schools with the assistance of their supervisors. Provision has already been made therefore, for the first time in our history, for Bantu to be appointed to these high posts which rank above the post of teacher. And more and more as the Bantu are able to fill those senior posts, the White inspectors will disappear from Bantu education and be replaced by Bantu inspectors.</p>

<p>That brings me at once to the question put to me by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories, and that is what I propose to do in connection with the demand of the Bantu Authorities to take over the control of their own affairs, and to what extent I propose to meet their demands as far as Bantu education is concerned. Let me say at once that we are already instituting a careful inquiry into the question as to how the school boards <span class="col_5573-5574" refersTo="page_1383"/>are to be linked up with the Regional Authorities, so that the supervisory work at schools will become a function of the Bantu Authority itself, perhaps with a sub-committee of the Bantu Authority, and so that they can take the place of the school boards. We could then also rectify another matter, and that is that whereas at the moment there is no right of appeal against the decision of a school board&#x2014;because I think it is wrong that the decision of a school board, which is a Bantu body, should be subject to the decision of the Minister or of the Secretary of a White Department, because one then takes away the initiative of the school board and it feels that it has no power&#x2014;but if the school board is linked up with the Regional Authority there can then be an appeal from the Education Committee to the Regional Authority or to the Territorial Authority. That will also make it possible for teachers, when they are dismissed, to appeal against the decision of the school board.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. I have already instructed the Department to institute very careful inquiries into the methods that we can adopt to transfer some of the administrative duties which are still being performed by my Department, either at head office or at the regional office, to the Territorial Authorities at this stage already. For example, there is the question of subsidizing school buildings on the rand-for-rand basis. My attitude is that instead of granting a certain amount for school buildings to a region, I could then grant it to the Territorial Authority. Similarly the creation of additional teaching posts and many other things could become a function of the Territorial Authority. I mention this just as an example. There are many similar matters which could really be done by the Bantu Authority but which are still being done at the present time by my Department, and I have already given instructions that the possibility of doing this is to be inquired into. As soon as the possibilities in this connection have been investigated, I shall arrange discussions with the various Territorial Authorities in an endeavour, with their cooperation, to divise a system whereby more and more of the responsibilities which rests on my Department at present can be transferred to them with a view to promoting Bantu self-care and independence. This is a matter which requires careful study, and at this stage therefore I merely want to say that we are already giving attention to this problem and that we shall continue to work along these lines in the best interests of the Bantu and of education generally. Instead of having an education body, or an advisory body, as the hon. member for Kensington called it, for the whole Union, a body composed of various people, we will then be in a position to have such a body perhaps for every national group, a body that will be able to assist the Territorial Authority in the performance of its duties and which will be able to advise me in connection with educational matters generally. We are already working along those lines.</p>

<p>I think I have replied now to most of the matters which had been mentioned here, but before I sit down I just want to refer to a very important remark that was passed here by the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter), a remark of which I am sorry this Committee did not take more notice, and that is that in Bantu education we are complying more and more with the ever-increasing demands for development. I refer to technical education, to which we are giving careful attention. We have certain vocational schools in which various technical subjects are taught, such as concrete work, bricklaying, iron work, plumbing, plate-metal work, electricians&#x2019; work, general mechanical work, leather work, upholstery and tailoring. In other words, we are training Bantu persons for the essential services that they will have to provide in the Bantu areas for their own people. But apart from that, we have gone a step further this year. We have introduced a technical Junior Certificate course in addition to the ordinary Junior Certificate course. The pupils still take six subjects but two of them may be technical subjects, and with two technical subjects together with the four other subjects they can now take a technical Junior Certificate course. The subjects from which they can choose are building construction, mechanics, carpentry and electro-technique. All those subjects are taught, together with the necessary workshop practices which go hand in hand with them. It will be seen therefore that we are really making an effort to meet the needs of the Bantu in his own areas. In the same way we have also made it possible at our high schools to take the ordinary Junior Certificate course with a commercial content, so that instead of the six ordinary subjects, two of the six may be commercial subjects so as to meet the great need that exists for people with commercial training in the Bantu community. It will be seen therefore that we are making a careful analysis in the Department of Bantu Education of every problem that arises, that we are putting our finger on the real trouble, as we are now doing in connection with the examination results. We then take the necessary steps and we are continually in touch with the other Departments, particularly the Department of Bantu Administration, to determine the needs of the Bantu in his developing community, and we are making provision for that in our policy.</p>

<p>This Vote is now R1,590,000 and as land settlement contributes to the stabilization of primary production and the settlement of the permanent population on the land, we would appreciate any information that the Minister can give us regarding the progress of this development. We would like to know the number of probationers the Minister has placed on the new land settlements like Sand vet and Pienaar&#x2019;s River and the Orange River Settlement. I notice that there is an increased allotment of R22,300 to the Orange River Settlement. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what progress has been made there and how much relief he has been able to give the settlers on the Levubu Settlement, whose plots the Minister recognized as being too small and for whom he has made provision for extended areas. Has the Minister been able to induce farmers at Levubu to sell some of their land to enable the adjoining settlers to extend their areas? In the selection of settlers, too, we would like to know whether settlers with farming experience or with capital have preferences, and we would also like the Minister to inform us what steps are taken to ensure impartiality in the allotment of plots to applicants. Originally in the administration of land settlements the probationer lessees were under the control of agricultural advisers and they were kept strictly to a programme as regards rotation of crops and the use of water and fertilizers until their ten-year period of probation ceased, when they were able to obtain title to their holdings. I wonder whether the Minister can tell us what has been his experience as regards the settlers who have now acquired permanent title? Do they still co-operate with the Department as regards the rotation of crops and what type of crops to plant, and is there liaison between the Department and the probationer settler? We would like to know that when an allotment is sold, has it got to be with the approval of the Land Board or the Committee of Control? Have they a say in who should be the purchaser of a plot when it is sold? We would also like to know whether adjoining farmers are allowed to purchase plots that are put up for sale, or are these plots wholly reserved for land settlement applicants? One naturally has some nervousness in regard to the regulation of the land settlements. We want these to be extended but we would like to feel that as regards the settlers there is absolute fairplay. Is the Minister putting up the same adequate houses on the new settlements that he built at Vaalhartz and Loskop, and are these plots provided with outbuildings? In regard to the implements provided for the settlers, are these paid in instalments over a period? Apart from that, we would like to know what attention the Minister pays to the social life? We notice there are towns in the settlements to which the Government makes considerable contributions. We wonder whether these towns are only Government-run towns, or do the inhabitants have a say, and do they have their own committees to administer, in conjunction with the Government, the services in these towns? I notice that R12,000 is collected from these towns and we wonder whether these towns are run on a democratic system as towns are generally run, or are they run entirely by the Government. We appreciate the establishment of these townships and the facilities they give for recreation and the excellent schools the Minister has built on the settlements, but we would very much appreciate any information the Minister could give us, because generally speaking, the progress of settlements does not appear in the news and this is the only opportunity we have of receiving information in regard to the development of land settlements. We would very much appreciate it if the Minister would give us any information he has available.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member, who I know takes a great interest in land settlement, has fired a large number of questions at me and I have some difficulty in keeping note of all of them but I will try to answer them as fully as possible.</p>

<p>He spoke about our villages and the social amenities there, and asked whether the people living in these villages had any say in the management of the towns under a democratic system. I would like to point out that in the villages&#x2014;I think he refers to the villages we have at Vaalhartz and the one at Pongola&#x2014; they are ordinary villages in the ordinary sense of the word. We have assisted them very largely. We have laid them out and we have then sold plots. In many cases we have supplied them with water and with electricity, and then as soon as that village is strong enough to undertake the responsibilities of an ordinary village, it then becomes a village under the provincial regulations. The people then own the village and have full control of it. We sell the plots in the village from time to time, but we generally grant the village a large amount of commonage, and on the whole they are working very well indeed. I think if the hon. member could come to Jan Kemp one day he would be surprised to see that it is a most charming village indeed, a village laid out with care and provision for the future and laid out with an aesthetic sense and with beautiful avenues and streams of water and nice public buildings and churches. I think the hon. member can rest assured that these villages are very nice and very go-ahead villages, and the fact that there is a settlement there gives them a chance to grow very quickly. Although they are very modern they have not got that straggling look which so many new villages in the countryside have. They are more compact and for their age they are very well developed indeed.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted to know whether the probationers pay back the cost of the implements given to them. Yes, they pay it back in instalments according to the value of the particular implement.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of holdings which <span class="col_5577-5578" refersTo="page_1385"/>are sold, I presume that the member is referring to our closer settlements. He wants to know whether, when we sell these holdings, we only sell them to farmers who are going to farm there, or whether we also sell them to farmers who have other farms but who want them as an adjunct to their other farms, as in the case, for example, of a sheep farmer who wants a holding on which he can grow lucerne for his sheep. That is not our policy: our policy is to make these holdings large enough to enable the man to make a decent living there. However, when he gets transfer of it and it becomes his own property, he is free to sell it to whomsoever he likes, and it quite often happens then that he sells it to a farmer in some other part of the country. But the allotments are not made to farmers as an adjunct to their farms. He also wanted to know what happened to people after they became owners and whether there was liaison between them and those who were still &#x2026;</p>

<p>Probationers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>Actually there are two stages. There is the probationer and then there is the lessee. The probationer goes through a probationary period of one or two years just to see whether he is successful and if he is successful he becomes a lessee, and then in ten years&#x2019; time if he pays off the purchase price, he can become the owner. There are really three stages, therefore. The stage to which I referred, in which he is assisted with implements, is the probationary stage: the second stage is the lessee stage. The lessee is a pretty well independent man. The probationer, for instance, has to hand over to us one-quarter of his income. This is kept as a reserve for him, so that when it is large enough it helps to give him a start as a lessee, because when he becomes a lessee he does not get the help from the State that the probationer gets. The probationer can also get an allowance, almost a wage, to develop his own holding and to get going. When he becomes a lessee all that stops. For all practical purposes he is then an independent farmer except that he has to subscribe to the rules and regulations. When he becomes an owner, then as far as his agricultural connections with the Department are concerned, he falls under the officers of the Department of Agriculture and not under the officers of the Department of Lands. The officers of the Department of Lands are responsible for the probationers and for the lessees, but in a settlement where you have both types&#x2014;because after 10 years you start getting people who become owners&#x2014; there is a strong liaison between the officers of the Department of Agriculture and those of the Department of Lands. There is generally a holding there which is put aside for experimental and for demonstration purposes, and that is run for the owner, for the lessee and for the probationer but it is run by the Department of Agriculture and their officers.</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know how we chose our settlers and if we were satisfied that the settlers who have become owners&#x2014; and I presume he also means those who have become lessees&#x2014;are making a success of their allotments. Well, I have here the average gross income at most of our settlements. Some of them are too small; some of those that were granted originally when land settlement was not so much an endeavour to create new economic farms but rather to solve the poor White problem and the problem of unemployment and to give the man something better at any rate than he had, on some of those old settlements the income is not very high, but on the majority they make a very fair living indeed. On the more modern settlements&#x2014;say from the time of Vaalhartz onwards&#x2014;they make a very decent living indeed if they farm well.</p>

<p>Can you give any idea of the net income?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>No, I cannot give the hon. member the net income but I have the gross income here. At Vaalhartz the average gross income last year was R4,158. On the Orange River Settlement, one of the old settlements where the plots were too small, it was just R1,700. Lavubu is quite a big settlement and there it is R2.300, at Loskop R5,800, at Sterk River R3.370, at Riet River practically R4,000, at the Olifants River Settlement R2.460, and at Pongola R10,000. That is the average gross income. On the very small ones the expenses of the farmer are also low because he does most of the work himself; he does not employ much labour. It is very doubtful whether more than 40 per cent of this income would go towards expenses, which gives these people quite a good living.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted to know whether experience and capital count in the selection of settlers. Well, it all depends. We have various systems of land settlement in South Africa. We have the Section 20 system. That is where the buyer contributes 10 per cent of the capital and we advance him 90 per cent. He can go anywhere and choose his own bit of land, subject to our confirmation. We buy it for him and he then has the right to buy it back from us after five years and not ten. In that case it is generally necessary for the man to have quite a substantial amount of capital&#x2014;not so much that he could start on his own but still a good deal of capital. Then there is Section 23. Those are generally cattle or sheep farms. They are larger farms, and there the man must also have capital or capital invested in kind or machinery, and generally something like &#x00A3;1,500 to &#x00A3;3,000 capital is necessary. On the closed settlements, however, the man need not have any capital whatever. In fact, we actually pay him a wage&#x2014;it has always been done&#x2014;during his probationary period to help him to get on to his feet. We, therefore, have schemes under which we can get a man <span class="col_5579-5580" refersTo="page_1386"/>in without any capital, and in the case of the other schemes he requires proportionately more capital as the scheme advances.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to know how these people are chosen and whether they are making a success of their farming. On the whole I would say they are making a good success. Many of our larger schemes like Vaalhartz, Loskop and Pongola, are very beautiful indeed, and anybody going there would be very favourably impressed by the general standard of farming, the neatness of their farms, the productivity of the soil and the class of settler we have there. But we have had disappointments, and I was of the opinion that we had had more disappointments than we should have had, so I devised a new scheme for selecting our settlers. That new method has been in operation for about a year and it is giving very good results indeed. What happened previously was this: We used to advertise certain holdings and we would get a tremendous number of applicants. In one case for, I think, 16 holdings at Pongola we had something like 1,600 applicants. A great variety of people were optimistic enough to think that they stood a chance. One clergyman was optimistic to think that the acres that he was accustomed to ploughing would be the same acres that he would be expected to plough at Pongola. He did not get a holding. These selections are finally made by our land boards. As you can imagine, if you have a large number of applicants it is pretty well impossible to interview all of them personally because they are spread all over the country, and it is very difficult on the <i>prima facie</i> evidence before you to select the right people. What we do now is to have a smaller body comprising the superintendent of the land settlement scheme in which the allotments are going to be made, a senior man from the Department of Agriculture and a senior man from my Department and two members of the Land Board. They go through the applications and they throw out all those applicants who are obviously unfit. Then they take those whom they think might be suitable for selection&#x2014; generally two or three times as many as the number of allotments to be made&#x2014;and then they try to find out this man&#x2019;s antecedence. For instance, if a man in, say, Malmesbury, applies for an allotment at Lavubu or Vaalhartz, it is impossible for the Land Board up there to know what sort of man he is down here. We then get in touch with the magistrate down here and with our own officials. They interview this man and if he is a lessee of ground they see how he is farming; if he is a bywoner they see how he is farming; they see whether his family life is suitable and whether he is likely to be a successful settler. These final ones then come to the Land Board which has before it the selections made by these committees. We are finding that this is working very well indeed, and that people who otherwise would not stand much chance, generally because they live too far away and cannot come and interview the board personally, are also being taken into consideration. As far as the Section 20 scheme is concerned, which is one of our best&#x2014;the one-tenth scheme, under the old Section 11&#x2014;there has been a great diminution this year in the number of applicants. In fact the number of applicants for help under this section has fallen by over 50 per cent. This year we had only about 50 per cent of the applicants we had last year. I think the reason for that is that the terms on which the Land Bank is now lending money to people has made it easier for them to get that help from the Land Bank rather than to come to us.</p>

<p>As far as our closer settlements are concerned, we are at present going through a period where we have not many allotments to make, because these allotments always depend on the completion of an irrigation scheme. No big irrigation scheme has been completed in the last few years. The old schemes are getting filled up, but with the two new large dams which are being built on the Vet River and the Sand River in the Free State, we will probably have a large number of holdings to be given out next year under the Vet River and the Sand River settlements. I think I can say that on the whole our settlements are working very well. You do get complaints, of course, and if people did not complain they would not be human. On the whole, however, our settlements are working very well, and our settlers are earning more than they used to earn. One of the reasons for that is this. The hon. member did not ask this question but I mention it because it is of general interest. I was dissatisfied with the methods of farming used on various settlements of ours, especially at Loskop. I ascribed it to the fact that the difficulty of the people there was that they had nothing to go on. Here you have a new agricultural settlement in a place where there was no agriculture before hand. Now, if I buy a farm in, let us say, the Worcester valley, I can go to any of my neighbours and discuss farming problems with him. These people have had experience and they can enlighten me because people had been farming there for hundreds of years. But when you place a settlement in what was practically desert beforehand, as in the case of Vaalhartz or Loskop, there is nobody to whom they can turn for advice. Everybody starts experimenting with his own particular theory and you get a complete muddle as far as farming methods are concerned. Many of them are successful and many are not nearly as successful as they should be. I therefore appointed a committee to go into the farming methods at Loskop and various other settlements of ours, and they have now given me their report on two settlements, including Loskop, in which they set out the pattern of farming which they consider would be the best and the most economical for that settlement. We do not keep the man stringently to that <span class="col_5581-5582" refersTo="page_1387"/>particular pattern. He has a choice of two or three different patterns. He might specialize chiefly in tobacco; on the other hand he may be more interested in the production of wheat. He can decide which pattern he wants to follow but then he has to keep to that pattern, except that on a certain portion of his farm he is allowed to plant anything he likes. But if he is a tobacco grower he has to plant tobacco; he has to have certain rotational crops which had been found to be the most suitable for that area. I think in this way we will be able to increase the average income of our farmers very considerably. The good man is all right; If a man makes more than a certain amount we say that he can go on without this help; he does not need it. But it is the &#x201C; suk-kelaar &#x201D; to whom we have to say, &#x201C; you are not doing on this holding of yours what you ought to do and we want you to follow this particular method of farming, and we then expect you to do better and we think you will do better I think one of the reasons why the average income at Loskop is so high this year is not only that they had a good season, but I think it is due partly to the fact that the investigations that we conducted there are beginning to bear fruit and that people are following the patterns of farming laid down by us.</p>

<p>I think that answers most of the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister said in passing that the gross income of the Sterk River settlement is R3.370. The information which I received is that the people are struggling on that settlement and I would like the hon. the Minister to reply to the following questions: He gave us the gross income of those people but we do not know what their net income is. Is the hon. the Minister satisfied that the farmers can make a living there? Have any of the settlers already left the plots because they cannot make a living there? How many of them had to go and work out because they could not make a decent living there? Then I would also like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he wants to expand the settlement or whether he wants to limit it because the farmers cannot make a good living there?</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also referred to the older settlements and said that the income there was smaller than on the new settlements. Was he, for example, making a comparison between the Orange River settlement, which is an old settlement with an average gross income of R1,700, and the Pongola settlement where the average gross income is R10,000? Mr. Chairman, several months ago I had the privilege of seeing many of the settlements along the Orange River.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot see who the hon. member is who is so concerned about this. The hon. member knows so little, in any case, that one cannot take much notice of him. I am talking about the Orange River settlement and several months ago I was privileged to see many of the farmers there. What struck me in particular was that the plots were so small. Most of those farmers cultivate lucerne and I just cannot see how they manage to make a living there. On inquiry I learnt that it was the policy of the Department to try to enlarge the plots by, for example, taking up the plots of deceased owners and not letting it to others but using them to enlarge existing plots, and I would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether that is correct. As I said, I cannot understand how those people can make a living there and I think it deserves the serious consideration of the Department. It was very clear to me that there it was a question of struggling for an existence. I know that the hon. the Minister is interested in it and I would appreciate if he could tell me that there will definitely be an improvement in those people&#x2019;s circumstances.</p>

<p>Then I would like some information in connection with the Makatini Flats settlement where the new Pongolapoort dam is now being built. I want to make it clear that what I am going to say now is based on hearsay. As far as I know no start has yet been made with the settlement but people living in that vicinity have put the following questions to me. They asked me whether trading rights would be granted on the future Makatini Flats settlement. If that is so, what kind of trading rights would be concerned? Would farmers be protected against a monopoly? Would trading rights be tendered for? If there is already a syndicate which has tendered or applied for such trading rights, who are the members of the syndicate? A further question was whether settlers would have the right to establish their own co-operatives there or whether all business rights would be granted to the syndicate? As I said before, as far as I know no start has yet been made with the settlement on the Makatini Flats, but these questions have been put to me and I would like the hon. the Minister to reply to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to bring a few matters pertinently to the notice of the hon. the Minister. Before doing so, however, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and the Department for the way in which they have rendered service to settlers in South Africa during the past three or four years. I have analysed the figures for 1956-7 to 1958-9. Permit me to say that it is no use trying to compare what the National Party has done with what the United Party did in the past. I just want to give one example. The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) had much to say about plots on the <span class="col_5583-5584" refersTo="page_1388"/>Orange River scheme which are too small. Mr. Chairman, that is the result of the United Party&#x2019;s deeds and this hon. Minister is now trying to correct what can be corrected there if the plots are too small. During the few years from 1956-7 to 1958-9 this Department in terms of Section 53 (the purchase of cattle and improvements) assisted 1,220 farmers to an amount of R4,104.554. In terms of Section 42 (immovable improvements) they assisted 538 farmers in those three years to an amount of R279,760. Let us now examine the plots granted under Section 20. We know that there have been fewer applications during recent years. During these three years there were 763 applicants who were assisted to an amount of more than R6,330,000 with which they bought 174,404 morgen of land. Let us now look at the plots granted in terms of Section 23 during these three years. Two hundred and thirty-nine farmers were assisted to acquire 470,141 morgen which cost the State R1,673,000. Mr. Chairman, much is heard about the de-population of the platteland and that no services are rendered to the farmers of the country, but here it is shown that in these three years the Department assisted settlers with an amount of R8,678,844. I repeat that it is no use trying to compare what has been achieved during the period that the National Party has been in power with what the United Party Government did because the National Party has been busy all this time remedying the mistakes of the United Party. That is why the hon. member for Drakensberg weeps so copiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I now want to make representations to the hon. the Minister in connection with the 160 settlers at Pongola. Those settlers were originally granted 76,800 tons of sucrose as a quota for sugar or cane which they could produce. That is equivalent to approximately 537,000 tons of cane. But now with over-production and the curtailment of cane it is found that those settlers cannot attain the maximum production. Some of those settlers are still busy building up to the quota granted to them. Last year the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs made a special concession through which Pongola could obtain an extra 41,737 tons of cane, but that 41,737 tons of extra cane included not only the settlers but also a number of private people, the millers among others, with the result that of the approximately 41,000 tons the settlers only got about 30,000 tons, or 160 tons extra per settler. My appeal is that after the Department of Commerce and Industries has allocated the quota to Pongola&#x2014;and I hope that it will be a global quota so that they can divide it there as they like&#x2014;and it has been determined what quantity of land will not be put under cane and will therefore not be productive to the farmers, that consideration will be given to allowing other crops to be planted there. I know that the hon. the Minister is inclined to permit one-year crops to be planted but I hope that in these times of a sugar quota which results in a curtailment, consideration will be given to permitting other crops which take longer to mature also to be planted there during that period (perhaps a period of four or five or six years). The curtailment is there and I think the matter deserves attention.</p>

<p>Now I also want to say something about the Makatini Flats but it is in an entirely different connection from the one referred to by the hon. member for Drakensberg, because I do not believe that the hon. the Minister concerns himself with commercial matters. In that connection the people can apply to the Provincial Councils and then licences can be granted to traders to start trade businesses, etc. The matter I want to raise in connection with the Makatini Flats is two-fold. First of all I want to request that the Department of Lands should expedite the purchasing of land in the dam basin and that it should finalize the matter as soon as possible. There are a number of farmers there who must seek another livelihood and from time to time land comes into the market which those farmers could buy but because everybody expects that those farmers will obtain tremendously high prices there is an artificial rise in land prices in the vicinity which does not fall under the dam basin and it is sometimes impossible for them to pay that price. If there is finality in connection with this matter then things will return to normal again. At the same time I want to ask that when land is purchased consideration should also be given to the production potential of the land as such, that the present production be considered and that there will be no limitations and that the standpoint should not be adopted that as a result of a certain quantity of water being allocated the valuation of the ground should be determined accordingly. My request, however, is that the matter should be expedited. The hon. the Minister said that probably the planting of fibres in the area behind the mountain would be investigated. I now ask that the possibility should also be investigated of allotting all the cattle farms in that vicinity subsequent to a servitude that farmers may only produce a certain type of cattle and that they will sell all the young calves to the settlement when they are weaned. The settlement should also be divided into small camps with certain types of grazing being planted there, such as clover, lucerne and other kinds of grazing&#x2014;similar to a scheme in the Argentine&#x2014;and the settlers should keep the young cattle on the settlement for about 11 months and then put them on the market. Through that an export market for the best grade of export meat could be developed. South Africa faces a meat shortage, as was announced by the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, and such a scheme would lend itself to the environment. The calves will be bought from the breeders and they will be fed on the settlement and will be sold on the market as &#x201C; baby beefers &#x201D;, animals which are not fed at the manger but which have an even quality of meat with an even spreading of fat, and which <span class="col_5585-5586" refersTo="page_1389"/>is not lumpy. This will be an excellent scheme if it could be implemented. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. A. F. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>There are one or two matters which I would like to raise briefly with the hon. the Minister, and in the first place the matter to which both the hon. member for Wakkerstroom and the hon. member for Drakensberg have referred, the question of the Makatini Flats Irrigation Scheme. That is something which has come about since the Lands Vote was under discussion last year in this House. Now apart from the specific issue raised by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to take this opportunity to give the House a full account of what his Department has in mind in regard to the proposed irrigation scheme and the proposed settlement scheme on the Makatini Flats. When the hon. Minister of Water Affairs raised the matter last year, it caused a great deal of interest throughout South Africa, and particularly in the Province of Natal. At that stage the main reasons given by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs for the project were that it was hoped that this settlement scheme could become a sugar producing area. It would appear that the hon. the Minister of Lands has somewhat different thoughts in regard to that matter, and I think it is important that the hon. the Minister should tell us precisely what the Department of Lands sees the future of his settlement scheme to be. There have been reactions from parts of Natal to the statement which was initially made by the Minister of Water Affairs, and I think if the hon. the Minister could tell us from his Department&#x2019;s point of view how he regards the future of this settlement, it would be of great benefit to those who are interested in the development of this area.</p>

<p>There are other matters which I would like briefly to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, and there is firstly again the general question of the future of Crown Land in Zululand. We know that there is something over 350,000 morgen of Crown Land in Zululand, and we know too that part of that Crown Land will have to go to the South African Native Trust. This matter has been raised time and time again, and I want again to ask the hon. the Minister whether any progress has been made during the past year, since the matter was discussed in this House last year, in regard to the future of the Crown Land in Zululand with particular reference to that part which we know eventually will have to go to the Native Trust.</p>

<p>Then also related to the question of Crown Land generally in Zululand is the question which the Minister has mentioned on previous occasions of an exchange of Crown Land with the Natal Provincial Administration.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place I should like to make use of this opportunity to assure the Minister that we in this House are very, very glad that he has recovered so completely from his recent accident and that he is able to be with us here again to give his attention to matters of this kind. Perhaps he has not fully recovered his strength, but we are convinced that with his experience he will take everything in his stride.</p>

<p>There are a few matters that I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice, particularly in connection with the Vaalhartz settlement. The dairy farmers there are going through a difficult time. The hon. the Minister made certain concessions to them recently. He allowed them to grow ground-nuts and to sow wheat, and where they have land which is scheduled for lucerne, he allowed them to sow an additional 20 per cent. But I want to point out that if a farm is scheduled for 5 morgen of lucerne and the farmer is only allowed to sow 20 per cent more, it only means one extra morgen, a total of 6 morgen, and that is not very much. These people have to make provision for the proper feeding of their stock, particularly in the winter, and I think the hon. the Minister will agree that 6 morgen of lucerne is not very much. Moreover, there is not sufficient water to irrigate the 6 morgen. I know that this water does not fall under the jurisdiction of the hon. the Minister, but even if additional land can be put under lucerne and even if they are allowed to grow groundnuts, that concession is not of much assistance unless there is sufficient water. I felt that I should bring this to the Minister&#x2019;s notice, and I should like to suggest that the Minister appoint a commission to institute a thorough investigation on the spot so that he can ascertain precisely what the position is there, and so that that commission can approach every farmer, every individual farmer, to determine precisely what his position is. In asking for this, I am not asking for anything that would involve a great deal of work, because there are not many of these small farmers or dairy farmers, and I am convinced that a commission that makes investigations on the spot will be able to approach every farmer individually so as to discuss his position with him and thus learn precisely what is needed and what has to be done to enable these people to make a proper living.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter in connection with Vaalhartz, a matter which has often been raised and which has already received a great deal of attention, but nevertheless one which has not been satisfactorily settled, and that is the position of the smallholders and of the occupiers of plots which are situated on a slope. There are two aspects of the Vaalhartz settlement <span class="col_5587-5588" refersTo="page_1390"/>which are not yet satisfactory and to which a very great deal of attention will have to be given. As far as these plots situated on a slope are concerned, I can assure the hon. the Minister that representations are continually being made to me to provide assistance to those people. The position is that some of these holdings are too small; a report is then perhaps submitted by the Land Board to the effect that these holdings are too small, and then an extra piece of odd land is given to the occupier of such a holding. That extra piece of land is given to him for a period of one year, and this is renewed from year to year. This has a retarding influence on the farming activities of the settler because he realizes that the extra piece of ground that is allocated to him or rather that is leased to him, is not his property. Year after year he has to ask for permission to keep it for another year, with the result that he cannot bring about any permanent improvements or permanent works on that extra piece of land. In view of the fact that there are practically no more holdings left for allocation at Vaalhartz, I think the time has come when attention should be given to the question of allocating these odd pieces of ground, of which there are a good many at Vaalhartz, on a permanent basis to people when their holdings are either too small or situated on a slope. I can give the Minister the assurance that there are people who are exerting all their energies to make a decent living at Vaalhartz, but because of the situation of the holdings, it is simply impossible to do so. There are other people too who have done a great deal of work at Vaalhartz in levelling the ground. There are some people who have excavated and carted away up to 4 feet of soil in an attempt to level their holdings, and who have found after they have done so that they are worse off than before, after having spent an enormous amount on this work. One cannot remove huge quantities of soil with a bulldozer for the purpose of levelling the ground without incurring considerable expense. These people removed all the fertile top soil, and when they started to plough, sow and cultivate the soil, they found that they could produce nothing on that soil. These are matters which ought to receive serious attention. The Vaalhartz farmers who have sufficiently large holdings and who have level holdings are doing well. It is a pleasure to see what these people are accomplishing. But there are these exceptions where people are faced with the difficulty that their holdings are either too small or situated on a slope. Sir, you can imagine the state of mind of these people when they see how their neighbours, their fellow-farmers, are making headway while they either make no headway or go downhill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to reply on these few matters before the list becomes too long. I want to thank the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) for welcoming me back to the House after my enforced absence, and I want to give him the assurance that I would much rather be here than to have to go through what I went through just lately. He is somebody who is always very interested in Vaalhartz and to-day he again made a number of very reasonable requests in regard to improvements which might be effected there. Now I want to give the hon. member certain information which I think will give him quite a lot of satisfaction. But in regard to the matter concerning these odd bits of land, he knows that eventually these odd bits will probably all be allotted to people who have inferior plots or whose plots are too small. But at the moment we are still holding these bits of land because it often happens there that in the beginning a plot is a very good one but that owing to drainage troubles that plot or part of it deteriorates and becomes useless. Then we have to help such a man, and hitherto we always utilized these odd bits of land in order to assist such a man, but the Department of Water Affairs, which is now busy with this huge drainage scheme, is gradually decreasing the danger of plots becoming brackish, and when the time arrives when we feel that the danger is past and that it is no longer necessary to retain certain bits of land because of this danger, we will increasingly be able to allot this land to the people.</p>

<p>In regard to the sloping plots and small plots and the dairy farmers, there is at the moment a committee investigating the position. Mr. Hugo, the Assistant Director of Settlements, is there and the Agricultural and Irrigation officials are there, and they are investigating particularly these sloping plots and the small dairy farmers to ascertain whether these people get enough water or not. I have no control over the water. If the people there want to plan lucerne for their own use, I shall be only too glad, because every morgen of lucerne is equivalent to 20 morgen of grazing, but the limiting factor is the amount of water available and I have no control over that. But I have now got the Department of Water Affairs to go there, together with my Department, and where my Department will investigate the problem of the sloping plots, they will together investigate the position of the small farmers and their water requirements, to see whether it is possible to supply them with sufficient water. The investigation is starting now; I think they arrived there today.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) referred to the other crops we allow the people at Pongola to plant on the land which cannot now be planted to sugar cane as the result of the cut in the quota. We are very sorry about this cut in the quota. It is the industry itself which cut the quotas. If I were to have done it, I would have cut it in a different way, because by cutting the small man&#x2019;s quota less it would make a big difference to him, but it would make only a small difference to the larger growers.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>I hope that is now being investigated. I strongly recommended that it should be done in that way, and I hope that their quota will be higher, even though it cannot be 100 per cent. But then the people asked me to allow them to plant other crops on the land on which they are not allowed to plant sugar cane now. Now I must first say that this scheme was established as a sugar scheme, and got the millers to erect the mill there on the strength of our promise that this would become a sugar scheme, and it must remain a sugar scheme. Now there are many people there who want to use this as an excuse to plant orange trees and all kinds of permanent things there, but it is a sugar scheme and it must remain one. If it is a question of a plot which stands there for two or three years&#x2014;I do not know what kind of plots they are; I know of crops which stand for one year, and others which stand for 20 or 30 years&#x2014;but if there is something which perhaps takes two years to mature and they come to me with such a suggestion, I will be prepared to investigate it, but I will not allow it to be used as a back door for those people who now want to get away from sugar and who want to plant citrus there to make it a citrus settlement. It will have to remain a sugar-growing settlement, and the people who went there knew that they were buying subject to that condition, and they are doing very well there, and I think that in general the settlers on the Pongola Settlement have very little reason for complaint.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a very interesting suggestion here, viz. that if one day we cut up the Makatini Flats the farmers round about should farm with a certain type of cattle which can be fattened by the people on the settlement. That is a very interesting thought and we shall devote attention to it. I do not want to go into the matter further, but I would like to say a few words in general about the whole problem of the Makatini Flats. There is a lot of land there and it is very good soil. We know that there is enough good soil, but part of it lies in the Native reserves. We do not know where the dividing line is between the good soil and the poorer soil, and we cannot plan our settlement there until we have surveyed the whole of the Makatini Flats, because certain exchanges of land will have to be effected. There is one small Native reserve right in the middle of this land. It would be much better for those people if that reserve could adjoin the existing reserves, but in view of the fact that we have to exchange land for land of equal value, we must now make a survey of the value of the land there, because it is irrigable land and they will have to be given irrigable land in exchange. We therefore have to determine what the size is of the various types of land, and there are various factors connected with that. There is the question of what are we going to plant there. Originally the idea was to make it a sugar-growing settlement, because the sugar authorities were of the opinion that we would be able to carry on for many, many years before we had an over-production of sugar. Improved farming methods and favourable seasons have resulted in our having a surplus of sugar. Therefore the sugar programme for the Makatini Flats will have to be postponed, because we cannot plant sugar cane there if we already have a surplus of sugar in the rest of the Union.</p>

<p>The Department of Agriculture, together with my Department, are therefore investigating what methods of agriculture will be best there, and when we know what types of farming should be practised there, only then will we be able to decide how large the plots will be and the hundred and one other things connected with it. The first thing required is to have a soil survey, and that soil survey will now be done not by the State, but because we are in a great hurry&#x2014;I think it has already been approved; it falls under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services&#x2014;we are going to get an overseas firm to come and make this survey because they can do it so much more speedily than the Department can, seeing that the Department&#x2019;s hands are already very full. In this connection tenders are already being received. When we have all the information, we will be able to say how much good soil there is, where the canals will be, what type of agriculture should be practised there and how big the plots should be for that type of agriculture, etc. But it is no use taking any decisions before we have those data available. That is also the reply to the hon. member for Zululand and I think that is all I can say at the moment. I only hope that the hon. member for Drakensberg, who is not here at the moment, will not continue spreading these wild rumours with which she came along here, such as in regard to trading rights and land we are alleged to be selling, etc. This has not even been considered yet and it will take many years before we will even be able to consider these things. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom also referred to the buying out of the farmers in the dam basin. In regard to this matter we are moving as quickly as possible, but large areas of land are concerned and the people are not easy to negotiate with. We will take into consideration the matters mentioned by the hon. member and pay them a fair price for their land, and the value of the land will be carefully determined. We shall also be prepared to lease the land to those people if they want to keep on farming there until such time as that land is submerged. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. R. A. F. Swart) spoke about the general question of Crown land in Zululand. A committee has now been appointed to investigate this matter, and it consists of representatives of the Departments of Bantu Administration, Lands, Forestry and <span class="col_5591-5592" refersTo="page_1392"/>Agriculture. They have now got together and said that they cannot continue with that work until such time as this intensive soil survey has been made, because the value of the land in the Makatini Flats will play an important r&#x00F4;le in any exchange of land which might take place. That is a second reason why we are employing an outside firm to make that survey as soon as possible. As soon as we have the survey the value of the various bits of land which will perhaps have to be exchanged can be determined.</p>

<p>The hon. member also complained about the exchange of land with the Provincial Administration of Natal. There are two game reserves in Natal, the Hluhluwe and the one about 20 miles south of it, the Umfolosi Reserve, where the white rhinoceroses are. The white rhinoceroses are somewhat wilful. They do not want to stay in the reserve and prefer grazing on the Crown land outside the reserve. It is therefore necessary for us, as it were, to bring the mountain to Mohammed if Mohammed does not want to go to the mountain, and to make certain changes to the borders of the reserve so that the white rhinoceroses will be inside the reserve. We have already arrived at a preliminary agreement with the Provincial Administration as to what pieces of land should be added to the Umfolosi Reserve, but now it is very important, particularly in the case of game reserves, namely the Hluhluwe and the Umfolosi, that they should be joined together. In between the two there is a piece of land called the Corridor. I have told the Natal Provincial Administration that I am willing to give them a portion of the Corridor in exchange for the Mkusi Game Reserve, because this is a reserve portion of the area of which will probably be inundated as the result of the building of the Pongola Dam. It is a very good cattle area. Then they will have one big game reserve in one piece, viz. the two they have at present plus the bit in between. If they have that they will have a nice, clearly demarcated game reserve with, I think, everything which the Natal Provincial Administration needs. I find that the Natal Provincial Administration is rather like a coquette in regard to this matter. She keeps on enticing one, and when one thinks she is going to say yes there is some hitch again. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) co-operated with me and with them to try to get finality in regard to the suggestion I made, and I hope that within the near future we shall be able to come to an agreement and that the exchange will take place.</p>

<p>But I may tell the hon. member for Zulu-land this, that by far the greatest portion of the land we own in Zululand would eventually have to become Native reserves, and be given to the Trust. It is much better for us to give that land to the Trust, because we are under an obligation to give the Trust land. It is also compulsory to do so in Natal in terms of the law. Unless we give the Trust that Crown land on which nobody is living, or where Natives have already settled, we must buy the land from White people to give to the Trust, whilst we have Crown land there which we can hand over. In the meantime we have the difficulty that the Natives are beginning to encroach on the Crown land. If we have to give them land and Natives have already settled there, then they are there and it makes no difference. But if they settle on land which was not intended for the Native Trust, we will have great difficulty in getting them to leave again. Therefore it is necessary to reach finality as to what land will go to the Trust and what will not. That is another reason why we ask that this survey should be completed as soon as possible. I think I have now dealt with all these matters.</p>

<p>I may just say, in regard to Sterkrivier, that this is one of the places where we made investigations and obtained a report in regard to the agricultural methods to be applied there. The income of our people there has also improved. They were badly hit by hail last year, which to a large extent destroyed the tobacco crop. Although it was insured, the insurance payments are less than the amount the crop produced. The people there found dungs a little difficult. The hon. member for Drakensberg wanted to know whether anybody had left that settlement. Has the hon. member ever heard of a settlement which was never left by anybody? We have quite a few people on every settlement whom we would be only too pleased to see leaving. It is usually the weak type of man who leaves. Then she wanted to know whether there are people who take employment outside. There are people who do that on every settlement, with our permission. If a settler has finished planting his tobacco, and the time for planting is past, and a storm destroys his tobacco, it is no use him sitting there to watch the destroyed tobacco rotting. He then comes to us and says his crop has been destroyed, and asks for permission to go and work until the next planting season in order to earn a little money. We are sensible people and we agree. I do not know whether the hon. member objects to that.</p>
