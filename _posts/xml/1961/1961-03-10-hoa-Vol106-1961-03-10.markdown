<heading>LOSSES BY FARMERS DURING DROUGHTS</heading>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, in view of the enormous and disastrous losses repeatedly suffered by farmers as a result of droughts, this House is of the opinion that the Government should consider the advisability of appointing a commission consisting of experts and practical farmers to institute an exhaustive inquiry <span class="col_2779-2780" refersTo="page_1405"/>aimed at devising means whereby farmers can retain their stock in times of drought and thus contribute their share towards keeping the country&#x2019;s economy on a sound basis.</block>

<p>I maintain that with a view to the present conditions prevailing in this country, this is the most important motion that can be introduced in this House at the moment. We know that this country of ours, or certain areas of it, is in the grip of a terrible drought. We also know that even if this drought were broken, as sure as the sun shines up above, there will be another drought in the future, because this country is subject to periodic droughts. Unless something is done which will ensure that the terrible losses sustained by the farmers are limited to the minimum, there is the danger that because of these losses we will be unable in future to meet the needs of the country as far as food is concerned. Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that I am not introducing this motion in order to prove that all the farmers are threatened with bankruptcy, as is sometimes alleged. On the contrary, we know that some farmers are extremely well off but we also have to admit that the position of the farmers in many areas in this country is definitely not good. This motion of mine has reference in particular to those areas.</p>

<p>Secondly we must remember that the Government is not responsible for these droughts. It is something which we experience periodically in this country, and against which we have to arm ourselves if we wish to combat it and if we wish to limit the losses to the minimum. In the third place this motion of mine is not intended to indicate that the Government is unaware of prevailing conditions. The Government is indeed aware of them and having listened to the explanation of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing the other day as to what the Government has done to bring relief to those drought-stricken areas, and considering the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Transport the day before yesterday when he told the House in the clearest of terms what the Railways had done in order to combat the drought conditions, there is only one thing left for me to do, and I am convinced that I am speaking on behalf of the farmers of the whole country or on behalf of the farmers in the drought-stricken areas, and that is to convey the thanks of those farmers to the Government for what the Government has done to relieve this serious condition. I repeat that if we consider what the Minister of Transport has explained it must be clear to everyone that the position is serious in this country and I think it is fitting for this House to give its attention to this matter.</p>

<p>We are aware of the fact that the Government has established the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board. In addition we have the Land Bank which to the best of its ability assists farmers who apply for assistance. However, I am not merely asking for temporary assistance. The object of my motion is to devise means by which we can in future avoid what we have repeatedly experienced in the past in this country. No one will deny that the farmers have on numerous occasions and repeatedly suffered severe losses as a result of droughts. Since the establishment of Union in 1910 there have been various periods which have been regarded as very dry periods, and I want to deal with those particular periods. The year which comes to my mind in the first instance is the year 1919 and I think hon. members will agree with me that for a long time after 1919 people regarded that year as the worst year they had experienced up to that time. I tried to obtain statistics in regard to the losses suffered by the farmers in 1919 but unfortunately I was not able to do so but after 1919 the Government of the day thought it proper to appoint a commission to inquire into the monetary losses which the farmers had sustained in 1919. According to the report of that commission the farmers suffered losses to the tune of R32,000,000 in 1919. Special means were applied at that time to rehabilitate the farmer and to place him on a sound basis but in spite of that droughts followed time and again with consequent severe losses to the farmer. I want to give the House a few figures. I apologize for the fact that I have to come to this House with figures, Sir; I realize that figures are not always very interesting but where we are dealing with such an important matter as this, you have to give figures to substantiate what you are saying. As hon. members know it is the duty of the farmer to provide the country with food and I maintain that the farmers of the Union have succeeded in providing the country with it staple varieties of food. I read in the newspapers the other day that the wheat crop for 1960 was expected to be 8,600,000 bags and as far as I know we require about 9,000,000 bags to meet our wheat requirements. The farmer has therefore reached the stage, as far as wheat is concerned, where he has succeeded in making the country practically independent of countries abroad. As far as maize is concerned, according to newspaper reports, the maize crop for this year is expected to be more or less 52,000,000 bags. This country normally requires more or less 30,000,000 bags. As far as maize is concerned, therefore, the farmer has succeeded in producing an appreciable surplus over and above our local consumption. As far as cheese, butter and milk are concerned, the farmer has also succeeded in producing more than is required by the local market. However, bearing world conditions in mind, we should not hesitate to produce surpluses. Experts maintain that within the next century or half a century the world will not be able to produce sufficient food to feed the population of the world and when we consider that the population of the world is increasing at the rate of approximately 22,000,000 per annum, we have some idea of what the population of the world will be within the next half-century or century. For that <span class="col_2781-2782" refersTo="page_1406"/>reason we will have to produce as much as we can in order to meet the food requirements of the world.</p>

<p>I have said that we have suffered severe and disastrous losses. I have referred to 1919 and I have pointed out that the losses sustained in that year were valued at R32,000,000. I succeeded in obtaining further statistics and I want to quote from the &#x201C;Official Year Book &#x201D;. I think the House can take it that these figures were arrived at after a thorough analysis of the actual position in the country. During the years 1929 to 1932, years which were not regarded as exceptionally dry years, the cattle loss sustained was 511,050 head and 6,379,281 sheep and goats. The year 1933 is recorded in our history as having been an exceptionally dry year and for that reason I felt that, as far as the losses sustained in 1933 were concerned, I should also submit the figures relating to that year to this House. I am again quoting from the &#x201C;Official Year Book&#x201D; and we find that in 1933 753,002 head of cattle were lost as a result of drought conditions and 11,940,000 sheep and goats. Over a period of six years, from 1929 to 1933, the total loss sustained by farmers in the Union was 1,264,000 head of cattle and 18,319,324 sheep and goats. I have tried to calculate the monetary value of those losses and if I value a sheep at R4 and an ox at R20, which to my mind is very conservative. I find that the farmers lost R130,480,000 during those six years. In other words, if we take the average annual loss which the farmers sustained over that period, we find that it amounts to R21,740,000. I think I am entitled to say, therefore, that the farmers sustained a terrible and disastrous loss. But I go further. I have said that the experience has been that, with every drought, the loss sustained by the farmers becomes heavier and heavier whereas the population of the country is continually growing, and in those circumstances the future of this country seems dark to me as far as its food potential is concerned. I now have to reveal even more shocking figures to the House for the years 1949 to 1955, a period which was also regarded as a very dry one In 1949 the loss in cattle, due to drought and disease, amounted to 420,000 head. I make no apology for linking disease with drought, because it is a well-known fact that when drought conditions prevail in the country disease is more prevalent than usual amongst the stock. I shall try to give the House the losses sustained by farmers during the individual years. I thought it would be just as well if I gave the House the annual losses for the period 1949 to 1955 separately. In 1949 the loss in cattle was 420,000 and in sheep and goats 2,356,000 There are figures which I obtained from the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. In 1950-1 the loss in cattle was 283,000 and in sheep and goats 1,494,000; in 1951-2: cattle, 311,000; sheep and goats, 1,666,000; in 1952-3: cattle, 326,000, sheep and goats. 1,744,000; 1953-4: cattle, 287,000; sheep and goats, 1,625,000; 1954-5: cattle, 404,000; sheep and goats, 1,748,000. In other words a grand total for 1949-55 of 2,005,000 cattle and 8,898,000 sheep and goats. If we take the total for the first six years which I have mentioned and for the second period from 1949 up to 1955, we find that over a period of 12 years the farmers sustained the following losses: Cattle, 3,269,502 and sheep and goats. 27,217,324. Mr. Speaker, those are alarming and shocking figures. I maintain that we in this House and the farmers outside really have no idea of what is actually happening in this country. I have tried to calculate the monetary value of these losses. In respect of the first six years I have valued a sheep at R4 and an ox at R20. In respect of the second period I have valued a sheep and a goat at R6 but I have left the value of an ox at R20&#x2014;again very conservative figures. On this basis the value of the losses sustained by the farmers during that period is R223,988,000, an average of R22,000,000 per annum. Mr. Speaker, surely that should not be allowed to continue, and if it were to continue, we can expect trouble in the future. There is further proof that we cannot allow this position to continue. The Government has appointed a commission of inquiry to inquire into the depopulation of the platteland. That commission brought out its report in 1956. That commission found that, in respect of the sheep-farming areas of the country, 50,000 White persons had left those areas, or 43.6 per cent of the total population of the sheep-farming areas of the country&#x2014;practically half the number of small stock farmers had left the platteland, and there is only one reason for that and that is that they simply could not make a living on the platteland, mainly due to the fact that this country is subject to drought. That, Sir, is the position of this country as far as I was able to ascertain. I am very sorry that I was unable to obtain the figures in respect of the losses sustained in 1955. I am sorry that I cannot tell the House what losses the farmers are sustaining to-day or have sustained since 1957. Whereas the figures which I have just given to the House are shocking, I maintain that the losses which the farmers have suffered from 1957 up to the present are much more shocking. Where that is the position, I contend that I have made out a good case to warrant the Cabinet&#x2019;s serious attention and I have no doubt but that the Government will decide to heed my request that a special commission be appointed, a commission consisting of experts and practical farmers, to go into this matter. I want experts on the commission but I also want practical farmers on it, farmers who will be able to deal with the practical aspect of the matter. A few years ago there was an official in the Department who made himself famous and I want to pay tribute to his memory to-day, Sir. I refer to the late Col. Heinrich du Toit, the father, as it were, of dry-land farming. I once had the privilege of listening to a lecture of his and on that <span class="col_2783-2784" refersTo="page_1407"/>occasion he told his audience that it was always a good thing to have an expert but that you should also have the practical farmer on such a commission of inquiry. He then gave the following example. He said that if you asked the expert what the difference was between a snake and a flea, he would tell you that the snake was a cold-blooded animal whereas the flea was a blood-sucking animal; he would tell you that an additional difference was that the snake crawled on its stomach whereas the flea did not mind on whose stomach it found itself. That is the difference between the expert and the farmer and that is why I am asking that there should not only be experts on that commission&#x2014;they are essential&#x2014;but practical farmers as well who can state the practical side of the question.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I ask in my motion that means should be devised whereby farmers can retain their stock in times of drought. It is not my intention to anticipate the work of such a commission, if it is to be appointed, but I do think it will be just as well for this House to make some suggestions as to what the commission should consider in deciding what should be done to combat and prevent these serious conditions in future. The reply to the first question as to what should be done is obvious. The answer is water and if I were a German I would have said water, more water and again water. That is the main solution. Here again I do not say that the Government is indifferent towards the question of water conservation and irrigation. I went into the position and found that since 1910 a sum of R106,164,894 was spent in this country on irrigation. In other words, over a period of 50 years more than &#x00A3;100,000,000 was spent on irrigation, or an average of more than &#x00A3;2,000,000 per annum. During the period 1948 to 1959 (which is the last year in respect of which figures are available) this Government has spent &#x00A3;73,765,186 on irrigation, drilling and water conservation. In other words this Government has spent more than &#x00A3;6,000,000 per annum. But I ask myself this question: What has been the result&#x003F; In spite of the fact that this amount has been spent on water and irrigation the experience has been during these drought-stricken periods that we have had in this country, that the country could not supply the means to enable the farmer to save his stock. Just prior to the present lucerne cutting or harvesting season a farmer was simply unable to buy one bale of lucerne to save his animals. He could buy maize but he cannot continually feed maize to his animals, Sir; they become sickly and, apart from that, maize is too expensive. What is left to be done&#x003F; We are living in a period of severe droughts. This is a big question and if we wish to tackle a big question, we have to do big things, and in this respect I want to ask the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestion I am about to make, and once again I want to express my gratitude for what the Government has already done. I am convinced that even the hon. member for Queenstown, who is looking at me in a peculiar way, is grateful for that, he too is grateful for what the Government has done to meet the situation. Nevertheless, the figures which I have given prove that that has not been sufficient. We have to do more, we have to do infinitely more. What is the most important thing that we can do&#x003F; We should make use of the water of the Orange River which is running into the sea to-day, we must make use of the surplus water of the Vaal River, if there is any, and we must utilize the water of the other rivers in the Eastern Province. Here again I have to admit that the Government is already doing that; the Government is not sitting back, the Government is busy, with the personnel at its disposal, investigating the position as quickly as possible and conducting tests, with the object of embarking on big schemes. I think it will be done but I even want to suggest that if necessary the help of people from outside should be enlisted to do the necessary surveys, calculations, etc., and, if necessary, also to assist with the construction of those works. If we do that, I am convinced we will be on the right track and that we will in future be able to meet those serious conditions.</p>

<p>However, I am not asking the Government to do everything. The farmer is there, and he is willing to contribute his share. Our main object should be to bring about a change, in view of the fact that it has been proved that we cannot produce sufficient food to meet the drought conditions which we are to-day experiencing. We find that in times of drought the necessary food for the animals is simply not available, and our object should be that every farmer, who is at all able to do so, or who lives in an area where this idea can be put into effect, should establish his own fodder bank, so that he will be in a position to supply his own requirements. How must that be done, Sir&#x003F; It can be done in one way only, and that is that at every place where a dam can possibly be constructed it should be constructed, not only, as I have said, by the Government, but also by the farmers. The question now arises whether the farmer can do so alone. I am afraid I have to reply &#x201C;no&#x201D; to that unless he receives help from the Government. There is an Act to-day which says that if a farmer wishes to construct a dam on his farm for irrigation purposes, he can get a subsidy of a maximum amount of &#x00A3;300 per dam on a unit. I think we are on the wrong track there. We should change that. I make a serious plea to-day, Sir, that the legislation dealing with the subsidization of irrigation dams should immediately be revised, because it is necessary that we change it. We should, as it were, place no limit on the subsidization of dams. What I am pleading for will not create a dangerous principle; not at all, because the dam will not be constructed and the Government will not grant a subsidy unless the Government engineer has surveyed <span class="col_2785-2786" refersTo="page_1408"/>that dam and decided whether or not it would be an economic unit. If it will be an economic unit, and the dam will cost &#x00A3;20,000, the farmer should be given the opportunity of constructing that dam, and he should be given a subsidy on the basis of the cost of construction of that dam. The amount should not be limited to &#x00A3;300. As long as there is that limit, I am convinced that we will be unable in future to meet our own requirements. There are many more under-privileged farmers to-day than wealthy farmers, farmers who, when they wish to undertake any major work, simply cannot do so because they lack the capital. For that reason I ask that the legislation be amended so that any applicant who applies for assistance for the construction of an irrigation dam, and if the engineer approves of it, will get the necessary subsidy from the Government on a one-third basis, as the law stands at the moment, I want to go further and ask that, if possible, the subsidy should be increased. It will have the effect that the farmers will undertake more developmental works for the conservation of water, and more irrigation dams will be constructed. Once we reach the stage where every farmer, who is able to do so, establishes his own fodder bank in order to meet his own requirements when he finds himself in a position such as we have to-day, the country will be on a sound basis in the future and, whatever happens, we shall be able to meet drought conditions, and the farmers will not suffer the shocking losses which I have just enumerated.</p>

<p>The losses which the farmers have sustained during the past 12 years are really disturbing; and those are direct losses, not indirect losses. The losses were so heavy that, calculated in terms of capital that was lost, we would have been able to build a second Kariba Dam in South Africa. And what will that mean to us! We have the land, the fertile land, we have the space which other countries in the world lack; all we need is the opportunity to develop it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to mention one point in respect of which I think such a commission will be useful. The farmers buy food for their animals to-day if they can get it, and what do they do in most cases where they buy lucerne&#x003F; They buy the lucerne in bales, and they drive into the veld and throw the bales of lucerne haphazardly about for the animals to eat. The animals go there and eat, but I maintain that a third of that bale of lucerne goes waste, because there is not a proper system whereby it is ensured that 100 per cent of that lucerne and other feed reaches the stomach of the animal. That is a matter which requires urgent attention. The question is whether means should not be devised whereby food can be given to animals in a concentrated form, in small quantities, but with big results. If we can do that, Sir, I am convinced that we will be doing this country a great service, and that the farmers of this country will be able to face the future with confidence.</p>

<speech by="#stander">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I second the motion, not because I think this commission will wave a magic wand and eliminate droughts in future, but I support it, Sir, because I think they will discover facts of which the Department has hitherto been blissfully unaware. The facts are known. That is why this commission should not purely and simply be a fact-finding commission. I would rather call it a fact-coordinating commission. I hope this commission will regard this problem against the background of the South African economy, that its recommendations will be definite in regard to the important r&#x00F4;le which agriculture and stock-breeding play in the economy of South Africa, and that it will, in particular, show how farming, stock farming and agriculture in these Karoo areas, expecially in the North Western areas, have to fit into the picture. Once we have clarity about this matter, we will be in a better position to plan in regard to the farming industry in the drought-stricken areas. That, Sir, is the big problem. If they do that, other concerns outside the farming industry will be more sympathetic and more willing to co-operate. For instance, the attendance in this Chamber will be better when a matter such as this is under discussion, and we will place the Government in a better position to take active steps.</p>

<p>I do not want to weary the House by giving examples of the suffering and misery that people are undergoing. I could tell you stories, Sir, of homes that have been abandoned, of scorched grazing lands, of starving animals and despondent farmers who are on the brink of insolvency, but I do not want to do so. The Press sees to that, and the figures which the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) has given must have struck home. We can, however, exaggerate the position and ultimately come to the conclusion that the inheritance of the farmer is a kind of <i>hereditas damnosa</i> in this country. We should not allow that idea to gain ground. What I want to do is to ask a few questions more especially in regard to the North-Western areas because those are the areas which suffer most when there is a drought in this country. I want to know whether the game is worth the candle in the South African economy to keep the North-West going and if it is, what should be done to bring about stability and a measure of security for those farmers. I think the first question is justified because public opinion still has to be trained to appreciate the actual position which prevails in the North-West. Is the general idea not that the North-West is an uninhabitable, untamable desert, an area which is only fitting for those people who prefer a nomadic way of life and who fight shy of a settled permanent life elsewhere in the country&#x003F; I think many people have no better knowledge of the North-West than the travellers of the earlier years in the last century had, who described it as &#x201C;A land of sun, sin, sand, sorrow and sore eyes &#x201D;. Most of the people still have that idea about the North-West. If <span class="col_2787-2788" refersTo="page_1409"/>the farmer has a hard time we feel sorry for him; we hand out alms and then we wait for the next drought before we give him another thought. If that were not the case, Mr. Speaker, how do you account for the fact that the Government has not as yet embarked on effective and large-scale planning in regard to farming in the North-West&#x003F; How do you account for the fact that the transport facilities in that area are so ineffective&#x003F; Just look at the map of South Africa. You will look in vain for railway lines and tarred roads to those areas. How do you account for the lack of water conservation and the fact that underground water supplies are not exploited, protected and controlled&#x003F; How do you account for the fact, as the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has shown, that the waters of the Orange River is still being allowed to run to the ocean without being put to any use practically&#x003F; It is true that attention is given to water conservation now and then; dams and boreholes are subsidized to a certain extent; a number of boring machines are in operation but far too few. Road transportation services have been introduced but for the greater part the farmers are dependent on private transport. As a result of the joint efforts of all governments since 1910, it is a fact that approximately 25,000 morgen of land along the Orange River have been placed under irrigation and that was done with the assistance of private enterprise; and note this, Sir, that was not done with the object of placing farming in the North-West on a proper basis, but it was done more in the nature of a rehabilitation scheme to rehabilitate farmers who had already thrown in the towel in their struggle against nature. There has never been anything like a planned developmental scheme for the North-West. This is an area which is backward not because of a lack of potential, and not because of a lack of initiative and ability to work on the part of the inhabitants, but only because of a lack of a systematic developmental scheme.</p>

<p>In regard to the North-West I want to refer to nine districts in the North-West and I am choosing them because they are representative of the North-West and because they will probably fall within the scope of any future planning in respect of the Orange River. They are Britstown, Calvinia, Carnarvon, Gordonia, Hopetown, Kenhardt, Namaqualand, Prieska and Williston. These districts comprise more or less what is described as the sheep-grazing area, those 46,000,000 morgen to which the Du Toit Commission referred. They comprise 22,000,000 morgen of land. There are 4,150 sheep-raising farms, 1,313 irrigation plots, involving a capital investment of &#x00A3;81.5 million. Eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty labourers are directly concerned with the farming activities in those areas. Two point eight million small stock or 20 per cent of the small stock of the Cape Province are to be found there, or 12&#x00BD; per cent of the total small stock population of the Union of 38,000,000. Although this area is not really a cattle breeding area, there are about 200,000 large stock. The latest figures which I could find are in respect of 1946-7 and in that year those nine districts produced 29,000,000 lbs. of wool, which is 20 per cent of the total production of the Cape Province of 158,000,000 lbs. The entire Union produced 233,000,000 lbs. During the year 1954-5 karakul pelts to the value of approximately &#x00A3;800,000 were sold. That area paid between &#x00A3;750,000 and &#x00A3;1,000,000 in income tax last year. I think I have replied to the question whether the game was worth the candle in the North-West, Sir.</p>

<p>Apart from that, human values also come into the picture. We are dealing here with a hardened, independent, orderly and proud community, Sir. I can call as my witnesses the hon. the Ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Lands when I say that even during these critical times the farmers did not make much use of the relief which was offered to them. However there is a limit to the power of endurance of even the toughest farmer. The hon. member for Kimberley (North) has already pointed out that during the past 30 years the sheep-grazing area as a whole lost nearly 50 per cent of its White population, and I can assure you, Sir, that most of them came from the North-West.</p>

<p>I now come to the question whether it is possible to give security and stability to those farmers. We have received assistance from the Government in the form of fodder loans, rebates on the railway tariffs in respect of the transportation of sheep and stock feed; we even received a subsidy in respect of the rent payable for grazing elsewhere. In addition there was the 1950 scheme under which debts were consolidated, a scheme of which the farmers in the North-West and in the Karoo could not make much use because they were in the grip of a drought at that time, as they are to-day. The farmers are grateful and I think I am entitled to convey their thanks to the Minister. The fact remains, however, that most of the assistance offered is in the form of rehabilitation. The patient is critically ill and we are making a contribution towards his hospital expenses. What we want is a medicine that will prevent the disease. [Quorum.]</p>

<p>According to the findings of the Du Toit Commission the depopulation of the platteland is due to economic reasons, and they say, <i>inter alia,</i> that unless the farming population, particularly in these areas, is assured of a sound economic livelihood, this process of the depopulation of the platteland will continue.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with a few aspects of this question which such a commission should be able to investigate fruitfully. The hon. member who introduced the motion has already referred to this, and that is the problem of uneconomic farms and holdings. For example, the Du Toit Commission found that one-quarter of the number of farms in this sheep-grazing area was uneconomic, between 101 and 1,000 morgen. That conclusion of theirs was based on their finding that a farmer should at least <span class="col_2789-2790" refersTo="page_1410"/>have 1,200 sheep to enable him to make a proper living. If I take 1,200 sheep, without comment, as basis, then 4,150 sheep farms in those nine districts, that is 28 per cent of the total number of farms, are uneconomic. It is true that there are farms of 15,000 morgen and over and that has also given rise to this stupid opposition to so-called land barons. Without going further into this matter, Sir, I just want to say, that they are not the people who cause the Government a headache when times are hard and when there is a drought. What is the solution&#x003F; It is not impossible for the Government to determine what will be an economic unit for the various districts. In that case you can prevent those units from being sub-divided, by legislation if necessary, Sir. The Land Bank can also assist in that regard by refusing to grant loans for the purchase of uneconomic holdings, except of course, in the case where a farmer wants to extend his farming operations, and for the rest, the Government can take steps to consolidate uneconomic units. As it is the Minister of Lands, for example, is at present assisting farmers along the Orange River who have uneconomic holdings, to acquire more land. A second matter which should be investigated is the supply of stock feed. As you know, Sir, in the past, up to 1940, the answer to any drought, was always for the farmer to trek with his stock. The farmers in the North-West trekked with their stock to those areas where there was grazing, where grazing was plentiful and cheap, and those were areas to which the stock could easily adapt themselves, with the result that the losses were not exceptionally heavy. To-day, however, the position has changed completely. During the prosperous years those areas to the north of the Orange River have developed very fast. Farms have been fenced, roads have been fenced off, and the days when a farmer could take to the road with his stock and trek to other pastures are gone for ever. The farmer has to depend on feeding his stock. This recent drought has proved that it does not pay a farmer to feed his sheep over a very long period. Recently the Government decided to pay &#x00A3;20 per 100 sheep per month&#x2014;it used to be &#x00A3;14&#x2014;to a farmer in the form of a loan. But that has been proved to be insufficient. A farmer needs at least &#x00A3;25 to &#x00A3;27 10s. per month for 100 sheep. If a farmer spends &#x00A3;25 per month on 100 sheep in the form of feed it comes to exactly &#x00A3;3 per sheep per annum, if he has to feed his stock for 12 months. In that case it is tantamount to the farmer having given away his animal, and from a financial point of view it would have been better for him not to have fed the animal. The problem therefore is to provide cheap feed to the farmer. There is only one way in which that can be done and it is this: The farmer should be placed in a position where he can produce his own feed, or, as my hon. friend has said, establish his own fodder bank.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of water. The farmers in the North-West have spent millions of pounds on drilling for water. They received very little assistance from the Central Government for various reasons. The Government has not got the geologists and it has insufficient boring machines. This is a question which needs urgent attention. A hydrological survey should be made of those areas. There should be sufficient boring machines. We should try to find a cheap way of desalting water and we should make use of the waters of the Orange River. We are again dealing with the Orange River but we must use the waters of that river to supplement other supplies, not only as far as the farmers are concerned, but as far as the towns are concerned as well. Many of the towns in the North-West simply find it &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member must not go too deeply into that question, because there is a motion on the Order Paper dealing with that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stander">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>The motion on the Order Paper, does not really cover the point which I want to raise, Mr. Speaker, namely, that for municipal use there are no further supplies of water in the North-West and development of those communities has practically come to a standstill. I hope that when the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Water Works comes up for discussion, he will have good news for us and the country outside.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of transport. There should be a thorough investigation into the transport facilities in the North-West. When you look at the map, Sir, you find that two railway lines have been constructed. I do not know what the origin is of the line from Hutchinson over Victoria West, Carnarvon and Calvinia in the direction of the west coast&#x2014; I do not know whether it has something to do with the copper mines there. The other short stretch of railway line runs from De Aar over Prieska and Upington, and we all know its history. It was not constructed with a view to developing that area, but for military purposes. Most of the farmers in the North-West are dependent on private road transportation services. Do you know, Sir, that it costs some of those farmers as much as 6s. to bring one bag of maize from the nearest station to their farms.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of credit. Last year, or the year before, the Land Bank Act was amended, which amendment placed the money market at the disposal of the Land Bank. We were all very pleased and thought that our troubles were over as far as longterm credit facilities were concerned. I do not know what the experience of hon. members have been, but mine has been anything but encouraging. It is high time that we make provision not only for long-term credit facilities to the farmer but also for short-term and interim-term credit facilities. This is a question which could fruitfully be investigated by this commission.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it would be unreasonable on <span class="col_2791-2792" refersTo="page_1411"/>my part if I did not refer to the decision which the Land Board took recently, as announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance in the Other Place, namely, that when this prevailing drought is broken, a scheme will be introduced under which the debts will be consolidated of those farmers in the North-West who need it. I want to thank that institution very heartily in advance for that idea.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have mentioned a few of the facets of the problem of the North-West which can be fruitfully investigated by a planning commission. I have indicated why, from an economic angle, I thought the North-West was worth the trouble and let me add this Sir, the North-West is one of the most important, if not the most important &#x201C;lebensraum&#x201D; for the White people to-day. The farmers in the North-West are busy conquering the desert for White South Africa. They have gone a long way along that road at their own expense and own initiative and in their own faith. On their behalf I am to-day asking the Government to take their hand and to help them further along that road of stability. My question is this: Is the Government prepared to do so&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the whole House owes a debt of gratitude to the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) for having introduced this very important motion and for having started a discussion which up to now has been very interesting But before dealing with the hon. member&#x2019;s motion I should like to move an amendment on behalf of this side of the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;advisability of&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;taking immediate steps to assist such farmers to remain on a sound economic basis and thus to enable them to make their contribution to maintaining the country&#x2019;s economy on a high level &#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will realize immediately that by moving the deletion of the proposed words, this side om the House is of the opinion that it is necessary to appoint a commission of inquiry but that the Government should immediately devise means and schemes whereby the people who are to-day suffering severe hardship as a result of the drought, can be assisted. This motion could not have come at a more opportune time.&#x2019; I am tempted to say that it is a year too late, Sir. It should really have come up for discussion in this House last year already. I say that because this drought is the greatest catastrophe, the greatest national tragedy that has ever hit a large section of the country. The hon. member for Kimberley (North) gave the House the most shocking figures and he showed us what the extent of the loss was in South Africa during the past years in the way of money and in the way of small and big stock that was lost as a result of droughts. I reiterate that it is practically impossible to calculate the damage. It is practically impossible to determine the value of the losses which farmers sustain in times of drought. I do not for one moment doubt the figures of the hon. member. Those figures are shocking, all the more shocking because they are true. But there is one factor which the hon. member for Kimberley (North) did not take into account and that is the actual loss in vegetation, in veld, in land and the actual loss the farmer has sustained as a result of the deterioration in the condition of his animal, be it sheep or ox.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I said I was only giving the figures relating to direct losses.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased the hon. member has said that. That is why I say that it is practically impossible to calculate the loss because in actual fact it is millions and millions of rand more than the hon. member has said. As I have said, land, vegetation and animals that have been ruined as a result of drought do not recover over night once it has rained. It takes months, perhaps years, before the soil and the animals reach a stage where they are capable of proper production. Let me say immediately, Sir, that in a time such as the present, our thoughts turn in sympathy to those people who are fighting such a hard battle against the elements. We know that for years they have been scanning the sky, looking at the clouds that appear on the horizon, cloud that appear and disappear without shedding one drop of water, that drop of water which will again inspire the people with new hope and life. We all know that these people are tired of looking and tired of waiting. All of them find it difficult to look at the animals who lose condition daily. Hundreds and thousands have already died. We know that many of these farmers no longer hear the bleating of lambs or the lowing of calves which have just been born. That is a sound that is no longer intended for their ears. For many years they have not had a lamb crop and some of them have not had a calf crop for years. Mr. Speaker, one asks oneself this question: Who are these people who are stricken by this drought&#x003F; Are they made of the dust which rises from the whirling and cutting west wind&#x003F; No, they are made of flesh and blood, but they are people whom one can more or less compare with the hard brown iron-stone of the North-West and of the Karoo, those stones which they know so well. Although this drought is the greatest catastrophe that has hit South Africa, I think the farming community should be complimented on the fact that they have managed to keep going, and that they have remained hopeful under all the circumstances. One asks oneself this question. Sir: When one watches the lucerne stacks disappearing, the veld becoming scorched, the sheep and cattle herds diminishing, fresh loads of expensive lucerne and maize <span class="col_2793-2794" refersTo="page_1412"/>that have been bought being off-loaded on the farms&#x2014;tons and hundreds of bags&#x2014;who would not have abandoned all hope&#x003F; Who would not have abandoned all hope when he sees how the convenient nest egg that he has built up in the bank or post office or building society, gets smaller and smaller and eventually changes into a growing overdraft&#x003F; In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, he sees how his accounts with the local shopkeepers, the local co-operative societies, grow bigger and bigger and how the interest on his bond accumulates. It is not possible for that man even to think of paying. With what must he pay&#x003F; Only one thing is left for him and that is hope, courage and faith&#x2014;that unshakeable faith and courage that tomorrow will bring relief. When you see all that, Sir, you ask yourself this question: Is it necessary that man and beast should be tortured like this&#x003F; Should we merely accept it and say it is a law of nature&#x003F; It is the will of God and we have to abide by it. In every sphere man is busy protecting himself through the medium of science against diesease and attacks. He has various means of protecting himself&#x2014;he is protecting his own health and that of his animals and crops. Pests and disease are being eradicated root and branch. But a drought! No, that we accept periodically; that is a law of nature!</p>

<p>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, nobody can really calculate the losses which have been sustained through this drought in pounds, shillings and pence because the effect of it will still be felt for a long time to come. It will still run into additional millions of pounds. One asks oneself the question whether steps should not have been taken more timeously. Have these schemes been established timeously&#x003F; Will a commission of inquiry be of any assistance&#x003F; As the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) has said, the facts are there. In an interview during the drought the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services himself said that his Department was fully acquainted with the position&#x2014;they knew everything. To ask now that a commission of inquiry be appointed will, I think, be a further waste of time, because the facts are known already. We know how long it takes in South Africa for a commission of inquiry to submit its report. By the time this commission brings out its report, South Africa may find itself in the strangling grip of the next drought. Hon. Ministers have the experts in their Departments and I do not think it will be very difficult to obtain the co-operation of agricultural institutions to devise ways and means immediately and to introduce schemes to meet the situation. That can be done without a commission of inquiry. I ask again: What has been the use of these existing schemes when some farmers have for two years and more been compelled to use their own funds and facilities they themselves had established&#x003F; It is alleged that only 6 per cent of these farmers have availed themselves of the schemes which the Governmet has established to assist them. There is, of course, the question of the self-respect and the pride of some of the farmers which has prevented them from seeking assistance under those schemes. But that does not mean to say that those people did not incur very heavy expenditure. They have spent thousands and thousands of pounds without having received any assistance from the Government.</p>

<p>We should regard a drought as a national catastrophe. One does not require a great deal of brain to realize that a national emergency situation exists after a year or two of drought. No one will say that the Government has done nothing; that it has sat with its arms folded. This side of the House is certainly not so unreasonable as to allege that. We know that the Government made military lorries available to transport stock and to cart water; they made trains and trucks available. But, Mr. Speaker, one thing that we should bear in mind is this: that the people who availed themselves of those facilities had to pay for them, or they still have to pay for them. Those services were not rendered free of charge. If those services were not rendered free of charge, and those schemes were established, was that assistance sufficient, as the hon. member for Prieska himself was asked&#x003F; The hon. member also said that &#x00A3;20 per month per 100 sheep was not sufficient. It used to be only &#x00A3;14. When it comes to the question of rent for grazing, is &#x00A3;5 per month sufficient&#x003F; The hon. member himself said that the farmer needed at least &#x00A3;27 10s. per month to keep 100 head of small stock alive. No, Mr. Speaker, when anything like the present drought prevails, and when it is as widespread as the present drought, we should realize that it is a national catastrophe, and the Goverment of the country should leave no stone unturned to give adequate assistance to these people. The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services is not here at the moment, so I am asking the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing whether it was necessary to have a conference at Williston to make those people realize the seriousness of the position in the Karoo and in the North-West&#x003F; Was a Williston conference necessary to make them realize that &#x00A3;14 per month per 100 sheep was insufficient&#x003F; It was only after that conference that the hon. the Minister decided to raise it to &#x00A3;20 per month. This is not the first occasion on which a Nationalist Party Government has experienced a period of drought of this magnitude. Ministerial sympathy and reports about the scope of the drought are not enough. Did either of the hon. Ministers, the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing or the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services visit those areas during this serious drought to ascertain what the position was there&#x003F; No, they said their Departments were fully acquainted with the position.</p>

<p>The sympathy which these people got from the hon. the Ministers of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and of Agricultural Technical Services they could have got equally well by listening to the weather reports over the radio. Although it does not often happen that South Africa experiences such a wide-spread drought, there are always areas in this country which experience difficulty in this regard. Ways and means or schemes should always be available, whereby these people can be assisted when the need arises. They are not to blame for it. They are not responsible for it. When areas have not had sufficient rain for years on end, the best veld, the best grazing, the best water supply cannot save the farmers. Although a farmer may never have overstocked his farm, although he has the best camps, although he has the best water supply for his stock, if it does not rain regularly, it is inevitable that he will eventually find himself in difficulty. Some of these farmers have already spent double the cash value of their stock. It is completely uneconomic, and I say that, because there was no scheme in existence worth while mentioning and too many farmers had to feed their animals to keep them alive. There was no planning as to how to get rid of the surplus stock. They have already spent thousands of pounds on stock in respect of which the market value may be a third or a quarter of their original value. When it comes to discussing drought conditions, the main principle to observe is, of course, as the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has said, the establishment of fodder banks in years of plenty. Some of the agricultural training colleges already have this information. They know what will be the better way of feeding lucerne as a feed, whether it should be given in the form of a pill or in powdered form. We should get that information. A commission of inquiry is not necessary; all we want is the right information.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot ask the hon. member for Kimberley (North) to help me, because he will help me from the frying-pan into the fire. Another important aspect that we should not lose sight of is that subsidies should be made available to the farmers to enable them to maintain their standard of living in times of drought. Another important aspect that we should remember is that when people have spent hundreds of rand on stockfeed they cannot expect any income from those emaciated animals. This drought has proved that it is not only the man with very little capital who gets into difficulties. To-day the man with capital also gets into difficulties. They are the ones in particular who feel the crippling effects of this drought. We know that the town dweller will approve of any assistance which we give to these drought-stricken areas; the shopkeeper, the motor trader, etc., will approve of it. They are the people who have to provide the farmers with credit. They, too, have large overdrafts in the banks and accounts which have accumulated over months which must be paid. Once the drought is over their creditors, too, will make demands for payment. If, therefore, a better scheme of assistance can be introduced than the present one, I am convinced that these people, too, will stand by the farmers and help them; because they know that, if the farmers are not assisted, they will go under with them. What we want to know is when the Government will announce such a scheme, when will they inform us of these rehabilitation schemes of theirs; have they already devised them, or are they still undecided&#x003F; Do they not realize of what value a few encouraging words will be <span class="col_2797-2798" refersTo="page_1414"/>to these people&#x003F; They should say to these people: &#x201C;We shall look after you; you will not go under; you are not to blame.&#x201D; We also know that over and above the difficulties and the stubbornness and endless efforts of these farmers, they still harbour this fear in their sub-conscious mind: &#x201C;How am I going to keep my head above water once this drought is over&#x003F; If the bank manager sends for me and asks when I am going to pay, and if the cooperative society asks me to pay for the fodder, whom shall I ask for assistance&#x003F; The Land Bank or the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board&#x003F; I have not lived lavishly and wasted my money.&#x201D; Those are the questions which the farmer asks himself to-day, Sir, and if the Minister or the Government does not believe me, then they do not know what is happening in those areas. Their only worry is not how to keep their stock alive, but they also worry about what is going to happen once the drought is over.</p>

<p>The financial worry of how they are going to re-establish themselves after the drought is leaving its mark on these people, and, while all this is happening, the attitude on that side of the House remains one of devising plans for the next drought, whereas they have no plan at the moment of how to assist the farmers who are suffering to-day; they want to wait and see. That is their attitude. I say it is late already, but the Government should take action immediately. They have all the necessary knowledge at their disposal. Set the farmers&#x2019; minds at rest. Tell them what you are going to do. Do not merely say that you will rehabilitate them, but inform them of your plans. How will they manage to keep their farms and pay their accumulated debts&#x003F; Tell them what you intend doing to avoid a repetition of this state of emergency, or at least to soften the blow if it were to come again. Sir, we should realize that the ingenuity of these individual farmers has been strained to the utmost. Alone and individually they cannot act. Only proper assistance from the Government can save them from total ruination.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>I second. I should like to second this amendment of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), but in doing so I do not want to imply that I condemn the original motion by the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker). I want to make that quite clear. I think the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has rendered the country a service by moving this motion in the highest council of the land so that this problem of droughts, its physical consequences, its financial consequences, and I feel inclined to say its moral consequences, can be brought pertinently in the first place to the notice of the Government and, in the second place, to the notice of all responsible people in our country, and to the notice of the people as a whole, by his description of the physical aspects of droughts and the consequences of such droughts, and by his estimate of what droughts cost the farmers when their stock losses are expressed in terms of money. I think the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has succeeded in giving the House a picture of the disastrous losses which have been suffered as a result of droughts over the past 50 years. The Opposition have moved this amendment not in order to belittle this aspect which the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has put before us, but it has moved this amendment in the first place in order to widen the scope of discussion. As the hon. member has worded his motion, it only relates to the stock farmers. As the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) has worded his amendment, this discussion can now cover droughts as they affect all farmers in the country, and not stock farmers alone. I do not want to belittle in any way the losses which stock farmers have suffered as a result of drought. I think they are enormous, but I want to make it quite clear in this House that the stock farmers of this country are not the only farmers who have suffered heavy losses over the past 50 years as a result of droughts. The losses caused by droughts have affected the stock farmers, the grain farmers, the fruit farmers, the citrus farmers, the wine farmers and practically all farmers. It is a general phenomenon that droughts affect all branches of our agricultural industry from time to time. The point is simply that, when there is a drought in the stock areas of our country, it is much more noticeable because one is then dealing with live stock which suffer from day to day and which die and because the stock farmers of our country, in the northwest and the areas which are now affected, are in effect concentrating almost exclusively on one type of farming. They are dependent on stock farming alone, and that is why they are more severely affected by droughts than farmers elsewhere in the country who practise a more diversified type of farming. I have said that this amendment has been moved with a view particularly to broadening discussion. While the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) and the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander)&#x2014;I valued his speech particularly; he has brought certain aspects of farming in the north-west to my notice of which I was formerly unaware&#x2014;have paid particular attention to the immediate problem and what concrete steps should be taken to overcome it, and have indicated the important role which water plays in a country like South Africa with its low rainfall and also the role which water conservation should play, and the role which the Government should play in an attempt to conserve as much of our rain water as possible before it runs into the sea so that fodder <span class="col_2799-2800" refersTo="page_1415"/>banks can be built up and the farmers, particularly in the north-west, can be enabled to have their own fodder banks so that the immediate problem can be combated, I want to approach the problem from a somewhat different angle. I am doing so particularly, because I consider that the three hon. members who have participated in the debate hitherto have made out a very good case as far as the immediate problem and its physical combating are concerned. But, in approaching this problem, I want to do so from a somewhat different angle.</p>

<p>I do not want to say much about the fact that in its amendment this side of the House does not advocate the appointment of a commission. In my speech I would prefer to emphasize the problems which affect all farmers in our country as far as droughts are concerned. But what has persuaded me to second this amendment is, in the first place, the fact that it will broaden discussion and in the second place the fact that I do not think that at this stage an inquiry is so essential because the problem is well known. There is one thing in South Africa which I do not think that anyone has yet accepted. We in South Africa still regard drought conditions as an abnormal phenomenon. But that is not the position. Drought is a normal phenomenon in our agricultural industry and not an abnormal one, and the time has come for us to accept that. I think the hon. member for Kimberley (North) also put the matter in this way and I want to emphasize that aspect. For that reason, in our approach to the problem of droughts all of us, including the State, have always been inclined to regard drought as an abnormal phenomenon which we should only combat by taking abnormal measures, such as special loans, etc. I think the time has come for us to accept that with our uncertain climate and our varying rainfall, which varies from three and a half inches per annum in the Kalahari to more than 100 inches in the eastern areas, droughts are a normal phenomenon and must be accepted as such. Then our whole approach to the solution of this problem will change. It is for this reason that I want to submit one or two thoughts to the Minister for his consideration.</p>

<p>Under any economic system, under the system of private enterprise, where the economy is based on the principle that every individual must fend for himself, there is always the risk element. But what we must realize is that as a result of climatic conditions in South Africa, the set-up of the agricultural industry, and the unusual differences in climate, which we experience, the risk factor plays an infinitely greater role in the agricultural industry than in any other branch of our economy. It is on this aspect that I should like to say a few words.</p>

<p>It is a normal phenomenon in any other branch of our economy that when a person invests a sum of money in order to earn a livelihood in a particular industry and he is a capable man who knows what he is doing, he will have made a certain profit by the end of the year. I am not talking about a man who neglects his business, but under normal conditions if money is invested wisely in an industry, in mining or in commerce, the person concerned can normally expect to make a certain net profit by the end of the year. Practically the only risk he runs is that the product which he is producing or selling may be subject to fluctuations in supply and demand and that this may affect the price. But in agriculture there are ancillary phenomena as far as the risk element is concerned. In the agricultural industry, as far as grain or stock farming are concerned, I do not think there is one farmer in South Africa who can tell one at the beginning of the year that he will show a net profit at the end of the year. That is the key to the whole problem in agriculture, namely this risk factor. It is for this reason that I should like to point out to the Minister that the State in its approach to the problems of our agricultural industry should pay greater attention to the risk factor. Hon. members will now ask me what steps we should take to alleviate the impact of this risk factor. The risk factor is in the first place attributable to the fact that South Africa is a country where a drought occurs annually in one or other area, a drought which completely upsets the farmers&#x2019; calculations. If the drought continues for some time, instead of the farmer being a creditworthy person, it may within a couple of years turn him into a man with heavy debts. From time to time I have said that as far as the distribution of agricultural products is concerned, we have changed over from a free economy to a planned economy under the Marketing Act because we have realized from bitter experience, including the 1933 drought, the depression and the tremendous losses which were suffered at that time, that a free economy in which one has to depend on the law of supply and demand to determine the price of one&#x2019;s products, is the road to destruction for the farmer. That is why the South African farmer who is one of the most individualistic people in the world, has disciplined himself to such an extent that he has been prepared to subject himself to discipline and to a planned economy under the Marketing Act as regards the distribution and sale of his products. When that is the position, then the price of the product is the most important factor as far as the producer is concerned. I do not want to cast any reflections on anyone as far as the method of determining the prices of agricultural products is concerned. I think the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing is doing its best, and the Marketing Council is doing its best as well. I think that the various control boards are doing their best. I have had a great deal to do with this matter and I am not one of those who are always criticizing the Department and the control boards as regards their price policy and I am not one who says that they do not have any sympathy for the farmers. I know <span class="col_2801-2802" refersTo="page_1416"/>what the problems of these people are. I also know that the control boards do not only represent the producers but that the interests of all parties are represented on those boards and all those interests must be catered for. But ever since I have had anything to do with control boards and the implementation of the Marketing Act, I have consistently adopted the attitude that too little attention is paid to the risk factor when the control boards determine the prices of products under the Marketing Act, and that is the crux of the problem. We have listened to the appalling figures which the hon. member for Kimberley (North) mentioned this morning relating to the losses in terms of money which are suffered during droughts. We in South Africa have not yet accepted that if this is an important sector of our economy&#x2014; I think that it is more or less the most essential sector&#x2014;the risk factor must be taken into account. I hope that we shall not make the mistake which certain old countries of the world have made and neglect the agricultural industry completely and only concentrate on industrialization with the result that eventually they were no longer self-supporting. I do not think that is this Government&#x2019;s intention, but I only want to mention it. I say that it is the position that we are faced with this great risk factor in the agricultural industry, and that practically every year there are droughts&#x2014;for example in 1957, 1958 and 1959 there were such severe droughts in certain areas of the mealie triangle that the mealie farmers and the wheat farmers had crop failures for three successive years. If this is measured in terms of money, the position is disturbing. The point I should like to make is this. Seeing that we now know that these droughts which cause tremendous losses are a normal phenomenon in our agricultural industry&#x2014;I am not even referring to the losses in capital and future capital in the form of stock increases which could have taken place if the stock had not died&#x2014;then it must be part of our price policy to take this risk factor into full account when determining prices under a controlled economy. If one does not do so, one is playing with fire. Then one is not taking the realities of the position of the agricultural industry into account. I therefore say that the risk element must play a far greater role than it does to-day in the price policy which is followed in this country, in the determination of agricultural prices, and I shall say why I believe that. Unless one simply says that it does not matter whether farmers are ruined, and if one wants to keep them on the land, we must let the risk element play a greater role so that the farmer can build up reserves over and above his entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage to tide him over these bad times. In our planning we must bear in mind that we must make provision for that aspect and there is only one way to do so effectively, apart from the physical steps such as water conservation and the establishment of fodder banks, that is to say, we must pay the farmer an additional amount so that he can build up reserves to help him over these times when he has no income as a result of droughts. I do not want to blame this Government; I think every Government since the establishment of the Marketing Council has been to blame for paying too little attention to the risk element and for not taking it sufficiently into account in the determination of our price policy under a planned economy as far as our distribution is concerned.</p>

<p>I really must congratulate the hon. member for Kimberley (District) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) on the excellent speech he has made. I also welcome the commendable spirit in which the hon. member for Florida (Mr. H. G. Swart) has spoken.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>He has made a few cheap remarks which any of us could just as easily have made. If I want to tear the United Party&#x2019;s policy to pieces, I could easily do so, but this is a matter which affects all of us so intimately that we should not regard it from a political point of view; we must regard it from a national point of view. This is a matter which affects the economy of all South Africa. We as farmers realize that we in South Africa form an economic entity; when one section of that entity is suffering, other sections of our economy will later suffer as well, and that is why we have always welcomed the wonderful development of our industries. We as farmers have not always complained that we are being paid too little for our products, although we know that at the time promises were made to us that if we could lay a foundation of low food prices, we would be compensated in the future. We do not want to harp on that unduly to-day. I feel the hon. member for Florida has raised one very sound point, namely, that when the price basis was laid down under the Marketing Act, the risk element was to all intents and purposes completely overlooked; the prices are altogether too low. The result has been that the farmers, particularly in the grain areas, have not been able to place their farming activities on a sound economic basis or, as the hon. member himself has said, to earn so much in the good years that they are able to face the bad years. I feel that this is definitely one of the points which we shall have to take into account when determining prices in future.</p>

<p>I now want to tell my friends in the cities this: We congratulate you on your prosperity; we congratulate you on your great industrial development; we welcome it because it creates a market for the farmers&#x2019; products, but at the same time we want to tell the urban dwellers that they must ask themselves how they gained these great benefits. They are in their present <span class="col_2803-2804" refersTo="page_1417"/>favourable position in the first place because food prices have been kept at a low level. The same applies to the gold mines. In general we congratulate them; we cannot do without them, but our farmers to-day are in a critical position, and seeing that for 20 years we have helped the urban dwellers by providing cheap food, I am convinced that the urban dwellers will agree with us that they should help us to place the agricultural industry on a sound footing. As far as I can see the main requirement to-day is water conservation. As my hon. friend here has said, the need is &#x201C;water, more water and yet more water &#x201D;. Without water no one can exist. No animal, no person, can exist without water, and that is why the provision of water should be priority number one. Let us examine the position in other countries and see what they are doing about their water. We are a dry country and to-day we are allowing a river which is 1,200 miles long, from Mont-aux-Sources to the sea, to become a drainage channel, whereas previously it was a sponge which fed our subterranean water resources. I agree with the Americans when they say &#x201C;water brings water &#x201D;. That is why America 10-15 years ago was spending even more on water conservation than on her war effort. When a country has sponges from which water can evaporate, there is no doubt that it must have an effect on the rainfall as a whole. Mr. Speaker, water is absolutely essential to us &#x2014;to the urban dwellers, the farmers, the animals&#x2014;and I therefore feel that large sums of money should be set aside for the conservation of our water in South Africa so that it will not flow into the sea. We are very thankful that the State has invested &#x00A3;200,000,000 or &#x00A3;300,000,000 in our Railways because we cannot manage without transport. The money which has been invested in Iscor and our industries has also been well spent and we welcome it. Mr. Speaker, I say here that the solution for the problem facing the farmer is not to be found in loans and subsidies, because whenever one gives the farmer a loan, one is increasing his obligations still further. There is no doubt that the farmer cannot continue as he is to-day. The cost of living index figure stands at more than 200 to-day while the index figure in the case of farming products is only approximately 140. The farmer cannot go on like this; he must go under. The man who is financially strong can go on for a little longer but even he cannot continue like this indefinitely.</p>

<p>I now turn to the disastrous droughts to which the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has referred. Seeing that the whole country and all parties are prepared to tackle the water problem to-day, I think the time has come for the Government to give its serious attention to this matter. As a matter of fact, I know that the Government will do so. I shall never forget what our former Prime Minister, the late Adv. Strijdom, said at Colesburg when he said that as soon as the present schemes had been properly planned we would have to tackle the Orange River scheme. The existing schemes do not provide sufficient water and although we have tackled erosion effectively, the water schemes as a whole have become white elephants, mud dams. There is only one way to remedy this position, namely, by the proper utilization of the waters of the Orange River. While that water flows to the sea today, we must build sufficient dams to ensure that the water is conserved so that the humidity level in the interior of our country will be raised so that the water can be utilized. We must not think for one moment that the Government does not appreciate the seriousness of the position, and that is why the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs stated in this House last year that they were going to set aside &#x00A3;100,000 for an investigation. This investigation is being carried out to-day. We just feel that this investigation should be completed and the necessary dams, etc., started as soon as possible. I am convinced that the Government appreciates the necessity for these steps. Once our water is being conserved, three-quarters of the farmers&#x2019; difficulties will have been solved. The water cannot only be provided to people on the banks of the river; it can be distributed throughout the Karoo because there is no doubt that if the waters of the Orange River are not properly utilized the whole of the Karoo will become a desert. From 1934 to 1938 when the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board was established, we were faced with the same difficulty. Although there was still grazing, the subterranean waters had become exhausted. The Government then took action and moved the poorest of those people to the Olifants River and other rivers and built schools for their children. Some of those children to-day are amongst our most brilliant citizens. We must not think that the brains of South Africa do not come from the platteland. When we look at all our great people, we cannot but come to the conclusion that our best brains come from the platteland because the plattelander has a wider outlook. [Laughter.] My hon. friend is laughing, but I can tell him that it is true. I feel that if we do not divert the Orange River back to the old Karoo, the Karoo is going to become a desert. I can still remember that at that time our water table stood at 50-60 feet. Within 30 years that water table had sunk to 300 feet and there are areas to-day where even at 300 feet we do not find water. Mr. Speaker, when we speak of the waters of the Orange River there are people who say: Yes, that is all very well, but how are you going to get that water to the interior&#x003F; There are many ways in which it can be done. When one goes to Australia one finds that they are pumping water from the Murray River 320 miles over the mountains into the desert. At Perth there is a scheme whereby they pump water 170 miles. The pumping of water is no problem to-day. When one cannot take water to a certain area by normal methods, one can pump it to a higher level and then <span class="col_2805-2806" refersTo="page_1418"/>lead it from there. I hope the Government will spend some hundreds of millions of pounds on water conservation. It will repay them over and over again. We know that today there is not sufficient water in the Vaal River to continue to irrigate Vaalhartz and those areas for much longer. By damming the waters of the Orange River, we can provide water to Bloemfontein and all the dams in the Free State which are dry to-day; we can provide water to Vaalhartz and even to Vryburg if one pumps it. There is no more fertile area than the Vryburg district if only we can get water there. Water is the life blood of any country. I prophesy to-day that next year a large sum will be made available for the utilization of the waters of the Orange River. Just give the farmer water and he will ask for nothing more. I am now referring particularly to the stock farmer. It is these droughts which are ruining him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say much more. I just want to say this in conclusion. If we do not want South Africa to become a desert, the Orange River, and not only the Orange River but all the rivers of this country, must be dammed to increase the humidity in the interior and to eliminate these disastrous losses the farmers in the interior are suffering. These losses which the farmers are suffering would have paid for a Kariba scheme. The people who think that we cannot build a Kariba scheme in South Africa to-day are wrong. I repeat that the first matter to which the Government should give its attention is water. Water is worth more to the country than the gold mines; it is worth just as much to us as our industries, and I tell the Government: Make a start on the proper utilization of our water resources so that we can save our children and so that South Africa does not become a desert in future.</p>

<speech by="#dodds">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DODDS</person>:</from>

<p>The previous speaker, who was speaking just before business was suspended, dealt with a few matters. I am sorry he is not here because it is not often that I find myself agreeing with him. He made an appeal to the townspeople to give assistance so that the agricultural economy can be put on a sound basis. Well, Sir, I think you and I realize that if the agricultural economy is on a sound basis, that is already a very great contribution to the economy of this country. I would say that without the agricultural economy being on a sound basis your country would be very poor indeed. The hon. member also dealt with another matter, which we are all very concerned about, and that is the question of utilizing all the waters that we have to spare, and I would like him to know that in that respect I felt with him. The hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) and the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) and also members on this side of the House made what I thought was a very big contribution. I think that the hon. member for Kimberley (North) should be complimented on having gone to so much trouble and having established that over a period of some five years the capital loss to the country as the result of drought was in the vicinity of R223,000,000. Sir, we have to remember that in making this statement the hon. member was only referring to capital loss. If we bear in mind the loss of increase in stock, be it cattle, be it sheep, the loss of output from the point of view of wool, which is also an immediate result, the loss of mohair and the loss of all the products that flow from the farmer&#x2019;s venture, I think it could well be said that the sum lost during the period to which he referred must have been double that amount. Sir, to my mind these hon. gentlemen presented a great challenge to the hon. the Minister to-day, a challenge probably on one of the biggest problems that any Minister has been given opportunity to tackle with the full support of all parties. I feel that the Minister should virtually declare war on drought. I do not know whether he understands what I mean by that but he must put up a real fight, because he has only had a small indication here to-day as to the losses that this country is suffering due to the inroads made on farming as a whole as a result of droughts. It has been said that droughts are God-made. Well, all difficulties that we have to face may be described as God-made. I do not think this is an insurmountable problem. Sir, I have just glanced at certain figures here and I find that whereas our farmers in 1940-1 got an average of 10.1d. for their wool, the present average price, I believe, is 37d. I want to say that the farmers in 1940-1 were possibly a little better off with their 10.1d. than they are to-day at a price of 37d. Very few people apart from the farmer realize how vulnerable the farmer&#x2019;s position is. It is only when the farmer sits down in his quiet moment to study his accounts, which he probably does when he wants to make up his income tax return, that he realizes how vulnerable his position is, and in saying that I am not only talking about the man with whom we are really concerned at this moment, namely the producer, who has had to face severe losses due to drought conditions. I make this statement as an over-all one. We know that a fairly substantial percentage of our farmers could probably go on farming merrily at 37d. per lb. for their wool or even less, because the circumstances under which they acquired their land were vastly different from the circumstances which prevail today in these drought-stricken areas, where the farmers are suffering these severe hardships. Sir, one only has to look at a few items to realize how conditions have changed. In 1941 the farmer could buy his woolpack for 2s. 6d. and to-day he has to pay 15s. 6d., I think, for the same article. That is only one item, there are many others where the position <span class="col_2807-2808" refersTo="page_1419"/>is very much the same and that is why I say that the farmer to-day is probably no better off than he was in 1940-1. Sir, there are disturbing factors in this whole development. As I have said I think the Minister should declare war against drought. To take the wool industry as an example again, we find that since 1949 there has been a very gradual but a very definite increase in the wool output. If we can increase our wool clip by very nearly 200,000 bales, one has to be realistic and say to ourselves: Haven&#x2019;t we got to the stage where due to low prices the farmer has been forced to carry the maximum and more than the maximum amount of livestock on his farm. I think we have often heard and I myself have said it&#x2014;and I can say it more readily to-day be cause I am not dependent on farmers sending their wool to me, and they would probably have taken offence at it if I had said it before &#x2014;that circumstances have forced the producer to over-load his farm where his normal income has not been sufficient to meet his expenses, he has&#x2014;I won&#x2019;t say&#x2014;taken the least line of resistance, because he knows what he is doing, but he is forced to over-load his farm, and when drought conditions come those farms already sick, have been eaten down.</p>

<p>In saying this I want to make the point that it seems to me that we have to establish the maximum number of sheep or cattle, or whatever else you run, that our country can carry. There must be control in this direction, otherwise the see-sawing of the droughts which frequently come&#x2014;and they appear to be coming more rapidly&#x2014;will bring even greater disaster. When one bears in mind the contributions that have been made in cash and in kind by the railway services, by way of advances to the producer, one is inclined to feel that this vast amount of money, if spent judiciously, years ahead and on prevention, would be far better for us than this type of cure which we try to effect. And the farmer will, if he is able to do so, himself pay this money back. He is handicapped because no sooner is he out of one period of drought and perhaps placed in a position to pay back what he owes than he literally finds himself in another drought.</p>

<p>This, after all, is a matter for the hon. the Minister. It is his responsibility and he must see how this vast problem can be tackled so that the effect of these droughts can at least be checked. I now want to take the matter a little further, with particular reference to wool. The hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) quite rightly indicated that the North-Western Districts were the most prolific wool producers. If I understood him correctly, I think he said he thought that that particular area, which is so subject to droughts from time to time has, in the past, produced very nearly 20 per cent of our wool clip. I think he is right. As a matter of fact, I thought it had been a little more at times, when you count some of the lower areas in. But let us look at the position and establish the great loss to the producer who, under drought conditions, sets out to produce a wool clip. The wool is dirty and wasty and inferior, and very often from that area your wool&#x2019;s value can depreciate anything from 10d. to 20d. I am talking in terms of pence since we are still dealing in pence in wool. That is the first fact. Examine the position further and see how many millions of pounds are involved which are directly lost to your producer and to the country because, if that wool was shipped, look at the amount of foreign exchange it would earn. And so one can go on continuously reciting the various instances of losses which we suffer due to the fact that drought has been able to get on top of us and we have not got on top of the problem.</p>

<p>I have always felt, and I still feel that the farmers have always been the backbone of our country, but we must admit now as we see it, particularly when we take the drought problem into consideration, that this backbone is getting somewhat bent.</p>

<p>Dealing again with the producer, let us look at the position as it actually is. I know that farmers appreciate it, and I am sure that our townspeople and hon. members also appreciate it: Look at the position of the farmer in these drought-stricken areas: not only does he lose very largely on his wool clip because it has become inferior, but he has no increase. He has no meat to sell. Whatever cash he has been able to conserve, over a period such as we have had now, has dwindled away. He tries his best to maintain his position because, inherently, he is an honest man. I can speak about that because I happen to know. But in times like the present this man is tied up. He eventually gets to the stage where he has a rope round his neck. All his credit with the banks, and with his brokers is gone, and presently his credit with the Government side, in terms whatever facilities they give him must go to. The outlook for that man is dreadful. And the man with no wool at all is probably in a worse position. He farms mutton but he has no sale. As I said earlier, I think this position is a challenge to the Government and. particularly, it is a challenge to this hon. Minister who is himself a farmer. I think the hon. the Minister should accept this challenge and declare war on drought.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The fact that this motion is before the House to-day is an indication of the serious proportions which the drought has assumed in recent times. This is moreover not the first occasion that we have discussed such a motion. In the past this House has discussed similar motions on various occasions under more or less the same circumstances. But as I have said, this is an indication that we are now dealing with one of the worst droughts which we have experienced in South Africa for a long time. South Africa is well known for her droughts and the farmer of South Africa knows that at some time or another he may experience a drought. <span class="col_2809-2810" refersTo="page_1420"/>In other words, a drought is a normal phenomenon in the life of the farmer of South Africa. Everyone accepts that. But there come circumstances and times when such droughts take on abnormal proportions, as is the case with the drought which has prevailed for the past year or more and which still prevails to-day. I am sure that everyone in this House and outside, particularly those people who are connected with the agricultural industry and who are familiar with the hardships which are sometimes involved in farming, has the greatest possible sympathy with the people affected. It is important that we in this House should also discuss the position of these people. I also want to thank hon. members who have participated in the debate for the contributions they have made in outlining this problem and submitting certain solutions. However, I want to add that I consider it a great pity that certain people sometimes exploit such conditions for political purposes, and in saying that, I am referring particularly to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher). He has told the House and the country to-day that this Government, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture, is so unsympathetic towards the people who are suffering from the ravages of droughts that the Ministers concerned did not go from place to place in order to investigate conditions personally. They simply sat and waited until deputations came to them and the conditions were brought to their notice. Mr. Speaker, apart from the fact that that is not true, I want to ask the hon. member: Is it the function of a Minister to travel around the country and examine drought conditions&#x003F;</p>

<p>That is surely quite a different matter. A drought is not like a flood which descends upon an area; it comes about gradually. Conditions gradually become worse and worse, and as such a drought has gradually developed, so the Department and the Government have always acted step by step. One cannot take abnormal measures to deal with a normal drought. Hon. members surely do not expect that of any Government. Measures which have to be taken to meet abnormal conditions, can surely not be put into operation to deal with normal drought conditions. I am sorry that the hon. member felt that this was the opportune time to exploit the position of these people in order to gain himself a little party political capital.</p>

<p>I do not think that the farmers who are living in these drought-stricken areas and who have nothing but the greatest appreciation for what the Government has already done for them, will thank the hon. member.</p>

<p>When we discuss droughts in South Africa there are three phases to be borne in mind. Droughts are inherent to our whole system of farming. I have here a report which was submitted by the commission which investigated the establishment of a fodder bank. A map which appears in that report shows the parts of the country which have been declared drought-stricken areas at one time or another in the past. When one examines this map, one finds that in all the Union of South Africa only a small part of the Transvaal high veld, a small part of the Natal coast and a small part of the Western Province had not been declared drought-stricken areas during the period preceding the publication of this report. There are other districts which are declared drought-stricken areas almost regularly. I have a list here of the districts which have been declared to be drought-stricken for a total period of more than six years out of the past 12 years, that is to say, since 1948. I shall just mention the districts: Albany, Wepener, Tarkastad, Steynsburg, Hanover, Richmond, Victoria West, Beaufort West, Willowmore, Prince Albert, Laingsburg, Sutherland, Fraserburg, Carnarvon, a part of Prieska, Kenhardt, Williston, a part of Calvinia, Van Rhynsdorp and Kuruman and then in addition Dewetsdorp in the Free State. These districts which I have just mentioned have been declared to be drought-stricken areas for a total period of more than six years out of the past 12 years. But in many of these cases the droughts did not take on such proportions that the farmers could not be assisted by the normal methods which are adopted in such cases. When we discuss drought conditions and steps which can be taken, I feel that we should distinguish between the various forms which droughts take. The whole policy of the Department is to educate the farmers. I am now discussing the normal drought conditions which we find in various parts of the country from time to time. The whole policy of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is precisely to give the farmers guidance so that they can so arrange their activities that they can overcome <span class="col_2811-2812" refersTo="page_1421"/>these periodic periods of drought. The Soil Conservation Act is partially intended to combat drought by the planning of farms, the provision of fencing, the establishment of smaller camps, and the construction of dams. All these measures by which the State assists the farmers, are measures which are taken to assist farmers in taking precautionary measures against droughts because every farmer knows at one time or another a drought may affect him.</p>

<p>Of course it remains a fact that the cheapest fodder is grazing, and for that reason the sheep-grazing areas are stock areas exclusively because the sheep in those areas can use the grazing as a reasonably cheap fodder. That is why one of the most important considerations is that we must conserve our grazing. That is why we are giving our farmers guidance. When too many head of stock are being kept, when farms are being overstocked, the farmers are told of the dangers of this practice. The farmers are also told how to provide certain types of fodder which are drought resistant and how they can cultivate them on their farms. For many years past we have urged our farmers to build up their own fodder reserves in times when they are doing well and there are no droughts. Then there is the position of those farmers who have uneconomic farms. There are many farms which have been uneconomically subdivided and the farmers with uneconomic units are the people who get into difficulties first in times of drought. That is why warnings are issued from time to time that farmers should be careful not to subdivide their farms into uneconomic units, particularly in our more extensive sheep-farming regions. One hon. member has mentioned that 50,000 people have left the platteland, particularly the dry areas, and he has told us what the position could have been, according to the report. But, Mr. Speaker, assume for a moment that in the case of an exceptional drought such as the present one, those 50,000 people had still been on the platteland, what would the position have been&#x003F; Then the position would have been so much worse. We must bear the facts in mind. We must bear in mind that a large part of our country is only suitable for stock farming. And when we bear those facts in mind we must also remember that these areas are subject to droughts. We must educate our farmers to realize that, if they farm in those areas, they must take precautionary measures to meet drought conditions. But when droughts take on more serious proportions than the normal droughts with which we are all familiar, then further steps must be taken to tide the people affected over such droughts. This is the second phase, namely, when a district is declared to be a drought-stricken area. Then assistance is provided by means of railway rebates which total 87 per cent and more of the rail charges for the conveyance of sheep to and from the farmer&#x2019;s farm. Other methods are used to help the farmers so that they can obtain their fodder more cheaply. I just want to give one or two figures to show what sums have been spent in recent years. As regards the conveyance of stock fodder, the Railway Administration pays 50 per cent of the railage; they bear 50 per cent of the railage charges, and the Department pays 25 per cent. I just want to give figures indicating what the Department has spent in recent years in the form of subsidies for the conveyance of stock fodder: In 1956-7 the figure was R8,000; in 1957-8 it was R12,800; in 1958-9 it was R40,800; in 1959-60 it was R62,000 and in 1960-1 it was as much as R112,000. This is merely one subsidy which is aimed at making cheaper fodder available to the farmers on their farms. Then I want to mention one or two figures relating to the conveyance of stock. When stock is conveyed from the drought-stricken area to another area, the farmer only pays 6 1/4 per cent of the total rail charges. The Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing pay 18 3/4 per cent and the Railways pay 75 per cent of the railage for the conveyance of such stock to and from the farm. The figures in this regard are &#x00A3;1,633 in 1956-7; &#x00A3;2,000 in 1957-8; &#x00A3;15,000 in 1958-9; &#x00A3;13,000 in 1959-60 and &#x00A3;17,000 during the period of 11 months in 1960-1. I am merely mentioning these figures to show that we always have schemes which are applied from time to time when a district experiences a drought which is more severe than normal. But when we are faced with abnormal conditions such as we have to-day, it is obvious that a scheme or schemes which have been introduced to deal with abnormal conditions cannot be used to meet more normal conditions. If, during normal drought conditions, we were to use schemes which are based on abnormal conditions, which would mean that it would cost &#x00A3;2 and more per annum to feed one head of stock, it would be more economic to put those animals into a kraal, construct water pipes and mangers and then feed them in the kraal. Any assistance which is provided must be provided on such a basis that economic farming will eventually be possible. Accordingly, when we are faced with abnormal conditions such as the present conditions, it is of course a Government&#x2019;s duty to take abnormal measures to meet such abnormal conditions. But I want to repeat that measures which are intended to meet abnormal conditions, cannot be used to meet normal droughts. This must be quite clearly understood.</p>

<p>Hon. members have referred to soil conservation and water conservation, particularly water conservation. Bearing in mind our limited water resources this is of course one of the most important methods which we in South Africa can use. But during an abnormal drought we may even find ourselves in the position that water conservation does not help at all in many areas. It can even help to create such a position. I just want to mention this. We take the Eastern Cape, the Fish River areas. There we have three dams in <span class="col_2813-2814" refersTo="page_1422"/>which water is conserved, but conditions can be such that the three dams are all empty; then the position is abnormal. Then we are not only faced with the position that the farmer below the dam cannot produce because he does not have water, but we then have the further difficulty that such a person who is making his livelihood below that dam, cannot carry on at all and we are then faced with the problem that under exceptional conditions we must eventually buy him out. One finds the same position elsewhere in the country. In the case of the Riet River scheme in the Free State we are now faced with the position that as the result of an abnormal drought, we have people living below one of the biggest dams in the Union, which contains not a drop of water. I am not saying this to prove that we should not build dams; I am merely mentioning it to show that abnormal drought conditions can have the result that even measures which one takes to meet abnormal conditions, are inadequate, and not only are they inadequate, but that they can create an additional burden. I therefore say that when we are faced with abnormal drought conditions as we are to-day, it is of course inevitable for many important reasons that we should take abnormal steps. In the first place, we must try to save the stock. If one was wise enough or if one had the knowledge to know for how long a drought is going to continue once it starts, then it would be very easy to decide, as the drought continues, what type of assistance one should offer, but no one knows when a drought starts whether it will last one year or two years or whether it may even last five years. If one was to know in advance that it was going to last for five years, it might be much cheaper for the State and for everyone concerned, to buy the stock, let the farms lie empty and then to start again from scratch in five years&#x2019; time. But all the farmers also use their own funds and the Government provides assistance in the hope that rain will come in the foreseeable future. In discussing the assistance given to farmers, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) has said: &#x201C;Of what use is &#x00A3;20 per month in the case of sheep&#x003F; &#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member now argues that the Minister should have investigated the position and then provided further assistance. Mr. Speaker, we provide the assistance as and when it is needed. If reasonable grazing is available and the fodder is merely used to supplement that grazing and the farmers do not need to provide their animals with all their food, then it would be ridiculous for any farmer to give his stock all that fodder because it would be an uneconomic proposition. But if conditions develop in such a way that it becomes necessary to save the stock, then the necessary aid must be, and is, provided. And it is provided at the request of the farmers. If they ask for assistance, they are given such assistance within the prescribed limits. But I want to point out to the hon. member that the Government is using the funds of the taxpayers and if the Government should help every farmer who asks for money without proper investigation, hon. members opposite would be the first to criticize us.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<p>There is a serious drought, but if the Government should provide assistance which cannot be justified by the prevailing conditions, hon. members opposite would be the first to raise objections. I just want to indicate what assistance can be provided. Farmers are helped to buy stock fodder up to a monthly maximum of &#x00A3;20 per 100 head of small stock and &#x00A3;7 per 10 head of large stock. Loans can also be advanced for the purchase of fuel for the private transport of small stock or large stock where no railway transport or railway bus transport is available. Loans are also available for the hiring of grazing up to a maximum of &#x00A3;5 per month for 100 small stock. Furthermore, loans are available for the payment of the transport costs of stock or fodder, when stock is conveyed by private transport to grazing when railway buses are not available. Loans are also available in respect of the conveyance of stock fodder from the nearest station or bus stop to the applicant&#x2019;s farm. I just want to mention one or two amounts which have been extended in this connection since 1958-9. In that year an amount of R330,000 was paid out for these purposes. From I April 1959 to 1960 an amount of R247,000 was paid out. Then, for II months in 1960-1, an amount of R1,875,000 was paid out in respect of these loans. I am only mentioning these figures to show that the Government is fully aware of this serious and abnormal position which the drought has created, and that we are prepared to help these people. But from time to time there have been other abnormal droughts as well and the Government has taken other measures. During 1959 the Government decided to help the farmers in the Kenhardt district, where the farmers no longer had any grazing as a result of the serious drought, by conveying their sheep with Defence Force lorries to Namaqualand where grazing was then available. Steps are therefore taken to meet abnormal conditions. For this assistance the farmers paid 1s. 4d. per sheep. The deficit, namely, &#x00A3;6,947, was borne by the Department, together with the cost of repairing the vehicles. The vehicles had to travel over bad roads and the Department had to bear all the repair costs. When conditions assumed serious proportions in Gordonia last year, the <span class="col_2815-2816" refersTo="page_1423"/>State conveyed water for the farmers at a very low tariff. I am merely mentioning these figures to show that when abnormal drought conditions prevail, the Government is completely willing to provide abnormal assistance of a type which is not normally provided.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. H. G. Swart) has also referred to the fact that not only the stock farmers are involved, but that the grain farmers are also placed in a difficult position when droughts arise. The hon. member knows what has been done in that respect. But I just want to give the figures to show what has been spent in recent years in respect of seed, fertilizer and fuel loans. These were intended more specifically to help that type of farmer. In 1956-7 seed, fertilizer and fuel loans to the value of &#x00A3;204,000 were granted; in 1957-8 to the value of &#x00A3;222,000; while in 1958-9&#x2014;this was an exceptionally dry year&#x2014; the amount was &#x00A3;2,395,000. Nearly &#x00A3;2,500,000 has been spent on just that one item alone. In 1960 the amount advanced was R564,000 and in 1960-1, R453,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have given these figures just to substantiate the submission I made at the beginning of my speech; namely, that seeing we in South Africa are faced with droughts periodically and seeing that droughts are to a very large extent a normal phenomenon, it is the function of the State and the Department of Agriculture to educate the farmers in those areas to use the best farming methods in order to meet such conditions. That is why many other methods are being utilized as well. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services also supplies information to the farmers as to how they should feed their sheep in times of drought. The Department is also engaged on an extensive research project relating to the feeding of sheep. This research is being carried out at Grootfontein and Stellenbosch especially. It also includes an investigation into mineral deficiencies, trace elements and vitamin A nutrients. The Department also intends appointing a commission to inquire into the whole question of the feeding of sheep in times of drought, the co-ordination of all research work in this regard and the planning of further feeding and fodder projects. In this regard the Department will work in the closest possible co-operation with the companies which supply fodders and the various interested organizations. But, Mr. Speaker, it still remains a fact that while all these investigations are being undertaken and while fodder can be made available for stock in drought-stricken areas, the cheapest and most economic fodder remains grazing itself. That is why I want to repeat once again that a Government cannot be expected to provide assistance or to establish a scheme to combat normal periodical droughts. A scheme can therefore only be introduced to meet abnormal conditions. If we were to continue to feed sheep permanently on this basis, that is to say on the basis of &#x00A3;20 per 100 sheep per month, it is after all quite clear that such a scheme could not be economic. What one can do is to establish such a scheme as a temporary measure to meet an abnormal position. I want to make it quite clear that abnormal drought conditions must be met by abnormal measures.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley (North) now asks for a wide and exhaustive inquiry by a commission which should be appointed to inquire into drought conditions and to submit plans and schemes which will enable us to face the droughts of the future. With the required information at their disposal, the Government and the Department are fully familiar with these conditions which arise from time to time. Various commissions of inquiry have already been appointed from time to time. For example, there has been the Commission of Inquiry into fodder banks which made certain recommendations regarding an insurance scheme whereby fodder could be bought for a fodder bank. At the time our farmers would not accept that proposal. They said that they would rather provide their own fodder. Nor can the mealie farmer and the lucerne farmer be expected in times of surplus to store those surpluses and then to make that fodder available to the stock farmer when the stock farmer needs it in times of drought. These conditions have been investigated on various occasions. As long ago as 1933 the Poor White Commission was already investigating it. The commission into the depopulation of the platteland referred to this matter and the facts of the matter are not unknown. We are all familiar with them. I therefore think that it is quite unnecessary to appoint a commission of inquiry at this stage. I want to give hon. members the assurance that the Government is fully aware of the problems and that from time to time measures will be taken to meet these problems. We all hope that the position will soon be relieved by general rains, particularly in these exceptionally hard hit areas. In anticipation of this development. The Minister of Finance has already announced in the Senate that the Government has decided in consultation with the Land Bank that, when the drought in those areas is broken, those people who require assistance will be assisted to rehabilitate themselves. The assistance will be provided to them on a reasonably large scale. I just want to repeat that announcement here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After consultation with the Board of the Land Bank I can make the following statement: The Board is aware of the difficult position in which farmers of the Karoo and of the North-West Cape are finding themselves at the moment as a result of the continuing drought which has possibly also prevented their making use of the Board&#x2019;s plan during 1959 to assist farmers to consolidate their debts. Therefore, it has been decided within the limits of the means at its <span class="col_2817-2818" refersTo="page_1424"/>disposal and to the extent which its funds permit, to assist the farmers from these parts to consolidate their debts and/or to buy cattle after they have satisfied the Board that the drought has been broken. Where serious cattle losses have been apparent, it is also prepared under the mortgage scheme to grant loans for the restoration of cattle herds and will be prepared for this purpose to suspend the restriction which has thus far been binding upon the scope of this type of loan if the circumstances of the applicant justify it. The concessions will however be confined to the Karoo and to the North-West Cape and will only take effect after soaking rains have fallen.</block>

<p>These are the areas where exceptional drought conditions are prevailing. Apart from this announcement by the hon. the Minister of Finance, a committee was appointed not very long ago to inquire into the provision of credit to the agricultural industry. This committee has also made certain recommendations which the Cabinet is now considering. I hope to be able to announce further plans in the near future aimed at helping people who are in a difficult position as far as credit is concerned. I just want to repeat that I do not think it is necessary to appoint a commission of inquiry at this stage, and I cannot see the need for it. Such a commission would only report in a couple of years&#x2019; time. And our experience in South Africa over the years has been that every commission which we have appointed to inquire into drought conditions has found that by the time its report is published, the drought is already over. Then no one mentions the report again until another serious drought arises. By that time such a report is obsolete and one has to appoint a new commission.</p>

<p>I think the Government has shown itself quite prepared to help the farmers under the exceptionally difficult drought conditions in which a large part of the country finds itself. It is in these areas especially that we find our hardiest farmers. When we examine the position regarding the hypothec loans and the facilities for consolidating debts which were made available last year, we find that a very small proportion of the farmers in these areas where droughts usually assume the worst proportions, have made use of these facilities. This is proof that these people are to a very large extent independent people, people who fight through under difficult conditions. They are amongst our hardiest farmers. Even in the case of the scheme which is intended to help these people to buy fodder, it has been our experience that these farmers do not lightly make use of it. Most of them stand on their own feet unless conditions absolutely force them to make use of these loans. When there is such a community of farmers who are prepared to continue farming under these difficult conditions, and not only to do that but to maintain their independence as well, it is obvious that any government would treat such people with the utmost measure of sympathy when they are faced with difficult conditions over which they have no control. It is quite obvious that any government would make all possible assistance available to them to help them overcome their difficulties.</p>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that all sides of this House have the utmost sympathy for the farmers of our country, particularly those in the drought-stricken areas. Only those of us who come from farms can realize what suffering this entails, and I am not only referring to the financial losses. Great as they are, the financial losses sometimes are the least of the real suffering which a drought causes. I therefore agree with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Mr. Dodds) that we are faced here with the greatest possible enemy of our people and nation, namely the droughts of South Africa, and that we must declare war on that enemy. I also agree with that submission, just as long as we realize fully what it entails and what it means.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this matter has such a vast variety of aspects and implications that I pity the poor Minister who happens to be charged with responsibility for this problem. We can really sympathize with him, but the problem is far too great for any Government to solve. It is caused by South Africa&#x2019;s climate. It is nothing new. As far back as our historical records go, there have been droughts; for the most part normal droughts and perhaps only too often, abnormal droughts. It would appear that the abnormal droughts are now being experienced more frequently than formerly. It is this question which calls for the attention of the nation. This is not a question for the Government; it is a question for the whole nation. In the first instance it is the farmer who is actually engaged in farming who will have to realize that if he wishes to go on farming, there are certain things which it is absolutely essential he should do and that he dare not take a risk in this regard. He must do these things to the best of his ability. In the first place, he must comply with the guidance and instructions of the Department and try to farm according to the rules laid down for farming in his particular area. He must take those natural factors into account. As Prof. Leppan once said, one of the most important factors in farming in South Africa is &#x201C;the natural controls &#x201D;. I do not believe in the type of control about which we have heard i.e. over what the people must do. The farmer will have to listen to nature in South Africa and will have to adjust himself accordingly. The farmer who does not want to do so and who cannot or still does not wish to do so, even with the assistance of the State&#x2014;Mr. Speaker, let us be clear on this point&#x2014;has no hope of remaining a farmer. Nor can the nation afford to keep him on his farm. He must do his duty towards himself and his people.</p>

<p><span class="col_2819-2820" refersTo="page_1425"/>We must declare war. I agree that we must provide water, as the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has said&#x2014;water, water! But even if we should provide all the water possible, then we must still not imagine that the problem will be solved. In the first place, how are we going to get the water&#x003F; How are we going to declare war in that respect&#x003F; I make bold to say that we are at all times faced with a limiting factor which we shall have to take into account. The small handful of people who are living in South Africa are in actual fact not in a position to take these war measures, i.e. to make the maximum possible amount of water available. We need far more people in South Africa if we are to undertake that task. We have people in this country, but we need many more to carry the burden of taking even one such step. It must be possible to spread the burden far more widely than we can to-day.</p>

<p>But then we are faced with yet another fact, as the position is to-day. Let us assume that we succeed in bringing the water to where it is needed. Then we are once again faced with the fundamental fact that there are too few people in South Africa. Despite all the droughts which affect our agricultural products we are already faced with a surplus or a so-called surplus in nearly every branch of our agricultural industry. If we should take the steps needed to bring water to where it is required, then it is quite clear that our surpluses would soon become still larger. I urge that <i>pari passu</i>, together with all the measures which may be taken, we should never forget the basic principle, namely, that these things will become possible as a result of manpower and man&#x2019;s economic ability, and that we must increase the already existing human resources and the economic resources of the nation, or else we can tell beautiful stories about what should be done and what should not be done, but we shall always find ourselves faced with this fact that there are too few people and too great a task before us. Turning to the hon. member for Florida (Mr. H. G. Swart) who has put forward a reasonable point, I want to say this. The hon. member says that in determining prices, sufficient regard is not paid to the risk element in farming. There may be a certain degree of truth in that contention. But I just want to say this. Only in determining the maximum prices can one take the quite normal calculable risk which applies to normal droughts, and which every farmer should calculate for himself, into account. If the risk of normal and abnormal droughts should be taken into full consideration in determining the price of an article, the position would be quite impossible. Then we should find that as the droughts are by no means evenly distributed, farmers would make fortunes in one part of the country, while in other parts of the country the provision made for the risk factor would not be nearly sufficient. I have had a great deal to do with price determinations and with this factor, and I know&#x2014;and the Minister can go into this aspect&#x2014;that even the normal risk which farmers run when they produce agricultural products is not taken sufficiently into account. For what it is worth, I want to suggest what we should do. We have insurance schemes providing for all branches of the community. We have unemployment insurance for the workers. To-day approximately &#x00A3;70,000,000 stands to their credit. As far as the farmers are concerned, we have hail insurance schemes and it may even be possible for the farmers themselves, supported by the nation, to build up a fund which may help to tide farmers over these disastrous droughts which are experienced in certain areas. Let the farmers help one another to carry this burden. I know that individual farmers are prepared to do so to-day by telling people in drought-stricken areas that they can send their stock and make use of free grazing. That already helps. But it is of a sporadic nature and in reality it does not help much. Let us see whether we cannot do something in the direction of an insurance scheme to which the farmers themselves will contribute and to which the nation as a whole will contribute, so that there will at least be a fund on which we can draw to provide direct assistance to people in certain areas so that we can see whether we can minimize the effect of droughts on them.</p>

<p>I return to the main point, Mr. Speaker, namely, that if we want to solve this problem it may be worth our while&#x2014;I know the conditions are quite different&#x2014;to examine what Israel is doing. I think what Israel is doing to-day should be a lesson to the whole world and to South Africa, showing us what can be done if the spirit and the need are really present. I concede that what they have done would not have been possible if the threat of death had not been hanging over a people who must live on a small piece of land, nor would it have been possible without the assistance which has been obtained from various parts of the world. But the practical steps which have been taken should make us realize that we are not making anything like the best use of the water and the land we have. I believe that we can learn from these people, that we shall once again find&#x2014;what I am saying will sound ironic&#x2014;that dire necessity has not yet taught us to pray. We do pray sporadically in church, but necessity has not yet become sufficiently pressing. But it will become so great that every farmer and every citizen will realize that we will have to do things which we have never done before. We are still wasting water and land on a tremendous scale because these two usually go together. We are doing so because hitherto we have been able to afford luxuries as a result of a shortage of people. Necessity is not yet pressing hard enough because the people are not yet there to exercise pressure. As our population grows&#x2014;not necessarily poor people, because when I refer to people I am not only referring to the number of people but I am <span class="col_2821-2822" refersTo="page_1426"/>referring to the people who are becoming economically effective. And here is the great problem which I always regard as the basic problem, and I must repeat it, even if it is for the umpteenth time. Unless we also face up to the tremendous erosion and droughts in the case of our human resources, and unless we uplift our people in terms of economic effectiveness, whether they be Black or White, we shall not realize that here is our material which we shall be eventually able to use to solve this greater problem presented by nature. It is only in that direction that I see hope for South Africa. Give every person in this country the opportunity to develop his own inner resources and to give full expression to those resources in terms of economic effectiveness so that this can become a factor in building up and rehabilitating the natural resources, the soil of South Africa and in preventing our retrogressing still further in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA REY VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is surely one of the most interesting debates to which I have ever listened in this House. Before saying a few words about the speech of the last speaker, I would just like to thank the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) for the excellent speech he made, and also the hon. member for Florida (Mr. H. G. Swart), who reacted to it so nicely. I regret to say that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) struck a false note because he tried to make capital out of it to see whether he could not catch a cheap vote, or two, by saying things here which were quite out of place in this debate. It is a great pity. He is a young farmer who farms in a very good part of the Karoo. I know his farm very well and he is quite an efficient farmer. We are now living at a time when by far the greatest portion of the Cape Province finds itself in very difficult circumstances, but still the hon. member comes here with petty matters. He started off his speech very nicely and I thought we were going to hear a good speech, but he had hardly gone half-way when it petered out to nothing. The hon. member for Florida approached the matter differently. He made a contribution towards coping with conditions which are absolutely critical. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat is an excellent theoretician. He discussed the matter from the theoretical aspect, but when one has gained a little practical experience one knows that one cannot always strictly apply theory in practice. In practice theory often leaves one in the lurch. I am glad that the Minister gave us such a thorough exposition here. The Department of Agriculture and the Government have done very much during the last 12 years to put agriculture on a sound basis. When one travels through the country one becomes aware of the large scale on which the Government tries to do things. When one looks at the thousands of miles of contour walls that have been built for soil conservation, one realizes that this has its merits but also its demerits in practice. The water which usually ran down a donga and eventually landed in a river has been diverted on to the veld and that river no longer gets any water. What is the use of building weirs in small rivers which do not have a constant flow&#x003F; What is the use of spending R1,000,000 on that&#x003F; We have the example of Lake Mentz. We spent many millions building dams, but if one looks at the dams to-day which still contain water one sees that there are not very many contour walls above them. We improved our grazing but allowed our water resources to deteriorate. The water is now being diverted over the veld. Our rainfall has diminished in recent years, and we now get soft rains which do not allow any water to run off. That only benefits the higher parts of the veld but the vlei is not benefited unless there is a hard rainfall. We erected thousands of miles of fences. We made camps so that the grazing could be controlled to such an extent that one-third of the farm could lie fallow, but many people cannot allow one-third of the farm to rest; they are compelled to graze the whole farm because they are farming on uneconomic units. A certain person arrived from the north-west with his sheep to look for grazing because he could no longer afford to buy fodder and we gave him grazing gratis. I asked him what conditions were like there and he told me his history. His father had farmed on 5,000 morgen, which is a reasonably economic unit, but after his death the farm was divided between this man and three other brothers. Each of them received less than 300 morgen, which is quite uneconomic there. He told me that he had tried to manage on this small piece of land and had lived economically, but that he had now come to the end of his tether and could not carry on. Are we now to allow that man to go under completely&#x003F; At one time or another we shall have to say that it is illegal to subdivide land too much.</p>

<p>But I go further. We tried to raise our subterranean water level by diverting the water over the veld, but after a few years of drought we just have no water level any more. It was said here this morning that we should have more geologists and more boring machines. That is not the correct approach. My practical experience in this respect is that just as we control the grazing one should also control the subterranean water. When one sinks a borehole and gets 2,000 gallons per hour, it is very unwise to use all that water. By pumping out that water by means of a deep water pump, only one thing can happen, viz. that one&#x2019;s neighbour&#x2019;s water is reduced, and also one&#x2019;s own. We shall have to consider in future controlling the erection of deep water pumps. I am a farmer myself, but I am sorry to say that the farmer will not do it of his own accord. He wants to irrigate a bit of land in order to build up a fodder bank, and often he does so on an <span class="col_2823-2824" refersTo="page_1427"/>unsuitable piece of land. Unless one has the correct soil for growing lucerne, one can only suffer losses.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be better for him to be asked to remove it and to put up an ordinary windmill.</p>

<p>The other day we heard the frightening figures in connection with the depopulation of the platteland. This present drought has led to the depopulation of the platteland on a large scale and a plan should now be evolved. We cannot allow those areas to be denuded of people. I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker). The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Prof. Fourie) said that there are too few people in the country. He is quite wrong there. We cannot allow even this small group of people to go under. We shall have to evolve methods to control the water which is not being used beneficially now, and in those parts of the country there is only one way of doing so and that is by damming up the Orange River. In my opinion, we should not give the people in the north-west hundreds of morgen which can be irrigated and on which to plant lucerne, but we should give a man ten to 15 morgen to build up his own fodder bank. I am given to understand that there are about 600,000 morgen of irrigable land along the Orange River. If one divides that up into units of ten morgen, the depopulation of the platteland can be combated to a very large extent. Then there will be no danger of the Cape Province being denuded of people. That is one way of keeping these people on the land. It will cost a lot of money, but we are spending a lot of money on other things too. We should not be put off by the money which we will have to spend, because the people of South Africa will be prepared to pay for it.</p>

<p>I would like to associate myself with the last speaker, who expressed his thanks to the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) for introducing this motion, and in the time at my disposal I should like to repeat the cardinal points he made. The hon. member took us back into the past and proved by means of statistics what droughts have cost the farmers of South Africa during past years up to 1955. It amounts to millions of pounds. That was his first proposition, and the background for the motion. He suggested what steps should be taken to combat this natural process of periodic droughts, and if it cannot be combated then to reduce the losses of the farmer and of our economy as a whole as far as possible. He firstly suggested that we should make better use of the water available to us. The last speaker said that it was no use building small dams, because they would just stand empty like Lake Mentz. The hon. member meant that we should act judiciously in building dams. His point was that the farmers have available to them the technicians of the Departments, and what prevents us from building dams&#x003F; The hon. member also pointed out that however much we as farmers appreciate the assistance we obtain for the building of dams, in so far as irrigation is concerned, it is not of much use. It helps to conserve the soil and to raise the water table and to restore fountains which have dried up but the idea he had in mind was that the farmer should be enabled to build up his own fodder bank. Unless he takes steps to put the individual farmer in the position to build up his own fodder bank, these periodic droughts and their resultant losses will strike a severe blow at the whole of the economy of South Africa. The point was made by the hon. member for Germiston (District) that our population was too small to exert sufficient pressure on the Government to take steps to cope with these difficulties. He also said that the purchasing power of our people was confined to the higher strata of the population, and that point has also repeatedly been made at agricultural congresses, that we should put the farmer into the position where he will be strong enough financially to provide for the periodic droughts. Therefore I want to make my contribution towards exerting pressure on the Government and the Minister, because although we realize that they are doing what they can, it is not enough. In my opinion, it is wrong economic thinking to be afraid of investing &#x00A3;80,000,000 or &#x00A3;100,000,000 in so far as the Orange River scheme is concerned, when we have lost hundreds of millions of pounds ever since 1919 as the result of droughts. Because it is not only the farmer who suffers loss, but the whole country. Therefore I welcome this motion because it directs the attention of the whole of the population to the fact that although it will cost a large amount of money, it is essential for us as a nation to tackle that task. I am glad the Minister is here. He told us last year that the Government had decided to make use of the Pongola. He said that they had decided on the Pongola because the research done in regard to the potentialities of our large rivers as compared with those of the Pongola shows that the Pongola would be a more economic investment.</p>

<p>For 20 years already there has been talk about using the water of the Orange River. One commission after another was appointed, and one congress after another sat, and all those things cost the farmers money, and if we have to wait another 20 years you can imagine, Sir, what damage will be suffered. But I want to give the Minister the assurance that he will receive the support of all sections of the population for that project.</p>

<p>I just want to make one final point, that the cattle farmer cannot expect the lucernegrowers and maize farmers to stockpile their products and to sit and wait for a drought so that the cattle farmers can buy that produce. That is not what the cattle farmers mean. The cattle farmers do not want it, but what he said is that the Government should enable him to build up his own fodder-bank through water conservation, and that it should not be limited to &#x00A3;300 per dam. Secondly, the cattle farmer asks that the surplus maize and lucerne now being sold overseas should be utilized here in South Africa. The point made by the hon. member, and which I would like to emphasize, is the plea I have made here year after year in regard to the so-called surpluses. I say &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; because it is only a surplus due to the small purchasing power of the population.</p>

<p>Yes, but it cannot be used because the price is too high. The economists always use the argument that one cannot have two prices for the same product. If the maize sold overseas at a loss is sold in South Africa at the same price then we have two different prices for the same product. We agreed with that argument at the time when maize could not be turned into a product which could compete with the maize used for domestic consumption. The hon. member made the point that one-third of the value of the lucerne is lost, but now there are five or six firms and co-operatives turning out balanced rations. They use the lucerne and the maize and add proteins in order to obtain a balanced ration.</p>

<heading>CHIROPRACTORS BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for leave to introduce the Chiropractors Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by Mr. van der Walt, adjourned on 17 Februry, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I have pleasure in asking leave to introduce this Bill. Let me say at the outset that I have obtained my party&#x2019;s permission to bring this Bill to this House, and that my party has decided to regard this Bill as a non-party measure, and I only trust that the Opposition parties will do the same.</p>

<p>The request to introduce this Bill came from two important trade union bodies, the S.A. Federation of Trade Unions and the Co-ordinated Council of Trade Unions. The affiliated unions of these two councils have a membership of approximately 120,000. Furthermore, I understand that they also have the backing of the Confederation of Labour and of the Trade Union Council. These bodies are joined in their desire that this Bill should become law. The reason for this position is self-evident.</p>

<p>Members of the trade unions avail themselves of the services of chiropractors, but they are not allowed to submit the bills of their chiropractors to the medical benefit societies for payment. The constitutions of medical benefit societies invariably carry a clause prohibiting the payment of fees for treatment by persons not registered with the Medical Council. In short, it means that the members of the trade unions are anxious to be placed in a position to claim payment of the chiropractors&#x2019; fees on the same basis as those of the medical practitioner. When these requests were made to me, I had to give serious consideration to the question whether it is in the public interest to bring a Bill of this kind to this House for discussion. After I had given due consideration to the pros and the cons of the matter, I came to the conclusion that it is in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>As far as I could ascertain, chiropractors have been practicing their health philosophy and technique in this country for the past 50 years. At the moment there are approximately 120 of them practicing in South Africa, and there is a large number of South Africans in the U.S.A. at the moment studying for this profession. It was especially during the last two decades that the number of practicing chiropractors grew steadily, and it is to be foreseen that their number will continue to grow. In this connection I want to draw the attention of the House to the interesting fact that at the end of World War II the United Party Government gave bursaries to 26 ex-soldiers to <span class="col_2827-2828" refersTo="page_1429"/>enable them to study for this profession in the U.S.A. This number was a substantial addition to the number of practicing chiropractors in this country. In a certain sense this can be regarded as State recognition of the chiropractic profession and as I have said, it is to be foreseen that the number will steadily grow, and therefore I want to appeal to hon. members to approach this question in a practical, objective and unbiased way. To my mind there are only two alternative attitudes that we can adopt in this House in the interests of the public. The first is to prohibit these people to carry on their profession in this country. If the dangers of this practice are of the magnitude that people want us to believe, then the only logical thing to do would be to prohibit them. The other alternative is to give them the desired statutory powers to control their profession and place it on a sound and proper professional basis. It seems to me that these are the only alternatives left to this House if we have the interests of the public at heart. Since this profession has been allowed for so many years, I cannot foresee that this House would adopt legislation prohibiting chiropractors to proceed with their practice and thereby rob them of their livelihood. On the other hand there is abundant evidence that a great many people have benefited by the services of these people, many after long years of suffering and attendance by medical practitioners. Even in this House there is a substantial number of hon. members who can testify to the benefits that they have received as the result of treatment by these people. As I have said, I cannot see that this House will ever adopt legislation to deprive the public of the benefit of the service of chiropractors. It is alleged that harm has come to many people by the technique of the chiropractor; but cannot that be said of the medical profession as well&#x003F; I have a high regard for the high standing of the medical profession in this country, but that does not mean that no medical man has ever made a mistake. It is fortunate for the medical profession that no assessment can be made of the number of people who have suffered severe mental and physical agony as the result of the mistakes made by the medical profession.</p>

<p>Is there any member in this House who would be so bold as to vouch that no man has ever been sent to his grave by the mistake of a medical practitioner&#x003F; Sir, this argument used against chiropractice is to my mind the main and most important reason why we should assist the chiropractors to put their profession on a proper professional basis by prescribing minimum educational and professional standards. That was the way in which the medical profession was placed on a sound professional basis. Why should we not give the same remedy to the chiropractors in this country&#x003F;</p>

<p>The question may be asked why these people do not seek recognition and registration with the Medical Council. I think that is a fair question, but the facts show that the Medical Council does not want to give recognition to the chiropractic profession. Members who were in this House in 1952 will remember that in that year a Bill on Supplementary Health Services was introduced in this House. Although it was withdrawn at a later stage that Bill was submitted to a Select Committee. The Bill did not provide for the recognition of chiropractice, but that question was considered by the Select Committee. Representatives of the Medical Council gave evidence before that committee and I want to read an extract from the memorandum presented to that committee by the Medical Council. The quotation will be found on page 9 para. 27 of the Select Committee&#x2019;s report. The memorandum says this in reference to the omission of chiropractice from the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The omission is from the viewpoint of the Council, which was consulted in the drafting of the Bill, intentional. Osteopaths, chiropractors, etc., do not supplement the service provided by medical practitioners and the auxiliaries scheduled and to be scheduled under the Bill. They supplant or endeavour to supplant them. They base their practice upon concepts of etiology and pathology of disease which are totally different from those of scientific medicine, and no reconciliation is possible.</block>

<speech by="#shearer">

<from>Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SHEARER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me say at once that I am supporting the introduction of this Bill, and I do so for various reasons. Firstly, I am not prepared to deny a member the right to introduce a Bill, a right given under our Standing Orders. Secondly, I am not prepared to deny the right of bodies to request the consideration of legislation by Parliament, the highest legislative body in the land, and thirdly I think that the legal maxim, which has so frequently and forcibly been expressed in this House, the legal maxim of <i>audi alteram partem</i> should be applied in this instance. What is the position&#x003F; This is merely a motion for leave to introduce a Bill. That Bill has not been tabled. We are not aware of its contents. So how can the opposing viewpoints be adequately expressed&#x003F; I understand it is the intention of the sponsor of this Bill to refer it to a Select Committee before the second reading. Obviously that is a wise course, because by referring it to a Select Committee, the opposing viewpoints can be advanced before the Select Committee and the <span class="col_2829-2830" refersTo="page_1430"/>Bill can be considered dispassionately there. Its merits or demerits can then be considered and in its wisdom, Parliament, through its Select Committee, can accept, amend or reject the Bill. There have been two attempts, as far as I am aware, in the history of this Parliament, to introduce legislation affecting chiropractors. The first was during the United Party r&#x00E9;gime and that Bill was called the Medical Auxiliaries Bill. That Bill never saw the light of day; it was dropped before the second reading. The Bill came up subsequently under another title, the Supplementary Health Services Bill. Both of those Bills had as their objective the bringing of some of the services of chiropractors under the jurisdiction of the Medical Council. Now, two attempts to do that have failed. What is left therefore&#x003F; One alternative is to introduce legislation to prohibit chiropractic, but frankly I cannot conceive that any responsible Government would take so drastic a step. What is the other alternative&#x003F; Here I want to refer to two of the principal arguments of my distinguished and hon. friend, the member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford). He advanced two criticisms; the first was the danger of certain chiropractors due to the fact that they did not have the necessary knowledge, and the ease with which they secured their diplomas, some even through correspondence schools. I agree with this criticism. The second criticism was that there were no institutions in this country for the training of chiropractors. Let me take the first argument, because I think the first argument of my hon. friend supports the necessity for this Bill. I think those chiropractors who are experienced and adequately trained realize themselves that there may be a certain number who are not adequately trained and who do perhaps constitute a danger to the public, but that very argument surely necessitates the granting of statutory recognition to the chiropractors to enable them to put their own house in order. In other words, to set a standard of examinations as well as a code of ethical conduct. It seems to me perfectly logical that that is the only course open now to the chiropractors. The second argument advanced was that there is a lack of institutions for training in this country, but I would remind this House that even in my own generation, as far as medical qualifications were concerned&#x2014;and that is not so very long ago&#x2014;no one could take a complete course and secure a medical degree in this country. The only examination that was available was the first professional examination which did not deal with what are the purely medical subjects, but dealt with the subjects of botany, physics, chemistry and zoology. Students could continue a course in anatomy and physiology in the second year, but the second professional examination could not be taken in this country and South Africans who wished to qualify in medicine had to go overseas. Fortunately, however, that position has been rectified. Applying that same line of reasoning to the chiropractors, surely one of the ultimate goals of the chiropractor will be the provision in this country of an institution for the adequate training of the chiropractor. Some time back an erstwhile Minister of Health, in describing the line of demarcation between scientific and orthodox medicine on the one hand as compared with unscientific and unorthodox medicine, in which group he possibly included the chiropractor, stated that the line of demarcation was the fundamental sciences of anatomy and physiology. If one studies the course followed by the chiropractor, the curriculum at the institutions in the United States, one finds that the training, both theoretical and practical, in both those subjects compares very favourably with the training received in those subjects by medical students. I think that is quite clear. But the important point, as far as I am concerned, is the fact that there have been two attempts, through the Medical Auxiliaries Bill and the Supplementary Health Services Bill, which was not proceeded with on the recommendation of the Select Committee, to bring some chiropractice services under the jurisdiction of the Medical Council, both of which have failed, and any such attempt in the future is likely to fail again.</p>

<p>The hon. member who introduced this Bill mentioned another alternative and that is the legal prohibition of chiropractic in this country. I contend&#x2014;and I think this House will agree with me&#x2014;that no responsible Government would take that attitude, particularly as a Government of this country assisted ex-servicemen to study chiropractic. Now, what is left&#x003F; What is left now is the request of the chiropractors to be allowed to introduce a private Bill which will enable them to set their house in order, based on examination standards and the practice of a sound code of ethics.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Before answering the mover, I feel that I am compelled to answer the unreliable statements of my hon. friend, the member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Col. Shearer). Neither the Supplementary Health Services Bill nor the Medical Auxiliaries Bill, both of which came to this House, made any effort to control the chiropractors. They were Bills which were submitted through the Health Department by the South African Medical Council, and the Medical Council has no wish and never has had any wish to control the chiropractors. The hon. member says that no Government would make it illegal to practise chiropractic. Every chiropractor to-day is acting illegally, and that Bill, Sir, was passed by a Nationalist Government. Dr. Malan put that Bill through. Every chiropractor to-day is acting illegally but it is not the function of the Medical Council to prosecute those people; that is the function of the police. My hon. friend also says that the standards are equivalent. I am sure that everything I say will be regarded as rather an <i>ex parte</i> statement, but I want to quote briefly from the <span class="col_2831-2832" refersTo="page_1431"/>report of the commission set up by the Government of New Jersey, a state with 5,500,000 inhabitants, a state which recognizes chiropractors. This question was put to them on a Government Select Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are students at present enrolled in chiropractic schools or colleges receiving adequate training to be licensed to treat the sick&#x003F;&#x2014;Our answer is a categorical &#x201C;no&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The following reasons are then given, which I quote in brief&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No pre-chiropractic training on the college level is required before admission to a chiropractic school.</block>

<p>That means that they are not even asked for a matriculation certificate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Secondly, the approved chiropractic schools do not give the same quality of instruction as medical schools, and thirdly, the chiropractic student receives practically no clinical training.</block>

<p>That is to say, he receives no training on the patient. But I do not want to labour that question. I merely want to correct the false impression which my hon. friend has given. I want rather to draw the attention of this House to what the effect would be of giving recognition to chiropractic. Sir, if this was a cult which asked only for a limited amount of recognition, which said &#x201C;we only want to treat sore backs or lumbago and things of that kind&#x201D; it would be a different matter, but they do not. Chiropractors lay claim to treating all illnesses. But that they limit their method of treatment to manipulation of the back. Sir, we must ask ourselves what will happen to the country. Are people prepared to have the chiropractor attend their wives in labour&#x003F; Are they prepared to send their children with whooping cough and measles and that kind of thing to the chiropractor&#x003F;</p>

If they said that they were prepared to limit their practice there might be some way, but there is no way of limiting the chiropractors. They claim that chiropractic is a complete system of medicine, a system of medicine which is taught in some places in a fortnight and in the best institutions in four years.</p>

<p>They do nothing else but manipulative health but they are doctors.

They will not treat whooping cough, diphtheria and leprosy by manipulating the back. I know, I have seen it. It will lead to a complete destruction of the whole legal system of medicine if these people are recognized legally. If they wish to have recognition they must come not under the jurisdiction of the Medical Council; the main function of the Medical Council is to scrutinize the qualifications of people who wish to attend to the sick for gain. That is what they have to do and that is all they do really.</p>

<p>They are prohibited completely now; I have nothing to do with that. They practice, but that is a police affair, not mine. The Medical Council scrutinizes the qualifications of every person who wants to practice as a doctor, who wants to care for the sick for gain. It is laid down by law what the qualifications of medical practitioners shall be, and if any chiropractor can acquire those qualifications he is entitled to practice his cult as long as he wishes. It is because these people cannot comply with the simple straightforward educational requirements, which science has shown to be the best available at the moment, that we say that they should not receive recognition. If they <span class="col_2833-2834" refersTo="page_1432"/>claim to cure only backaches, there might be some argument, but they are not prepared to do that; they claim that chiropractic covers the complete field of medicine.

<p>If one needed proof as to why it was necessary to allow the first reading of this Bill, it is to be found in the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down. The mere fact that certain information was given to the House, correct in some respects and completely wrong in others, simply proves that there should be an opportunity to discuss a subject like this on a broad basis and from all aspects. I am not going to waste my ten minutes by proving how wrong the hon. member was. I rather want to make a contribution towards the discussion of this subject. One could advance many reasons for allowing the first reading of a Bill like this so that the matter can then later be discussed fully in this House and in order that information might be given by the persons affected by the Bill, but one does not have the time for that, and therefore I want to mention only three reasons why the first reading should be allowed. Unless the first reading is allowed, the real scientific facts, incontrovertible facts, cannot be given to the House, and that would be a great pity because it would mean that the whole matter would be strangled at birth, and surely it is not the duty of this House to refuse to discuss a matter or to hear the facts so that the House can decide whether it should protect a certain group of professional people. It is only after investigation that the House can come to such a decision, and it is for that reason that the first reading should be allowed, in order that the matter may be discussed thoroughly. Chiropractice, as we know, is a modern development in our national health. I say it is a modern development, but the oldest school for the training of chiropractors has been in existence for almost 60 years and there are at least 25,000 chiropractors who have graduated and started practicing on a post-matriculation basis, i.e. on a university basis. Every year still nearly 500 students graduate from this one school, the Palmer school in Ohio. The position fortunately is that out of all the chiropractors practicing in the world, approximately 90 per cent come from this Palmer school which has already existed for about 60 years. The hon. member over there spoke about a brief period of training. At the Palmer school the period of training is four years. The only place here of which I know where a chiropractor can be trained is in Johannesburg, where courses of three or four weeks are given by quacks for quacks. Is that not in itself sufficient reason why a stop should be put to that sort of thing at this stage&#x003F; Unless we allow the first reading of this Bill, facts such as these I have just mentioned will not come to light&#x2014;the years of study required, the subjects studied, etc. We have the facts and I personally also have facts which I can put at the disposal of the House, but this is not the occasion for doing so. If this first reading is not allowed, the House cannot be informed that the time devoted to certain subjects is in many cases longer than the time devoted to such subjects in medical schools. I am not trying to play off the medical schools against the chiropractors now, but if we have the opportunity we can prove that, e.g., in anatomy the time spent on that subject by the chiropractor in his four-year course is longer than the time spent on it by the medical student. This Palmer school undertakes research on a large scale, and the thorough and efficient way in which that work is done is really impressive. That is my first reason for saying that this information should be made available, and the House can only be given this information if the first reading is allowed. But the second reason I want to mention is that the medical profession does not regard this matter as an additional medical service. They regard it as an independent medical service, and I am quoting from the same document from which the hon. member who introduced the motion quoted, but I think this is even more relevant in connection with that point. In this case Dr. le Roux, the ex-Chief of the Health Services, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the knowledge that I have, I would regard chiropractice as an independent health service.</block>

<p>He is not the only one. Dr. Oosthuizen, the chairman of that board, and Dr. Gale, who is also a member of the Medical Council, said the same. They do not regard it as a supplementary service, but as an independent service. It is for that reason that we have medical men who practice it, who practice manipulation, but they are people who have been specially trained. It is specialized manipulation. I knew a medical man who practiced long before there was a single chiropractor in our country, 30 years ago. I am referring to Dr. Hoffman, who worked in London years ago. He had special training. He is a medical man. He had special training and therefore he could practice it, but just as little as the ordinary medical man will pose to-day as a dietetic expert or an expert in the field of physiology or in any of the other subjects of which he happened to have learnt something&#x2014;just as little will a chiropractor pose as an expert in any sphere other than his own. I therefore say again that it is necessary to point out that this is not a supplementary service but a special service, an independent service, and it is necessary to have an opportunity to discuss the matter here, and that can only be done if the first reading is allowed.</p>

<p>The third and last reason I want to advance is this: We are living to-day in a time of specialization. The position is no longer <span class="col_2835-2836" refersTo="page_1433"/>what it was in the past, when if a man was a chemist he was a physicist and all the other things, and if a man was a scientist he was expected to know something about all the sciences. No, that is no longer the position. That is what gave rise to the different professions. I merely want to mention these few cases. Of course there was a time, not long ago, when only medical men knew something about dietetics. To-day we have the dietician. Although it is not a profession, these are people who are not connected with the medical profession at all. We have the physiotherapists, people who are experts in the physiological sphere. Less than 30 years ago there was no veterinary profession in our country, but to-day the veterinarians have their own profession. There were so many people who studied veterinary science that it became a profession, and in that way they could be registered. The same applies to engineers. In regard to chiropractors we have precisely the same development. When there were only a few of them it did not matter, but now that many people practice as chiropractors and in view of the fact that many countries in the world recognize and register them as a profession, and where in those countries they are controlled by a board just like the medical practitioners, so that care is taken that not every Tom, Dick and Harry can practice as a chiropractor, we must also in this country go into the matter thoroughly.</p>

<p>The motion before the House is an application by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) for leave to introduce a Bill. Now many of us in this House have had the honour to introduce a public Bill as a private member. When we had done so, I can say to the credit of this honourable House that that permission was rarely refused. I do not say that the Bill will be accepted by this House, that is quite a different matter. But this House does not refuse permission to introduce a Bill. I simply ask this: that the hon. member should receive permission to introduce the Bill. Let us see the Bill. Let us go to a Select Committee, and then we shall have left the arena open for these hon. gentlemen who know all about the subject&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;to have their say. Let us clear the ring and let us hear what they have to say. I support the introduction of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>I also want to support the hon. member who asked for leave to introduce this Bill. I am very surprised that the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) made such a fuss about the introduction of the Bill. Mr. Speaker, this Bill is of the greatest importance. The hon. member for Durban (Central) said he would like to know what would happen to the public if the chiropractors were to receive recognition. I shall reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question. If they receive recognition and can put their own house in order, there will be fewer funerals in the country. The hon. member is a medical man and I want to ask him whether he differs from Dr. Fisher, M.C., M.B., Ch.B., F.R.C.S., who said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many authenticated cases exist where the chiropractor has cured where prolonged treatment by our profession, even by its most eminent professors, have failed. Yet the profession &#x2026; were unwilling to make any serious effort to find out what there was in chiropractice or to place the subject upon a scientific basis.</block>

<p>Here a medical man admits that it is essential for these people to receive recognition, and surely he knows what he is talking about. There are many hon. members in this House who can give evidence of the good work done by chiropractors. But there is the danger today that people infiltrate into that profession who are dangerous because they are not qualified, and then they do the work but they do not do it properly, with the result that the blame also attaches to those who are qualified. Now they simply ask for recognition. As we know, the Medical Council is opposed to these people. The correct procedure would be for the Medical Council to agree to this body being established and then they would then also to a large extent have authority to ensure that these people confine themselves to their own work. I am convinced that these people do not claim to be able to cure all kinds of diseases and complaints which do not fall within the scope of their activities. What is wrong with allowing the Bill to be read for the first time this afternoon and then being referred to a Select Committee, because it is not only the chiropractors who want it for their own protection, but there are also the trade unions which ask for it and request that these people should be recognized so that they will have the right to go to these people for certain treatment, for which they will be compensated out of their sick funds. The only request at this stage is that the Bill should be introduced, and I have no doubt that hon. members on both sides of the House, seeing that it is not a party matter, will find later that the medical men in this House will assist in placing the Bill on the Statute Book.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_beer">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE BEER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make it clear immediately that I claim no expert knowledge of the subject of chiropractic, or what is in the Bill that we have not yet seen. Unlike hon. members who spoke I am not going to plead the case for or against the chiropractor as such at this stage at all events. I am going to support the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) in his opposition to leave to introduce, but for reasons somewhat different than those advanced by him. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Col. Shearer) <span class="col_2837-2838" refersTo="page_1434"/>spoke in favour of leave to introduce, and other members followed him, and he based this on the fact that any private member should have the right to introduce a Bill. The hon. member for Kensington followed in the same strain. Well naturally, all things being equal, one would wish to give the introducer of a Bill the opportunity of having his Bill heard, but if there were a rule that leave to introduce must always be granted, then naturally it would not be necessary to have this motion before the House.</p>

<p>What are the grounds on which the House can reasonably refuse leave to introduce a Bill&#x003F; It has correctly been pointed out that the contents of the Bill are not known, except in so far as they have been indicated by the mover. It is not then on the ground of the contents. I suggest that the time for this honourable House to refuse leave to introduce a Bill is when there is good reason why the matter therein contained should not be debated by Parliament, at any rate under the circumstances obtaining at the time. Now I ask hon. members to consider this proposition from that point of view. We are not here dealing with a Bill to control for instance cabinet-makers, or watch-makers, or whatever it might be. We are dealing here with a proposal to make regulations for the conduct of an occupation which in the words of the hon. member for Durban (Central) proposes to treat the sick human being, and to treat him for gain. Now for a long time past, Parliament here, and indeed in all countries, has in its wisdom found it necessary to make provision for the proper control of all such occupations, the medical profession proper, and various auxiliary professions, and the reason why our Parliament and other Parliaments have found it necessary to do this, is because they are jealous of the health of their citizens, and secondly, because it is precisely in this whole field of activity that the greatest opportunities unfortunately exist for people in their ignorance to suffer as a result of their misplaced faith in practitioners of various sorts. That is why we have to seen fit to provide for the control of all such occupations. I dismiss, with all the respect I have for him, the argument of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City), on the ground that it would be an excellent argument, as I have said, for carpenters and watchmakers, but in the field in which he is using it, I believe, it would be out of place. I believe it is not automatic that a Bill of this sort should be given a first reading. The particular machinery which we have set up in this country for the control of all these matters, is the South African Medical and Dental Council. Now the Medical Council is there by statute, is there with a duty to keep watch over the standards of the profession, also with the duty, through the Minister of Health to give the Government advice on what ought to be done and what ought not to be done in this sphere, and in a matter of this sort, which when all is said and done, is a highly technical one&#x2014;and I say that with all respect for the confidence with which hon. members discoursed on it here in this House, a subject on which certainly I would not yet try to discourse&#x2014;in a subject of this nature it seems to me that Parliament ought to be guided by the advice of the Medical Council. The Medical Council is the proper body to decide what sort of control, if any, and what sort of recognition, if any, should be accorded to these particular practitioners. Now it can be argued of course that the Medical Council is a subordinate creature to this House and that this House need not be dictated to by it. That is true.</p>

<p>Hasn&#x2019;t the council got a vested interest&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_beer">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE BEER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the council has not got a vested interest in this thing. The hon. member does not know the composition of the council. It is not a trade union body. It is the Medical Council, as appointed by the Minister, and many of its members are not medical men. I may say in passing that of the members serving on the Medical Council, there are very few with any pecuniary interest in a matter of this sort. I think that was a somewhat unworthy suggestion. If Parliament for any reason comes to believe that the Medical Council is not discharging its functions properly, then it is for Parliament to amend, if it wishes, the legislation under which the Medical Council operates. But for so long as Parliament is satisfied, and I believe Parliament is satisfied at the moment, I believe the Minister of Health and his Department are satisfied, and for so long as the Medical Council is doing its job properly for the sake of the protection of the health of our population, and particularly the standard of practice of those who seek to look after the health of our population&#x2014;as long as the council is doing its work properly it should be on the recommendation and the advice of the council that legislation of this sort should come before this House, and failing that recommendation, and failing that advice, I believe that the House would do well to refuse to grant leave to introduce this Bill.</p>

<p>As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I do not propose at this stage at any rate to comment upon the various arguments in favour of or against chiropractic as an occupation or as a form of treatment. There is a great deal one could say in refutation of what the hon. member for Langlaagte and others had to say about it, but I do not think this is the time to do so. I urge that, unless and until the South African Medical Council sees fit to recommend the introduction of legislation of this sort, the House would do well to decline to debate a measure of this kind.</p>

<speech by="#van_nierop">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN NIEROP</person>:</from>

<p>I would just like to dispel a misapprehension which hon. members may perhaps be under in connection with previous commissions which have been appointed. <span class="col_2839-2840" refersTo="page_1435"/>I cannot quite understand the argument of the hon. member for Maitland (Dr. de Beer). He says he does not really want to speak in favour or against the matter, but I must have understood him wrongly because I gained the impression that he did not really speak in favour of the people covered by the Bill. I want to say that I have never in my life voted against the motion of an hon. member who wished to introduce a Bill, and all the arguments the hon. member submitted to the House, and all the arguments of the Medical Council, and the control they exercise over health are not relevant here. All those matters can be discussed when the Bill is before the House. All of us here are perhaps laymen in so far as the work of chiropractors is concerned. I see that since 1952 the House has been trying to ascertain whether these people should have the right to practice or not, but not in a single case have the commissions which were appointed yet come to the conclusion that they should not be allowed. Reasons were given why they should not be allowed to practice, but not in a single report was it stated that these people should not be allowed to practice. In May 1956 the last Committee submitted its report, and I would like to tell the House what the reason was which they advanced for the report they submitted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After careful consideration of the written and verbal representations made to it, your Committee came to the conclusion that in the present circumstances it would not be practicable to provide effectively in one Bill for the divergent interests of the various groups which provide supplementary health services.</block>

<p>You see, Sir, they did not say that they should not be allowed to practice, but because there were so many divergent activities they found it impossible to embody all of them in one Bill. They said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your Committee therefore recommends that the Supplementary Health Services Bill should not be continued with.</block>

<p>It was impossible to come to a conclusion in regard to the various persons who applied for recognition in terms of the Act. I served on that Committee, and in connection with the people in whose interest the request has now been made to introduce a Bill, I want to say that the Committee in fact felt that something could be said in favour of these people. But I am not going to express an opinion in favour of or against the Bill. I want to ask hon. members, however, to allow the Bill to be introduced so that a Select Committee may again investigate one aspect of the matter. Then the Medical Council and all the medical men in this House can express their opinions and say why they are opposed to it, and I am convinced that the medical advice will not be ignored. What I find peculiar is that the three medical men in this House who spoke, and who in general are concerned with the health of the people, are not in favour of the introduction of the Bill. What is the reason for it&#x003F; Perhaps the reason is that the Medical Council is not in favour of it, but we as people who have to judge in general should get rid of any prejudice against any person who may perhaps assist people in regard to their health. I think the hon. members sitting at the back over there did not state the case correctly. They stated that these people want to practice all branches of the medical profession. That is not the impression I gained on the Committee. There was no reference to these people being granted recognition to deal with the kind of diseases mentioned by the hon. member.</p>

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the House will support the motion and that this Bill will be brought before the House so that it can go to a Select Committee for investigation on its merits. Surely it is better that there should be control and a formula set up for training for this service, which, as we know, may impinge on the medical services. I think it is for Parliament to say that that service should come into being and how it should be controlled. I cannot understand how anybody can say that we should not deal with it on its merits, and I disagree with the hon. member for Maitland on that point, and I support my colleague, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Col. Shearer) when he says that we should get the Bill before the House and deal with it on its merits. After all, we did send young ex-servicemen at expense to the State to America to be trained to alleviate pain and suffering in this country, and we know there are numerous people who have come into that side of health service who have not had full training, and it is only right that there should be control and that those who are properly trained should be given some protection in their profession.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the period of one hour allotted for the debate on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill, the business under consideration was interrupted by Mr. Speaker in accordance with Standing Order No. 161.</p>
