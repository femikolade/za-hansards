<p>asked the Minister of Finance:</p>

<p>Whether there is any restriction on the amount which may be repatriated from South Africa by persons who have settled here during the past five years and who are not South African citizens; and, if so, (a) <span class="col_7251-7252" refersTo="page_0847"/>what are the maximum amounts which may be repatriated by such persons and (b) what factors are taken into account in limiting the applications for exchange.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#hopewell">

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<p>There are no restrictions, although applications for such repatriation require to be submitted to the Exchange Control Authorities and it has to be shown that:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) the funds were introduced into the Union through approved channels;</li>

<li>(ii) the applicant has resided in the Union for less than five years; and</li>

<from>Mr. HOPEWELL:</from>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#hopewell">

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<p>The basis is: Residents and non-residents. The dividing line has been extended beyond the ordinary period in other laws where domicile is regarded as three years&#x2019; residence. In this case it has been made five years&#x2019; residence.</p>

</answer>

<question by="#suzman" to="#minister_of_finance">

<from>Mrs. SUZMAN:</from>

<p>Arising out of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s reply, may I ask him whether he means continuous residence for five years, unbroken by any periods he went overseas during those five years?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<p>The ordinary rule as to <i>domicilium</i> allows for visits overseas; but if the permanent residence is here, people have to acquire a permit for permanent residence if they want to stay here and are not merely tourists. If they have got that permit and have actually resided here, apart from occasional holiday visits overseas, that is the period of domicile for ordinary purposes, and I take it that is also what will be accepted by the authorities in this case.</p>

<num>*XXII.</num>

<from>Mr. NIEMAND (for Dr. Otto)</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<p>Whether he is now in a position to state whether the Government has taken any decision in the light of the findings of the interdepartmental committee referred to by him on 14 April 1961, in regard to the future functioning of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the South African Bureau of Standards; and, if so, what is the nature of the decision.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#niemand">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>Yes. The Committee found that the services rendered to our industries and the public by the two organizations are, although closely linked, not only of a different and divergent nature, but that it is also the present tendency of similar organizations abroad to develop independently from each other in order to render better service. The Committee recommend very strongly that the position which existed before 1956 be reverted to. I have accepted this recommendation.</p>

<p>The Committee also recommended certain re-adjustments in regard to particular functions. These recommendations are still being investigated more closely and I shall decide thereon later.</p>

<p>The required draft legislation is at present being prepared for introduction during the parliamentary session next year.</p>

<p>I do not wish to address the House at length on the third reading of the Bill but I wonder whether for the clarification of the matter that was raised during the debate, the Minister will state briefly that all the A and B shares of the Corporation are held by the Government and therefore the Government has the right to appoint the directors.</p>

<p>I want to clear up a misunderstanding. The A shares are held by the Government and in respect of the A shares the Government nominates certain directors. The B shares are also held by the Government and in respect of the B shares the Government nominates the other directors. There are other shareholders as well in the form of cumulative preferent shareholders. They have no say in the appointment of directors but they do have a say in the appointment of the auditors.</p>

<p>Second Order read: House to go into Committee on Report of Select Committee on State-owned Land.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee</b>:</p>

<p>On Recommendation No. 1,</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that the release of forest reserves is not made too easy. We have in this report Item No. 1, and then of course, there are Nos. 3, 5, 6 and 12 which are all similar. They all deal with the release of forest land. I regard our forest reserves as the property of the nation and if we are going to release forest reserves at the rate at which we have been doing so in recent years, I feel that we will not be acting as proper trustees of the nation in general. I notice that most of the lands apportioned consist of small pieces of land, and I dare say the Minister will be able to explain the position. I do not want the Minister to reply on No. 1 alone; when I come to No. 12 I will ask the hon. the Minister for a more explicit reply because the ground there is of material extent. Perhaps the Minister could tell us how the Government proceeds when it supports recommendations of this nature. No. 1 recommends&#x2014;</p>

<p>I would like the Minister to inform the House why this withdrawal from demarcated forests is being allowed in this particular instance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps I should just say a few words with regard to the whole question of the withdrawal of demarcated forest property. I may say that the amount of land acquired by the Forestry Department over any period of years is on the whole in excess of the amount of land withdrawn from demarcation, so we are actually getting more land. But now we come to the question of these pieces of land which are withdrawn from demarcation from time to time. Let me put it this way: There are two types of land&#x2014;I might almost say three types &#x2014;which the Department holds. We have land which can be used for afforestation. That land we do not demarcate; we keep it, and we actually acquire more land from time to time that can be used for afforestation. Then we have certain lands which are held by the Department of Forestry for the preservation of water supplies. They are lands which can never be afforested. I have in mind, for instance, big areas of land that we hold in the district of Uniondale and Willowmore. They are held by the Department merely for the preservation of the water supplies. Two years ago my predecessor had an investigation made into those lands and the report is now in my hands. There were little corners running into private land; there were pieces of our land that were completely useless for the preservation of water supplies, because they were in any case situated below water supplies. This committee went round to try to straighten out those lands, which were undemarcated last year or the year before to get our area straight. Where there are areas which are useless for the purpose of conserving water supplies but can be put to other use, land that cannot be used for afforestation, I have no objection to those pieces being undemarcated. But I am not going to undemarcate ground which is being kept for the preservation of water supplies. Then we have large areas in the sand dune belt along the coast, and there we are chiefly occupied with the problem of fixing the moving sand there. We acquire these lands from time to time from the farmers; we buy them from them and then we do this reclamation work there. The Department of Forestry has little bits of land lying all over the place which are useless for afforestation, as in the case of this particular piece of land, and there is really no object in our holding on to them. In this case the Divisional Council requires that land for a specific purpose and it is completely useless to us for afforestation. No afforestation can take place there; it is not protecting any water supplies and it is not dune land that we are trying to reclaim. In those cases I have no objection to that land being undemarcated for a specific purpose, if the use to which the land can be put is of greater value to the State than simply to hold it. But we are very careful. We do not undemarcate without a very good reason indeed. All questions of withdrawing land from demarcation are dealt with by a Select Committee of Parliament.</p>

<p>Recommendation put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Recommendation No. 12,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the hon. the Minister will be good enough to detail to the House the circumstances under which this particular withdrawal is taking place. It is a particularly extensive piece of property of approximately 350 morgen in extent, a portion of sub-reserve (e), Kaffer Bos, of Reserve No. IV. Secondly, the withdrawal is recommended of a portion, approximately 120 morgen in extent, of sub-reserve (a), Wit Els Bos, of Reserve No. IV. The total area therefore is 370 morgen, which is quite a considerable extent. I have no doubt that the House will appreciate it if the Minister would explain why it was felt advisable to allow the withdrawal of this considerable extent of ground from our demarcated forest estate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that the owner of a property on the banks of the Wit Els River is cut off from the river by a strip, which was marked on the map and laid before the Select Committee&#x2014;a strip of land between his land and the river. It is a high embankment going a couple of hundred feet down, and it is completely useless for forestry purposes. It lies on the opposite of the river from our reserves; it is subject to fires and seeing that it is useless to us there would be no reason for us not to dispose of it. It will now be incorporated in the farm upon payment of an amount which was agreed to by the Select Committee and this person will then be able to afford protection against fire because he wants to use it for grazing. The vegetation there is what is called &#x201C;fyn bos&#x201D;, bush that is anything from three to five feet high and that is very inflammable indeed, so it is always a source of danger to us and it is completely useless to us. I can assure the hon. member that we will not get rid of any land that we can use. The withdrawal of this land from demarcation will round off our property, and it will give us considerably more safety against fire than we had before.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have no doubt that the House is very pleased that the provisions of this section have been made possible and that there will be this necessary widening of a certain street in Cape Town, but I imagine the hon. the Minister could give us a little further information with regard to the conditions that will appertain when this project is completed. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister: Will Parliament Street be permanently closed to public traffic when the scheme is completed and the Government obtains control over a section of Parliament Street?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>This is a very old project. It started before the last war and as a result of the war it could not be brought to fruition. An agreement was made by the late Mr. Clarkson with the Town Council of Cape Town that we should take Parliament Street as part of the grounds of Parliament, and in exchange for that we would give the Cape Town Municipality the old Supreme Court building which they were then going to demolish, and they were then going to broaden Bureau Street, that is the little street between the church and the old Supreme Court, to bring in the traffic to Cape Town. War broke out and it could not be brought to finality, and after the war this has been a point of discussion between us and the City Council for the last 14 years and we have now reached a certain finality. The first thing that happened was that the citizens of Cape Town and many public bodies in Cape Town objected very strongly indeed to the demolition of the old Supreme Court building and I and the Government felt, as did my predecessor before me, that we should not do that. So we then actually broke the contract in saying that we were not going to allow Cape Town to demolish one of their most beautiful old historic buildings in Cape Town. But they had to get their traffic through. So there were very protracted discussions between them and the Dutch Reformed Church, to see if the Dutch Reformed Church would be willing to sell part of the buildings attached to the Dutch Reformed Church. These are buildings which were built up against the Dutch Reformed Church subsequent to the church building being built, except for the consistory of the church, which protruded in between these buildings which had been added. After long negotiations with the Dutch Reformed Church, to which we were also a party because we would have to pay for that in lieu of our breaking the contract in not giving them the old Supreme Court building, this arrangement was come to. This finalized the matter. Certain plans were drawn up some 21 or 22 years ago of the front of Parliament with Parliament Street incorporated in our buildings, and now under this arrangement Parliament Street becomes our property and we can do with it what we like. I mentioned this to the two Select Committees who deal with these matters, the other day. The Clerk has these old plans and we are going to go into them now because I cannot say now whether the plans that were drawn up 22 years ago will be approved by Parliament to-day. Circumstances have altered. For instance, the number of motor-cars used by Members of Parliament has increased tremendously. We are making other arrangements here for parking space for Members of Parliament in the new Government Building that will be built in Parliament Street, and it might alter our plans. But it is our street and we can do with it what we like, and the Select Committee that deals with these matters will go into the matter fully and see in what way we can incorporate Parliament Street into the Houses of Parliament grounds, to what extent, in what way, etc. It is ours and it is for us to do with it what we deem to be in the best interests of Parliament. It will not be a through street any more. It becomes part of the grounds of Parliament.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder whether I might ask the hon. the Minister to take the matter a little bit further in regard to the taking over of Parliament Street. Just how far does the exchange include Parliament Street? Is it actually the street between the buildings, or is there any lien with regard to the upper portion as far as Stalplein as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>No, not Stalplein, just to the top of Parliament Street. Now the Municipality have certain plans with regard to Stalplein. They want to turn the whole of Stalplein into a park with underground parking space. We will also have parking space as I have said in this new building that is going to be constructed just opposite Parliament, where all these old buildings are which the state has acquired, with the exception of two on the corners, the one on the top corner of Parliament Street which belongs to the British Government, and <span class="col_7259-7260" refersTo="page_0851"/>the one on the bottom corner of Plein Street which belongs to a bank. All the rest has been acquired by the state and we are going to put up new Government offices there. The plans are being drawn up at present. There we will have a lot of parking space. The bottom floor will probably be all parking space.</p>

<p>The basement, or perhaps the ground floor also. The Town Council have shown us these plans very tentatively, which they have for Stalplein. I might say that they have probably shown them to us in the hope that Parliament will make a substantial contribution to the improvements on Stalplein. That would be quite an obvious deduction to make from the fact that they were so kind as to show us these plans beforehand. But nothing further has been done as yet. The plans look very nice. They have not come to us with any requests, but merely told us that this is what they envisage ought to be done with Stalplein in the future.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I think the information the hon. Minister has given us will be received with great appreciation by the public generally because, as the hon. Minister has explained there has been very long hiatus caused by circumstances beyond anybody&#x2019;s control with regard to the opening up of Bureau Street, which even from a Member of Parliament&#x2019;s point of view is a most important improvement to be put into operation as soon as possible, and from the city point of view it is naturally one of the most difficult traffic problems they have to face to-day. So the sooner this can be done, the better, and from the hon. Minister&#x2019;s statement it does appear that all difficulties with regard to that scheme have now been cleared away, and it remains for the City Council itself to proceed with the actual work.</p>

<p>As regards to the wider scheme, the future of Parliament Street itself and any other land abutting onto Parliament Street which may form under to-day&#x2019;s conditions a portion of the natural scheme which would be required to get the best value out of it, I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister who I know is most sympathetic to this type of development &#x2026;</p>

<p>On Clause 3,</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I was asked by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Plewman) yesterday whether the wording of this clause could not be simplified. I have gone into the matter and it appears that the existing Section 9 provides that references in any law to the sovereign are to be construed as reference to the reigning sovereign. This provision now lapses. Section 116 of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Bill provides as follows in subsection (1) (a)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All criminal proceedings which immediately prior to the commencement of this Act were required to be instituted in the name of the Queen, shall be instituted in the name of the republic.</block>

<p>In the place of this section now, a new section is proposed providing that criminal proceedings will be instituted in the name of the state instead of the name of the republic. This does not mean that the name of the republic in criminal proceedings cannot be used, but Clause 3 of this Bill provides what I take it will be the custom in the future, to use the words &#x201C;in the name of the state&#x201D;. Now the hon. member complains that the wording is involved and should be simplified. The legal advisers have gone into the matter and they advise that we should leave the section as it is because they say it conveys what it is purported to convey.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate the trouble that the hon. the Minister went to and that he abided by what he said yesterday that he would look into the matter. It seems to me, however, that it is not entirely satisfactory. It is this House that legislates, not the law advisers. I have the highest respect for the <span class="col_7261-7262" refersTo="page_0852"/>law advisers, but that does not do away with the fact that it is this Parliament that is responsible for legislation. It seems that at this stage there is already some change in the Constitution that actually has not yet come into operation. There is reference to this matter in the Constitution Act, as the hon. the Minister has explained, and we are in effect bringing about a change in that regard already.</p>

<p>Even if it is an alternative it is still a change in the Constitution that has not yet come into effect, although the Bill has already passed into law. I do feel, however, that on the grounds I have indicated it would be wrong of us to have a situation in which clarity is needed and is not afforded, merely because the hon. the Minister has received advice that this conveys what it is purported to convey. We are all capable of expressing views in regard to what the meaning of words are, and in order to bring the matter to an issue, because I think it is important at this stage, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the proposed new Section 9 and to substitute the following new section:<br/>&#x201C;9. Criminal proceedings shall be instituted in the name of the State.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I in turn believe that that is precisely what the section is intended to convey. Whether or not it brings about an alteration or a substitution or an alternative to what is stated in the Constitution Act, I think it should be in clear terms such as this.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill had its origin in the Senate and was passed there after certain amendments had unanimously been agreed to. As the name indicates this Bill deals with the disposal of State land but I want to explain that it does not refer to Railway land or forest land or soil erosion land or with land for settlements. It deals with other State land, general State land as it is usually called. There is nothing new in the first part of this Bill. It is a summary of many laws, as hon. members will see from the Schedule, most of which are no longer in use and are completely out of date, and the reason for the existence of many has long since disappeared. Where an Act dealt with certain land and all that land had been disposed of, the Act still remained on the Statute Book. It is the intention of my Department to consolidate all the Acts dealing with the disposal of land into one Act during the next session. As will be seen from the Schedule there are approximately 50 Acts under which State land can be disposed of. What we have done here is to summarize in one piece of legislation the different ways and the different legislation according to which State land can be disposed of and we could quite easily have introduced a consolidating measure at this stage. There are, however, three or four new points that have to be considered and I first want to do so so that when we do consolidate the provisions will be there and it will go through the usual process of consolidation. That is to say, the measure will be referred to a Select Committee and if the Select Committee is convinced that no changes are effected to existing legislation, that it is merely a consolidating measure, the Bill will go through without discussion. It is a simpler system first to introduce amendmens and to consolidate at a later stage.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the innovations in this Bill. The first new provision is that State land is indemnified against prescription, in conformity with the principle created in the Sea-shore Act of 1935 and in the Forest Act <span class="col_7263-7264" refersTo="page_0853"/>of 1941. It is not a new principle to indemnify State land against prescription. In terms of the Sea-shore Act of 1935 those sections of the beaches which belong to the State are exempt from prescription and in terms of the Forest Act of 1941 State forest land is exempt from prescription. We are now asking that other State property should also be exempt from prescription. The reason is that most of our State land is situated in large extensive parts of the country, usually mountainous areas. Many of them are practically inaccessible, many of them are never visited, and in those cases our borders can very easily be infringed upon without anybody noticing it. The position is totally different from the person who owns private property, the person who visits his property physically, and where the property is comparatively small and where he can always ensure that his neighbour does not encroach on his property. But the position is different in the case of the State. I may mention that in respect of one case with which the Select Committee has dealt, the case of a piece of land near Stellenbosch, a case in connection with which we made a concession, Parliament has given us the right to sell the land concerned because in that case we are convinced that if the Select Committee had not recommended its sale, the person would in any case have been entitled to it by virtue of prescription because as far as we can ascertain that piece of land (it is forest land) has been fenced in and used by the owner of that farm for a period of over 50 years. It lies on the other side of a mountain, away from the centre of the State land and nobody ever goes there.</p>

<p>When I introduced this new principle in the Other Place nobody raised any objection but both sides of the House felt that it should not come into immediate operation and that we should really notify the people of our intention to apply it. It was unanimously decided that we should give ten years&#x2019; notice and after ten years from now onwards nobody will have any prescriptive right to any State land by virtue of the fact that he has used that land for a period of 30 years. That was generally approved of and accepted as such.</p>

<p>The other matter in connection with which unanimity was also reached after a great deal of discussion, was that the Governor-General should have the right to delegate his powers in connection with the disposal of State land. It seems that the position at the moment is that that power rests solely in the hands of the Governor-General. There are many cases where an official has to dispose of land temporarily in a certain district. I may mention the case of drought-stricken areas where State land is made available for grazing purposes. Instructions have been issued to our officials in those areas to make that land available at a fixed rate to temporary lessees. The person gets there with stock that is on the verge of dying and he seeks grazing. If we do not have the power to delegate that right to that official, if we first have to go through the usual channels of applying to the Governor-General and waiting for his reply, the stock will be dead before they are allowed to graze on that land. As far as this aspect is concerned, we have amended the law to provide that the Governor-General may delegate his powers to a Minister, an administrator or to an official of the State. The Bill went further originally and said &#x201C;any person&#x201C;. What we had in mind with &#x201C;any person&#x201D; was a town clerk or somebody like that. However, the Other Place thought that that was going too far and we agreed to change the words &#x201C;other person&#x201D; to Government official. We are now creating the right that that power may be delegated to a Government official or to an administrator or to a Minister of the Crown&#x2014;not necessarily the Minister of Lands, because it may be Railway land, in which case the power may be delegated to the Minister of Transport.</p>

<p>We are also introducing a third new principle. In the past the position was that where the Government disposed of land in the form of a sale or donation or by means of exchange, the Minister was the person who negotiated such sale, exchange or made the donation, without accounting to Parliament or without Parliament ever getting to know about it. It is true that the Select Committee, whose reports we have just considered, dealt with certain donations, exchanges and sales and that we come to Parliament for its approval, but I am not obliged to do so. It was obligatory in the past in the Cape Province to do so, but never in Natal, the Transvaal or in the Free State. The law was subsequently changed in order to bring the position in the Cape Province in line with that in the other three provinces. I and my predecessors have often, in the case of sales, particularly to private individuals, and where it could perhaps have been contended that the Minister should not have done so on his own, voluntarily referred those cases to the Select Committee. Many matters are, therefore, submitted to the Select Committee on State land by the Minister in spite of the fact that it is not necessary for him to do so. I trust that every Minister of Lands will continue to do so in future, particularly in cases where the State and a private individual are concerned. I think it is right to do so in such cases. But as I have said Parliament has never been informed about the other transactions. We are now inserting a very democratic and wise provision, namely that at the beginning of every parliamentary session my Department will table the details of every sale of land by the State, of every exchange of land and of every donation&#x2014;that means where general land is concerned&#x2014;so that hon. members may have the opportunity of going into those details if they so wish. The Minister can then be questioned about any one of <span class="col_7265-7266" refersTo="page_0854"/>those land transactions when his Vote comes up for discussion and give his reasons. That was never done in the past but I think it is only right that Parliament should have that right of scrutiny and the right to know what has happened. I have decided that that should be inserted in the Act. Hon. members will accordingly know of every transaction that the State has negotiated. It will no longer be possible for a Minister or a Department to conclude any transaction without it becoming known to the public. All transactions must in future be submitted to Parliament and the Minister has to give an account of himself when his Vote comes up for discussion.</p>

<p>That is all that this Bill provides for. Those are practically the only three new principles that are being introduced. For the rest it is a summary of existing Acts with a view to consolidation next year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate that the hon. the Minister is anxious to get a consolidating Act on the Statute Book, and from the point of view of tidying up our Statute Book, no doubt a very good purpose will be served by the repeal of this massive legislation which is the schedule to the Bill before us. But, Mr. Speaker, that is not the issue before us. The hon. the Minister admits quite freely that he is making certain important amendments to the general law dealing with State lands as a preliminary to getting the Consolidating Bill prepared. He does not want an amending and a consolidating Bill so he comes with an amending Bill and thereafter he will come forward with a consolidating measure.</p>

<p>I want to deal broadly with one or two of the principles which the hon. the Minister has stated this morning. I would like to say at once that I do not want to deal with the question of the right of prescription, or the clause in this Bill which prevents prescription running against the State in the case of State-owned lands. That will be dealt with by other speakers, but I want to deal particularly with the right of the Governor-General to delegate authority to the Minister, and the right of the Minister, in turn, to delegate that authority on such terms and conditions as he may deem fit; that is, to sell, exchange, donate or lease any State-owned land. The hon. the Minister has referred to the report of the Select Committee on State-owned land which we discussed earlier on this morning. He said that with respect to some of the matters that went before that Select Committee, it was not really necessary for him to put those matters before the Select Committee, that he had the authority as Minister to deal with those matters. He goes on to say that he is adopting a very democratic procedure as far as this Bill is concerned by providing that all matters of that kind, after this Bill is on the Statute Book will be dealt with in this manner: they will be laid on the Table of the House and can be raised in debate when his Vote is under discussion on the Estimates, and Parliament will have a full opportunity to deal with the matter. I think that this gives us the opportunity to say something about this procedure. I think I probably speak for all hon. members in this House, from both sides, when I say that it is quite clear that that procedure is entirely ineffectual as a means of bringing before Parliament matters of great importance and upon which there is room for very much to be said both for and against in regard to a particular proposal. From our side, naturally, we would look at it from the point of view that there is much to be said, very often, in terms of criticism of some of the proposals. I accept that there is much to be said in favour of the proposals as well as there is much to be said in criticism of them. We are finding that as our Estimates go to Parliament year after year we are now reaching a stage where time is limited in respect of discussion of proposals which are of immense and pressing importance. The time for some Votes is extended and there is necessarily a cut in the time for other Votes. So Parliament itself must necessarily give priority in the time available to deal with certain matters, thus limiting and circumscribing the time that Parliament has to deal with certain other matters. Where questions of this kind are concerned, I am prepared to hazard a guess that by the time the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote comes before us and we have to deal with issues that have been laid on the Table of the House in terms of official records of the disposal of land by donation or sale or exchange, in practice the time that will be allowed will be very, very limited indeed. I therefore want to make the point that I do not believe that the disposal of State-owned land is an unimportant matter or a matter in respect of which Parliament can afford to give only passing attention.</p>

<p>The disposal of State-owned land, in my opinion, is of growing importance. With every year that goes by it becomes of greater importance. Our population can grow, development can take place; industry and commerce and all other activities can expand year by year, as I hope they will. But we cannot add to our land. We can add to commerce, we can add to industry and we can add to our population. We can extend our Railways and we can make bigger harbours. But we cannot give ourselves one extra acre of land. We can reclaim it from the sea as has been done in Cape Town, but on a very limited scale. In the main the land that we have inherited or acquired is the maximum that we can enjoy. When I look at the position in 1961 and I think of even 50 years back to the land that we had at the time of Union; land that was brought into the Union Government under the status of what is to-day called inherited Crown Land, and by other means, and when I think of what has happened in those 50 years and I try to project my thoughts forward to the position as it may be in 50 years&#x2019; time, then I see the State in the position of having divested <span class="col_7267-7268" refersTo="page_0855"/>itself of State-owned land except in respect of land ear-marked for a specific purpose such as for forestry. And that is not State-owned land in the usual sense. I approach this problem to-day, as I do on the Select Committee, from the point of view that State-owned land is very much the property of prosperity. It is for us to handle, not for us to mishandle. It is for us to bequeath to prosperity, to the future of South Africa. It is for us to leave to the future of South Africa. It is not for us to destroy it. And by destroy it I mean to lose the dominion over that land, to hand the dominion to somebody else so that the future South Africa will say &#x201C;Where is our inheritance?&#x201D; They will say &#x201C;Our forefathers in 1961 sold our land, they gave it away, they exchanged it for other land.&#x201D; The issue has been determined, we are no longer free agents</p>

<p>Eventually you reach the stage&#x2014;and this has happened repeatedly in the world&#x2014;that a generation arises which says &#x201C;We are not prepared to have this any longer; that state of affairs cannot continue; we are going to nationalize land Country after country has come to that decision for the simple reason that a generation has b&#x00E9;en born and has become adult and they no longer have their own lands.&#x201D; The disposal of the land has all been effected by the generation that preceded them. They say &#x201C;This is not fair, this is our country and this is our land&#x201D;. It is all very well for people to come along and say that they were given land or that they bought land a hundred or two hundred years ago, but it does not help the new generation. There is the famous story which is still told in Great Britain of the noble lord, when walking through his park, came across a very rough-looking character. He said to him &#x201C;What are you doing here on my land?&#x201D; The roughlooking character said &#x201C;M&#x2019;Lord, is this your land?&#x201D; The Lord said &#x201C;Yes, it certainly is my land and, what is more, I will put the police about you&#x201D;. So the other one said &#x201C;M&#x2019;Lord, how did you acquire this land?&#x201D; He said &#x201C;My great-great-grandfather fought for it in the days of William the Conqueror&#x201D;. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; said the rough character, &#x201C;I will fight you for it now&#x201D;.</p>

<p>That is the sort of rough logical argument that is applied by posterity from time to time. I want to emphasize the necessity of this Parliament viewing State-owned land as something that belongs to South Africa. It is something for us to develop and to use; it is something we should not part with except when a case has been made out in the clearest possible manner. I am the owner of freehold land in this country myself, and I am therefore prejudiced from the side of the man who owns land and wants to protect it. And I say that where the State is concerned, we have to give it exactly the same protection as we would give to our own land.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from that angle you will realize that where the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposal is that land can be donated, exchanged or sold departmentally &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. the Minister will allow me to finish my sentence he will know what I am saying. That those things can be done and only a paper laid on the Table of the House is not satisfactory. That is what I wanted to finish up by saying. The only opportunity we in Parliament will have to discuss it will be taking papers from the Table of the House at some future session and applying our minds to it, and then finding the time to discuss it. There are two things of which we do not have enough: we do not have enough land and we do not have enough time to consider these matters. It is true that the hon. the Minister does put before the Select Committee on State-owned land certain issues for determination in respect of which he has the statutory authority to determine for himself. We appreciate that. Without going into the reports that we had before us in any detail, I want to say that if hon. members will look at those they will find that we have a case here already. We have had cases year after year where forestry land which has been proclaimed through the procedure laid down by the law is withdrawn from demarcation and handed back to the Lands Department. And when the Minister of Forestry and the Minister of Lands get together there is no difference of opinion. I find, particularly in the last year or two, that we never seem to find these two Ministers quarrelling.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>They get on very well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>They seem to be two of the most amiably disposed Ministers in the Cabinet. We find them always in agreement, we have never found them in disagreement yet. They get together and the Minister of Forestry decides to give the Minister of Lands a portion of land that the Forestry Department no longer requires, such as in the case referred to by my hon. colleague this morning. The recommendation then comes before us that it shall be disposed of in such and such a manner. So the Department of Forestry hands the land over to the Department of Lands and the Minister comes before us at the Select Committee and says &#x201C;I recommend that that land be disposed of in such and such a manner&#x201D;. In this particular case the land was sold to a neighbouring farmer, for a very good reason. I am not referring to that case in any spirit of criticism at all. I approve of it. I merely say that that is the method adopted. But it does give the Select Committee an opportunity to sit down and discuss the matter objectively, not under pressure from a Whip who is watching the clock to see how much <span class="col_7269-7270" refersTo="page_0856"/>time is to be spent on the Vote. They can sit down in a Select Committee room where they have officials from the various departments concerned who know their stuff and are able to give us the information. It is quite objective, the matter can be dealt with, and if in the opinion of the Select Committee the decision is right, that is the recommendation that comes to Parliament. Then Parliament gets its opportunity to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>Here again I want to emphasize the question of time. This very morning Parliament has dealt with a report from that Select Committee on State-owned-lands. It is not time taken out of our discussion on the Estimates. It is time made available by the Government. This morning we had a full discussion and the Minister was able to deal with questions that were raised in the Select Committee by members of the Select Committee but in respect of which hon. members of this House who are not members of the Select Committee are perfectly free to raise points. And the Minister was able to handle those points and make his case. The point is that Parliament has had time to discuss this. I approve of the present system and I value it very highly. I am going to be extremely sorry if the hon. the Minister proposes to adopt the procedure he is now proposing to the House.</p>

<p>Sir, I am dealing with a matter which, as I say, I rank very highly indeed, and that is that State-owned land shall not be disposed of in so far as the law permits. And where practice has permitted it, it shall be done under the scrutiny of Parliament itself. And that is the practical scrutiny of a Select Committee which has time to spend on that particular matter. Then it should come as a substantive motion before Parliament from the Chairman of the Select Committee so that Parliament itself shall have the opportunity of dealing with the matter. If in those circumstances Parliament agrees to dispose of the land then Parliament has taken the decision and that is the last word. But when it can be done without that I am unhappy about it. The fact that the hon. the Minister himself says that it is only when there is a doubt about <span class="col_7271-7272" refersTo="page_0857"/>a case that he adopts that procedure proves the very point I am trying to make.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can take the matter no further. The hon. the Minister has made up his mind that he is going to put this Bill on the Statute Book. He knows very well that he can do that with the big vote he has behind him. But I want to say I am unhappy about this and I regret it. I do not think that an important subject like State-owned land should be dealt with like this. I would sooner we went back to the previous practice in the Cape and that no exchange or donation of State-owned land took place without it specifically being approved by the Select Committee or a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>I think we agree with certain remarks made by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) such as the importance of State land and our responsibility to protect this land and not to destroy it, so that posterity will have sufficient land. The trouble with the hon. member is, however, that he does not quite understand the position. The Minister has explained very clearly that it was customary in the past&#x2014;not obligatory&#x2014;for all the Ministers of Lands that we have ever had and the Department to refer those matters to the Select Committee. They probably did so in order to protect themselves so that they would not be criticized at a later stage and so that the public could not say at a later stage that the Minister had exercised his discretion injudiciously in exchanging land or selling or donating it. They were not legally obliged to do so. There was no legal provision compelling them to do so. There was such a legal obligation in the old Cape Act but that was not the position in Natal, the Free State and Transvaal. The hon. member ought to know that that was changed, that Parliament did not retain the former Cape Act but that it passed an Act based on the position which obtained in the other provinces, where the right to act rested in the hands of the Governor-General. I think it was a case of self protection in the past that the Department and the Minister ensured that the Select Committee scrutinized those transactions.</p>

<p>In introducing this new clause in the legislation the Minister is giving much more to Parliament than it had in the past. He now compels his Department and himself as Minister to obtain Parliamentary sanction for his actions within a month of the commencement of the sitting of the House of Assembly. He Tables the documents and it is the task and the responsibility of Members of Parliament to study those documents properly and to ascertain whether the actions of the Department and of the Minister were so <i>bona fide</i> in every respect that Parliament can sanction them. I think in view of the fact that the hon. member for South Coast is so concerned and where he quite rightly pointed out how important it was that the land should be retained for the State, he ought to thank the Minister and say to him: You are taking a step in the right direction; you are giving Parliament a better opportunity of criticizing, of approving or disapproving, when you want to alienate land. I am very sorry that the hon. member does not fully understand the present legislation. Where we are making a concession he thinks we are departing from the <i>status quo</i> and that Parliament will have less rights than it had in the past. He should make a further study of the law.</p>

<p>Clause 3 is a further example of the seriousness with which the Department and the hon. the Minister regard the retention of State land. The position used to be that land could become alienated by virtue of prescription. The hon. the Minister now says that he will no longer allow that because of the geographical nature of our country. That is land which is very rarely inspected as has been proved by the examples given by the hon. the Minister. We must prevent Crown land ever becoming lost to us or alienated as a result of prescription. That is the reason why the Minister has introduced this clause which provides that State land will not be subject to prescription. On the other hand the Minister is also very sympathetic. He notifies the people of South Africa that that will be the position ten years hence. It is quite clear to me why he does that. He <span class="col_7273-7274" refersTo="page_0858"/>does so because some people may want to effect improvements on that land, erect fences or develope it in some way or other. Now is the time for land owners of property adjacent to State land, to ascertain where the beacons are and to convince themselves that they are not encroaching on State land and that they are not developing on State land because ten years hence they will no longer be able to claim that land by virtue of prescription. That is another example of the practical way in which the Minister desires to protect the State land that has been entrusted to him. Obviously the hon. member for South Coast does not understand the legislation at all. He does not know what the present position is and he thinks that the Minister is trying to take a right away which he thinks the Select Committee has, but which is a right which the Select Committee has never had. That is all. The Minister is giving Parliament authority over himself, something which Parliament never had. He compels himself to report to Parliament so that no transactions can be concluded and no land be alienated. I think all of us ought to agree with that.</p>

<p>The only other point that I want to touch upon in this Bill is this. It is interesting to note that 38 Acts will be repealed, some of them date as far back as 1882. Because these Acts have remained on the Statute Book the Department must have been involved in a tremendous amount of unnecessary and troublesome administrative work. We are removing all the dead wood. But the fact that that is being done and that an hon. member opposite who has done valuable work on the Select Committee does not understand the legislation properly, is an indication to me that the time has arrived for the Minister to come forward with a consolidating measure as soon as the opportunity presents itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_beer">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE BEER</person>:</from>

<p>There are one or two questions we would like to ask and comments we would like to make before agreeing to the passage of this second reading. Firstly, as to the abolition of the process of prescription as it affects State land, in principle we are entirely in agreement that this should happen, but it appears from the advice I have been given that there are some concepts relating to prescription as it applies to State land which are not very easy to understand and we would be grateful if the Minister would explain it in his reply.</p>

<p>According to the representations made to us, these appear to turn really on the precise definition of what is to be regarded as State land for this purpose. I want to raise with the Minister particularly the question of land which was originally State land and now vests in other owners, but in regard to which the registration of transfer has not been effected. I am informed that this is the position affecting the streets in many of our older cities, that the blocks of land on which the buildings stand were in fact transferred long ago to the owners or the municipality or whoever it may be, but that in many cases the streets, while they vest in the municipality concerned, are still registered in the name of the State. Now the question arises whether it will be possible for prescriptions to be obtained in the future as against such land. I am advised that the position at the moment is that if a portion of a street is lost by prescription, which is the sort of thing which happens when a man builds a stoep which extends forward on to the pavement from his own property&#x2014;I am informed that when portion of a street is lost in this way the State gives a grant on that land to the local authority which in turn then transfers it to the claimant. I take it that this is a correct statement. So that the prescription effectively runs against the vested owner, the municipality, and not against the registered owner, the State. Clearly there is scope for a great deal of confusion unless it really is clear for the purpose of this Act what is intended by State land. There is a principle contained in my argument. For the reasons which the Minister himself stated, I think it is entirely reasonable to accept as a principle that State land should not be lost by prescription, but the very argument which the Minister used, and which we concede, about the difficulty of supervising State land to see that prescription does not run against it, can hardly be held to obtain when one is dealing with a local authority.</p>

<p>The other question, which I understand is purely an academic one, is the question of provincial ownership. I am told that the Provinces do not own land.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>It does in the Cape but not in the other provinces.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_beer">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE BEER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, to the extent that the provinces own land I shall be grateful if the Minister will explain this also, whether this sort of confusion can arise there as I have described in regard to the streets in local authority areas. Just purely as a question, the Minister stated that these provisions are not intended to apply to Railway land, but I am led to believe that the same sort of confusion about ownership may arise in the case of certain Railway land as could arise in the case of these streets in the cities. I am informed that there is a good deal of land being used by the Railways which is still registered in the names of the farmers on whose land the railway runs and from whom the land was acquired. Perhaps the Minister can assure us that the Act does not apply to the Railways. This is not an immediate problem, but again it is a question which could lead to confusion in future and which we would like to have clarified.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of the delegation of power from the Governor-General to various officials, I think the Minister has made out an unanswerable case that there should be some delegation. His argument as to what took place in the drought is itself convincing. <span class="col_7275-7276" refersTo="page_0859"/>However, I should be grateful if the Minister would go into a little more detail in his reply or in the Committee Stage about the sort of official to whom it is intended to delegate these powers. I am not raising a general objection to delegation, because it seems reasonable that there should be such delegation, but it would seem in view of what the hon. member for South Coast and others have said about the necessity to be very jealous of the possession of State land, it would be wise to ensure that the right to alienate State land is not placed in the hands of an official who may be subject to undue local pressure or pressures of friendship in the area where he lives. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us that the delegation will not lead to this becoming possible.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the question of parliamentary control. I think the Minister has made the position quite clear and I want to discuss, firstly, the legal position, and secondly the practical position. In regard to the legal position, of course Parliament has no rights at all in the matter at the moment, and the Minister can do what he likes and there is no provision for parliamentary supervision. Therefore, as regards the legal position there can be no doubt that the Bill is an improvement. The Minister is introducing this slender measure of parliamentary control and one can only welcome it. However, the practical position is somewhat different. Our experience in a number of directions is that the mere tabling of information regarding actions taken by Departments does not in practice give us much of an opportunity to exercise any control over it. Nevertheless, as I have said, it is to be welcomed, but I would welcome it with a far happier heart if I could have some assurance from the Minister that he does propose to continue to refer to the Select Committee at least as many of these cases as he does at present. Like the hon. member for South Coast, if it were possible and practicable&#x2014;I do not know &#x2014;to ensure that all such cases came before the Select Committee, I would like to see this happening, but I am not asking for that. I realize that is not the law and has not been the law for a long time, but I would like the Minister to indicate what his intention is for the future in regard to referring cases where land is disposed of to the Select Committee. If we can be assured that parliamentary control will in practice be as effective, or possibly more effective, than it has been in the past, then this provision also ought to be welcomed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have to agree with the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) in one respect, namely that just as a private individual is jealous of his property, so much more should the State be jealous of its property. It is a possession which will probably become smaller in future and for that reason the state must guard it jealously. I agree 100 per cent with the hon. member when he says that the state must guard its property and I am pleased that the Minister has now taken steps so that that will no longer happen for years to come. I want to explain that in laying down a period of ten years, that ten-year period does not constitute a further period within which people can acquire prescriptive lights. We are afraid of that position because as the Minister has said there are cases where prescription is coming into operation and we want to put a stop to that. It is quite right to say that the state&#x2019;s position is different from that of a private owner who is always either near or on his property and supervises it, whereas in the case of the State it is dependent on a number of officials, and not always senior officials, and the extent of its property is such that the State cannot always supervise it directly. That is why it is no more than right that the State should take special steps to guard its property. I agree with the Minister and I am glad for the concession that he has made and that he is placing more powers in the hands of the officials to act in times of drought. We often come up against that difficulty and you cannot obtain the right before a considerable period of time has elapsed. In that respect this is a very big concession&#x2014;it will be of great assistance. As the actions of Ministers in the past have shown, I think the House can rest assured that there will not be any malpractices in this respect, we are only saving time.</p>

<p>I am somewhat surprised at the hon. member for South Coast for saying what he did say in regard to the Minister&#x2019;s right to sell land, etc. The hon. member serves on the Select Committee on State land and that has been discussed not once but often and not once has he raised any objection. This question of the alienation of State land in terms of Section 1 of the amending legislation of 1922 has often been raised, but the Minister of Land prefers, in spite of that, to submit it to Parliament. Transactions of this kind crop up time and again. If the hon. member ever had any doubt about it, you would have expected him at least to have raised an objection in the Select Committee and asked that the matter be put right. The hon. member knows that the law places a tremendous responsibility on the shoulders of the Minister, and not to shoulder that responsibility alone he refers these matters to the Select Committee. We are now making other arrangements. In actual fact this is a concession as far as the rights of the Minister are concerned, because he thought that he had too much power, as has been proved by the fact that he has repeatedly referred cases to the Select Committee, where he had the power to decide, he is now going in another direction and compelling himself by law to lay it on the Table of the House. That is a concession and I think in that respect the Minister is meeting the demands of the hon. member for South Coast who wants to go still further. He wants the Select Committee to deal with it. I have nothing against that but he must admit that the Minister&#x2019;s action constitutes a concession <span class="col_7277-7278" refersTo="page_0860"/>as far as the position in the past is concerned. You must pay tribute to the Ministers of the past, Sir, and to the present Minister for the fact that they did that in the past and that they did not shoulder the tremendous responsibility which the Government had placed upon their shoulders alone, but that they continually referred those cases to the Select Committee. We welcome the new arrangement, more particularly do we welcome the fact that he is now repealing that host of legislation and consolidating it. We are also pleased that he contemplates consolidating the Land Settlement legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will confine my remarks to the principles contained in Clause 2 and 3 of the Bill. Clause 2 is designed to give the Governor-General power to dispose of certain State-land. I think the Minister will agree that very substantial powers are being vested in the hands of the Executive, that is in the name of the Governor-General, under the provisions of sub-section (1). Those powers, moreover, are being granted to dispose of land without any limitation except that they are subject alone to such limitation as is provided in sub-sections (2) and (3). Now I suggest that the powers granted under this sub-section are likely to bring about a change in parliamentary control or parliamentary practice in the near future. I am not suggesting that the Minister who now occupies the portfolio will himself do that, because I believe he values the salutary conventions which have existed of submitting these matters to the Select Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>They are not submitted except in very special cases.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with these special cases, and I am calling it a salutary convention, but I think it is more than just that. I believe it has been parliamentary practice because for as long as I have known Parliament there has always been a Standing Select Committee on Lands and it has largely dealt with the disposal of State Land. I think the Minister merely makes a debating point when he says that this practice is confined to doubtful or difficult cases. That is how it might well be dealt with, but because the practice is there Ministers will be careful to ensure that any case which might be subject to criticism will not be dealt with in any other way but will go through this machine which provides a form of parliamentary control at the stage of proposal. That is the significant importance of the matter, that that form of control to-day takes place at the stage of proposal. Difficulties and criticism can therefore be raised before any final action is taken. But as Clause 2 now reads it gives very substantial powers to the Executive to deal with State land.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that it has been the practice of the Government to do it and that it is now being enshrined in legislation, but that practice has been subject to limitations in the past. There is however nothing in this clause which says that doubtful or difficult cases will not be disposed of by the Governor-General in terms of these statutory powers which are now being designedly granted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>But the statutory powers are contained in the previous Statutes and they are merely being repeated here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But this is a general provision. If they are specific powers in other Statutes&#x2014;and I would not like to deal with the matter because I do not know what specific provisions there are, and there might be good reason for them&#x2014;but this is a general provision and not specific. I do not think it is difficult to predict that more and more cases of disposal will take place in terms of this general provision and fewer and fewer will be submitted to the Select Committee and so ensuring parliamentary control at the stage of proposal. As regards the provisions of subsection (4), whilst on the face of them they appear to be safe, there is of course nothing so dangerous as a safeguard which is not really safe, and this is not a safeguard which is safe because by the time the matter reaches Parliament action will already have been taken. Parliament will then deal with it at the stage when the transaction has long been concluded and not at the stage when action is proposed to be taken and when it can be subject to comment and criticism, which has a great value, as the hon. the Minister will know because he has sat on this side of the House and I am sure he has made valuable contributions to ensure that what was done was done correctly. Therefore I think the Minister, in putting the matter as he does, is overlooking the fact that by enshrining rights and powers in the Governor-General without any other sort of limitation to preserve parliamentary control except that provided in sub-section (4), will lead to sub-section (4) being the only way in which the matter will ultimately come to the notice of Parliament.</p>

<p>I come then to the principles contained in Clause 3, which says that State land shall not be subject to prescription. As I understood the Minister, he justified this provision on the ground that it would safeguard State land. If that is so, what he omitted to tell us is that that safeguarding is taking place at the expense of denying long-standing legal rights to individuals. That is the crux of this position. Therefore I ask the Minister why it is introduced at this stage? The justification he offers about the difficulty of exercising supervision over Crown land or State lands, is not wholly tenable. Methods of transport and of communications have improved considerably in the last <span class="col_7279-7280" refersTo="page_0861"/>ten or 20 years and the country has become smaller, not bigger, and consequently the supervision by a host of State officials is far easier to-day than it was before. The Minister justifies it by qouting one isolated case in which there was State land which was difficult of access and which apparently the Crown ultimately lost through prescription to some neighbouring person. Well, is that not precisely what the law was designed to ensure? Here was a piece of land not being used by the State. Someone in good faith deals with it, and the law is designed to ensure that there will be some form of protection to this person for having done what he did. The law of prescription is very specific. What the person does must be done openly and in good faith and without any secrecy. Surely the case the hon. the Minister quotes is the very case against the withdrawal of this prescriptive right which is now proposed in this clause. But the Minister made no reference to the fact that our laws of prescritption provide for interruption. Prescription can be interrupted from time to time, and therefore whatever duty State officials had to do in the past to protect the interests of the State is now simply being taken away because now they know that they need not worry about it. The interruption of prescription was a very important part of our law of prescription, and it had a very significant purpose. Sir, the Minister says that this provision introduces no new principle. I think what the Minister really meant was that it introduces no new legislative policy, because the fact is that what we are doing away with here and are denying to individuals is a longstanding legal right which individuals have. I, and I believe others on this side, still believe that the rights of the individual count for more than the rights of the community and that the rights of the community count for more than the rights of the State. I personally will always try to ensure that the rights of the individual are protected. As I have indicated, the law of prescription makes the position very clear. There can be no acquisitive prescription in secrecy; it must be done openly and in good faith and there is no doubt about it that the period of 30 years is very onerous on the man who in good faith and openly did something like this, because 30 years&#x2019; work might be lost to him, and all the improvements he made on the land will become a nullity. Our common law provides for two forms of prescription, acquisitive prescription and extinctive prescription. Both these forms have long been enshrined in our Statute law. Acquisitive prescription was originally 33&#x2153; years, but by statutory provision it was made 30 years. Apart from what I have indicated, this is unsatisfactory legislation in a different direction also. The Prescription Act of 1943 deals with the whole subject of prescription and I would like to read two sections of it. Section 2, which deals with acquisitive prescription, says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Acquisitive prescription is the acquisition of ownership by the possession of another person&#x2019;s movable or immovable property or the use of a servitude in respect of immovable property, continuously for 30 years <i>nec vi, nec clam, nec precario</i>.</block>

<p>Sub-section (2) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As soon as the period of 30 years has elapsed, such possession or user shall <i>ipso jure</i> become the owner of the property or the servitude, as the case may be.</block>

<p>The provision is perfectly clear. It cannot be done by force; it must be done openly, and it must be completely <i>bona fide</i>. Section 13 of this Act says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Act binds the Crown: Provided that acquisitive prescription shall not run against the Crown unless the property concerned is capable of being alienated by the Government and of being owned by a private person.</block>

<p>Those were restrictive provisions and if this type of legislation has to stand, I ask the hon. the Minister why he does not amend the Prescription Act itself? How is anybody going to find out what the law is in regard to State land? It seems to me a most inappropriate provision, the prohibition against acquisitive prescription, in an Act which is going to be known as the &#x201C;State Land Disposal Act&#x201D;. Because &#x201C;disposal&#x201D; is a complete contradiction in terms; since this clause relates to the prevention of disposal. It is such a contradiction in terms that I think the Minister should give reconsideration to the matter. If he feels that a provision of this nature, objectionable as it is from my point of view in so far as it infringes upon the rights of the individual, is necessary, then why not put it into the provisions of the Statute where everybody will look for it and be able to find it? Put it into the Prescription Act where it can be found and can be known.</p>

<p>Finally, I understood the hon. the Minister to say that this provision, because it gives ten years&#x2019; warning that there will be no more prescription of State land&#x2014;in other words, that Sections 2 and 13 of the Prescription Act would cease to operate in so far as State or Crown land is concerned&#x2014;found &#x201C;algemene byval&#x201D; in the Other Place. Well, obviously the Minister was there, I was not; but looking at Hansard it seems that there was a vote against the whole of the Bill and that certainly does not indicate that it found &#x201C;algemene byval&#x201D; on both sides of the House; that there was general acceptance or general approval of the provision. It seems to me that the hon. the Minister is in error in feeling that there was general acceptance of this provision in the Other Place. Sir, I do not want to take the matter further. It is, of course, within the power of the State to deal with the matter. But, speaking for myself, I feel that there <span class="col_7281-7282" refersTo="page_0862"/>is a great obligation on Parliament to preserve the rights of the individual. In fact, I would like to reiterate the old precept that says that the cost of freedom is eternal vigilance on the part of the lawmaker. This is a case where I think the lawmaker should be vigilant and should not remove the rights of the individual.</p>

<p>I notice that the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) is here, but he made his usual outburst against this side of the House and his speech as usual was full of inaccuracies. He claimed that we had not studied this Bill. I claim that he has not done so. He said that 38 Acts were being repealed by this measure, which is not the case. Only 31 are being repealed. I doubt whether he has studied any of the Acts which are to be repealed, and I think the hon. member should be careful in making attacks upon this side of the House. After all, we are the official Opposition and it is our duty to watch all legislation in the interests of the general public. This Act transgresses against our fundamental national principles and it seeks to transfer to the Government the right to land which was generally considered to belong to the people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, we did so this morning in a particular report that came before Parliament. Rather than extending the powers to transfer land I would prefer to see the power of the Government to transfer land restricted. I feel that the Minister has not made out a case for the so-called urgent necessity of this legislation, especially since we know that the consolidation of our Land Act is under consideration. I ask the Minister what can go wrong if this Bill is not put through the House at present. What immediate powers does the Minister seek that he does not possess at present? The Minister says that they have all the necessary powers as regards the transfer of land. On an occasion like this I would like to appeal to the Minister for a further limitation of Government powers. I did not like the delegation of powers that took place in the past. A previous Minister of Lands provided for farmers to graze their stock in the Kalahari Gemsbok Reserve, regardless of the welfare of the game in that reserve. We hear a great deal about the numbers of domesticated animals that die but we never hear of the numbers of our precious game that is fast disappearing from this country and for the feeding of which no provision can be made. I will never forget how farmers were let loose in the Gemsbok Kalahari Reserve at a time when the preservation of our game was vital. This was the only place where game from the surrounding areas and South West Africa were able to congregate for their self-preservation. It is powers of that nature that I feel will be extended by passing legislation of this nature, and I would much rather see a consolidated measure brought before the House. We would prefer to probe more deeply into the implications of this Bill. As I said, 31 Acts of Parliament are being repealed by this measure and eight are being amended. It is very difficult for a Member of Parliament at short notice to study the implications of all that legislation. We take it that the Government&#x2019;s legal advisers are very careful, we know that mistakes are often made; we know how often legislation has to come back to this House for amendment in the interests of the State. The Minister can explain to us in his reply why these powers are now being sought under this Bill when the Government already has these powers. The Minister says that the Minister can give away land to anybody and that he may delegate that authority to anybody to give it away without even obtaining the sanction of Parliament. All that is required is a report to Parliament that these things have already been carried out. I think that the public in general would be shocked if they knew that these rights existed, but if they did exist Governments have always been careful; they have come to Parliament and they have had a Select Committee on Lands to go care <span class="col_7283-7284" refersTo="page_0863"/>fully into each case, and there have always been certain sarefguards. Surely the Minister is not going to tell us that these provisions have just been a blind; that Crown Land can be given away now without coining to Parliament. I should like to know how much land the Government has given away. I had no idea that the Government could part with our land without obtaining the sanction of Parliament. It is true that the papers are laid on the Table, but generally those documents are not studied by Members of Parliament because any amount of stuff is laid on the Table. Gifts of land could be made without being noticed by the Press or anybody else, and I would appeal to the Minister to withdraw this legislation, not to force it through Parliament at this stage. Nothing can really go wrong because the Minister says that they have the necessary powers. As far as the acquisition of ground by prescription is concerned, I would remind the Minister that it is not so easy to obtain ground by prescription. The person concerned has to obtain title; he has to have a survey made and he has to satisfy the Surveyor-General and obtain title to ground acquired by prescription before he can own it. It is not easy to acquire ground by prescription. Reference has been made to difficulties in connection with the intrusion on our streets. I doubt whether even those difficulties are insurmountable. I doubt whether this measure is going to alleviate that position in any way. I would appreciate it if the Minister would tell us what definite difficulties the State is faced with that makes it essential to introduce legislation of this nature in the dying days of our present Parliament. I think that we should have more notice of a Bill of this nature, so that its implications can be more deeply studied, especially in view of the fact that the ownership of land is regarded as sacred by the whole nation. We continually hear hon. members talking about the land hunger. People crave for land ownership and when that land is State-owned, they want to be assured that its ownership is safeguarded in every possible way. We would like the Minister to tell us whether there is any land which the Government has lost in recent years or may lose if this Bill is not passed in the near future. I have no knowledge of any immediate danger which makes it necessary for this Bill to be rushed through Parliament at this stage. I regard this as rush legislation which is tampering with fundamental rights and principles in our country.</p>

<p>I am tempted to say that when the hon. Uncle Tom, the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) started to speak, one wondered whether he was talking to the correct Bill. I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition in connection with this, measure. Throughout the years the main objection which the Opposition has had against the legislation that has been passed has been that Parliament was not given sufficient responsibility or that Ministers did not report in sufficient detail to the House of Assembly in respect of their actions. In this case, where the Minister himself is introducing an amending Bill in which he binds himself by way of legislation to table a report in both Houses of Parliament within the first month of a parliamentary session on transactions that have taken place in connection with the disposal of State land during the preceding calendar year, the Opposition objects to that. I simply cannot understand that. I do not think the Opposition has made out a case why this Bill should be withdrawn or how it can be alleged that this Bill is being rushed through the dying hours of this old order of Parliament. That is not the position.</p>

<p>The Bill has been lying there for a long time and anyone interested could have studied it. I do not follow the argument of the hon. member for Albany that documents that are tabled pass unnoticed unless the Press take note of them. We know what the procedure is every day when we commence, when reports and papers are tabled. It may be that we are not interested in all the reports and papers that are tabled, but surely the hon. member and other members who are interested in this matter will note the fact that documents are tabled to-day in which a report is made to Parliament concerning transactions by the State, the Minister and the Governor-General (in future the State President) in respect of the disposal of State land. Those documents are at the disposal of anybody who is interested in them. I merely rose to say that I did not think the hon. member for Albany or the Opposition have made out a case in support of their objection, What reasons did they advance? Is the reason why they do not welcome this Bill not simply the fact that the Governor-General may delegate the power to act to the Minister? Everybody who understands the agricultural position in South Africa ought to welcome it that it will be possible in future to act quicker. If State land is available and thousands of head of stock are dying, we welcome the fact that faster action can now be taken; that the Governor-General may authorize the Minister to act, and that the Minister may even authorize an official in the Department to make that land available so that the stock will be saved. Is that what they are objecting against? We should all assist in that. The other principle contained in this Bill, to my mind, is simply the fact that in future a report will be submitted to Parliament as to how State land has been disposed of. We welcome this Bill, and I think agriculture in general will welcome the acceptance of this Bill.</p>

<p>In connection with Clause <span class="col_7285-7286" refersTo="page_0864"/>3, I would like to support the hon. member for Maitland (Dr. de Beer) in his request for clarity with regard to the application of this prescriptive right over certain State-owned land such as streets. Many of our townships were originally made out on Crown land. The erven or lots were disposed of by Crown grants, but not the streets, and they are to-day still registered in the name of the State or in the name of the Crown. Those streets are to-day vested in local authorities. It is not clear whether Clause 3 will be applicable in that case. It is not clear whether a private individual whose property, perhaps, encroaches on a street, will have the right to obtain that portion of the street by prescriptive right or not. It is not clear whether, owing to the fact that the streets now vest in local authorities, we will be able to retain the prescriptive right and thus obtain that portion of the street under the prescriptive laws of this country. I would like that point cleared up, because there is considerable doubt, and the survey profession would like to know where they stand.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>As regards the point which the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) and Maitland (Dr. de Beer) have raised, the position is that in those cases where streets are still registered as being the property of the State, it will not be possible to acquire it by way of prescription.</p>

<p>At the outset I want to say a few words on the question of prescription. I think that I have made it clear, but that it is apparently not quite understood, that these prescriptions will only apply in the case of a person who, ten years after the passing of this legislation, has had unhindered physical possession of the land concerned for 30 years. If in ten years time he can prove that he has occupied the land for 30 years, he will be given that land, but after ten years the right of prescription will no longer apply. That is what is meant by the reference to ten years. To a large extent I agree with the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) that we must be jealous of the State&#x2019;s property. If the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) will just give me an opportunity, I want to tell the hon. member for South Coast that I agree with him about something; I do not always agree with him, but when I agree with him about something, then I should like him to know it. I agree with him that any State or Government should be jealous of the land which it owns. It should exercise the greatest caution in respect of that land and it should not dispose of that land unless it is in the interests of the nation. In that respect I agree with him, but then it is self-contradictory to say that we should allow prescription. Because what is prescription? Prescription merely means that someone acquires property or a right of servitude to someone else&#x2019;s land; it means that he acquires the rights of ownership without paying for those rights and without it being in some one else&#x2019;s interests that that land should be taken from him and without it being in the interests of the State or the public as a whole that that should happen. These are two mutually contradictory arguments. On the one hand the hon. member for South Coast says that we should take all sorts of steps to make the alienation of State land more difficult and his colleague rises and says that we should not take these steps which we are taking with a view to making such alienation more difficult; that we should make it easier. Is the hon. member over there correct or is the hon. member for South Coast correct? I agree with the hon. member for South Coast. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Plewman) says that as regards these prescriptions his side of the House believes that the rights of the individual are of far greater importance than the rights of the State. Very well; if that is the policy of his side of the House, why was that policy not upheld in the two previous instances? It was his party which took away the right of prescription in the sea-shore legislation; it was his party which took away the right of prescription in the Forest Act. At that time it was in order; at that time he did not say: &#x201C;We on this side of the House consider that the individual&#x2019;s right of prescription is more important than that of the State.&#x201D;</p>

What is the difference between State land and forest land except that we are a little more concerned about State land than we are about forest land, as the hon. member has said&#x2014;and perhaps he is correct in that regard as well.</p>

<p>One is just as little aware of what is forest land as one is of what is State land. When there is land in an area which belongs to the State, the public does not know whether that land is forest land or State land, except in those cases where trees are already growing on that land, but in other cases when the land is being held by the Department of Forestry for water conservation and drift sand control purposes they do not know whether it is forest land or State land, and what difference would it make if they did know? No, one must be logical. When their party introduced these measures it was quite correct at that time. Then we did not have this holy indignation or these subtle arguments from the hon. member for Johannesburg (North).</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>No. I might just tell the hon. member for Maitland that the Cape Provincial Council which is the only one to be affected, has asked me to make the prescription provisions applicable to their land as well. The Transvaal, Natal and the Free State have not asked for it because in those provinces all provincial property is registered in the name of the State. In the Cape that has not been done. Consequently land can only be acquired by means of prescription in the Cape in the case of land belonging to a provincial council. I have told them that the solution is to fall into line with the other provinces of South Africa and to have their provincial property registered in the name of the State and not in their own name.</p>

<p>The only other point which has been discussed is the question whether certain powers should be delegated to Ministers or to Administrators or to officials. For some reason or another hon. members have tried to create the impression that this legislation gives powers to the Minister which he never had before. The hon. member for Albany was nearly petrified with fright at the powers which the State is now taking for itself; the hon. member for South Coast has also referred to the new powers which the State is taking. This Bill does not give the State or the Minister one single power which they do not already possess.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no. I shall discuss that point presently and also the reasons. As far as the delegation of powers is concerned, hon. members say we must not allow it. We must leave the position unchanged. The be practical, what difference does it make whether the Governor-General delegates that power to a Minister or the Minister signs an Exco for the Governor-General to sign. There is really no difference. Consequently, as far as the delegation of powers to the Minister is concerned, there is in fact no practical difference between the provisions of this measure and the present position. But under this Bill I am now being given the power to delegate certain powers to officials of my Department and I can delegate whatever powers I choose. If we have had one, we have had dozens of such cases over the past six months as a result of the drought. We have large tracts of State land around Vaalharts, in the Northern Transvaal and elsewhere; the farmers approach us and ask for grazing for their stock. I have now told the local officials: You can lease grazing on the following basis. I want to have the right to give the officials that power. I do not want the official&#x2019;s recommendation to have come to me and to go to the Governor-General and by the time the authorization reaches the official, the farmer&#x2019;s stock have probably died. In any case it is ridiculous to have to send an Exco to the Governor-General in the case of a man who wants a month&#x2019;s grazing for 30 or 40 head of stock. It is in this type of case that I want to delegate the necessary power to local officials. I can tell the officials exactly what power I am delegating to them; I do not give them <i>carte blanche</i>; I give them certain specific powers. I can tell the official: &#x201C;You have the right to lease that grazing at so much per head to the people you are convinced have suffered as a result of the drought&#x201D;. Such an official will then have no further powers.</p>

<p>Nonsense. What happens in practice is that such an official recommends to the head of the Department that grazing should be granted and eventually the Department says: &#x201C;Very well.&#x201D; The whole machinery must then be put in motion in order to obtain the Governor-General&#x2019;s approval. It is a ridiculous statement which the hon. member has now made. That is the reason why it is necessary to facilitate this work, namely in order to eliminate unnecessary expense and to eliminate a whole series of officials who must give their attention to matters which are of a trivial nature and which can be disposed of locally. These matters can be far better dealt with locally than they can by the head office.</p>

<p>If I want to, yes. But if I want to, I can do so now as well.</p>

<p>The next point related to the disposal of this land. The hon. member for South Coast wants the Select Committee to approve of every proposal to dispose of State land. Does he know what that will entail? He said that they <span class="col_7289-7290" refersTo="page_0866"/>could then give their full attention to the matter. Sir, if we were to have three Select Committees and they were all to sit throughout the Session, they would still not be able to examine and dispose of the hundreds of minor transactions. There are hundreds of these transactions which for the most part are of a very trivial nature. There are transactions between us and the Department of Public Works and there are transactions in which the municipalities approach us because they would like to exchange one plot for another plot. The other day I had to sign the documents relating to a plot which I think was 16 square yards in extent. One or other municipality wanted to buy that piece of land in order to widen one or other road. The hon. member now wants such a matter to be submitted to Parliament and then to go through the Select Committee procedure. It will take a year before we can dispose of the land. It will hold up and delay the work. Is that practical? It will only result in tremendous delays. A city council approached us and wants a piece of land for some public purpose or other&#x2014;perhaps for the erection of office buildings or the widening of a street. There are a hundred and one things in respect of which city councils approach us and ask to be able to purchase land. The hon. member now wants us to tell them: Very well, we shall recommend it, but you must now wait a year until the Select Committee has considered the matter. That is completely unpractical. It has always been unpractical. No one has ever objected to this procedure before. Suddenly a fuss is made. Now these are new powers which I want to take for myself. No, these are not new powers. These are powers which already exist. All that we are doing in this Bill is that we are taking the powers for which other laws provide and we are placing them in one law so that we can introduce a consolidating measure next year. We are not derogating from one single right of Parliament. Certain hon. members have also said it is after all the custom to refer such matters to the Select Committee. That is not so. A very, very small percentage of these matters are referred to the Select Committee. It rests in the discretion of the Minister. If he has a matter which he regards as a difficult matter or which will expose him to criticism and in respect of which he is running the risk of acting unfairly, then he has the right to say that the matter should be referred to the Select Committee and that the Select Committe must give its decision. Any sensible Minister will also continue to do so in future. It is quite correct that he should do so. It protects both himself and his Department, but we cannot refer to the Select Committee the 101 everyday transactions, the minor land transactions, the sales of little pieces of surplus land, small corners, etc. It would be ridiculous. No Select Committee would be able to give its attention to all these small transactions and if they must all be referred to a Select Committee, it will simply mean that it will become nothing but a rubber stamp and will only do what the officials tell it to do. It is quite impossible for the Select Committee to give its attention to all these matters. It would cause tremendous delays and would hamper development, and it is completely unpractical to make such a proposal. The machinery which we have used ever since Union has shown that it is sound and we want to retain it unchanged.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>I just want to say a few words about the national parks. I think that we can justifiably say that in our national parks we in South Africa have an asset which is to be found in few other countries of the world These are of great value to South Africa and not only to South Africa but to all lovers of wild life throughout the world, and our national parks are performing an extremely important function as regards the preservation of wild life. The wild life of South Africa has been reduced greatly and is being reduced still further. It can also justifiably be said that if one wants to develop a country and one wants to farm, one cannot farm with wild animals. But precisely because the wild animals have had to give way for that reason before the so-called advantages of civilisation, it is also most necessary that those of us who are civilised should take measures to preserve all our various types of wild life in one or other area and that we should protect that wild life so that the various types of wild life will be preserved for future generations. The importance of our national parks and other game reserves here in the Union is becoming greater than ever because, as a result of the new dispensation which is arising elsewhere in Africa, there is not much hope that the wild life will be preserved. Hon. members also know of course what is happening in Tanganyika at the moment. The magnificent Serengetti plains and other areas are being cleaned out; the raids have become practically uncontrollable and we are afraid that when these areas are transferred to the control of the Natives, the remaining wild life will be given short shrift. When one goes to Kenya which was famous throughout the world both for its many types of wild animals and for their numbers, we find that practically the same process is taking place and that the number of wild animals has been reduced amazingly and that they are threatened with complete extinction. In the Congo, particularly in the Ruanda Urundi area where there were wonderful game reserves, the Natives are practically wiping out all wild animal life and I think it will not be long before the Union of South Africa will be the only country which is still preserving its wild life for future generations on a scientific basis and for the benefit of those people who love wild life. As a result of the eradication of wild life elsewhere in Africa, our game reserves are becoming of steadily greater importance both to us in the Union and to the rest of the world. They are of course also a very great asset to us in South Africa in that they attract people from elsewhere in the world to come and see our treasures and when they come and see how we are preserving this wealth of the past for future generations, we are also able to show the rest of the world the measure of civilization which exists here in South Africa as compared with many other parts of Africa.</p>

<p>The National Parks Board only has parks in two provinces, namely, the Cape Province and the Transvaal, while the Natal Provincial Administration has various game reserves and the Free State has at least one important game reserve which was recently established, namely, the Pretorius game reserve, which offers a home particularly to those wild animals which are indigenous to the Free State, for example, the black wildebeest. Here the types of buck which were on the point of eradication will be preserved for the future. In the Cape we have the Gemsbok Park in the Kalahari Desert which is unique, and which offers a refuge to gemsbokke (Gazelles), as well as springboks, particularly the Kalahari springbok which is different from the Karoo springbok. Then we also have the Bontebok Park, which was first situated in the Bredasdorp district, but which has now been transferred to Swellendam, where the terrein is more suitable, and which, I am glad to say, is really very suitable for the Bontebok, and where they are also multiplying satisfactorily. Then, in the Cape, we also have the Addo Park, where we have the Addo elephants which are an interesting type because they are probably the smallest elephants in Africa. Strangely enough, just nearby are the Knysna forests where there are still a small number of the Knysna elephants and although these areas are very close to one another the Knysna elephant is different in that it in turn is the largest elephant in the world. But they are very few in number and although they are protected, I am sorry to say that they are apparently dying out. These are the parks which we have in the Cape. In the Transvaal we have of course the biggest and the most important, the Kruger National Park, and it is from the Kruger National Park that, we can say, all the other national parks have sprung. The late Mr. Piet Grobler extended the old Sabie Park which the late President Kruger established as a game reserve, by making it four or five times its former size, and I think that we and future generations will always be very grateful for the far-sightedness of the late Mr. Grobler because it is due to him that the enormous wealth of game which is to be found in the Transvaal lowveld has been preserved for future generations.</p>

<p>These are the parks which fall under the Parks Board, and that Board is functioning under an Act which is already comparatively old. It has now become necessary to overhaul the Act to a certain extent. The Bill now <span class="col_7293-7294" refersTo="page_0868"/>before us is based on the years of experience of the Parks Board and those concerned with the parks, and I think that we are quite justified in saying that both as regards its general management and administration and its efforts to preserve our wild life, our Parks Board has fulfilled a great task and has done wonderful work and that we owe it the highest praise. We anticipate that it will continue with its wonderful work in the future. The question is continuously arising as to what extent facilities should be provided in the national parks: Whether the accommodation should be of a luxurious nature or whether it should be of a more primitive nature in keeping with the conditions which prevailed when people first entered those areas. I think that the Parks Board has now adopted a middle way which has given everyone a very large measure of satisfaction. From time to time applications have been submitted to me for permission to erect luxury hotels in the national parks, and especially the Kruger National Park. But I have put my foot down and have said that if people want to live in luxury hotels, those hotels must be outside the parks and they can go from there to see the game. On the other hand I, and the Board has agreed with me, have ensured that the accommodation provided in the parks is not primitive but that there is a certain or a large measure of comfort, but that the accommodation provided fits in with the surroundings and the type of life that one wants to live in a national park. I think that the middle way which has been adopted also gives general satisfaction.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, after these few introductory remarks I want to turn to the Bill itself and to discuss one or two of the main provisions. The first amendment is to Section 3 of the principal Act which provides that the powers of the provincial councils in respect of the protection of fish and game, the eradication of noxious weeds and vermin, the registration and control of dogs and also the control and management of places upon state-owned land will not be applicable within the parks themselves. The Parks Board lays down its own rules which are in fact based on the provisions of the Transvaal provincial ordinance dealing with wild life but which have been adjusted to meet the peculiar circumstances of the parks themselves. We now want to add certain other provincial council powers which will not be applicable to the game reserves, but which the board will have the power to apply itself. There is for example the licensing of hunting and fishing, the sale of game, the picking and sale of veld flowers, questions such as entertainment tax, the preservation of plants and animals, the running of libraries which we want to establish in our game reserves, museums, herbariums, etc., and the licensing of and control over the places of entertainment and recreation. We do not want these powers which the provincial councils have and which are of general application to be applicable in the parks because we feel that the Parks Board can arrange these matters better on its own.</p>

<p>Section 4 (1) provides that land which forms part of a national park can only be alienated under the authority of an Act of Parliament. We now propose that it will not be necessary when we alienate land forming part of a national Park to introduce a Bill into Parliament. Instead both Houses of Parliament will have to pass a resolution. Land is often exchanged. If hon. members will look at the western border of the Kruger National Park as it is shown on the maps, they will see that the border does not run in a straight line or anything approaching a straight line. There are points which project into private land. There are islands of private land, particularly along the Olifants River. There are also peninsulas of private land which are almost completely encircled by land belonging to the National Parks Board. From time to time the State buys such farms and we then exchange land with the Parks Board for a wedge of their land which projects into private land. The State exchanges such land for land of equal value and equal size. Hon. members will remember that two years ago we introduced such a Bill into Parliament. We bought a large farm and in that case there was also a tongue of land belonging to the Parks Board which projected into private land. We then arranged an exchange with the Board. We had to introduce legislation for that purpose in this House. We now propose that in future we shall not do so by means of legislation, but that instead of introducing a Bill dealing with such exchanges, we shall obtain approval by means of a motion in this House and a motion in the Senate. Only when the motion has been approved by both Houses will such a transaction be valid.</p>

<p>Then there is a whole series of small amendments, such as the amendment contained in Clause 5 for example whereby the word &#x201C;maintenance&#x201D; is inserted into the functions of the Parks Board. One of the main functions of the Parks Board is the maintenance of certain things. There are certain things such as the building of dams for which the existing legislation does not really give authority. The Parks Board has done these things, and this word is now being inserted merely to obtain clarity as far as the legislation is concerned.</p>

<p>Another provision lays down that the membership of the Parks Board will now be increased from ten to 12. Flowing from that we are proposing the deletion of the words &#x201C;in which any park is situated&#x201D;. The existing legislation provides that the members of the Parks Board shall be people who are representative of various bodies and of the provincial administrations of those provinces in which a national park is situated. In other words, the provincial administrations of the Free State and Natal have no members on the Parks Board. We are now increasing the membership from ten to 12 and we shall allocate the <span class="col_7295-7296" refersTo="page_0869"/>two new members to the provincial administrations of Natal and the Free State. We are also providing that the new members will be an Administrator or another member of the executive committee or a member of the provincial council selected on the advice of the executive committee of the province concerned.</p>

<p>Can he also be a member of the Provincial Council?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>He can also be a member of the Provincial Council. We also have to insert another amendment to the effect that an officer of a Provincial Council may not be nominated, and we are also laying down that for the purpose of this Bill an Administrator, a Member of the Executive Committee or a Member of the Provincial Council will not be regarded as an officer.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Department of Lands has always provided the secretary of the Parks Board. We feel that the Board now has sufficient staff to make it unnecessary for it to be dependent any longer on the Department of Lands for a secretary and it can appoint its own secretary.</p>

<p>Clause 6 merely deals with the period of office of members of the Parks Board. When we had ten members and they were appointed for five years, two members retired annually and two new ones were appointed. If we have 12 and the period is five years, we shall not be able to do so. We now propose that that provision should be omitted and we are merely laying down that the period of office of a member will remain unchanged, namely five years. When his five years expires, he will retire. The quorum is being increased from three to four.</p>

<p>I have referred to the question of dams which are dealt with in Clause 8. They also fall under the provisions relating to control, management and maintenance. As I have said, we are doing so because although we have always constructed dams, it was doubtful whether we had the right to do so.</p>

<p>Clause 8 (b) is important. The principal Act authorizes the Board <i>inter alia</i> to let sites for the erection of hotels and to make provision whereby the Board itself can provide accommodation, food and refreshments and the other requirements of visitors; but it lays down that liquor cannot be sold in a park. What we now want to do is to bring the Parks Board under the ordinary law of the land as far as the sale of liquor is concerned. We feel that there are many people who use the eating places in the parks and who want something to drink, but they cannot get it there. People who want to drink in the parks take their own liquor with them. I think that most of us do so when we go to the parks. There is therefore no reason why we should not be able to sell liquor in the parks under the control of the Parks Board. This is not being entrusted to a private person, but will be done under the control of the Parks Board and subject to the conditions laid down by the Parks Board. They may not for example transfer a licence which they hold to someone else. Because everything sold in the parks is exempt from licence duties, the liquor which they sell will also be exempt from licence duties and will not be subject to the payment of licence fees.</p>

<p>Another important point is this. Other Departments have approached us and asked us to insert this provision. The Parks Board of South Africa through our national parks has to deal with approximately 500 miles of our international borders. These are borders between the Union and foreign territories. There are certain functions of the State which should be carried out along those borders. The Control should be exercised along the borders in order to ensure that people do not enter illegally, that smuggling does not take place, and that animals which may be carrying infectious diseases do not enter the country. At the moment there is no one undertaking the necessary patrols. The other State Departments have approached us and asked us to undertake this type of work on their behalf and at their request and expense&#x2014;work relating to customs, immigration, stock diseases, smuggling, etc. This will only be done at the request of another Department so that we shall act on its behalf and it will have to pay for those services. We prefer to do the work ourselves because we do not want to have a multitude of officials who are not familiar with the traditions etc. of a game reserve living in those game reserves in order to carry out such other duties. It is far better that officials of the Parks Board should carry out those duties themselves.</p>

<p>In the past donations could not be made directly to the Parks Board. A donation to the Parks Board was regarded as a donation to the Department of Lands and we then handed the donation over to the Board. From time to time land adjacent to the parks has been donated, and we now want to provide that such donations can be made direct to the Parks Board and that they need not go via the Department of Lands.</p>

<p>There is one clause which is a little contentious, and that is the clause which prohibits the feeding of animals in the parks. I see that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) is smiling. I feel exactly as he does and I had exactly the same smile when they came to me. Hitherto feeding animals has been prohibited. But we now find that we did not really have the power to prohibit such feeding. The fact that we prohibited it did not have a very great effect. The public still persist in feeding the animals, particularly baboons This is something which we do not wish to encourage. People have already been seriously injured while feeding animals and if we have a regulation to the effect that they may <span class="col_7297-7298" refersTo="page_0870"/>not do so, it will at any rate make the public more careful than they are at the moment.</p>

<p>There is an interesting point, namely that elsewhere in the Union one is not allowed to drive one&#x2019;s motor car without a driver&#x2019;s licence. The parks however are private property and that provision is therefore not applicable in the parks because one is allowed to drive a motor vehicle without a licence if one does not use a public road. The roads in the national parks are not public roads but private roads. We are now taking the right to make that law applicable in the parks themselves. We have found that a man comes to the park with his son who does not have a driver&#x2019;s licence and when he reaches the park he says to his son: Now you can drive because a licence is not needed here.</p>

<p>I now turn to Clause 11. Under the existing legislation any officer or servant of the Parks Board has the power to arrest people who commit offences. We have many temporary officers who only work in the parks during the busy season. We now want to amend this provision by laying down that only permanent employees of the Parks Board will have these powers. In other words, the temporary employees who have this power to-day are now losing this power and we are only giving this power to permanent employees. Whereas the relevant position formerly used the word Native, we want to change it to &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; because the Parks Board to-day also has a considerable number of Coloureds in its employ.</p>

<p>Clause 12 contains a new definition of the word &#x201C;animal&#x201D; Under the new definition contained in the provincial ordinance, an insect is included under the definition of &#x201C;animal&#x201D;. As the law stands to-day, if one kills a tick or a fly in the national parks, one is contravening the law of the land. We now want to have the right to exclude any insect from the definition of an animal so the hon. members can kill a tick and also a mosquito if one attacks them in future without their consciences troubling them. Under this clause the Parks Board is also given full control over the movements of visitors in the parks. It was not clear what power we had regarding the movement of the visitors. We have found that visitors often go into parts of the parks where they are not allowed to go. There were regulations but they were probably <i>ultra vires</i>. We are now making quite sure that the Parks Board will have the right to exercise full control over the movements of visitors to the parks.</p>

<p>Clause 13 deals with the new penalties, and hon. members will see that the penalties for hunting and killing animals are being increased. Our penalties were lower than those provided for in the Transvaal provincial ordinance and we are now bringing them more or less into line with those penalties.</p>

<p>Clause 15 deals with prospecting and all we are trying to do here is to word a little more clearly the existing clause which already deals with prospecting.</p>

<p>In Clause 16 we are making it quite clear that if people have an accident involving an animal in a park, the Parks Board is not liable. We find that people take risks, but it is very often difficult to prove that such a person did take a risk. But if he collides with a buck, there is doubt whether or not he would be able to claim compensation from us because the buck which was on the road belonged to us. We are now making it quite clear that the Parks Board is not liable for any accident which takes place as a result of a collision involving a wild animal in a park, or in any other way.</p>

<p>I then come to Clause 17. The Parks Board of course regards nature conservation as its main task and the word which was formerly used to describe the head of a national park, namely &#x201C;superintendent&#x201D; (opsiener), is no longer suitable. We are now going to call him a &#x201C;nature conservator&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then only the schedule remains. For the first time this schedule sets out the boundaries of our five national parks. They are now being clearly set out.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are the main clauses contained in the Bill. In effect it represents an overhauling of our existing legislation to bring it into line with modern circumstances and to make it easier for the Parks Board to carry out its duties and at the same time to improve the facilities which are available to the people who visit the parks.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to commence my remarks this afternoon by explaining that we on this side of the House are not going to oppose the second reading of this Bill but at the Committee stage there probably will be some amendments moved to some provisions of the Bill in respect of which some hon. members feel very strongly. I will deal with them as I come to them.</p>

<p>I would like to say how much I personally, and I think all hon. members, agree with the general opinions expressed by the hon. the Minister this afternoon in the second reading speech, and how far we go with him in his desire to preserve the wild life which we still have left to us. I think back to the early history of the Sabie Reserve and the difficulties that the then President of the Transvaal, Paul Kruger had, and the greater difficulties that arose thereafter when the addition to the Sabie Reserve was made by Mr. Grobbelaar, and the opposition that was met with. I think it can be said that on the principle of the maintenance and the care of the Kruger Park and other reserves, probably not one single hon. member in this House could be found <span class="col_7299-7300" refersTo="page_0871"/>to vote against it. I think there is unanimous support to-day for the principle not only of the maintenance but, where it is indicated, also of the extention of the National Parks and reserves which we enjoy at the present time.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister dealt with the position in a few years time when we are likely to find that in this country we possibly have the last remnants of areas of protection for wild life, perhaps in the whole of Southern Africa. In passing I should like to give an example of what is happening. Only about two months ago we sent a senior official from the Natal Parks Board up to Northern Rhodesia to investigate, with the help of American scientists, the latest technique in connection with the use of hypodermic syringe as a means of capturing adult wild animals, and particularly some of the pachyderms. The hypodermic syringe is either fired at the end of an arrow from a bow, or from some kind of firearm, and injects a dose of anaesthetic into the animal concerned so that it becomes unconscious for a while and can be bound and crated ready for removal. We are very interested in those developments and so we sent a man up there to see how it was done and get experience in the field. It was of great interest to us to learn that when he was given the opportunity of going round a new region which has recently come under the control of one of the newly independent Governments to the North of the Federation, an area where there is the northern type of square lipped rhinoceros&#x2014;usually called the white rhinoceros&#x2014;in an area which has been marked for some time of carrying a population of approximately 150 of these animals, they came across 51 carcasses on the ground every one of which was less than 12 months old. The bulk of them were less than six months old. The majority were probably less than three months old, as far as they could judge from the remains. That is what they actually found.</p>

<p>Yes I know what it is used for, but I am surprised that the hon. the Minister knows what it is used for. He could read my feelings about another matter; I can read his feelings about the use to which a rhinoceros&#x2019; horn is put. And may I say that I sympathize with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a survey from the air of the area where there were supposed to be, according to the records, approximately 150 white rhinoceros, disclosed only one live animal after an exhaustive survey. That is what is happening. Therefore I say we cannot be too careful in preserving the remnants of our game and the wild life conditions, the ecology of the areas in which wild life is found.</p>

<p>The provisions of this Bill are designed with a view to tightening up the provisions of the existing Act; to make it harder for malefactors to escape the penalties of the law, and to make it easier for the law enforcement officers in the reserves to deal with malefactors, and also to deal with another type of person altogether, and that is the plain vandal. The people whose duty it is to preserve the wild life&#x2014;both the flora and fauna of our country &#x2014;have not only to deal with those people who slaughter rhinos and other animals, poachers who have a specific goal in view, they have other duties as well. These poachers go out after biltong; they collect the tails, for example of wildebeest and other things from the point of view of making money out of them. Not only do they have them to contend with, but they have to deal with the vandal. Where, as in the case of the Kruger National Park, the number of visitors grows year by year until it has reached astronomical proportions to-day, so does the army of vandals tend to increase in direct and growing proportion to the total of visitors to the Park. It is human nature. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that the law enforcement officers have to deal with people who make money out of their clandestine activities, and also with the vandal, the man who does not care what he does as long as he can just have his way, the man who wants to pull up every flower and pull every fern off a tree, and with him goes his little boy with a catapult and shoots the birds because they are sitting still and then puts the catapult back in his pocket and hopes that he will not be caught. Our rangers in the Kruger Park have so many people to deal with that it is impossible to keep a watch on everybody. Indeed, I wonder sometimes why there has not been a very serious accident long ago through the plain stupidity of those vandals.</p>

<p>I want to deal with Clause 1 of the Bill, with which the Minister did not deal. He started with Clause 3. I want to deal with Clause 1 (2), the object of the constitution of the National Park. The present phraseology is wider than what is contemplated in the Bill before us. The Bill talks about the preservation of wild animal and plant life, etc., for the benefit and enjoyment of visitors to such a park. The existing Act says that these things will be preserved for the benefit, advantage and enjoyment of the inhabitants <span class="col_7301-7302" refersTo="page_0872"/>of the Union. I suggest that that is a much better definition. There things are for the benefit, advantage and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the Union. If a visitor is here and visits the park, he is a temporary inhabitant, but we do not rule out the enjoyment of the visitor. My point is that the protection of those aspects of wild life can give intense enjoyment to people who do not necessarily even visit our parks, but through reports and papers and the material which is made available, through scientific institutions, immense interest is manifested. On another aspect of it, talking about our game reserves in Natal, we have a standing arrangement with the Veterinary Department in regard to the collection of specimens, etc., which is done on a very large scale indeed. This arrangement is functioning very well and the matter collected there is of immense value to them, so they say. They get wild animals from us from time to time and they collect subject matter for scientific investigation. That comes from the preservation of the animals in the first place and I cannot over-emphasize the necessity for methodical scientific research in connection with the flora and fauna in our game reserves. I naturally know more about the workings of our own parks in Natal, but there we have had for four years now a full-time ecologist doing research on matters like bush encroachment, which he has tackled successfully. I believe we are leading the Union and even Africa to-day. We are doing work in regard to game management and the protection of species of flora which would otherwise be killed by a thorn-bush, which spreads and obliterates the normal vegetation and which cannot compete with this new development. In the Cape it was due to species which were introduced, but in the case of Zululand where bush encroachment takes place it is indigenous species which are wiping out our grasses and killing so much of the indigenous vegetation that went with the grass. In connection with that type of work alone, valuable experiments have been carried out. The bush encroachment experiments cost Natal well over &#x00A3;10,000 last year. This kind of work can be done in the game reserves because it can be properly controlled and it can be of immense economic value to the country as a whole. I like the old clause because it is so much wider. I would hate to think that our game reserves are for the enjoyment and benefit of visitors to such a park. Surely there is a much wider meaning to the preservation of our wild life than the enjoyment of visitors.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the Minister for that offer.</p>

<p>The next clause is Clause 5, where it is provided that the Administrator, on the advice of the Executive Committee, may nominate himself as a member of the Parks Board, the Board of Trustees, and he can nominate a member of the Executive Committee or a member of the Provincial Council, but not an official of the Council. To the suggestion that there might be nominated a member of the Executive Council or a Provincial Councillor, I can have little objection. My objection is to the right of the Administrator to nominate himself to be a member. I would like to see in practice and by tradition&#x2014;I do not think it is the thing one should put into an Act&#x2014;that an Administrator should not be a member of the Parks Board. I know that I am on dangerous ground, because an Administrator is the Chairman of the Parks Board, but I think we must be realistic about it. Let us look at it from this angle. The Parks Board handle a vast sum of money and in the past there was an occasion when doubt was thrown on the correct administration and the handling of public funds by the Board of Trustees. I think I am correct in saying that after an inquiry nothing was found to be wrong, but what happened once can happen again. Now the Administrator in a Province occupies a very special position. He is not like a member of the Executive Committee. He is not even answerable to his Provincial Council. He has a highly privileged position because in a sense he is the mouthpiece of the Government. He can influence the funds of his province very materially. He can take part in the debate, but he cannot vote in the Council and he can influence money and he is his own treasurer. But when it comes to handling public money as a member of a corporate body which can be called to account for the way it is handling or mishandling public funds, I do not think the Administrator should be in that position, even if he wanted to. I think it is quite wrong. I think it is like suggesting that you have a body of this kind and put a Cabinet Minister on to it. What will happen if there is an inquiry about the misappropriation of funds and it is found that funds have been misappropriated by a body of which four Administrators are members? What happens in the Provincial Council concerned? They should never be allowed to get into that position. Where the handling of public funds is concerned, the Administrator should be like the Auditor-General; he should be in the arena himself and perhaps be found to be a party to something which has even a shadow of doubt attached to it. With all due respect to the gentlemen who occupy the position of Administrators, for the purpose of this Board of Trustees I believe that four other men equally able and determined to protect our wild life can be found. I do not think that any of these men are so indispensable that we cannot replace them. I hope the Minister will not press on with that provision.</p>

<from><span class="col_7303-7304" refersTo="page_0873"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, very easily. The Minister dealt with Clause 9, which deals with liquor in the park. Only this morning I was asked about the provisions of this Bill and it was suggested that if I would advocate that a special provision be put into the Bill to say that the animals should be entitled to obtain liquor as well as the visitors, this person thought that I should support this clause. He said that you cannot have the game reserves without animals and why should the visitors and <i>homo sapiens</i> generally be given this undue privilege over the animals which create the reserve. He said that mankind went to look at the animals, and why should the animals not be given the opportunity of looking at mankind after imbibing a little liquor? Well, I do not know, but being a teetotaler I am sorry that the wholesale supply of liquor is being permitted in the parks. I know the difficulty. I am not bigoted about it. The Minister shakes his head and says, &#x201C;not wholesale&#x201D;. It says here that visitors may be supplied with anything that may be sold under a bottle liquor licence. Oh, I see. I was thinking of the volume. The man who wants a drink with his meals can buy a bottle of beer. I can quite understand that and I see nothing wrong with it and I will support it, but this seems to go much further than that. If the answer is that sometimes visitors to the park take a large volume of liquor in with them and when they can get it in large volume in the park they will not bring it in from outside&#x2014;then all I can say is that they are the people who should not be allowed to get it there. But I realize that there are difficulties about it. Once you open the door to the sale of liquor in the park, you are in difficulties about knowing where to draw the line and I think the position will have to be watched very closely. I could imagine a few fellows having a party and driving off and they see not one elephant but several, and they may even be pink or spotted, and then it is up to the elephant to determine the future of the gentlemen concerned.</p>

<p>Now I move on to the special clause that the Minister dealt with, Clause 10 (f), where there is a prohibition on the feeding of any animal. He also dealt with the question of a valid driver&#x2019;s licence, which is quite clear. Of course the question of feeding the animals is the difficulty. If there are baboons or monkeys and people feed them, it is dangerous. I have seen people feeding baboons under circumstances where I would never have dreamt of doing so. There is, of course, the clause which exonerates the Parks Board from responsibility if anyone gets hurt by an animal, and I am glad to see it, because often people tempt Providence. The feeding of baboons is very dangerous and if putting this clause into the Bill mitigates that danger, I welcome it, but I do not know whether it will. I can visualize the difficulty the law enforcement officers will have in enforcing a provision of that kind. However, it is on the safe side.</p>

<p>With regard to Clauses 13 and 14, there is room for a big difference of opinion regarding the minimum penalty provided, and in Clause 14 there is the onus of proof. I want to say frankly that as far as I personally am concerned, I have been a party to similar legislation in Another Place, and it seems to me that we in South Africa, together with other countries which want to make a real effort to protect their wild life, have to ask ourselves whether our existing law, framed to deal with normal malefactors, is capable of being en forced in the case of wild life. The difficulty is that where you are dealing with thieves, blackmailers or forgerers, etc., you are dealing with property, and however great the value of the property when the time comes that justice is done and the malefactor is caught, some kind of restitution can be made. But when you deal with poachers you are dealing with the lives of animals, and the life of the animal having been distinguished it is lost for all time, even if you punish the poacher. That is the big problem the conservator has to deal with, that every time he punishes a man for a breach of the laws he is dealing with a life which cannot be restored. If there are five animals of a species left alive and someone kills them, it does not matter what punishment you give him but that species is extinct. That is the difficulty. Our conservationists see our wild life being attacked deliberately because there is money to be made out of it, by poachers and the vandals, and just through sheer carelessness. The Minister dealt with that aspect of carelessness when he said that the onus would be put on people to show that animals did not lose their lives throught their carelessness. Here I want to deal with the Kruger Park, which I have visited many times. Hon. members will agree with me that the carelessness of the ordinary driver, particularly if he is told that there are lions over there, five miles away, is shocking. Cars come past and ask you whether you have seen any. They do not say any what. That implies lions, and you say yes, five miles back, and then off they go and they run over some animal and then they say they should not be charged because the animal just ran over the road. It may be that the careful driver can run over an animal, but what is happening to-day is that the genuine accident is the escape route for these people who are deliberately killing animals with their cars. I have many times seen people who have gloried in the fact that when leaving the Kruger Park they have run into a heard of impala and killed some of the animals and they have come out with the carcasses in the back of their car and they think they have done something clever. I think it a scandal that that should be done, but unfortunately through the difficulties of enforcement it is being done by people who otherwise claim that they are very interested in the preservation of the game. A genuine accident has been found by people to be the escape route for those who wilfully destroy our wild life. It is the same with the poacher. Let the <span class="col_7305-7306" refersTo="page_0874"/>poacher find that there is means of escaping guilt and he will take it. The magistrate says that there must be proof of a certain kind, and let the poacher find that he has been acquitted on that point and every poacher will go for that point in future. It is a hopeless task to protect all our animals. So if the law is tightened up and in the case of these animals we have to go further than we would like to go, I say it is forced upon us and we should either protect the principles of the law which apply to our ordinary lives or protect the animals. If we protect the principles of the law, in the end we will have no wild life. I believe it is as bad as that. You cannot preserve your wild life and preserve the rigid principles of the criminal law as they are generally applicable when you take into account the ingenuity which I have seen manifested by poachers all over. It is incredible the extent to which human ingenuity will go to find a loophole in the law so as to get away with profit-making or sheer vandalism. So while there will probably be amendments and people will not agree with what I have said, I personally believe that this is one of the cases where we have got to say that the law is designed for certain law-breakers and it is necessary that they be dealt with severely and summarily or otherwise we will lose our wild life.</p>

<p>I just want to touch on Clause 16, which says that no liability will attach to the Parks Board for damage caused by an animal in the park. I welcome that. I have heard arguments, where damage has taken place through an animal, as to whether a claim cannot be laid against the Parks Board. We have to realize that in our national parks <i>homo sapiens</i> is an interloper. That is one of the reasons why I was against the change in Clause I. <i>Homo sapiens</i> has no right to be in the park except to view the animals. You, Mr. Speaker, were with me in Ceylon and you may remember the big notice over the gate in the Zoo saying: &#x201C;This is a place where wild animals can study human beings without the risk of being shot&#x201D;. We might put that notice up over the entrance to our national parks. Let mankind go into our national parks and behave himself as if he is in another man&#x2019;s home. Let him comport himself with decency and courtesy. That home belongs to the animals. If a burglar comes into our homes we are entitled to shoot him. The poacher who breaks into that home of the animal must be dealt with severely. Let us set a clear pattern in our legislation of how we believe <i>homo sapiens</i> should comport himself there. A man should know that he is risking his life if he goes pushing his car up against an elephant and that he risks his life if he goes up to a lioness with cubs, yet they do it. I have seen a man get out of his car with a camera and walk up to a lioness with cubs and because she lies there quietly he says he must have some action and throws something at her. It seems to me that the animals sometimes behave better than human beings. I approve of this clause and in general I give this Bill my blessing.</p>

<p>The preservation of life is surely one of the most interesting subjects one can discuss. Nature preservation is one of the duties which has been entrusted to us. We must preserve our wild and natural life for posterity. It is the position that as a result of circumstances our wild animals have over the years been reduced by the thousands in South Africa. While we have made such progress to-day that our wild animals are concentrated in certain reserves, I feel that the State must take very strict action, or else we shall eventually no longer have any wild animals in those reserves either. The preservation of wild life has become a science. We can no longer preserve wild life as we did in earlier days. To-day it must be done on a scientific basis. For that reason I agree with the hon. member who has just sat down that a great deal of scientific research should be carried out in respect of certain matters, particularly in respect of the movements of our wild animals, their grazing habits, their diseases, their breeding methods and their control. It is the position that our game sometimes has to be thinned out by shooting in the game reserves because there are two many animals of one or other species. South West Africa to-day has the largest game reserve in the world, namely the Etosha game reserve. I had the honour of being the chairman of the Parks Board of South West Africa and of being concerned with laying the foundations for the development of that game reserve. I feel that there must be co-ordination between the preservation of wild life in the Union and in South West Africa. To-day we have the Parks Board of the Union and South West Africa has her own Parks Board, but there is one reserve, the Gemsbok Park, which lies between the two areas and in which both areas are interested, where the one can learn from the other. I therefore feel that there should be co-ordination between the Parks Board of South West and the Parks Board of the Union. I wonder whether the Minister will not consider approaching the South West Administration in this regard and whether a system cannot be devized whereby a member of the South West Parks Board can be co-opted as a member of the Union Parks Board and vice versa. The South West Parks Board in turn could co-opt a member of the Parks Board of the Union to serve as a member of the South West Parks Board so that there can be co-ordination. In this way the one could learn a great deal from the other. What I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister is the difficulty with which South West is faced in connection with the road which runs between the Union and South West.</p>

<p>I know, but I want to ask whether something cannot be done, whether some assistance cannot be granted; and whether the Minister cannot perhaps insert a provision into this Bill before the Bill passes its final stage. This is a road which carries heavy traffic and as someone who is concerned with the preservation of wild life. I realize that it is unsound that heavy traffic should pass through a game reserve. This road has been there for years already; it is a road which is indispensible to South West Africa, and if that road is to be diverted, I want to ask that the Parks Board should do so as soon as possible so that this difficulty can be eliminated.</p>

<p>I think that there is a great deal of good in this Bill; that the previous speaker has already dealt with the main points and that there should be no objection to the introduction of this Bill.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. L. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to thank the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) for the interesting information they have given us but I regret that I cannot agree with the view point that has been put forward by the hon. member for South Coast in regard to the provisions of Clauses 13 and 14; and it is in regard to those clauses that I wish to make certain comments. Clause 13 prescribes amended penalties for killing, injuring, capturing or disturbing animals in the National Park, and Clause 14 creates a number of presumptions in prosecutions for contraventions of the National Parks Act 1926, as amended, which are open, I submit, to very serious criticism. Under the principles that the hon. member for South Coast has put forward, I think it would be dangerous for any of us to visit these parks lest we should be caught in the network of these two clauses, however much we may wish to behave ourselves.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 13 we all appreciate the need for protecting our wild life and the substantial punishment of offenders who contravene the law. But the objection I raise to this clause is the inclusion of severe minimum penalties that deprive the courts of their judicial discretion in fixing punishment, whatever the circumstances may be. I am aware that this principle was adopted in the 1926 Act, but things have changed a great deal since then and I do not think this principle of minimum penalties should be continued. We on this side of the House have consistently opposed this procedure which we have always regarded as an undesirable innovation in our criminal procedure. I take first of all sub-clause (1) of this clause which prescribes penalties for killing, injuring, capturing or disturbing any animal, (including the eggs or nests of certain birds) hippopotami and other animals which for convenience I shall describe as Royal Game. A minimum penalty of not less than R400 or one year&#x2019;s imprisonment is laid down, with a maximum of not more than R800 or two years&#x2019; imprisonment. On a second conviction the magistrate may impose imprisonment without the option of a fine. In either case, if the commission of the offence was wilful, corporal punishment of 10 strokes may be added. Subsection (2) goes on to provide lesser penalties for causing a veld fire or for the killing or injuring or capturing or disturbing of any animal not specified in sub-section (1). Here the minimum penalty is a fine of not less than R100 or three months&#x2019; imprisonment, with a maximum of R500 or 18 months&#x2019; imprisonment. On a second conviction, imprisonment without the option of a fine may be imposed, and in either case 10 strokes in case of wilfulness. Sir, in order to appreciate the significance of what we are being asked to approve, I would like to refer to the definition of &#x201C;animal&#x201D; as set out in Section 22 of the National Parks Act of 1926.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Animal&#x201D; means any mammal, reptile, (other than a poisonous snake) bird, fish or bee.</block>

<p>Sir, just imagine what this means. If a nonpoisonous snake should happen to come into your shack at night in a National Park and you kill it, you would be liable to a minimum fine of R100 or three months. The fact that you thought it was poisonous would not save you. Under Clause 14 the onus will be on you to prove your innocence, and you would have but short shrift and you might run the risk of getting 10 strokes for wilfulness. Take another animal which is included in this definition, a bee&#x2014;not a beehive but an individual bee. Can you imagine a person given a minimum fine of R100 or three months&#x2019; imprisonment for killing a bee that may have been attracted to his tent? I think that is a monstrous suggestion, but that is the effect of this clause. It creates a situation that is truly Gilbertian, and it makes a laughing stock of our legislation. Here we are dealing with animals and imposing these drastic minimum penalties for interfering with them. Meanwhile thousands of human beings are being killed by motor cars every year, but there is no mini mum penalty for killing a human being with your car, the question of the penalty being left to the wise discretion of the court, as it should be in every case. In the administration of these game laws, experienced magistrates who are in touch with what is happening in their districts and who are keenly alive to the need for protecting our game, can he trusted to impose suitable penalties, and to compel them to impose these extraordinary minimum penalties, whatever the circumstances may be, is not only a reflection upon them but it is contrary to sound judicial administration.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 14. In so far as this clause is concerned, I submit that the presumption created casts an unfair burden upon a person charged with an offence under this Bill. <span class="col_7309-7310" refersTo="page_0876"/>It is a cardinal principle of our criminal law that the burden of proving the guilt of an accused person beyond reasonable doubt rests upon the prosecution. In this connection I would like to refer to certain statements contained in Gardiner and Lansdown, South African Criminal Law and Procedure Vol. I. I refer first of all to page 459 in which they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general rule is that the burden of proof rests upon the party who asserts the affirmative of the issue in dispute, but by &#x201C;affirmative&#x201D; here must be understood the affirmative in substance, not merely the affirmative in form.</block>

<p>Then on page 460&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Viewed apart from the evidence or of presumptions, the onus of proof in a criminal case never changes; it is always upon the prosecution.</block>

<p>That is the general principle. Then on pages 478 and 479 they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a universal presumption of criminal law that no person shall be supposed to have committed a criminal offence&#x2014;that the accused in any charge must be taken to be innocent until he is, by competent evidence which to a reasonable and honest mind, amounts to a moral certainty, and places the matter beyond reasonable doubt, shown to be guilty.<br/>Hence it is that the onus of proof in all criminal prosecutions lies upon the prosecutor except where specially provided by law to the contrary.</block>

<p>We are trying here to provide by law to the contrary but we are going too far. From time to time a number of rebuttable presumptions have been created by our law, designed as <i>prima facie</i> proof, to enable the prosecution to bring offenders to justice, but as a rule these presumptions relate to matters within the knowledge of the accused, such as the possession of a licence or permission to do an act and other incidental matters. But under this clause the shifting of the onus of proof from the prosecution and placing it upon the shoulders of the accused who in most cases may be an ignorant Native, is unreasonable and unjust. The effect of paragraphs 1 to 3 is that all the prosecution has to do is to put the accused in the dock and virtually to require him to prove his innocence. Take sub-Clause (1). I think it is important that the House should realize what it is passing. Sub-Clause (1) says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The burden of proving any fact which would be a defence to a charge under this Act or the regulation shall be upon the person so charged.</block>

<p>I say this places an intolerable burden upon the accused. It should be for the prosecution to prove its case, and generally speaking there should be no onus on the accused until the prosecution has established a <i>prima facie</i> case against him. Sub-section (2) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever in any prosecution under this Act or the regulations it is alleged in the charge that an offence has been committ&#x00E9;d in connection with or in respect of any species of the animal or plant life stated in the charge, it shall be presumed that the offence has been committed in connection with or in respect of such species of the animal or plant life unless the contrary is proved.</block>

<p>What a monstrous clause! Here the burden of proof is essentially one that should be upon the prosecutor, to prove that the animal or the plant concerned belongs to the species alleged in the charge, and there should be no difficulty in that regard. The ordinary procedure should be followed, namely, that an officer of the park should go into the witness box and identify the animal or plant that forms the subject of the charge. But I ask you. Sir, how can an ignorant Native or even a stranger to the park be expected to have the necessary knowledge to do what is required of him under this sub-section. Then I come to subsection (3)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If in any prosecution it is alleged in the charge that an act which constitutes an offence under this Act or the regulations has been committed within the boundaries of a park, that act shall be presumed to have been committed within the boundaries of that park unless the contrary is proved.</block>

<p>Proved by whom? Proved by the accused? Sir, the remarks I made in regard to subsection (2) apply here with equal force. How is an accused person, how is a Native, to know with any degree of certainty where the boundaries of a park begin or end? One could appreciate a provision that said that possession of protected game within a park would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a contravention of the law. But the paragraph as it stands casts an unreasonable burden on the accused. The warden or ranger of the park should be called to give that evidence. Then I think sub-section (4) is one of the worst of the lot. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any prosecution under this Act or the regulations, any record, book or document <span class="col_7311-7312" refersTo="page_0877"/>kept by an officer of the Board in the course of his duties, shall on its production by any officer of the Board be <i>prima facie</i> proof of the facts recorded therein.</block>

<p>I wonder if the Minister will tell us what is intended in this clause. It is a very dangerous clause and it is contrary to what is known as the best evidence rule, a principle of the law of evidence that the party who desires to prove certain facts cannot be allowed to do so by providing evidence of an inferior class, when it is within his power to place before the court evidence of a superior class. In other words, the best evidence here is that of the officer himself&#x2014;not the notes that he made of the occurrence. He may refer to his notes when he goes into the witness box so as to refresh his memory but his notes are not evidence of the content and cannot be put in in evidence in a case either by himself or anybody else. The effect of this amendment will be that entries made by a ranger in his note book in regard to an offence may be put in at the trial without calling the person who made the entry. Sir, that is an impossible state of affairs. I am quite sure that the Minister does not approve of that. Anyone who knows anything about court procedure will know that in such cases the ranger must be called and be subject to cross-examination to test his veracity. This procedure of handing in affidavits or other documents is only permitted in limited cases where there can be no suggestion of irregularity, such as bankers&#x2019; books. Government records and so forth. Under Section 239 of the Criminal Procedure Act, transactions in Government Departments or banks may be proved by the affidavit of some responsible officer, but in that case the court may require the officer to appear before it to give oral evidence and to undergo cross-examination. This innovation that the Minister now wishes to introduce, to dispense with a material witness by putting in his notes, is an outrage, and it may lead to false entries being put in, resulting in a grave injustice to the accused. I do hope that before the Committee Stage is reached, the hon. the Minister will discuss with his law advisers the points that I have raised in all sincerity and that he will not give us a reply on the spot. I hope that he will go into the matter and see that no injustice is done.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I will not keep hon. members long. I have sympathy with the case put up by the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. D. L. Smit). I do not think that the minimum sentences laid down in this Bill are primitive. Perhaps the Minister will be better advised to erect a gallows and a rack at the entrance to national parks to dissuade people from committing offences against our wild life, or perhaps he could institute the stocks at our various camps and a supply of rotton eggs for minor offenders. Perhaps that might have a more salutory affect than minimum sentences. I think these excessive minimum sentences are going to be very difficult to apply.</p>

<p>But I really stood up to say how unhappy I am about the liquor facilities for which the Minister has provided in this Bill in our national parks. The Minister has said that in previous years he allowed people to take their liquor into the parks. They could never take the quantities that they can under this Act where the wholesale sale of liquor by bottle stores is provided for. I think that our game reserves are sanctuaries and should be regarded as such and not as holiday resorts. I think the regulations should be so designed as to make our game reserves the greatest attraction to our children in this country. We must bring our children nearer to wild life. It would mean very much to them, and I think if we have that object in view we will not subject children to the unhappy experiences to which many of them are subject to-day in the vicinity of hotels. I think too that if the Minister is sincere in his desire to protect game, he should also provide that liquor facilities will not be available to visitors to the park in excessive quantities or at the discretion of the Board. After all, a man under the influence of liquor is a menace to the animals in the park. The Minister knows that in the parks he has not got the same police supervision that he has outside the parks. These parks are expensive and there is no doubt that by allowing the wholesale sale of liquor in the parks we are going to make the parks more attractive to a different type of person who want to get away from the public and perhaps have an excessive quantity of liquor. We have that happening at many of our country hotels. We have these deplorable incidents taking place where liquor is provided away from the eye of the law.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am speaking to clauses in the Bill; I do not want to hold up the House, but I am speaking to Clauses 8 and 9 which provide for full liquor facilities in our national parks, in the same way as anywhere else in the country. Clause 8 provides for the Board to have full bottle store facilities. That is for the wholesale sale of liquor to visitors to the park, and Clause 9 provides for the same facilities for liquor at meals that are enjoyed to-day by all our hotels. My idea is that these provisions are being inserted to enable the national parks to make greater profits out of visitors to the parks, and to this end the Board is also exempted in Clause 9 (4), from the payment of any licence duty or fee in respect of any of the activities contemplated in sub-section (1). I hope that the Minister will give this matter more serious consideration, and in the Committee Stage I myself will do all I can to convince the Minister <span class="col_7313-7314" refersTo="page_0878"/>that the provision of liquor facilities in the parks is not really in the interests of the development of the national parks which I regard as one of the greatest assets we have in this country.</p>

<p>I want to deal first of all with three points raised by the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. D. L. Smit). The first is the question of penalties. He complains that the penalties which we are imposing for certain contraventions within national parks&#x2014;he particularly has the Kruger National Park in mind&#x2014;are too heavy.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>These provisions are the same as those contained in the Transvaal Game Ordinance. What the hon. member for East London (City) wants is that the same sentence should be applicable over the whole of the Transvaal, but that in that area which has been set aside specially for wild animals, the sentence should be lighter for killing an animal. That seems quite illogical to me.</p>

<p>The hon. member had a great deal to say about the onus of proof and he said that the poor Native did not know where the borders of the park was. The hon. member was Secretary of Native Affairs. Does he think that those Natives who live around the Kruger National Park and other parks do not know where the borders are? They know that the game on this side of the stream or on the other side of that fence are protected. The Native knows those borders better than the hon. member or any other person in this House. He knows where the border is and he also knows what the penalties are. But what happens to-day? The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) gave an example. A person runs a buck over and kills it; he puts it in the back of his car and it is found. The onus now rests on you to prove that he ran the buck over inside the park and how are you going to do that? It is absolutely impossible to prove that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. L. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Cannot you add a provision that the possession of a buck within the park is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the commission of a contravention?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>You can do that but if you do, you go much further than the provision of this Bill. It may be that the person is quite legally in possession of that buck in the park and he may be able to prove it, but now the hon. member wants to go further than this Bill because he wants the mere possession of a buck to be regarded as proof of guilt. That person will now have to prove that that does not prove his guilt. I want to go further. That is also a provision of the Game Ordinance of the Transvaal. The hon. member wants lighter sentences to be imposed on culprits in those reserves that have been set aside for the protection of game than outside. I would think that if we departed from the provisions of the Transvaal Game Ordinance we should depart from it in the sense that the provisions are made more stringent in the National Parks Act, not less stringent. However, that is the law in the Transvaal and all we are doing here is to make the Transvaal law applicable to the rest of the Transvaal. I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member that the sentences should be lighter for contraventions within a national park than outside.</p>

<p>As far as the <i>prima facie</i> proof is concerned, that is being inserted for this reason. <i>Prima facie</i> proof is not necessary conclusive proof. If a magistrate does not wish to accept it, he need not. He may ask that the witness be tried in person. In certain cases, however, it is very easy to accept it, and that is in the case where the register is produced in which the person had registered on the day of his arrival in the park. That proves that he was inside the park. He had entered the park and the proof of that fact is contained in the &#x201C;log book&#x201D; and that may partially prove his guilt.</p>

<p>If that is bad evidence and the magistrate is not satisfied with it, he can ask for the person to give evidence in person. But if he is satisfied that it is in order, he may accept it. That is purely <i>prima</i> facie, it is not conclusive proof.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Windhoek asked whether the Board could not also have a representative of the Administration of South West Africa. I shall consider that.</p>

<p>I want to thank hon. members in general for their approval of this Bill. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. Mitchell) more or less approved of the whole Bill except one point. It is peculiar to note that this point has only been raised by the Natal members. They do not want an Administrator on the Parks Board. At the moment there are two Administrators on the Parks Board, the Administrator of the Cape Province and the Administrator of the Transvaal. We are very pleased to have them on the Board.

<p>know. He was one himself, but he resigned because he thought there was a higher calling for him. He advanced one argument why he thought that an Administrator should not serve on the Board, and that was a very farfetched argument. He says that if you have an Administrator as a member of the Board, and something illegal is done under the administration of the Parks Board, say for instances, money is embezzled or something similar, the Administrator is placed in an unenviable position. He may be regarded in the same light or involved by implication. In that case he should not be Administrator either because something similar may happen in the Provincial Council. In that case nobody can hold any position because the argument he advanced why an Administrator should not serve on the Board, applies to practically all fields of life. He says that something illegal may be done, there may be an investigation and the Administrator may be involved. That applies in the case of every person who holds any position in the world. That even applies to the leader of Natal in the House of Assembly. I do not want to go into detail as to what happened in the Transvaal, happenings which involved the hon. member, because I may be marching beyond the Rules of the House.</p>

<block name="quote">That the House do now adjourn.</block>

<p>Sir, with the permission of the House I should like to say a few words. To-day is a historical day. This is the last session of the House of Assembly of the Union of South Africa and we are closing an epoch in our history. As a child it was my unique privilege to attend the opening of the first session of Parliament of the Union of South Africa and I have been a member of the Union Parliament for more than 30 years, and the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Lawrence) and I have been sitting in this House of Assembly for more years than anybody else. We have seen the House of Assembly of the Union of South Africa at its best and we have also seen it when it was not at its best. The conclusion to which I have come is that we have been meeting here since Union as people who, as far as Parliament is concerned, wish to govern South Africa according to democratic principles, principles according to which a Parliament ought to try to govern. Democracy is not an easy instrument. It is a very sensitive instrument and if you do not play that instrument according to the rules, you are apt to produce discords. In order to conduct Parliament strictly according to the rules of democracy, and if they wish to practise democracy successfully the members must have a full realization of their obligations and also of their responsibilities. If you lack that realization, if you lack the necessary training to have that realization, democracy is a failure. We have the position in other parts of Africa where people are trying to build nations on our democratic system of government, people who do not appreciate the responsibility that goes with it, who do not handle that sensitive instrument correctly, that the democracy as we know it in the Union is running on to the rocks. If we ask ourselves whether our Parliament has maintained democratic principles during the past SO years, and maintained it successfully, I think the answer is definitely &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. We may have our shortcomings but in general we have acted democratically in this House of Assembly. The little incident that we witnessed a few minutes ago is indicative of the jealousy with which the House of Assembly regards its own rights and also its own duties.</p>

<p>We have reached the end of an epoch and I hope and trust that we shall carry that which was good in the old epoch forward into the new epoch and more especially where we are dealing with this unique instrument of Parliament I trust that in future we shall retain the old traditions that were good in the old Parliament and thus guide South Africa to her ultimate destination.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LAWRENCE</person>:</from>

<p>These are the last formal words I shall speak in the Parliament of the Union of South Africa; and because I have spent more than half of my life in Parliament and, like my hon. friend, Paul Sauer, the Minister of Lands, have been in this House continuously for three-fifths of the lifespan of the Union of South Africa, I am glad to have an opportunity of saying something on this historic motion for the adjournment of the House.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a very great temptation on this occasion to live in the past and, Sir, to revel in nostalgic memories of the vanished pomps of yesterday. A cynic once said that the only way to get rid of temptation is to give into it! But to do so on this occasion would be a mistake, and I do not intend to succumb to that temptation. We after all are living in the present, and are at the gateway of an unknown future in which all of us will be called upon to play a part for South Africa. So, Sir, as we pause this moment of transition, I should like to pay some tributes to the old order which is now changing. It is natural of course, Sir, that it is of Parliament that I would speak, in which I spent so much of my life. So my first tribute this afternoon is to the parliamentary traditions which have been built up in this House over the years of Union. We had the heritage of the old Cape House. The foundations of those traditions were then laid by the earlier Prime Ministers, Gen. Botha, Gen. Smuts, Gen. Hertzog. And then, Sir, I feel that a tremendous debt of gratitude is due to our parliamentary staff, to our Clerks of the House, to their Assistants, and to other officials who have helped successive Speakers and Chairmen of Committees to shape and mould parliamentary practice. Perhaps on this occasion, you will allow me, Sir, to pay my own particular tribute to the present Sergeant of Arms, Mr. Retief, who has escorted me outside the precincts of the House so often with the greatest courtesy and the greatest understanding! I want to say this afternoon that I hope that in this new era in <span class="col_7319-7320" refersTo="page_0881"/>the life of our country, we shall build on that foundation which has been laid by the great statesmen who have gone before us.</p>

<p>My second tribute is to the innate good sense which, in the past, Sir, has enabled searching debates to take place in this House on all matters touching the public welfare. After all, Mr. Speaker, the object of Parliament is to substitute argument for fisticuffs. May I be allowed to express the hope this afternoon, in this dying Parliament under the monarchy, that the Parliament of the republic will never forget this salutary lesson. The hon. the Leader of the House, Sir, has very rightly pointed to the vindication of the rights of members of this House as exemplified in the case to-day of the hon. member for Sea Point. What above all is important is the vindication of the rights of the people; and it is this forum, the Parliament of the Union which has been&#x2014;and in the future the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa which will be&#x2014;the forum in which the rights of the people, all the people, can be vindicated.</p>

<p>My third tribute, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;and I hope that on this special occasion you will allow me to make it, Sir&#x2014;is to the person of the successive monarchs who were our constitutional Heads of State in the past 51 years. Throughout the life of the Union, Mr. Speaker, the reigning sovereigns have behaved with constitutional propriety and gracious dignity. Under their rule the prerogatives of the Crown have become the privileges of the people. So today, I would say to you, Sir, and to every member of this House, on the Government side, and on my own side: Let us remember that with gratitude and thankfulness and express our appreciation to the Queen of South Africa for her sympathy, her tolerance and her understanding.</p>

<p>Now we are going to change all that. Nearly 400 years ago, Sir, an English writer Richard Hooker, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Change is not made without inconvenience, even from worse to better.</block>

<p>Only the future can tell, Sir, whether the change that we are about to make is going to be from worse to better, or from better to worse. Undoubtedly there will be inconvenience. There will be difficulties. There are the same old challenging problems. The fact that we are now departing from the monarchy and becoming a republic will not remove these challenging problems. What I would like to say on this historic and very solemn occasion is this, that if we, the legislators, the representatives of the people of South Africa, and those who may come after us, do not solve those problems, do not delude ourselves into believing that the blame can be laid elsewhere. &#x201C;The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.&#x201D;</p>

<p>So I say: Let us look to the future, knowing that what that future will be will depend largely on ourselves. We are a young nation, now to stand on its own. A nation has been defined as consisting of those who have done great things together and desire to do more of them. In the past, Mr. Speaker, some of us have done great things together, but not necessarily all of us together. So here is another stimulating challenge to each one of us on the eve of the republic. I would with all the earnestness at my command, as one who loves South Africa and one who is proud to serve South Africa, urge that all of us, whatever our colour or race or creed, should have a chance to work together for South Africa. And now as I say good-bye to this Parliament under the monarchy and to South Africa within the Commonwealth, and indeed on a very significant date&#x2014;it is the 13th anniversary to-day of the accession of the Nationalist Government to power&#x2014;I want to say not only to all my friends on this side of the House, but also to my friends on that side of the House that I go forward, in the words of Abraham Lincoln&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see it.</block>

<p>And may I add these words, Sir, of Louis Leipoldt&#x2014;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot claim and do not claim to be one of the oldest or most experienced members of this House, but it is perhaps fitting that on this occasion certain of the words coming from the Leader of the House should have come from one whose father sat in this House with my father. It is perhaps strange that on this occasion he should be Leader of the House and I should be Leader of the Opposition. Our fathers sat here together, in the same Cabinet, on the same side of the House. Whether it is he who has strayed from the path of South Africa or I, history alone will determine. It is significant also that the spokesman on this side of the House, who has the longest service, should have been my <span class="col_7321-7322" refersTo="page_0882"/>scout-master when I was a small boy. I am very honoured therefore, Sir, that I can say a few words on this solemn occasion and in such company. I think this is a solemn occasion for all South Africa, because this House, the legislative House of the Union Parliament, I feel has a proud record. It has a long history, it has seen good times, and it has seen bad times, and we are taking leave of this system to-day under which much of what we cherished in South Africa has been built up. It has seen our history in peace and in war, in good times and in bad times, in periods of temporary retrogression and in periods of spectacular advance. But I think we can say that throughout that period the system of government which we knew has stood the test. Our constitutional system as we knew it has served us well, and it has made possible the present Union of South Africa to which all of us primarily owe our loyalty. It has made it what it is to-day.</p>

<p>When one thinks back, Sir, of the problem with which it was faced&#x2014;the four different colonies, two of which had been warring against two others, the difficulties with which they were faced, enemy and enemy sitting across the floor of the House, what they achieved at that time, then I think what has been achieved in this House must be one of the great achievements of history.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in a few days we shall effect for South Africa a major change in our system of constitution at a time of great stress, at a time when pressure for change is the hallmark of what is happening in every state in Africa at the present time. I think at this time we should all unite in the hope that the new dispensation which is about to be achieved, to be imposed in South Africa, will serve South Africa as well as the old. As a young man, thinking back, there have been many historic occasions in this House, Sir. I have had accounted to me the debates at the time of the Rebellion; I have heard what happened during the period of the war from 1914 to 1918; I have had accounted and read certain of the occurrences here at the time of the Rand rising in 1922; there have been the debates over the Statute of Westminster, over the Status Act, over the war issue in 1939. Perhaps when the history of this period comes to be written, one of the historic debates will be that which concerns our Commonwealth membership. During all that period, Sir, there has been built up, I think, a tradition in this House, a tradition of which we had a right to be proud. I think there has been a tradition of impartiality in respect of the servants of Parliament; people like yourself, Mr. Speaker, who have held high office as servants of this House; the Clerks at the Table, the servants and others who have done so much to give this Parliament the shape and form which it has. Parliament&#x2019;s determination to maintain complete freedom of speech; the tradition of fearless opposition to the Government of the day; the fact that there has grown up, I think, a certain understanding amongst members no matter what their differences may be on political issues; the determination to protect the rights of a minority; the protection of the rights of individual members. And I think that perhaps we take many of those rights for granted. I wonder sometimes whether we are sufficiently jealous of them. But I think through the history of this Parliament there runs one underlying theme, that no matter how much we fought with one another, no matter how much we disagreed with each other, no matter how much, at times, we felt bitterly towards each other, there has been an underlying theme of loyalty to South Africa. I think that if we can carry into the new era that theme, that determination, we shall have achieved something upon which the foundation for the future can be built. It will be a common purpose, I think, which can bind together members on this side of the House and members on that side of the House.</p>

<p>With this tradition, Sir, we lose a tradition; the tradition of a monarchy in South Africa which has served us with great distinction throughout the entire life of the Union. And though there may be differences of opinion as to whether it has bound us together or not, I do not think there is one man on either side of the House who will criticize the actions of successive monarchs in respect of their constitutional approach to our South African problems. That is a big thing to be able to say, and it has established a great tradition. It casts a great responsibility upon the official, the person, the office with which that monarchy will be replaced. I think we would all like, on this occasion, to pay our tribute, and, in a small way, express our gratitude for that tradition and that service in the past, and express the hope and the prayer that we may carry into the future, into this new tradition, this new arrangement, all that has been best in this Parliament in the interests of South Africa and all its peoples.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to avail myself, once again, of the privilege of addressing the House in both languages. This should serve, a second time, as a symbol of the fact that both English and Afrikaans, <span class="col_7323-7324" refersTo="page_0883"/>together, are the languages of all of us. I wish to say that on this very memorable occasion it is as if we were looking back along a long and winding road of parliamentary development in South Africa. This started quite long ago in a small way, this self-government of ours, but in the course of time we brought our constitution to the stage at which we are leaving it to-day. It is as if we stand with one foot poised on the first step of a bridge, the bridge of time, which is to overcome the gap between to-day and 5 June. Looking back we see much that has been of the utmost importance in the development of the history of our country. And when we have crossed this short bridge, we shall start anew with another long road ahead of us. What that will bring, constitutionally, we do not as yet know. But we have no doubt that everything that has gone before will be a foundation for what is to come.</p>

<p>At this stage it would be fitting for me, too, on behalf not only of myself but also of all my predecessors in office, to place on record the warm and respectful esteem in which the Government and the people of South Africa have held Her Majesty&#x2019;s person, and to thank Her Majesty and, through her, all her predecessors, and pay most sincere tribute to them, for the courtesy and the consideration which they have always shown to those who have held this office. I wish to state that I have seen fit to have a message conveyed to Her Majesty, in order to make this known to her, on behalf of myself and those whom I represent. I also wish to state that I am convinced that the impending constitutional change will in no way affect the warm regard that the people of South Africa will still entertain towards Her Majesty&#x2019;s person. Nor will it in any way affect the warm regard and the close and friendly relations which exist between this country and those Commonwealth Governments&#x2014;particulary Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government in the United Kingdom&#x2014;with which South Africa has had such a long and historical association. I hope that by this tribute which is paid in all sincerity to-day, we are also laying one further foundation on which can be built: unity in South Africa and friendship with all those with whom we will remain closely associated.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, this Parliament of the Union of South Africa has itself been built on two traditions and not one. As a result of the form which our constitution and customs have taken in the past, one is sometimes inclined to think that our parliamentary tradition is exclusively British. But in reality the British example only formed part of that tradition. A tradition does not only consist of form; it is also represented by the spirit and the atmosphere of such an institution. There is much in the tradition and atmosphere of the Parliament of South Africa which we ourselves have created. We did therefore take over the tradition of the Mother of Parliament in many of our customs, but the tradition of the Afrikaner people as it developed here, also played its part, such as that represented by the spirit of freedom which inspired the Dutch Protestants and the Huguenots. The spirit of freedom which such people brought with them, also contributed towards giving this Parliament a character of its own.</p>

<p>The Parliament of the future, of the Republic of South Africa, will also be rooted in both traditions, and will inevitably be deeply rooted in the traditions of our own parliamentary past, as they have developed from the heritage of both sides. But one trunk must grow from those roots. We shall be starting with a young Parliament, but it will be a young trunk which must develop and become fertile precisely because it has such strong roots and is so bounteously nourished. It will grow and cast the shade in which a prosperous South Africa of the future will be able to sit and rest and survey the work of its hands. Just as we can rightly be proud, as hon members who have preceded me have already testified, of what this Parliament has achieved in the past, so I have no doubt that our successors will be able to be proud of the character which the Parliament of the Republic will reveal. In the future we shall also be able to be proud of what the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa has achieved for our nation and our people.</p>

<p>It will commence its new duties at a difficult time. We have no illusions about the heavy burden which both the Government and Parliament will have to carry. But we go to meet the future with our faith, our confidence and our courage undiminished because this will not be a completely new adventure for us. We shall traverse paths which have already been blazed. We know the strength of the customs we have inherited. We shall not wish to violate our democratic heritage. We believe that South Africa needs us&#x2014;needs all our resources and all our love.</p>
