<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say to the hon. the Minister this afternoon that he and his Government are being far too complacent over the housing situation in South Africa and that it is time they looked at the facts as they are and not as they claim them to be. I want to deal firstly with the economic and sub-economic categories and then I want to say something about the other categories of housing, viz., the housing of the middle and lower middle income groups. Let us take first of all the economic and sub-economic groups. The hon. member for Port Natal has quoted figures to this House&#x2014;he did so yesterday&#x2014;which showed that this Government is not keeping pace with the demand for housing. I would be interested to hear what the hon. the Minister has to say about these figures. In answer to a question which I put to the hon. the Minister early this year regarding the waiting list that he has for the three race groups which fall under his control, viz., Whites, Coloureds and Indians&#x2014;I refer to the waiting lists for economic and sub-economic houses&#x2014;he told me that the waiting lists showed a total of 78 530 families.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>What did I then say</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am coming to that; please just give me a chance. I accept the qualifications which the hon. the Minister mentioned, viz., that there is a measure of duplication, that people put their names on several lists and that this is therefore not a realistic figure. But I shall criticize him, as I propose to do in a moment, for not having produced an accurate statistical record of the actual demand for this housing. However, I shall come to that in a moment; this is another matter altogether. The fact of the matter is that there is a waiting list which is quite substantial. It may not extend to the total amount shown in these figures, viz., 78 000-odd, but it must be accepted nevertheless that there is a waiting list and that it is quite substantial. If, however, the hon. the Minister does not like figures, then I believe that there is irrefutable proof for him that he is not keeping up with the demand for this type of housing throughout the country. This irrefutable proof lies in the fact that in all the main cities of South Africa there are growing slum conditions, particularly amongst the Coloured and Indian peoples, but also amongst the Whites. He can be taken to areas in South Africa where White people are living under conditions which can only be described as slum conditions. So if the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept figures, I believe he must accept the facts, and the facts show the growing slum conditions in the major cities of South Africa, and this, I submit, is irrefutable proof of the fact that he is not keeping pace with the demand for economic and sub-economic housing throughout the country.</p>

<p>The position becomes even more worrying if we look at the future. South Africa has a higher rate of urbanization than many Western countries. The fi ures have already been quoted in this debate. At <span class="col_7337-7338" refersTo="page_0623"/>present 84 per cent of the White population is urbanized. This figure is expected to grow to 93 per cent of the White population by the end of the century. In numbers, this is about 6,6 million. The same high rate of urbanization is taking place amongst the Coloureds and the Indians, and although this Minister is not concerned with the Bantu, it is very interesting to note that this very reliable source from which I have quoted states that by the end of the century, 75 per cent of the Bantu population will be urbanized. The source is no less a person than the. Chief Director of Physical Planning of the Department of Planning, Dr. J. F. Otto, in a paper presented earlier this year to the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association. We on this side of the House would like to see proof that this Government is being realistic about the future housing needs of South Africa. It is all very well for this Minister to quote in speech after speech that South Africa is going to have to build as many houses between now and the end of the century as have been built in the last 300 years.</p>

<p>That is a very nice, interesting statistical figure but, Sir, we expect more than that from this Minister; we expect to hear from him what precisely are his Government&#x2019;s plans to cope with this tremendous housing demand in the future, having regard especially to the fact that this Government is not even able to keep pace with the present demand, let alone this future growth. Sir, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that it is high time he produced accurate statistics of the housing needs of South Africa. He has been in this post for several years, but neither he nor his predecessors have made any attempt to produce accurate statistics of the actual housing needs of the population. I believe it would not be too difficult, for example, to produce accurate waiting lists in respect of the economic and sub-economic groups. It would not be too difficult, I believe, to have one authoritative list for a region, a list on which a person&#x2019;s name is put down and. next to his name, his requirements, so that one then has a specific housing unit on that statistical record. The position, as has been explained by the Minister already, is that a man puts down his name for hiring or for buying; he puts down his name in different local authority areas, so there is a tremendous duplication. Mr. Chairman, this gets us nowhere. It helps the hon. the Minister perhaps because he is then in a position to say that these figures are not accurate and that therefore the housing position is not as bad as people seek to make out. I say it is high time that he and his Government produced accurate statistical records.</p>

<p>Let me now come to the other categories who do not fall within the economic and sub-economic groups. Sir, I believe that the Government has not even started to assist the lower middle income groups in their housing needs&#x2014;the young married couples and so on. The hon. the Minister of Finance introduced a house-owners&#x2019; saving scheme in this Budget. If I have time later in the debate, I should like to mention some criticisms of this scheme. I see that the hon. the Minister of Finance is in the House. I am glad, because I would like to address these remarks to him also. I believe that it is high time that this Government stopped playing around, each year giving a little crumb towards the amelioration of the housing situation. They must adopt a forthright and ambitious programme which will meet the housing needs of the people, and the hon. the Minister of Finance should do a great deal more thinking on this matter, because this house-owners&#x2019; saving scheme is just not sufficient.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday the hon. member who has just sat down asked me to make a statement on the report of the Niemand Commission. I will do so in the course of my speech. He also asked me to make a statement on the symposium on high density housing which we are going to have in Johannesburg, I think, in September. I wish to make the following statement in that regard.</p>

<p>A symposium organized by the National Building Research Institute of the CSIR will be held at the Wanderer&#x2019;s Club in Johannesburg on 26th to 28th September, 1972. Following that symposium, a separate seminar on the legal aspects of ownership for high density housing will be held on 29th September. The Sectional Titles Act will come under close scrutiny, and the seminar will be conducted by a panel consisting of representatives of, <i>inter alia,</i> the Department of Justice, the Department of Community Development and city councils and developers. The symposium on high density will also be attended by eminent experts from overseas countries, and the whole Republic is looking forward to <span class="col_7339-7340" refersTo="page_0624"/>the event, which will be of the utmost value to especially the local authorities and the private developers.</p>

<p>I have extended an invitation to the Community Development groups of both parties to attend that symposium.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member says that we are not keeping pace with the housing needs in South Africa. He wants me to supply figures. Sir, I have supplied those figures, not waiting list figures, which are completely inadequate, but figures worked out by sociologists and scientists, as to the housing needs of the White population group in South Africa, as well as the housing needs of the Coloured people, and what we are supplying at the moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>You do not need a scientist for that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will give those figures later on again. The hon. member says that we must be realistic about housing and that we are not keeping pace with the present demand. What nonsense, Sir! Where does he get that from? Then he says that there are increasing slum conditions in South Africa. Where does he get that from? It is just a foolish statement that there are increasing slum conditions in this country. We have never had less slum conditions in South Africa than we have at the moment. I have seen all the slum areas in South Africa. I have been right through South Africa; I have visited all these areas. Iknow what the previous position was and I know what the present position is. [Interjection.] I was there five years ago and I was there again last year. Today, in every city in South Africa, we have less slum conditions than we had previously, and the hon. member for Kensington, who made that interjection, can ask every local authority whether that is so. Sir, I challenge the hon. member for Kensington: He has a United Party city council in Johannesburg. I challenge him to get from the Johannesburg city council a statement to the effect that there are more slums in Johannesburg today than there were two years ago. Will the hon. member get that statement from the Johannesburg city council?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>He has offered to show you these conditions. Why don&#x2019;t you accept his offer?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Show me what? Sir, this is the test. What does the city council of Johannesburg say? Are there more slum conditions today, or less slum conditions? [Interjection.] Of course there are slums; we have not solved the whole problem yet. After all, the Nationalist Party is a good party, but we are not so good that we can solve every problem within five minutes. I am saying that there are less slum conditions in Johannesburg today than two years ago, or three years ago, or five years ago, and I call as my witness the United Party city council of Johannesburg.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Would the Minister deny that he has had warnings from the Johannesburg city council that the housing position for Black people and Coloured people in Johannesburg is reaching crisis proportions there?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have not had a warning like that at all. I do not want to express any opinion with regard to the housing conditions of the Black people, because it does not fall under my department. All we do is to supply the money. Bantu housing falls under the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. As far as the Coloured people of Johannesburg are concerned, I want to say to the hon. member for Yeoville that he is talking utter nonsense. I challenge him to get a statement from the Johannesburg city council that the position of the Coloured people in Johannesburg, as far as housing is concerned, is deteriorating.</p>

<p>The housing position of the Indians and Coloureds in Durban is far better than it used to be, and the reason why it is not better than it is at the moment is that we have a United Party city council in Durban; that is the only reason.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister whether he has had a complaint from the Durban City Council in regard to Duranta Road, near Wentworth?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have. The hon. member for Musgrave talked about waiting lists. Does he honestly want to tell me that he looks upon waiting lists as an accurate barometer of the housing needs in South Africa? [Interjections.] It is absolutely nonsensical. In the reply which I gave him in 1971 about waiting lists, I pointed out how inaccurate waiting lists could be. I pointed out to him that the waiting list in Kimberley was 600, while we have established scientifically that the need for housing in Kimberley was only 100 houses.</p>

<p>*Now I want to come back to the hon. member for Green Point in regard to a few matters, and I hope he will listen now. Yesterday I accused the hon. member of having laid an absolute untruth at my door. He charged me with having said&#x2014;and these were his words&#x2014;that in 1969 the housing shortage in South Africa for Whites was 4 860, and that in 1972 it was 12 165. Yesterday I proved to him from Hansard that it was totally and completely untrue that I had ever made such a statement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>It was a lie.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He said I had said that in 1969 there was a shortage of 4 860 houses, and then he ostensibly quoted to me from Hansard that I had said there was a shortage of 12 165 in 1972. I am telling him that this is untrue. He can see from Hansard that this is untrue. If he were to read what I said on these two occasions, he would know what I said and that what he accused me of is untrue. At the time I asked him to put the matter right. He did not do so. He said other members would speak on the real needs and waiting lists. Nobody spoke on those matters.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am telling the hon. member now that when he said I had said that in 1969 there was a shortage of 4 860 houses for Whites, and that I had said there was a shortage of 12165 in 1972&#x2014;I am telling him now to his face that it is not true that I said so. Now it depends on the hon. member whether or not he wants to put the matter right. I think he is in honour bound to put it right, but if he does not do so, I shall know in future what to think of this so-called honourable member.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>What is the shortage? What is the difference?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have said what it was in 1969, and in 1972 it was much less! It was most certainly not 12 000. Now I want to say this to the hon. member for Green Point. By that cunning question of his he is now trying to get out of a position which violates his honour. I am telling him it is violating his honour; but I shall leave the matter at that, and I leave it to the hon. member for Green Point to rise when I resume my seat and to say exactly what he meant. But I am telling him now that he will not.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now want to deal with the details brought to my attention by hon. members before I deal with the housing position as <span class="col_7343-7344" refersTo="page_0626"/>such, the housing position of the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians. The hon. member asked me to make the report on the Rents Act available immediately the commission reports to us. That will be done and it will be considered as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Green Point said that persons to be resettled are uncertain of their position and that they cannot repair their houses and do not know how long they will be there still. That is nonsensical. These people are given notice. They are given three months&#x2019; notice and they are given six months&#x2019; notice and they can repair their houses if they want to, because once they are resettled and their houses are bought by the Community Development Board or by the Housing Commission or by the department, they are paid out what those houses are worth. So there is no hardship whatsoever in that connection. Then the hon. member asked about the land at Blouberg. He asked me whether that land was going to be put to future use or whether it was available to the public now. No, of course it is not available to the public now, because we bought that land and there is no township there as yet.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>For how long have you been sitting on it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter. That land was bought for future housing use and we do not sit on it.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>You are sitting on it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we have plenty more land than the land at Blouberg. We have land all over the Cape Province and all over Natal and Transvaal. Why do we buy this land? To prevent the increase in land prices for future housing. We buy this land to keep it in reserve for future use for housing in South Africa, so that we are not caught up in the spiral of continually increasing prices, and what is wrong with it? What is wrong with us keeping the land at Blouberg? After all, we kept the land at Bothasig for over 12 years, and what is the position today? The position today is that at Bothasig we can supply housing and we can supply erven at a cost so low that it is practically unbelievable, because we bought that land at a very low price and we do not sell it at a profit; we sell it without profit and therefore at Bothasig today we can provide erven and houses for as little as R4 000 and R5 000 and R6 000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Is that a change of policy?</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Not selling at a profit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We have never sold land at a profit. Land that we have bought for housing has never been sold at a profit. We are planning for the future. It is absolutely a wise policy to follow. It is a long-term policy. We buy up as much land as we possibly can and keep it in reserve for future use. And that is why I encourage local authorities to do the same; I think it is a very wise policy, and a policy we shall continue with in future.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Green Point talked about my difference with local authorities, and he mentioned Stellenbosch, Pretoria and Mossel Bay. Sir, let me say this. The co-operation between my department and local authorities is as good as it can possibly be.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>And with the Minister?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>And that includes the Minister. Of course I have differences here and there. I had differences with Stellenbosch. And what was the outcome?&#x2014;That we got Cloetesdal today, where we house over 30 000 Coloured people in ideal conditions.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not give way; the Stellenbosch municipality gave way, but my relationship with the Stellenbosch municipality today is as good as it can be. But let us talk about Pretoria. What is wrong with my relationship with the Pretoria city council?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>R40 000.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Don&#x2019;t be stupid! Do hon. members think I will run away from <span class="col_7345-7346" refersTo="page_0627"/>that? I can reply to that fully if necessary. Today there is the area which is known as the frozen area in Pretoria, where I and my department co-operate with the Pretoria city council, and the co-operation is of the very best. The fact that I had a difference of opinion with Mr. Nel, the chairman of the Management Committee, has nothing to do with my co-operation with the city council of Pretoria. My co-operation is of the very best. The same applies to Mossel Bay, which the hon. member wanted to blow up as if there is a crisis between me and Mossel Bay. A mistake occurred, and it was one which could easily have occurred. It was said that they could not get the R300 000 while one of the civil servants said that they could get it. It was simply a mistake which was removed and today my co-operation with Mossel Bay is as good as can be.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It was all right before you interfered.</p>

<p>Where did I interfere?</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The Housing Commission approved and then you said &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Housing Commission did not approve. You do not know what you are talking about. You are talking so much nonsense it is absolutely unbelievable. You make me think that you are Winchester.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me why no sub-economic housing could be supplied to the Bantu in South Africa. Bantu housing is being provided by the Department of Bantu Administration. We only supply the money. No sub-economic houses are being supplied to the Bantu for the simple reason that the present houses for the Bantu which are being built by semi-skilled and unskilled labour are very cheap. There is therefore no need for sub-economic houses for the Bantu.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They are of a very poor quality.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, they are not of poor quality. I do not think the houses in Soweto are of a very poor quality. For the price which those people can afford I think those houses are of a very good quality. But this hon. member would like us to supply houses which those people cannot afford which would mean that they would have to be subsidized. Those people can afford those houses. I want to tell the hon. member that housing of the Bantu people in Soweto and the other urban areas in South Africa has never been better in the history of this country.</p>

<p>I will deal with the whole housing position raised by the hon. member for Green Point at a later stage. He asked me what the latest position was in regard to the Niemand Commission and how they were progressing with their negotiations with local authorities, the provinces, etc. I should like to read the following statement in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It gives me pleasure to state that since my previous statement, the Administrator of the Cape Province has caused a comprehensive circular, No. 48, to be issued to local authorities setting out a detailed formula for the implementation of the Niemand Commission&#x2019;s recommendation to the effect that local authorities should themselves provide trade services, i.e. water, electricity and sewerage in respect of new townships. I recommend this formula to administrators of other provinces too because it leaves ample room for negotiation between developers and! city councils without affecting the principle of the recommendation as such. The Provincial Administration of Natal will also soon make a decision in the matter as the Orange Free State did. The Orange Free State Administration has in fact at a very early stage adopted all the commission&#x2019;s recommendations. The Transvaal Administration has not moved in the matter yet, but I understand that especially in the Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging complex, the position requires intensive study because of the many local authorities in one big metropolis, so to speak. Rumours have, however, reached me from SAPOA sources that the administration of one city council in this area hopes to negotiate with SAPOA a division of responsibilties which would have the effect of relieving local authorities of the obligation to supply trade services themselves. If this rumour has any truth in it, the Government will not recognize any such action because the poor erf buyer would then still be saddled with the same heavy burden of having to pay about twice the cost of <span class="col_7347-7348" refersTo="page_0628"/>those services as an element of the erf&#x2019;s purchase price. Mr. Niemand is now busy discussing with several provincial administrations possible legislation with regard to the control to be exercised by the administrators over areas designated as areas to be urbanized and also a procedure for the collection of appreciation contributions. Much pressure is also being exercised on city councils to go into early action with township development on unplanned land owned by themselves.</block>

<p>This is as far as the Niemand Commission is concerned.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Germiston commented on the rising land prices in the urban areas. I agree with him that this is a tremendous problem in South Africa today. That is why I want to request local authorities to purchase as much land as they can possibly get hold of, and keep it in reserve for future housing. For the rest, the increasing land prices in South Africa leave us no choice but to build skywards.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Port Natal. His fulminations against my department and against me leave me absolutely cold. He asked for a commission of inquiry into my department, but he did not say what it should investigate. What should it investigate? Everything that is done by my department, is done in public, and there is no reason whatsoever to hold an investigation. The hon. member is being quite childish as far as this matter is concerned. I want to tell the hon. member for Port Natal without beating about the bush now that he knows nothing whatsoever about community development. He does not know how the machine operates; he does not have the least idea of what goes on in the department, and he does not have the least idea of what the relations between the department and the local authorities are. Nor does he have the least idea of how the Community Development Board functions. To tell the truth, I am not even sure whether he is even aware of the existence of the Development Board.</p>

<p>He knows nothing about the Housing Commission, nor does he know anything about the urban renewal schemes. The hon. member also said that we were the largest estate agent in the country. So what? What is wrong with that? Of course we own a great deal of land. In the first place, the department owns a tremendous amount of land so as to make provision for housing in future. What is wrong with that? We would be neglecting our duty if we did not own that land and if we did not acquire as much as possible of that land to protect ourselves against rising prices in future. Of course we have to purchase expensive land when we are engaged on urban renewal. How can we effect renewal in cities without purchasing land? How can we develop District 6 without purchasing land? How can we develop Jeppes, Riverside in Natal and South End in Port Elizabeth without purchasing land? Of course the department sometimes has to pay an expensive price for that land, but what is wrong with that? The hon. member knows nothing about urban renewal. He does not know what it means; he knows nothing about slum clearance. That is why he is so surprised because we are purchasing land in urban areas. How else does one clear a slum but by purchasing land and ensuring that the slum conditions do not develop further?</p>

<p>That is merely another statement the hon. member is making. He speaks the greatest nonsense imaginable; he speaks like a backward child.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I said that we do not make a profit on housing land. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District must not talk nonsense. Other land, again, we sell at a loss. With urban renewal we need a great deal of land, <i>inter alia</i> for streets, parks, schools, churches and community centres. We pay a lot of money for that land. It is true that when we sell land to private developers we do so at a profit. As <span class="col_7349-7350" refersTo="page_0629"/>far as I am concerned, the greater the profit the better, and the more I like it. This gives us more money for the development of that urban area. But the hon. member has not the foggiest idea of what all this entails. I say that there was not logic in his fulminations against my department. I shall simply pay no further heed to it. He spoke of people living in ghettoes. I shall deal with Coloured and Indian housing in South Africa later on. I just want to inform him that the Indians in the new areas are not living in ghettoes. They are living in highly developed and model townships in South Africa. Lenasia in Johannesburg is one of them; Chatsworth in Durban, another; and Laudium near Pretoria is still another. These are residential areas which are as attractive as one can find in any part of South Africa, or the world. If the hon. member knew anything about the world, he would also know this. They live in well-organized towns. No, those people are not living in ghettoes, but they all came from ghettoes created by his party when they were in power in South Africa. I need not get out of my Cadillac to see this, for I visit these areas more often that the hon. member does; I even visit Chatsworth more frequently than he does. Since I have been Minister. I have visited all these areas every year, and I shall continue to visit them in order to see what development is taking place there. The hon. member cannot tell me anything about that. To tell the truth, if he tells me that Chatsworth is a ghetto, then I cannot help wondering whether he has ever been in Chatsworth. I do not think he has ever been there.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, what a foolish question. Of course, there are still Indians who are living under unsatisfactory conditions. But we are solving this problem in a brilliant way. I shall have more to say about resettlement at a later stage. I do not want to pay very much more heed to the row that hon. member is kickin up in this House and outside. I just want to give him this piece of advice: Go and make a study of community development and everything it entails. Once the hon. member has done that he will talk considerably less nonsense.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow advocated here that the employers should do more for the housing of their Coloured employees than they are doing at the moment. Well, at the moment they are doing nothing. I am in complete agreement with the hon. member. I sometimes wonder whether it is not time a special levy was imposed on employers to assist in the provision of Coloured housing in the urban areas. They are, after all, the people who benefit from Coloured labour. If the farmers have to provide housing for their people. I see no reason why other employers should not also have to supply housing for their employees. Thus I am in complete agreement with the hon. member in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>To the hon. member for Port Elizabeth North I just want to say that I appreciate his acknowledgment of what we have done in Korsten in regard to the clearance of the slum there, and the resettlement of the Coloureds in Bethelsdorp. I am aware of the fact that there are still Coloureds in that area. But I can assure the hon. member that we are at present hard at work on the resettlement of those Coloureds.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put a question to me in regard to the 310 flats which are bein built near Sidwell, just below the railway line. His objection is that the rentals of those flats are too high. Those flats are quite luxurious flats, and I agree with him that the rentals are too high, and that certain lower income groups will not be able to occupy those flats. But there are already indications of a tremendous demand for those flats at the higher rentals: there will be no problem in letting the flats.</p>

<p>The hon. member also requested us to make better provision for the middle and lower income groups. I am in complete agreement with him. The Housing Commission studies this problem every year. The hon. member will recall that the interest rates and the income of the lower and middle <span class="col_7351-7352" refersTo="page_0630"/>income groups that are able to acquire certain houses was rather low until two years ago. The Housing Commission then went into this matter and reduced certain interest rates, and also raised certain income groups. This problem will simply have to be dealth with from time to time by the Housing Commission. I promise the hon. member that I shall bring the request he made and the idea he su gested to the attention of the Housing Commission. They will have to make the final decision in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Algoa also thanked us for the housing we have provided in Port Elizabeth. He raised certain other difficulties. The one was the question of washing lines at flats. I can give the hon. member the assurance that this is one of the problems we are trying to cope with, and that it will not be so easy to solve it. The problem is that people have to wash and dry their washing in such a way that other people cannot see it. Attention is being given to this matter; attention will definitely be given to his idea of a central washing and drying area. He then requested that no further increases in the rental of the flats in Algoa Park should be allowed. I just want to say that the increases in rentals which were introduced were the result of higher local taxes. I hope that there will be no need for further tax increases. We will o out of our way to ensure that there are no further rent increases. He then requested that a few of those flats be classified as sub-economic dwellings. This is a possibility which the department can go into. Of course there is a need for this, and they can go into the question of whether this can be done, or whether we may perhaps have to consider building other sub-economic flats. Either of the two will have to be done.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that the building limit of R6 000 for the middle and lower income groups was too low, because one simply cannot build a proper house for R6 000 today. I might inform the hon. member that this limit of R6 000 has already been increased to R7 200. In our housing schemes on the Witwatersrand, in Cape Town,&#x2014;here it is the most difficult of all&#x2014; in Port Elizabeth, and throughout the Republic we find that houses can in fact be built for R7 200. The interest and redemption. or the rental, will then be in the region of R40 to R45 per month. So we are, after all, succeeding in doing this.</p>

<p>The amount for the individual borrower has been increased. The combined building society and community development loan can be as much as R15 000. Thus the amount for the individual borrower has in fact been increased.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Jeppes asked me about Triomf. I dealt with this question of Triomf very fully in replies as given to questions he had in the Order Paper. I do not know what I can add to it. Unfortunately there were certain houses built by a certain contractor which showed very grave defects. We asked the contractor to restore those houses to a proper condition, and at the moment we have a court case going. However, we are doing everything in our power to solve the difficulty in Triomf, to get it over and done with and to get those contractors to attend to those houses. They must attend to those houses and put them in the proper condition they were supposed to be in after they were built.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Could I put a question to the hon. the Minister in regard to the question of the rentals for houses acquired by the department, which have been increased over and above the rent determination which existed. I would like to know the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s viewpoint on that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I know nothing about any increases beyond the rent determination.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Gardens referred to District Six and said that we should consider keeping the historical areas there more or less as they were in the past. When we restore and rebuild in that area, we must ensure that this is done according to the patterns as they were in the past. He mentioned certain areas which I cannot remember off-hand. I just want to assure him that when he mentioned those areas I was already well aware of them. What we are doing coincides precisely with what he desires. We know that the railings and wrought iron work are being stolen from some of the houses there. These are houses which people have vacated without <span class="col_7353-7354" refersTo="page_0631"/>notifying us. Consequently these houses are standing empty. The hon. member knows that as soon as a house stands empty in District Six the vandals converge on it and steal all those wrought iron railings, ornaments and so on. We are trying to prevent this as far as possible, but I must agree with him that this is in fact happening. We shall in future try to eliminate this. However, I want to say that we have approached the Simon van der Stel Foundation, and various other organizations, to ensure that we conserve and restore the historical part of District Six in such a way that what is of historical value may be preserved. We are doing this, as far as we are able, in consultation with those people. I just want to tell him that no one from District Six or any other area is resettled without being offered alternative accommodation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Walmer asked me when the rebuilding of South End will commence. The detailed planning of the area will be finished as soon as the land surveyor has prepared a diagram indicating the boundaries of the area. The detailed planning will be submitted in about two months&#x2019; time for the approval of the Community Development Board, the city council and the Minister. In the meantime, steps are being taken to instal the services and complete the excavation for Walmer Road. It would be possible for rebuilding to commence within about 18 months, but we are hoping that it may be sooner. Then he asked me how the land will pass into the hands of private developers. Private developers will be afforded an opportunity to obtain the land for development by tender. He asked me whether only private developers will be responsible for the development. The answer is: No, but private developers will be predominant. The board, however, will also undertake redevelopment on a large scale. Then the hon. member asked me whether the Lotus Building, which we built there for the Indian traders, has been sold. Yes, it has been sold to an Indian by way of tender. We accepted the highest tender. As far as the tenants are concerned, they will rent those premises on the same basis as they are renting them now, until their contract runs out. What will happen after that, is impossible for me to say. All I can say is, if there is any exploitation of those tenants, I will have no hesitation whatsoever to put the building under rent control. That will be the remedy. I may also tell the hon. member that we sell these buildings all over the country to Indians to own those buildings. We have no objection to that whatsoever.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Pretoria West said that Laudium, there near Pretoria, is becoming too small for the Indians and that it should be extended. We realise this and we asked the Department of Planning and the Group Areas Board to make a recommendation that that area should be enlarged. The hon. member&#x2019;s idea that high-rise buildings should be erected there because the area is too small is a sound one to which we will give attention.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District asked me about Oribi. Sir, Oribi is a military hospital complex. It was used for ex-soldiers on a temporary basis. There are no ex-soldiers staying there any more, and we are using the houses there to rent to poorer people, mostly in the sub-economic group. The structures as such cannot be made permanent; that is impossible. I hope that the time will come&#x2014;and we are now contemplating this very seriously &#x2014;when we can change the whole set-up in Oribi so that we can have proper housing units in that particular suburb. The hon. member asked for a committee to control Oribi. I do not see any necessity for that. Is that not what the hon. member asked?</p>

<p>*Now, Sir, I should like to say something about the general housing position in South Africa. Firstly I want to deal with White housing. After that I shall deal with Coloured housing, and then the resettlement of Whites, and particularly of non-Whites in South Africa. I want to say that the position in regard to White <span class="col_7355-7356" refersTo="page_0632"/>housing in South Africa is extremey satisfactory. I am pleased the hon. member for Musgrave is here, for he will now hear a few figures. I have said that it is extremely satisfactory, and to speak of a crisis in respect of housing for Whites in South Africa, is simply absurd. Sir, sitting on the Opposition side are the last people who should talk about poor housing conditions in South Africa. We inherited the most deplorable slum conditions which ever existed in South Africa from that side of the House. It is not I who say this; it is one of their own reports in 1945 which does so. Here I have the Summary of the Report, No. 8, of the Socio-Economic Planning Council of South Africa, 1945. That was when they were in power. What did these people say about housing in South Africa, as it was at the time?</p>

<p>Yes, but that was the reason why I left you. I quote from this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the case of the municipalities the council finds that such services are supplied almost without exception, but that they are usually extended to non-Europeans on a communal basis. Thus locations are often supplied with a few stand pipes and privies in selected areas, the latter sometimes being provided on as unfavourable a basis as one pail to over 100 people, whereas the minimum required, even on a nightly-removal basis, is one pail per 16 persons.</block>

<p>That is the position which was prevalent under their Government. Then it goes on to deal with housing accommodation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is largely a local government responsibility. It is a most unsatisfactory state and affects both Europeans and non-Europeans. The council staff in 1944 estimated, for the housing committee on the state of the housing situation, that the urban housing shortage in 1943 was 60 000 European houses, and 125 000 non-European houses.</block>

<p>That, Sir, was the situation in 1945, when they were in power, they who are complaining so much now. What is the situation today? They say there is a housing crisis in South Africa.

<p>Yes, it is old news, but it is none the less good news. Their own people say that to speak of a housing crisis in South Africa is simply ridiculous. That is the position we inherited, but what is the position today? Now I want the hon. member for Musgrave to listen. We had projections made by two professors, Prof. Sadie and another professor from the University of Stellenbosch, as well as by the Building Research Institute. They had to make a projection for us in respect of the housing requirements in South Africa <span class="col_7357-7358" refersTo="page_0633"/>from 1970 to 1975, from 1975 to 1980, from 1980 to 1985 and from 1985 to 1990. They concluded that the dwelling requirement between 1970 and 1975 would be an average of 26 000 residential units per annum. But in 1970 we, the Housing Commission, local authorities and the private sector, built 30 000 units. The projection for the period 1970 to 1975 was an average of 26 000 per annum, and in actual fact we built 30 000 units in 1970. In other words, we are eliminating the possible housing backlog at a rate of 4 000 units per annum. The backlog is therefore being eliminated rapidly. That is why I want to say that the position in respect of White housing in South Africa is the most favourable it has ever been in the history of South Africa. I go further and say that the housing position of the Whites in South Africa is the most favourable in the entire world. And then they talk about a housing crisis. I want to ask the hon. member for Jeppe: If he wants to tell me there is a housing crisis, why are there so many flats standing empty in Johannesburg?</p>

<p>Sir, I went through the Saturday evening newspaper to see what flats and houses were being offered; these are flats the rental of which is R40 per month and more. The flats and houses offered in that newspaper occupied a full three pages, but the demand for flats and houses only occupied 1&#x00BD; columns. That is the position in Cape Town, where there is supposed to be such a tremendous shortage of housing. But, Sir, how could it be otherwise, in view of what we have spent on housing during the last ten years from State funds? I am referring only to Whites now. During the past 10 years the local authorities have built over 25 000 houses; the Housing Commission 6 500, the Group Areas Development Board 1 256; official quarters, 1 505. A total of 34 441 residential units during the past 10 years, at a cost of R209 355 000. Sir, let us consider the various complexes in South Africa. It has been worked out that the housing requirements on the Witwatersrand for the four years from 1971 to 1975 will be 10 851 per annum. But in 1970 they had already built over 10 000 residential units, and there were over 4 000 residential units under construction; in Pretoria the requirement is 3 044, and the other figures are almost 4 000 and 352; in the Cape Peninsula the requirement is 2 307, and almost 4 000 residential units have been built. I can in this way go on to mention the figures for the Durban complex, the Port Elizabeth complex, East London, Pietermaritzburg, Bloemfontein and Kimberley. Everywhere more houses are being built per annum than are required to meet the need.</p>

<p>As far as housing for the aged is concerned, the department, in collaboration with the Churches and in collaboration with welfare organizations, is building homes for the aged which will place our elderly people in South Africa in a tremendously favourable position. The same applies to youth centres in South Africa.</p>

<p>So much for White housing. I come now to the question of Coloured housing in South Africa. Let me say at once that I <span class="col_7361-7362" refersTo="page_0635"/>am not all that satisfied with the position of Coloured housing in South Africa. Butthe plans we are working on at present, and the planning for the next seven years, will improve the position of Coloured housing in South Africa tremendously. During the past 10 years we have erected 75 710 residential units for Coloureds, at a cost of R103&#x00BD; million. I just want to mention what we are at present working on here in the Western Cape. At Kraaifontein and Brackenfell an urgent scheme of 643 terrace houses is at present under way. For the squatters of Elsies River and vicinity 1 093 terrace houses are being provided at Kleinvlei, and for the Hottentots-Holland basin 528 houses have just been erected at Macassar. The Bellville municipality is working on a scheme to provide 749 units in Bellville South. The Parow scheme comprises approximately 540 houses in Parow South and Florida. The Cape Divisional Council is working on an extensive slum clearance scheme at Elsies River. A total of 1 000 sub-economic houses have already been completed at Uitsig, and a contract for 600 economic units has been concluded. The Cape City Council has a scheme in progress for providing 2 000 houses for Coloureds at Lavender Hill to accommodate, among others, the squatters along Prince George&#x2019;s Drive. The city council ol Cape Town is annually building approximately 2 750 houses for Coloureds. I have already mentioned Wolwefontein. At Kleinvlei we are working on 1 093 residential units, under construction there. I have already mentioned Elsies River; and then there is Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain, which is at present being planned by the Cape City Council, where housing will be built for &#x00BC; million Coloureds. The scheme has already been planned. Building activities will commence within a year, and it is expected to be completed within seven years, and that 45 000 Coloured families will be accommodated at Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain in economic housing and flats, and also in sub-economic housing. Sir, this is what is happening at the moment. I expect the position in regard to Coloured housing in South Africa to be at least as favourable in seven years time as the White housing position in South Africa is today.</p>

<p>Then I want to conclude by referring briefly to the position of the resettlement of Coloureds and Indians in South Africa. Initially, when the Group Areas Act came into operation, there were 115 000 Coloured and Indian families that had to be resettled. To date, and this has been a period of approximately eight years, we have resettled 67 493; 115 000 had to be resettled, and 67 500 have already been resettled. For the Coloureds this figure is 76 544, of which 41 199 have already been resettled, and of the Indians 38 561, of which number 26 294 have already been resettled.</p>

<p>Yes. At the moment we are resettling Coloureds and Indians at a rate of approximately 8 000 families per annum. Of that number 67 000 remain to be resettled; we therefore expect, if nothing happens and the position carries on in this way, that we will within the next eight to nine years have completed the entire resettlement programme of the Government. In other words, they will all by then be settled in their own group areas. Sir, I now want to level this accusation at the Opposition, they who are always saying that they are in favour of separate residential areas in South Africa. I say to them it is mere lip service. They are not in favour of separate residential areas. They are not in favour of separate group areas in South Africa, and every time a group area is established and we resettle Coloureds or Indians, it is said that we are throwing them out into the veld. No, they are not being thrown out into the veld. Those Coloureds and Indians go to better housing than they ever had before. But <span class="col_7363-7364" refersTo="page_0636"/>every effort we make is opposed by this Opposition. Therefore, to sum up, just this. The White housing position in South Africa is more favourable than it has ever been before. That of the Coloureds is not all that favourable, but we are working on schemes which will, within a reasonably short period of time, make the position a favourable one. The same applies to the Indians, and as far as the resettlement programme is concerned, if we make the same progress we have been making up to now, this ought to have been completed within the next seven to eight years. I am proud to be in charge of such a department, and I shall, as long as I am there, continue to cope enthusiastically and energetically with these problems.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Community Development and his department on what they have done in recent years. While listening to the hon. member for Musgrave I thought how fitting it would have been if he had personally come to my constituency to contrast the position that existed during the late forties with the position that exists there today. In the whole of Cape Town I doubt whether there is any comparable place where a greater stigma attached to the name of a town as a result of slum conditions that prevailed in certain spots. I am referring here to the old area known as Goodwood Acres. Since I am involved with a municipality that can sometimes be difficult, I want to say thank you to the Minister today for having intervened at a certain stage and for having extended an invitation to the municipality to establish a State Committee for the replanning of the old Goodwood Acres. All that has remained today of that slum is the name. I want to ask the Minister whether he cannot already tell us what the new name of the Goodwood Acres area is going to be. I know that the work of the committee has virtually been completed, and I believe that by this time next year the stage will perhaps have been reached when thought can be given to the sale of plots in this new urban area.</p>

<p>While I am speaking about the question of slum clearance I should also just like to leave the hon. the Minister with this thought. If one travels overseas today and looks at the residential areas where television services have been introduced, one finds the cities virtually enveloped in aerial cobwebs. I always find those masses of aerials on the roofs of the houses throughout European cities one of the most unattractive of sights. This department, of course, does not only deal with the provision of accommodation in our urban areas. It is most certainly also involved in the appearance of our urban areas. One wonders whether the hon. the Minister cannot devise a plan, with the establishment of new towns and the clearing of slums in South Africa, so that there will be more communal aerials in South Africa when television is introduced.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder specifically whether a model cannot be made of the new towns, the names of which I do not know yet, making proper provision there for a new aerial receiving system where the service can be utilized collectively by all the inhabitants of the relative area.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to ensure that municipalities do not allow individual aerials above houses in our existing residential areas either. We must see to it that we obtain communal aerials for blocks or certain portions of towns, so that we do not have here in South Africa in future the conditions that developed in Europe and other countries.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the last sentence in the latest report of the Secretary for Community Development. There he makes the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unfortunately, however, the high cost of stands and services is at present placing home ownership beyond the reach of the middle income group.</block>

<p>In his report the Secretary states that the housing position in South Africa is as satisfactory as one could possibly expect it to be. But he says it is particularly those in the middle income group who are finding it difficult to own houses today because of the high prices of stands and buildings. It so happens that I serve on the board of directors of two of the best-known utility companies providing housing in South Africa, i.e. the Citizens Housing League and Garden Cities. Both these utility companies <span class="col_7365-7366" refersTo="page_0637"/>operate in Cape Town. Each of them has a long record of excellent service in the Cape Peninsula and vicinity. However, the stage is now being reached when it is becoming increasingly difficult for a company like Garden Cities, which will be 50 years old next year, to carry out its task, i.e. to supply housing to the middle income group in Cape Town. It so happens that by looking ahead this company has made provision for enough land for at least the next three decades. Fairly near Cape Town they have purchased the old historic 2 000 morgen Blouberg farm at a relatively low price. I do not think their activities will be handicapped as a result of a shortage of land. In the Maitland constituency, where this company also operates, and has just begun the Edgemead urban area, about 2 000 plots can be built on.</p>

<p>It has consistently been the policy of Garden Cities in the past to do its own building on at least six out of every seven plots because this company can build at least 25 per cent cheaper than the price at which housing can thus far be furnished in Cape Town by the private sector. Not only do they not build with a view to profits, but they do not make any profits out of their land either. In this way not only are the prices of stands in Cape Town kept low for the middle income group, but also the building costs for the middle income group are forced down. The present position is that Garden Cities is only able to obtain six housing loans per month from all building societies. They themselves can supply relatively little from their own resources, so that they are not able to build more than a maximum of eight to ten houses per month for the inhabitants of Cape Town.</p>

<p>At the same time the demand is still such, particularly as a result of the special service this company gives, that it cannot supply more than 25 per cent of the demands made upon this company. I personally believe that the approximately 100 houses per year that can be built in the Edgemead area can most probably be increased to 300 houses per year if the necessary loan facilities were available for individuals buying houses from this company.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister today whether it is not perhaps possible for the State also to make a contribution in this respect. This would, in particular, overcome the problem the Secretary for Community Development mentioned, especially in the Cape Peninsula. I want to request that the present R9 000 maximum loan that can be granted by building societies with State aid, i.e. a 90 per cent loan for which the State contributes 30 per cent, must be increased to about R12 000. I also want to ask that the present maximum income limit of R5 000 must be increased to R6 000 per year. The position is that this specific urban area is only an example of what was done in the past and what can still be done in Cape Town in the decades to come. The position is that in that area the plots are firstly sold at cost price. The houses are then built at cost price and in this way the middle income group is supplied with quality housing, probably unequalled anywhere else in South Africa. But at the same time this company tries to maintain a reasonably high standard. They make provision, in particular, for people falling into the R400 per month income group who perhaps hope to be earning salaries of R500 or R600 per month at a later stage. At this stage they are supplying houses at about R14 000. These houses would otherwise have cost about R20 000 in other urban areas. This company envisages a further reduction in the building costs of these houses during the next few months, and envisages supplying the same quality houses at no more than R13 000 per house. This means that if the buyer himself provides 10 per cent, he must be able to obtain a loan of R11700. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with what the hon. member for Vasco has said about the last sentence in the departmental report, that the middle class Whites in South Africa do have the worst of both worlds. They are too well-off to get State assistance, and they are not well enough off not to require that assistance, so that in practically every field they do have a very difficult time. But I want to come back to the hon. the Minister and his department and to the statements he has made. It is just as well that the hon. the Minister has the ebullient character that he has, because I do not envy him his job. I believe it is a formidable task that he has to tackle and anybody with less resilience than himself, would probably have faltered in this enormous task long ago. But the hon. the Minister is full of self-confidence and optimism, although I must say that it sometimes leads him to make very exaggerated statements. In this regard I think of a statement he made not <span class="col_7367-7368" refersTo="page_0638"/>so long ago, in November last year, when he said that South Africa &#x201C;leads the world so far as community development is concerned&#x201D;. I think that is rather an exaggerated statement, although I must admit that if the hon. the Minister is talking about the extent of uprooting of communities that his department has had to do, I have no doubt that we do lead the world. Certainly, he has done more than anybody I know to carry out literally the uplift clause in the Malan Cape Town agreement about the Indians when one thinks of the number of Indian families that have been uplifted by his department over the years.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has stated that something like 115 000 Coloured and Indian families were due to be removed, were disqualified people under the Group Areas Act and that he has already accomplished a good deal in resettling these people. He has certainly done so. During 1970 alone, according to the departmental report, something like 4 900 Cape Coloured families were removed and 2 497 Indian families were resettled under the Group Areas Act. There is an interesting sideline to this, namely that of the White families that had to be removed&#x2014;there were not very many of them&#x2014;only 12 required some assistance from his department in resettling. This shows, of course, that the White families have a far wider range of areas for residential purposes to choose from than the other two racial groups. A formidable task still remains to the hon. the Minister. There are still over 35 000 Coloured families that have to be resettled under the Group Areas Act, the majority of whom, 23 400 roughly, are in the Cape while 6 900 are in the Transvaal, and over 12 000 Indian families, of whom 6 986 are in Natal, still have to be removed. That leaves a grand total of 47 000 families that still have to be resettled under the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>I say that it would have been difficult enough under normal circumstances of natural increase in the population, ordinary urban renewal, ordinary slum clearance, to keep up with the supply of houses. But when one in addition considers what I believe to be the Government&#x2019;s positive obsession about resettling racial groups in a sort of chessboard formation of black and white squares, the hon. the Minister and his predecessors have undertaken a really gargantuan task. The result has been, unfortunately, what could only have been expected. That is to say that we have had inferior housing, because the expense and the size of the task have not made it possible to build houses of decent standard for Coloureds, Indians or Africans, the Coloureds and Indians under the sub-economic scheme and the Africans under the so-called cheap building scheme, which is not sub-economic. And, of course, we have had the development of slum conditions, whether the hon. the Minister likes it or not. The Cape, of course, has suffered particularly, because I think 50 per cent of the houses that are built by the local authority to deal with the normal population increase, are promptly grabbed by the Community Development Board in order to rehouse people under Group Areas proclamations who are being shifted from where they are already accommodated, some adequately and some, admittedly, inadequately.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It is 50 per cent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I say that 50 per cent is being grabbed by the Community Development Board. This has added enormously to the creation of what one can only call instant slums on the Cape Flats. There are areas known as Japhta&#x2019;s Farm, Mont Kreef and Hudson&#x2019;s Bush which have arisen, replacing areas like the Valley of Plentv. which the hon. the Minister has gradually cleared. Those people, I think, have mostly been rehoused in Hanover Park. They have taken much-needed houses from the ordinary Coloured population which was not living in these instant slums. By natural increase with young people getting married, these houses were badly required to house those people and also to house people who, as I say, were being cleared out of these areas. I think that these conditions have led to an acute shortage of housing. The hon. the Minister has planned a seven-year plan to overcome the situation which, I believe, should never have arisen. It is very difficult to get it across to this Government, that although it is true that areas like District Six and at Simonstown have very bad slum areas, many of the houses in those areas were perfectly reasonable houses. For a minimum of expense these houses could have been improved and, what is more, slum clearance could have been done <i>in situ.</i> It is not necessary to uproot entire communities and to plant them miles away from where they used to live. For the Minister of Community Development to be busy <span class="col_7369-7370" refersTo="page_0639"/>breaking up communities, is to me one of the ironical features of this Government&#x2019;s policy. It is not only in the Cape that we have this tremendous housing shortage, particularly for Coloured people; on the Witwatersrand there are 3 000 Coloured families waiting for housing. Some of them have been waiting for four or five years already. Johannesburg&#x2019;s difficulties are increasing all the time. I do not know when the hon. the Minister last visited areas like Kliptown in Johannesburg, and Noordgesig. All these areas were supposed to be due for urban renewal. They are the most appalling slums today and the situation is constantly becoming worse by the fact that thousands of Coloured people from the Cape, particularly from rural areas, are pouring into Johannesburg, where, of course, employment opportunities are much greater.</p>

<p>This brings me to my next point. That is what seems to me to be an abysmal lack of liaison between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department of Community Development, the local authorities and employers&#x2014;if you like to put it that way. With the declaration of industrial areas there never seems to be any anticipatory intelligent planning, so that where huge industrial areas are declared, areas are set aside at the same time for residential areas where employees can be housed. Unless some form of co-ordinated liaison is engaged on, I see a continuation of the situation of slum development despite all the efforts, and they are genuine efforts, by the department to do something about clearing up the existing slums. I do not know why it is not possible for the local authorities and the Minister&#x2019;s department to liaise and to see that there is anticipatory planning so that housing is built, more particularly sub-economic housing for the lower income Coloured people. The hon. the Minister does claim that he is on very good terms with the local authorities, and I do not for an instant question that, but something is lacking in the planning of his department. He has complained that he has inherited very bad slum conditions from the previous Government. I agree with him. Slum conditions were appalling. There had been no building during the war years, either in the African townships or in the Coloured and Indian areas. For that reason the Government did inherit bad slum conditions. I might mention that that hon. Minister was an M.E.C. for the Transvaal province at that time, and that he was a member of the United Party. Therefore, he could have used his not inconsiderable influence to see that something was done about this appalling position.</p>

<p>It is not true. What is happening here? What is happening in a city like Johannesburg? Surely the hon. member knows that different group areas have been declared for all the various race groups in South Africa. Where those people are unsuitably placed in their areas, they are removed in a very orderly and civilized way. Moreover, they are settled in other declared areas in accommodation which is 100 per cent luxurious in comparison with what they have been used to. The hon. member knows this. Take an area like Lenasia. The hon. member did not talk about Lenasia today.</p>

<p>She is ashamed in front of the world, because what she said here in this House, did not come true. Today Lenasia is developing into one of the finest Indian residential areas in Johannesburg. Let me say that I am in contact with these people&#x2014;they are in my constituency. There is much gratitude, appreciation and praise for what this Government is doing for those people. Go and look at those houses. When we started with this project, this hon. member said we were taking these people 18 miles out of Johannesburg and dumping them at a remote place. What is happening today? Those people are grateful to have that housing. They have everything there which they could wish for on God&#x2019;s earth. There are beautiful houses. They have wonderful schools. A fine technical high school is being built for those people now. They have all the facilities a community can hope to have. But what did this hon. member do? She spoke of slum conditions. Did the hon. member speak for one moment of the slum conditions still existing in Page View? She remains as silent as the grave about that. Did she talk of the slum conditions still existing in places such as Fordsburg and Ophirton, which we are clearing up? No, Sir, she is the spokesman here for the rich slum landlords of Johannesburg.</p>

But if the local authority does not come forward with schemes for clearing up these conditions, how is the Minister to do so? In that case he must intervene as he did intervened in District Six, in Page View and ! those areas. Then he must do this, and when he does they must not allege that <span class="col_7373-7374" refersTo="page_0641"/>this Minister and this Government deal harshly with these matters. No, Sir, I cannot agree. We also travel through the country and see what is going on. As far as this matter is concerned, this Government has a record of which the heavens would be proud. We need not take a back seat to anyone in the world as far as this matter is concerned. Our country and our people live in very good circumstances.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>If it is in your constituency, I want to say that the shortage of 1 230 houses in Natal which the hon. the Minister mentioned, must probably be in your constituency. But, Sir, let me say this to you: I have lived in this country under a United Party Government as well. In those days my constituency included areas such as Fordsburg. Braamfontein and Vrededorp, and you should have seen where the people lived at that time. Those people lived in shanties in backyards. That was the accommodation they had at that time. I challenge any member on that side to show me where people are still living under those conditions today.</p>

<p>But, Sir, let us be honest. As far as our young people are concerned, particularly the young married couples living in flats today, there is a need for a house of their own. Although they do have a place in which to live, there is a need among those people to have their own house and their own piece of land. I want to associate myself today with others who have also pleaded for those younger people. I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Germiston said and bring this matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister once again. I did so last year, but I want to do so again this year. In the southern parts of Johannesburg there are still huge pieces of vacant land which may be purchased. I want to say that no matter how difficult it may be to do so today because of our financial position, the Minister should include this matter of purchasing that vacant land and reserving it for future housing, particularly for our lower and middle income groups, on a list of priorities. In this regard I have in mind especially the young man who has to start a family today. Let us give him a small house there with a piece of land as well. It should be a house which is planned in such a way that as his family grows, he may enlarge that house so that he canrear a larger family there eventually. I want to plead for that with the Minister.</p>

<p>Then I want to say I am very grateful to see what is being done for the Coloured community, especially in my constituency. We know that as yet everything is not as perfect as we should like it to be; streets still have to be made, etc., but those people have much gratitude and appreciation for the houses that have been built and that will still be built. Generous provision is also being made for all sorts of other facilities, such as schools, etc. There is much appreciation among those people. That is why I say that this Government is a government which cares for all sections of the population. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to deal with some of the matters raised by the hon. the Minister. One finds it somewhat difficult to assess and to try to concentrate on the matter he raises when he addresses this House like a threshing machine. He threw out a lot of chaff, and I do not know how much really good grain was left behind when he had finished speaking. First of all, he challenged us in the course of his speech to refer to slums in the Johannesburg area. That has been done; it has been done by the hon. member for Langlaagte. I interjected and asked the Minister whether he had not heard about Kliptown and he had never heard of it. He also asked whether we would get a report from the Johannesburg City Council. I shall give him the report now; we do not have to wait to get it. We have it in our possession, and that is the reason why we raised this with the hon. the Minister. I quote from the report. This is referred to as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An area which has recently been incorporated into the municipal area. It adjoins a vast tract of land destined for <span class="col_7375-7376" refersTo="page_0642"/>Coloured housing development, which has been purchased by the Department of Community Development through its community development board. The personal view is expressed that the situation has become explosive and that the construction of houses at a tempo of at least 1 500 units a year will have to be built by the council and the Department of Community Development if trouble is to be forestalled. At the moment the Council has not been successful in obtaining the necessary funds to embark upon a small housing scheme of 367 units already approved for an area of land nearby in this vast residential complex.</block>

<p>* Where are the available funds? The hon. member for Langlaagte said that if schemes are submitted for the clearance of slums, the funds would be available. But they are not available to the Johannesburg City Council.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I raise this because it is all very well to sit here and blame the Johannesburg City Council. The Johannesburg City Council is doing what it can; it is asking for support, and then the Minister says: &#x201C;Where are the slums?&#x201D; Well, here is one.</p>

<p>You did. You asked us to bring proof from the Johannesburg City Council. You asked us to bring a statement from the Johannesburg City Council. Do you not remember saying that? But let me go further and refer to <i>Rapport</i> of 23rd April, 1972. It refers to the Coloured community&#x2019;s reaction to certain new houses being built by the department. We have already warned this Government that they are creating new slums with the housing being constructed in many cases. I quote from <i>Rapport</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Kleurlinggemeenskap verwerp die soort huise wat gebou gaan word. Sommige van die huise het net een buitedeur, geen badkamer, plafonne of binnedeure nie, en sommige van die vertrekke het geen vloere nie. Daar moet op die kaal grond gelewe word.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they do not know what is going on. Sir, let me refer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement about the improvement in housing. I said in my speech&#x2014;and he will see it in my Hansard&#x2014;that I concede that there has been considerable improvement in certain respects. I believe that there has been an improvement, and I said so in my address yesterday to this Committee. But when he speaks about flats being vacant, does he realize what he is talking about? There are plenty in Green Point just on the outskirts of the City of Cape Town, in Somerset Road, but what is their rental? It costs R110 for a bachelor flat, or R120 for a two-roomed flat. Three-roomed flats are available at R169. Who can live in those flats? We are concerned about the person in the R5 000 bracket&#x2014;referred to. I think, by the hon. member for Vasco &#x2014;the man who is earning R400 to R500 a month, and has to keep a family. According to standards he should be able to have a house at between R80 and R90 a month, a complete house, and not one or two rooms. That is the problem that we are not solving, with all our arguments about figures. I have nothing to retract of what I said earlier this session. I gave the hon. the Minister references to the answers which he had given, upon which I based my assumptions as to what the housing needs are. Those housing needs still exist, and there is nothing for me to apologize to the hon. the Minister about.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister must not start being noisy; it does not impress anybody. I want to ask him a <span class="col_7377-7378" refersTo="page_0643"/>question which he has avoided. He has avoided the question regarding the profiteering which is going on in Indian declared group areas. I told him of the price which is now being asked for land in Rylands. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that he and his department and the council have, as far as I know, in the last five years built nothing more than approximately 50 houses in the Rylands Indian area. There is a vast number of Indians who have to go there, seeking accommodation. They have to pay what is being asked there by private landlords, Indian landlords who have taken possession. Where is the control of this property to ensure that accommodation will be available at reasonable prices to those who need it? No wonder we have Lenasia cases when the temptation of bribes is placed before officials by people who want to get a little priority so that they can get a house. Sir, that emphasizes the urgency and the need of accommodation.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, the hon. the Minister made some rather amazing statements. He first of all said that his department never sells property, which it has purchased for housing, at a profit. Well, there are vast numbers of instances which have come to light in reply to questions in this House&#x2014;for instance, the property bought at Somerset Strand for R6 000 and sold for R100 000; that, of course, is not selling &#x201C;at a profit&#x201D;; then there is the fact that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department recently acquired a house in Jeppes and told the tenants that they could remain there, but the department put up the rent which had already been fixed by the Rent Board, and said that the return which the department required was 12&#x00BC; per cent on the money invested, which is more than a landlord can get from the Rent Board on his capital.</p>

<p>And they do not pay rates.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The department, as my hon. friend says, does not pay rates, but it gets 12&#x00BC; per cent. These things are continuing, and the Minister is not doing anything to curtail them.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to refer to Blouberg. In the middle of last year the hon. the Minister took me to task because I queried the purchase of this ground for R750 000. His statement to the Press was that he had refused to sell this ground to property developers &#x201C;because we want the land for much-needed housing development&#x201D;. When I ask him when he bought it, how long his department is going to keep this land, and when they are going to sell it, he says, &#x201C;That does not matter; we are going to keep it for some time in the future.&#x201D; But in the meantime, while he sits on that area of ground, the price of land in the neighbourhood is going up and up, because there is not enough to meet the demand. If the hon. the Minister put this 1 000 morgen on to the market and turned it into a township, he would do a great deal to stabilize the price of land in that area of the Peninsula, and he could do that also in other areas instead of sitting on land. We have told the hon. the Minister that we accept that he has an enormous task, but he must not come to this House with generalities and try to get away from the fact that there are difficulties which are still not being tackled and which are still not being overcome. The major difficulty remains, and nothing is being done by this Government to assist the man earning R5 000 a year to be able to acquire a house without having his house mortgaged for the rest of his days. That is where something can be done. We have suggested means whereby it can be done over and over again, but this Government turns a deaf ear to every one of those proposals, which have come not only from us, but from the building societies, from financial institutions and from property developers. This Minister just turns his deaf ear to those proposals and does nothing about them.</p>

<p>Sir, I must say that up to now one has had to exhaust oneself hunting amongst the speeches of members of the Opposition to try to find something constructive and positive in them. All I could find up to now has been a reproachful compliment which the hon. member for Green Point gave the hon. the Minister about the fact that at least he had now appointed a commission to go into the question of rent control, an aspect the Opposition has allegedly been advocating for so long. I want to ask the hon. the Minister today whether he would not give us the assurance that he will see the evidence the commission gathers against the background of the silent majority, i.e. those thousands upon thousands of tenants of properties in South Africa who are not organized into associations and consequently did not give co-ordinated evidence before this commission either. This perhaps <span class="col_7379-7380" refersTo="page_0644"/>sounds unnecessary to the hon. the Minister, but it is nevertheless necessary for us to give the repeated assurance from time to time that the whole object of this total investigation into rent control is not the rapid abolition of rent control. It surprises me that the hon. member for Green Point expressed the wish here&#x2014;actually demanded&#x2014;that he hoped that when that commission&#x2019;s report became available the Cabinet would immediately announce its standpoint in connection with that report. We are used to that hon. members opposite being, as a rule, terrible sticklers when it comes to the functions and the powers of this House, particularly with respect to reports of this nature and their implementation. One wonders whether it is perhaps because they do not want to express their own standpoint on the question of rent control that they are now so anxious for the Minister to announce the Cabinet&#x2019;s standpoint, even if he does so in the recess. Here we are dealing, to an increasing extent, with the fact that on the one hand there are continual allusions being made to rent boards and the action they take, while on the other hand the hon. member for Durban Point comes along, and I do not blame him for that, and continually advocates more control measures in respect of housing. Let us now for once say a little more than we do by merely mentioning this magic formula each time, i.e. that the supply and demand must determine the price. Then we can surely discuss this matter.</p>

<p>I want to come to the hon. member for Port Natal and tell you, Sir, that as a member of this House I was really ashamed yesterday at the conduct of that hon. member in the House. To remind you of what he said I just want to quote one paragraph from his speech. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">If the hon. the Minister or any other member on the Government side cared to get out of their Cadillacs and Buicks and pay visits to some of the ghettos he has established for Coloureds and Indians, they would soon see that the attitude of the people living in these ghettos towards the White race has undergone a change in the last few years which is shocking in the extreme. I want to say this to the hon. the Minister, and I hope he takes notice of it, although I must admit it is a very remote hope, that I want to tell South Africa that the threat of terrorism on our borders will be as nothing compared with the frustration, the bitterness and the absolute dislike that the occupants of these particular townships now hold for the White race in South Africa.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Sir, do you see why this hon. member is already known to the Indians as the &#x201C;darling&#x201D; of the extremists? He must apparently come and earn his curry here with that bitter gossip-mongering of his in this House. Meanwhile this hon. member merely demonstrates to us his frustration, which emanates from that nagging ambition of his within his own party framework in Natal, and in that frustration of his he does not scruple to come and fan up the flames of reckless hate in this House. What are now the facts in connection with these so-called ghettos the Government is establishing? Do yon know that with the resettlement of Coloureds from Goodwood Acres, to which the hon. member for Vasco has also just referred, a survey of the situation of those people a few years ago showed us the following: That 5 per cent were without employment, 15 per cent earned up to R20 per month, 20 per cent between R20 and R30 per month, 20 per cent between R30 and R40 per month, 10 per cent between R40 and R50 per month, 10 per cent between R50 and R60 per month and the rest earned more than R60 per month. Fifty per cent of the families had fewer than four children, 30 per cent had four or five children, and 20 per cent had six or morechildren. I now want to ask that hon. member in his bitterness: Should the Government have established houses there whichwere adapted to the financial capacities of the people or should it have established houses which were absolutely beyond the financial capabilities of the Coloureds? Hon.members will remember the recent public outcry by the lounge liberalists of his kind and the English Press about the squatters&#x2019;&#x201D; position in &#x201C;The Valley of Plenty&#x201D;. And what happened when the department said that the municipality could give preference to the resettlement of these people in Hanover Park? Then their next cry was that the people are being placed in houses that they cannot afford. They now have a roof over their heads but have to go to bed on empty stomachs. What must the Government do to satisfy such people, who are the spiritual allies of that hon. member? I want to state here that he does not want to be satisfied. In that hon. member&#x2019;s blind hate against this Government he is out-bidding <span class="col_7381-7382" refersTo="page_0645"/>the agitators in South Africa. He is playing this reckless game to unleash amongst the Coloureds as much hate as possible against this Government. Does the hon. member not realize that in that consuming bitterness of his he is fanning flames of a fierce hate against the Whites in South Africa as a whole? Unfortunately this hon. member is not the only one who is guilty of this offence.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow referred yesterday to slum conditions which this Government inherited and had to clear up. Then there was a chorus of voices on the opposite side which asked: What about Elsies River? Let us now test this Government against the Opposition as far as Elsies River is concerned. Are hon. members opposite conveniently unaware that re-development in Elsies River has already begun? This re-development will take place at an estimated cost of R50 million over a period of 10 years. To be able to do this effectively from a departmental point of view that area has been frozen. Do hon. members not know of the agitation and incitement in Elsies River against these steps? Even the Fire Brigade was pelted with stones in the normal course of its duties and water pipes were cut. Who are the biggest agitators in Elsies River today other than the Opposition&#x2019;s political playmate, i.e. the Labour Party? Why only this year that same labour party took hon. members on that side on excursions through the Peninsula. Have we ever heard a sound from that side condemning the agitation that exists there? It is all very well to shout: What about Elsies River? But what do we hear from hon. members on that side? Have hon. members heard any sound in that connection from the hon. member for Wynberg. the hon. member for Newton Park or the hon. member for Johannesburg North who received Mr. Currie of the Labour Party and his lieutenants with so much of a swagger and a holier-than-thou air?

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is quite remarkable that when there are complaints here about housing shortages they are specifically made by the representatives of the United Party city councillors. They ought to know by this time that the provision of housing, whether economic or sub-economic, is an obligation that rests in the first place on those municipalities. They must make that land available, and they surely know that if the land is available the Department of Community Development will make the necessary funds available. Now there is continual talk of the waiting lists that exist. It is understandable that there will be a waiting list for economic houses in South Africa. Those houses can be bought at the deposit of R200, and where else in the world can one buy a new house at the deposit of R200? I think that is one of the reasons why there is a waiting list for such houses. We are also grateful that our people are, in fact, properly aware of the possibility of owning their own property. But even it there were an abundance of those economic houses standing empty the United Party members would again complain and accuse the Government of wasting money. On this occasion I should like to convey my personal thanks, and the thanks of Boksburg, to the hon. the Minister of Community Development and his department for what has been done in respect of housing in Boksburg. Having said this, I immediately want to add that in the past few years we have obtained a total of 220 additional sub-economic dwelling units. This is in the form of a fine block of flats in which the majority of our aged are being housed. In addition 900 economic houses have been completed in the past two years in one single suburb, i.e. Vandyk Park. It is truly a garden city, and I am glad the hon. the Minister had the opportunity of paying it a visit, and I think that if all municipalities followed the example of the Boksburg municipality, which is a National-controlled municipality, by giving attention to the layout of a residential area, as was done there at Vandyk Park, we would obtain residential areas of which not only the inhabitants, but also South Africa, can be proud. Although these are economic housing schemes, they compare with the best of our other most expensive residential areas. There is also a happy group of people living there. I want to say to the credit of the Department of Community Development that there we have lovely tiled-roof houses, some of which are four-bedroomed houses, built at an average cost of R6 000 or a little more. The repayments people have to make there, including those for the stand, are no more than R45 per month. The Minister and I made inquiries there and we could not find any person who paid more than R45 per month for his house and the stand. What an achievement this is! But then there are still complaints about expensive housing. I think it is a snobbistic attitude being <span class="col_7383-7384" refersTo="page_0646"/>adopted by some of our people, because I would not mind living in one of those houses. If there is ever to be a monument erected to the National Party, it can be said to have been erected there in Vandyk Park in Boksburg with that economic housing scheme.</p>

<p>I should like to mention another local matter to the Minister. It concerns Reiger Park, the Coloured area of Boksburg. At present about 12 000 Coloureds are housed in this township. Those Coloureds have already been in Boksburg for eight or nine years. When the group area for Coloureds was established there at Boksburg, a group area for Indians was established at the same time at Benoni. The understanding was that the Coloureds of the East Rand would go to Boksburg and the Indians to Benoni. I want to say at once that I think the Boksburg Municipality met all its obligations, under difficult circumstances, in respect of those Coloureds. Unfortunately one cannot say the same for the Benoni Municipality, which is a United Party-controlled municipality. As far as I am concerned it looks more like a case of obstreperousness there. Adequate provision is not being made for the Housing of those Indians. Though we have this Coloured area at Boksburg, there are still numerous Indians and Chinese merchants, and this is creating problems for our Coloureds. In all fairness to the Coloureds of Boksburg I want to say that the situation there is promoting friction against those Indians and Chinese. Not only that; it is also creating frustration, because in their own group area they are being deprived of the opportunity to fully realize themselves in respect of the establishment of businesses by the presence of other race groups.</p>

<p>While I am speaking of the Indians in the Coloured area, I should also just like to ask the hon. the Minister whether attention could not again be given to the Indian merchants in Boksburg. I know it is not the Government&#x2019;s policy to deprive anyone of his livelihood, but I think the Benoni Municipality has had long enough to also do its duty in respect of the obligations entrusted to it and which it undertook to comply with. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not want to take a serious look at Benoni and ensure that they do what they ought to be doing there. If they do not want to, the hon. the Minister must use his powers and himself develop that area for the housing of the Indians there.</p>

<p>There is also another matter I want to refer to, a matter which has already been discussed on previous occasions. This concerns Indians that enter our White areas by surreptitious means; they manage this because unscrupulous Whites take out licences for them so that there are business undertakings which are registered in the names of Whites, but which actually belong to Indians. I know that this matter has already been discussed on previous occasions, and the hon. the Minister told us that it is difficult to ascertain ownership at all times, and that the Police have a special division dealing with those matters. Since the Department of Economic Affairs is now drafting a new Companies Act, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether a plan cannot be devized to plug those loopholes so that those Indians will be prevented from obtaining business undertakings by those means.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Tygervallei challenged this side of the House in regard to the investigation of the rents Act. I want to record firmly and unequivocally that this side of the House has never pleaded for the abolition of the Rents Act. We have never pleaded for the abolition of rent control. Obviously it is impractical in a country with a shortage such as we have of low rental accommodation, simply to do away with rent control. We have never ever suggested it, and let that stand on record without question. We have said that it could be looked at, that there are aspects that could well be considered. That is now being done. But I do not think he needs to appeal to the hon. the Minister to take into account the tenants, because the hon. the Minister would not last one minute in this House if he came with a Bill to abolish rent control. His own side and this side will slaughter him immediately. I am quite sure and I agree with the hon. member that the silent majority must be looked at.</p>

<p>Yes, so much that the Nationalist Party even went to the trouble of publishing photos of some of the slums. Now say &#x201C;ia&#x201D; again! The hon. the Minister knows this propaganda photo of a slum, headed: &#x201C;remember the squatters hovels <span class="col_7385-7386" refersTo="page_0647"/>and those disgraceful slums&#x201D;, &#x201C;races all mixed up&#x2014;living cheek by jowl&#x201D;. This is a Nationalist Party propaganda booklet. They published photos to show the slum conditions under the United Party. Here they published another one, but what is in the background? In 1948 the United Party fell out of power, but in the background there is a 1952 model motor-car. That hon. Minister is a member of a party responsible for a false, a lying and a fake photograph, purporting to show slums in the days of the United Party, but the Nat. organizer was not quick enough to get his car out of the way when this photo was taken. That is the notice we can take of the hon. the Minister and his reference to slum conditions under the United Party. It is worth just as much as that photo.</p>

<p>The hon. member did refer&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;to a report by a planning council set up by the old United Party Government, a socio-economic planning council amongst whose tasks was the collation of the data that is required for housing. His Government, however, abolished that council. Our complaint is that that Minister does not know what the needs are. He is not planning ahead but is trying to score cheap debating points between waiting lists and shortages, both of which he arbitrarily draws up himself and which he says cannot be compared. The hon. Minister says a waiting list is meaningless and that it is difficult to establish what the real figure is. Therefore, he says, he must take an arbitrary figure of actual housing shortages. I test by the facts. I have been trying for two years to house one person, one Indian person, who, with his wife, his three children&#x2014;there are now five&#x2014;were evicted in 1966. They have been living in a garage ever since. I took it up in 1970 and I took it up again last year. I find that this person&#x2019;s number on the waiting list with the Durban City Council is 28 199. That is his number on the waiting list. I challenge the hon. Minister to find out what number on the waiting is now being allocated; I challenge him to do so during the discussion of this debate&#x2014;it is a pity that it is too late now. I challege him to deny that it will be somewhere over 8 000 or in the vicinity of 8 000.</p>

<p>In Durban. What does the City Treasurer say? He says, and I quote from a letter of the 8th September last year:</p>

<block name="quote">For the past few years it has been the policy to allocate all accommodation at Chatsworth under the direction of the Department of Community Development for resettlement purposes. For this reason it will take a considerable time before it is possible to catch up with the backlog, nor will it be possible for me to assist him for some considerable time.</block>

<p>That is the test that I apply. I do not refer to the number of figures that are on the waiting list, but to how long you have to wait if you do not have a roof over your head. I have taken up case after case on behalf of Indians with responsible jobs. This man has worked for 20 years for one firm and he is now living in a garage. Because he has not been displaced to make room for somebody in a pretty blue-print, he has no right to a house and he can go on living in a garage until they have shifted another 70 000 or 80 000 people. What the Minister is doing is making the shortage greater. He is adding another 70 000 or 80 000 to the shortage that does exist. Then the hon. Minister says that there is no shortage for Whites. He referred to the Old Mutual flats in Cape Town. I notice that he did not refer to Mutual Beach Centre in my constituency. He did not refer to that. He does not know about it. This is an uncontrolled building that I have been negotiating about for a long time. This building has been sold and the flats are now being sold. The flat does not fall under rent control. The owners gave me an assurance and they have given his department an assurance that they will not evict anyone so as to sell their flats. They do not need to. They just put up the rents, time after time. Tenants have applied to the Minister&#x2019;s department and they say that there is nothing abnormal about the rent. The last increase was something like R18 per month; and it means that the rent has gone up by R39 during less than a year. For a two-bedroomed flat people now have to pay R144 per month.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Now the law has been changed to deal with that. What does the Minister do? He exempts the empty flats in Kangelani from rent control. It is the very building which led to the introduction of the intimidation section into the Rents Act. When I took up the matter, the Minister said it was to provide holiday accommodation for the lower and middle income groups. They say in advertising, &#x201C;If you sublet your flat five months of the year at current holiday flat rentals, the revenue received could comfortably meet your total year&#x2019;s repayments of bonds and loans&#x201D;. Yes, Mr. Chairman, at R80 per week in season and R60 for a four-bed apartment&#x2014; holiday flats for the lower and middle income groups! Surely what comes first is housing people who need homes. Here I give an example of where people by pressure had to leave one building and move into another. Now, with rents going up and up, they have had to move out of that one as well. That is. I believe, far more important that shuffling people around like on chess board, so that you will have neat lines and everybody can live smartly and cleanly within their defined area. Let us house people first. When I took up the Question of the conversion of buildings from residential accommodation into holiday flats, the Minister said it was no problem. I listed 20 buildings in my constituency alone that have been converted or demolished recently; but there is no problem to the Minister.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this, I want to ask the hon. the hon. the Minister something. I give him full marks for this: Before he gives a demolition permit, he makes it a condition that the existing tenants must be offered resaonable alternative accommodation. I ask him to go one step further and to make it a condition of the permit that the tenants be advised of that. The tenants are not told; the landlord simply sends them a letter, saying, &#x201C;We have got a demolition permit; you must be out in six months&#x2019; or a year&#x2019;s time&#x201D; or whatever the period is. I accept the period is reasonable. I ask for a warning to the tenants. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when people prove geometric theorems they usually write &#x201C;<i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>&#x201D;. The hon. member for Durban Point&#x2019;s <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i> was lacking when he referred to the photograph and tried to prove that there were no slum conditions under their rule. The big resettlement in this country in actual fact only began in 1962, because there was such a huge amount of work that had to precede it. I am thinking of the things they allowed in their days. Does he no longer remember the squatter camos of all races and colours around the big cities? There is nothing funny, surely, in presenting a photograph of slum conditions in which a 1955 motor-car features. In any case, I like his sense of humour.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come to another matter. The hon. member for Green Point said that the middle income group in our country is experiencing difficulties. This is true to a certain extent. I conscientiously believe that in respect of housing the department has done as much as could possibly be done under the circumstances. I want to congratulate the department and the Minister on what has been done. To come back now to the middle income group&#x2014;the Franzsen Commission actually found years ago that municipal services were becoming extremely expensive and that this is an encreasing trend, because the services are being provided to a decreasing extent by local authorities and to an increasing extent by private developers. Mr. Chairman, subsequently the Niemand Commission found in its report in 1970, findings absolutely independent of those of the Franzsen Commission, that the <span class="col_7389-7390" refersTo="page_0649"/>tremendous price increase was an aggravating factor in respect of the sale prices of plots. The reason for that is the following: Because the private developer is developing these residential stands and providing the services there, he wants to make a profit and also cover the costs he incurred in respect of those services that were furnished. These people must pay 43 per cent taxes and then they expect a return of 60 per cent. That is what such a person wants on the money he spent on these services, plus the interest on that money, plus a certain additional risk levy. This means that in some cases the purchaser of such a plot has to pay as much as twice what the plot cost the developers. The average cost of supplying services to a plot of about 12 000 square feet is a net R2 000. If one now doubles this it works out at about R4 000, which is added to the purchase price of the building site. The Niemand Commission&#x2019;s recommendation is that the local authority should itself supply the commercial services, i.e. the provision of water, electricity and sewerage installations. Those costs must be recovered over a period of 20 to 30 years, by way of levies on the owner. In this way each new urban area pays for its own services without an extra levy on the rest of the taxpayers in such a municipality. It would then become so much cheaper to obtain these stands.</p>

<p>In order to obtain successful results from the Niemand Commission&#x2019;s report, and obtain these results quickly, it is absolutely essential for local authorities themselves to jump in to develop towns, thus making stands available at reasonable prices, particularly to the middle income groups. The Slums Act was specifically amended in such a way last year as to entrust to local authorities the duty of providing not only dwellings, but also residential stands to the inhabitants of these local authority areas. The urban local authorities, except that of Johannesburg, have a great deal of undeveloped land, so much so that they can meet the needs for five years. This bottle-neck that exists can very easily be overcome by means of the provision of plots within the reach of the middle income groups, and this problem can really be solved very quickly if local authorities only have the will to do so in accordance with the findings of the Niemand Commission. The Transvaal urban areas in particular are the ones that have major objections. They state that they themselves do not have the money to provide these commercial services for new towns. One actually gets a bit jealous, particularly when one looks at the northern areas of Cape Town, where extensive development is taking place. They have overcome this problem by applying a system whereby developers lodge deposits with local authorities. They then obtain a guarantee that they will receive repayments as the area develops.</p>

<p>As far as the establishment of towns by local authorities themselves is concerned, this is probably not an insurmountable problem either, because if they can find no help anywhere else, they can still always turn to the Department of Community Development for assistance. The Pretoria City Council is in the privileged position of being the delegate of the Community Development Board, and it therefore works with the department&#x2019;s loan capital in any case.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to our local authorities to find a way&#x2014;and this can be done&#x2014;to make land more readily available at prices which the buyer can afford. These individuals from the middle income group are the ones that really need help. If our local authorities work along these lines they will be able to solve this problem to a very large extent. I believe the Niemand Commission has the solution to these problems, and I believe that if these findings were made applicable we would have much fewer problems with respect to expensive land.</p>

<p>I want to come to another matter, and this matter is of a more local nature; it concerns Lady Selborne. The Pretoria Municipality has various areas, which have been vacated by non-Whites, which they can develop, and Lady Selborne is one of these areas. I want to ask the Minister if he knows what success the Pretoria Municipality has had in carrying out the planning, and if there is something we can do to expedite matters with respect to the development of Lady Selborne.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope to deal with the hon. member who has just sat down, and other members who have spoken on that side of the House, during the course of my speech. I should, however, like to refer at once to the hon. member for Tygervallei, who is unfortunately not here at the moment. He had much to say and he seemed very pleased with himself, but I want to say that the most terrible conditions exist in his constituency. I know that these people I refer to are not his voters, but they are his responsibility. The conditions in which the <span class="col_7391-7392" refersTo="page_0650"/>Coloureds adjacent to the D. F. Malan Airport live are, I think, indescribable. One has only to go past there, especially after the rains, to see the conditions in which these people have to live.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the question of District Six. I am glad to see that there is a new Deputy Minister, the hon. member for Germiston, taking notes in the Minister&#x2019;s bench. Urban renewal is taking place in District Six, and, as I have said before, the hon. the Minister finds himself in a cleft stick as far as this area is concerned. He is trying to apply an urban renewal scheme and the Government&#x2019;s colour ideology at the same time. He is, of course, finding it difficult and, in fact the situation is becoming impossible. At the present moment I think we have reached a stalemate; things are not moving at all. The hon. the Minister said he would be able to settle the Coloureds in seven years, but it has been estimated by those in the know that at the present rate, it will take between 25 and 50 years. The point I should like to make here, is that we should face up to facts and see what is happening today, as a result of the Government&#x2019;s policy. When one goes through the area, one finds a condition of deteriorating housing. The buildings are deteriorating to such an extent that they are becoming unhygienic and dangerous. Most of the buildings there are built of a sun brick, and with the demolition of the adjacent buildings, the buildings which are still standing there are becoming dangerous. They are just a haven for loafers. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to do something in this regard, because the position has got out of hand. These buildings must either be demolished or something must be done about them. It would be completely uneconomical to try to save these buildings because they have been allowed to deteriorate too far. I shudder to think what these buildings will look like in seven years&#x2019; time. The Minister has told us here this afternoon what the department&#x2019;s plans are for the future, but we find that as far as capital expenditure is concerned there has been a reduction in his Vote of something like R12 million this year. But he still has to carry out his policy of developing housing and removing slums. The Minister has told us that the plans for the development of Mitchell&#x2019;s Vlei are ready, but it will still take some years before the infrastructure is ready. What is going to happen there in the meantime, Sir, we must look at this question of housing from another angle. I see the hon. the Minister of Defence sitting here. I remember that when he was still Minister of Coloured Affairs he made a speech in this House in which he said&#x2014; I think he was sincere&#x2014;that his aim as Minister of Coloured Affairs was the socio-upliftment of the Coloured races.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister of Defence has lost touch with the housing position since he went to the Department of Defence. Many of the Coloured people have been moved to the Cape Flats, where the conditions under which they have to live are such that you cannot expect any socio-upliftment there at all. Although they have a roof over their heads, the general conditions there leave much to be desired. My hon. friend here from Durban talked about the danger of removing people from one slum to an area which, because of the poor conditions prevailing there, is likely to develop into another slum. That is the great danger. Sir, we are not the only country facing this problem. Unfortunately I have not got the article in question here, but the same thing has happened in the United States and it has caused the American Government great concern. They have asked their rehousing people to watch the situation because they are finding today that they are moving people from old slums to what are virtually new slums. People can say what they like about the conditions under which the Coloureds lived in District Six, but District Six was not always what it is today; there were some very nice homes there. But they have been allowed to deteriorate over the years. These people have now been put out in the bundu, where the necessary infrastructure still has to be completed. Sir, in the socio-upliftment of our Coloured people there is another aspect that we have to watch. As a result of the social conditions under which they live, one finds that their health deteriorates. I may say that at one time I had a great deal to do with the hospitals here. One finds that the vast majority of the patients at our hospitals are Bantu or Coloured. It is not that they are more liable to become ill than the Whites, or that they cannot afford hospital treatment. When you talk to medical people, they tell you that 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the illnesses of <span class="col_7393-7394" refersTo="page_0651"/>these people result from the conditions under which they have to live. The hon. the Minister finds himself in this cleft stick that not only has he got to carry out an urban renewal scheme, but that he also has to carry out the Government&#x2019;s ideological policy. The result is that he is in a terrific muddle. On top of everything else, the Minister is faced with the fact that there has been a substantial cut-back on capital expenditure this year, and one wonders what is going to happen in the circumstances.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to make another appeal to the hon. the Minister. The general feeling, as you know, Sir, is that most Coloured families are sub-economic or barely economic, but in point of fact a very substantial section of the Coloured community in Cape Town are quite well-to-do people in a fairly high income-tax bracket. These people are embarrassed by this removal scheme, because they have the greatest difficulty in finding sites on which they can build. The Indians in Johannesburg have been able to build very substantial houses. Unfortunately there are no roads there, but at least they have been able to build good houses. Down here in the Cape, however, you find that the average, moderately well-to-do Coloured man has great difficulty in finding a site on which he can build. He does not want any Government assistance. All he wants to be told is where he can buy a site. He does not want to have to buy a site just anywhere. I do not say that he is snobbish, but he should like to be selective. The hon. the Minister tells me that he can go to Mitchell&#x2019;s Vlei. He is just condemning the man to go along with the masses. Why cannot he be selective, and why does the hon. the Minister not tell these people where they can go? They are not asking the Government for any money; they can afford to build their own homes. Sir, we have heard a great deal here this afternoon about housing for Whites from hon. members on the other side. They showered praises upon the Minister, but at the same time they were also criticizing the Government indirectly because of the shortage of housing for the middle-income group amongst the Whites. The hon. the Minister has asked hon. members on this side to tell him how many people they have in their constituencies who are still without housing. As far as my constituency is concerned, the Minister&#x2019;s own department will tell him that I have had to approach them on many occasions with regard to housing for Whites in my constituency. There is definitely a shortage of housing for the middle-income group. The hon. the Minister talks about waiting lists. I would like to ask him how he draws up these lists.</p>

The hon. member for Salt River, who has just resumed his seat, used two sentences here which I cannot allow to pass without comment. He criticizes the Government&#x2019;s so-called &#x201C;social upliftment of the Coloured people&#x201D;, as he calls it, and then states: &#x201C;We are sending them to the bundu&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now I want to quote something said by Mr. Horak, one of their leaders. He wrote this in a letter to the <i>Cape Times</i> on 17th August, 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The result of our policy was <i>inter alia</i> the establishment of shanty town after shanty town in which the most ghastly slum conditions developed, in which the infant mortality rate and the disease rate <span class="col_7395-7396" refersTo="page_0652"/>in general shot up to hitherto unknown peaks, and in which unemployment and crime assumed alarming proportions.</block>

<p>Those are the words written by one of the leaders of the party opposite, and now the hon. member for Salt River comes along and says: &#x201C;We are sending these people into the bundu&#x201D;. I do not think so much was ever done for housing for our Whites and non-Whites as has been done since the Group Areas Act came upon the scene. I think that with this legislation for separate group areas this Government made a positive contribution by virtue of the fact that it looked scientifically at the housing needs of our non-Whites. I now want to ask the hon. member for Salt River whether he is not in favour of the people who lived in District Six in absolute slum conditions being taken to better housing areas. They are so willing to trot along with the local English newspapers when those newspapers write article upon article about the so-called injustice done to these people, and then those newspapers even print photographs of the slum streets and conditions that prevailed there; and then they speak of the good old days. I have never heard the hon. member for Salt River, the hon. member for Maitland, or any of them say that the people who lived there are now living in better houses and that they now at least have a good roof over their heads. [Interjections.] We read in the newspapers of the poor health conditions in District Six. We read of how some of the Coloured mothers who lived there complained that at night the rats bit their children, but there where they are now living this cannot happen because they are living under clean hygienic conditions.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the hon. member for Port Natal. I just want to tell him this. He is either very jealous of the work this hon. Minister and his department are doing; he is either jealous and frustrated, or he hates this Minister with an intense hatred. [Interjections.] With his propagandist speeches I think that hon. member is doing a great deal of harm to the sound relations that exist between the various population [roups. I think he is damaging this striving of the Government in South Africa for sound relations between the various population groups. I wonder whether that hon. member ever tells those people who. according to him, live under poor conditions: &#x201C;Do you not also want to make a contribution with proper family planning so that we can give you proper housing? &#x201D; We have never heard him speak along those lines. I should like to join a previous speaker on our side in asking the Minister to consider this case very seriously. [Interjections.] If the hon. member for Houghton would give me a chance to speak to the Minister I would appreciate it very much. You know, Sir, she likes talking very much and she talks very readily. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider very seriously the idea raised here this afternoon in connection with a levy on employers for the housing of their employees. I represent a rural constituency with many farmers, and we as farmers must pay levies on many of our products, and we ourselves must provide housing for our farm labourers. That housing must comply with certain high Divisional Council standards. I really think the time has now come for this Minister, whom we know can stand firm, to tell the employers that it is high time they made a contribution to the housing needs of all their employees.</p>

<p>The Opposition is continually telling us we cannot make up the backlog that exists. Looking back for a moment at what our Government had to take over, at what we inherited. I can point out the conditions beside the road as one drives to Paarl. There were the biggest ever hovel and slum conditions. And do you know. Sir, that a previous Minister of this Government had to take the Cape Town Municipality by the throat and say: &#x201C;This is now a threat; you must now do something about these poor housing conditions or else I shall do so at your expense&#x201D;. They had to be forced and threatened before they did anything. Now we have the beautiful housing conditions along the National Road on the way to Paarl.</p>

<p>I want to come back to my own constituency and tell the Minister that I only have praise for him and his department for what they have riven us, particularly in Worcester very recently. If I may furnish the Minister of Community Development with a testimonial I want to say that I regard him as a very open-hearted person with a very true feeling for those who are less privileged and do not live in good or comfortable houses. We had the privilege recently of spending a short time there with him, and we travelled through the town. I want to tell you, Sir, that his heart rejoiced when he saw what that municipality <span class="col_7397-7398" refersTo="page_0653"/>is doing, not only for our Whites, but also for the Coloureds. In the same breath I cannot but also pay tribute to that municipality which is now engaged in a scheme involving 2 000 dwelling units for our Coloureds, a very big economic housing scheme for our Whites and a very big sub-economic scheme. It is right for us also to pay tribute to many of our local authorities who really go out of their way to provide housing. It is strange that many of the local authorities that play such a big role in the creation of good housing conditions are in the hands of the National Party. I think one cannot but pay tribute to those people and thank them very sincerely for what they are doing, in co-operation with the Government, to provide decent housing for our people, Whites and non-Whites.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. member for Worcester is wont to do, he once again made one of his days of yore speeches here, and yet he tried to say that the hon. member for Port Natal made propagandistic speeches in this House. But I am going to leave him at that. I want to say to the Minister I know he is aware of the fact that there are lairge areas in my constituency, Durban Central, which used to be occupied by Indians. In my constituency there are also large areas which fall in the same group as those areas described very nicely as &#x201C;urban renewal&#x201D;. Where these factors are present, it is virtually automatic to find that the Department of Community Development is extremely active. They are active to such an extent that one can say that as far as housing is concerned, they have the whip-hand utterly and completely. I know the hon. the Minister takes it amiss of us if we say that his department is one of the largest estate agencies in South Africa, and he asks, &#x201C;What of it?&#x201D; I want to say to him it is a state of affairs which I do not want to wish even on one of the Nationalist Party members in this House. It is definitely not a state of affairs which I wish on the tenants of houses and flats. This department is not only a large estate agency, but also a fickle agent. This is the problem with which we have to contend. From time to time it perpetrates things which are inexplicable yes, even reckless, in respect of tenants of buildings. Tenants are exposed not only to inconvenience but also to dangers. I shall mention specific examples from my constituency. In the first place, I want to point out cases of tenants who have been exposed to unprecedented rent increases as a result of the action of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. Then I want to mention cases of buildings which are so dilapidated that after the first downpour of rain, some rooms are virtually transformed into siwmming pools, of course, the hon. the Minister would say that this was one of the advantages, namely that if one obtained a house from him, one obtained a swimming pool inside the house at the same time. This is the type of problem with which I have to contend in my constituency. I even had the classic case recently of a building on which demolition work had been started while people were still living there. Can one imagine a more dangerous state of affairs?</p>

<p>Shortly before Christmas last year, the Department of Community Development sold two buildings in my constituency. They were buildings which had been built approximately four years before by the Community Development Board. I am referring to Strelitzia Court and Abelia Court. What was the result of that business transaction, or should I rather ask: What was the Christmas present which the hon. the Minister and his department gave the tenants? Strelitzia Court consisted of 36 flats which were occupied mainly by public servants and their families. It was sold to a private company and the rent for two-bedroomed flats was increased by 83 per cent. It was increased from R65 to R110 per month. For three-bedroomed flats the rent was increased by 74 per cent, i.e. from R72 per month to R125 per month. In Abelia Court, where there are only three-bedroomed flats, the rent increased by 86 per cent, i.e. from R65 to Rill per month. According to a letter from the hon. the Minister, these buildings were erected as part of an emergency programme in order to provide housing for the middle income group. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister if this is how he treats the middle income group? I know what his excuse is. He will say it is not the object of the Community Development Board to provide houses on a permanent basis. Buildings are constructed and sold later, and in the way it realizes its assets. But how does this department realize its assets? Abelia Court was built in 1967 for an amount of R58 732. Four years later it was sold for R58 500. in other words, there was a loss of R200. Strelitzia Court was built for R286 000 <span class="col_7399-7400" refersTo="page_0654"/>and sold for R300 000, in other words, at a profit of R14 000. The attempts of the tenants to have the buildings made subject to rent control failed completely. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he thinks it was a good business transaction to sell these buildings. Was the game worth the candle? In view of the increase in building costs from 1966 to 1970, he cannot build anything similar with those amounts of R300 000 and R58 000 which he received. In other words, it was a retrogressive step and even if he were to use the money for other urban renewal projects &#x2026;</p>

<p>The Minister says he has no authority over the Development Board. This was a transaction which fell under the Minister&#x2019;s department. The buildings were controlled by the Minister&#x2019;s department and the tenants had applied to his department.</p>

<p>However, one finds other cases in my constituency as well&#x2014;and in this regard I have put questions to the hon. the Minister and have sometimes received unsatisfactory replies&#x2014;where everything is not right. It is not his fault, but something is wrong somewhere. The hon. the Minister often tells us that nobody is homeless and that everybody has a roof over his head. However. I can take the Minister to streets and buildinrs in my constituency in respect of which I have already put specific questions to him. The tenants of these buildings complained to me that they had lodged complaints with the department in regard to leaking roofs. However, when one goes to the Department of Community Development, they say they have received no complaints. Somewhere there is something wrong. I want to suggest to the Minister that his department has become so large that this type of situation is necessarily developing. There is too much work for the staff of the department to handle. In other words, there is a manpower problem. It is not a case of their not recieiving complaints, In reality they receive too many complaints, and in this regard I am referring particularly to certain buildings in Leathern Road in my constituency, about which I have put questions. I have personal knowledge of one building where the people told me that the roof was leaking and that they had lodged complaints with the Department of Community Development in that regard. However, when I asked the Department of Community Development about it, they said they were not aware of such complaints.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I said earlier in the debate that I wanted to deal in greater detail with the Government&#x2019;s new house saving scheme, and I want to do so at this stage. Last night when I dealt with this subject briefly, I said that two spokesmen from companies who are engaged in the construction of housing for the lower to middle-income groups have described this scheme as being inadequate, unrealistic and likely to prove a monumental failure from the outset.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Who said that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Two spokesmen, one from Omega Construction and the other from Gough Cooper. It is as well that the hon. the Prime Minister is in his seat, because I think he ought to take note of what I am going to say. There are two fatal flaws in this scheme. These are related to the scheme&#x2019;s income and house price limitations. I want to deal, firstly, with the house price limitation, which is R16 000. It must be borne in mind that that includes the land as well. It is the land plus the house on which there is the limitation of R16 000. The position is that it is already difficult today for private house-builders, and I am not now referring to the sort of housing the department constructs for the sub-economic and economic groups, to build houses which can be sold, together with the ground, for R16 000. The two spokesmen from these <span class="col_7401-7402" refersTo="page_0655"/>companies that I have mentioned have said that they consider that it will be impossible to go on providing houses for as little as R16 000 in major urban areas for much longer. It must be borne in mind that under this scheme, persons who wish to make use of it, must save for at least 18 months. That means that they will not be making use of the scheme for a minimum of 18 months. By that time, I suggest, it will be quite impossible to produce a house of a reasonable standard for this figure.</p>

<p>But one must go further than this and one must bear in mind that most people who will be making use of this scheme will have to save for a great deal longer than 18 months in order to put aside the minimum deposit which is required, viz., R4 000, especially bearing in mind that the income limit is only R5 000. In dealing with the income limit, I should like to say that if the wife is not also earning and in that way increasing the total income to beyond R5 000, it will be virtually impossible for any young family whose total income is R5 000, to save at all, let alone to save sufficiently to put aside R4 000 within a reasonable period of time. There has been some confusion as to whether this R5 000 income limit applies only to the breadaawinner, the husband&#x2019;s income or whether in fact it is the total income of that household. If it is the total income of the household, in other words, the income earned by the wife as well as the husband, it of course becomes an even more unrealistic limitation. But I understand that the Government has stated since this was announced in the Budget that the R5 000 income limit is intended to refer to the income limit of the breadwinner, the husband only. The hon. the Minister nods his head in agreement. I would suggest that the hon. the Minister again repeats this, because there is still some confusion over it. I would reiterate that, even if it is the case that that applies to the income of the husband only, unless the wife is earning as well, it will be impossible for a couple to put aside money under this proposed scheme.</p>

<p>Let us see how this works in practice. The Government is not giving any rebate on transfer and stamp duties to people in this category. The effect of this under the present rate of transfer duty is that on a R16 000 house the transfer duty will be R700. That means transfer duty will be R700. That means that the young couple is being given a benefit which on the other hand is being taken away to the extent of R700. This side of the House and several of the speakers on that side of the House have pleaded with the hon. the Minister to give further consideration to the young couples and the middle income group. The hon. member for Germiston, for example, did so, and I think one or two other members on that side of the House also pointed to the difficulties which people in this category are having. If the Government is realistic in wishing to assist them, I believe they must improve this scheme a great deal. They must increase the house price limitation beyond R16 000. I would say that it should be increased to at least R20 000 for this category, but possibly even higher. They should also consider increasing the income limitation beyond R5 000. R6 000 would be a more realistic figure. In addition they should introduce other, what I may call, fringe benefits such as have been suggested by the hon. member for Green Point and which I do not wish to repeat. There are others, for example the Government could consider giving some form of tax concession to companies that wish to invest in housing schemes for their employees or who wish to assist their employees in obtaining houses. At the moment there is no incentive whatsoever for any companies to do so. The hon. the Minister made the point that farmers provide housing for their employees, and he expects the business community, commerce and industry, to follow suit. I would point out to the hon. the Minister that if a farmer provides housing for his employees, he is able to get the benefit of this against tax. Such expenses come off his taxable income, but there is no similar benefit for commerce and industry. I believe that the Government should seriously consider this. It would assist in making more housing available to this group.</p>

<p>Then I would like to deal briefly with two statements made by the hon. member for Germiston. He referred to the urbanization crisis&#x2014;he used the word &#x201C;crisis&#x201D;&#x2014;and he said that it is more a problem of management. I would agree with him up to a point, but I believe it becomes a problem of management only when adequate provision has been made for the projected urbanization growth. If the statistics are wrong and if the provision which is made for growing urbanization is wrong, no amount of good management will overcome the problem. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Musgrave complained about the home-owners&#x2019; saving scheme and said that certain institutions had major objections to it. That may be so. I am not saying it is a perfect scheme, but I must be guided by the building societies. All the building societies co-operated in the development of this scheme and up to now none has suggested any amendments to this scheme. In other words, I must accept that the building societies are completely satisfied with it. As long as they are satisfied with it, I see no reason why I should intervene. If the building societies were to find that certain changes should be made, I would be perfectly willing to listen to them. The hon. member&#x2019;s idea that R16 000 is too little for a house is foolish. Now I know &#x2026;</p>

<p>I may say that at present the Saambou-Nasionale Bouvereniging is building very good houses in Klerksdorp which cost R11 000 per house, including the land. Therefore I do not agree with him in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central complained about Strelitzia Court which had been sold by the Development Board. In the first place, I want to say to him that I have no authority at all over the Development Board. The Development Board is a statutory body and I cannot tell them what to do. They are completely independent of me and I may not interfere with what they do. They can tell me to get lost if I want to interfere with them. The only thing I can do, is to try to use my influence with them. How much influence I have with them, I do not know. What is the difficulty with Strelitzia Court? The place was sold at a small profit, after which the rent was increased. The rent was low because the Development Board could not fill Strelitzia Court. The rent has been increased now. If the rent becomes too high, surely the solution is obvious. If those are being exploited, that building is simply placed under rent control. In that case they need merely apply to have the building placed under rent control. If I receive an application for a building to be placed under rent control, I refer the matter to the Rent Control Board who must then investigate the matter. They must determine whether the rent is too high and must compare the rent payable in such a building to that payable in buildings in the area. Then it is up to them to recommend whether or not the building should be placed under rent control. I do not know of any other method whatsoever for dealing with this matter. Nor is there any other method for dealing with it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Worcester spoke about the levy on employers in regard to housing for Coloured workers. In my reply to the hon. member for Parow I said I was in favour of it; I support it and shall give it my serious attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River complained about District Six and said we should demolish some of the buildings there sooner because they were becoming dangerous, etc. I agree with him; we should demolish them as soon as possible. Some of those buildings are dangerous but the demolition work is being done as rapidly as possible. The hon. member also complained about the low quality of sub-economic houses for Coloureds. Sir, what does he expect as regards sub-economic houses for Coloureds, some of which cost as little as R600 and R700? The more luxurious&#x2014;if one can call it this&#x2014;one makes those houses, the fewer sub-economic houses one can build. I just want to point out to him that the sub-economic houses are at least of such a standard that in an interview conducted with the Minister of Coloured Affairs and I recently, the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council made serious representations to us to allow those sub-economic houses to be sold to the Coloureds. I will not be told that they want to buy them if they are so dissatisfied with the standard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hercules put a question about Lady Selbome. I just want to say to him that the city council had to struggle for a long time to get the province so far as to determine the route of the throughway. That is why there was much delay in the development. Towards the end of last year we exercised a great deal of pressure. Now the route has been determined and now the planning of Lady Selborne will be proceeded with.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hercules also placed serious emphasis on the Niemand Commission&#x2019;s recommendation that local authorities themselves should develop townships. I fully agree with him. We encourage <span class="col_7405-7406" refersTo="page_0657"/>them as much as possible to develop townships and to implement the Niemand Commission&#x2019;s recommendations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point also complained about flats which had been removed from rent control and had then been converted into holiday flats. He spoke of flat dwellers who were being bothered by the owners in all sorts of ways. As he knows, this is against the law.</p>

<p>Very well; if they simply increase the rent, the remedy is obvious. The tenants must apply for that building to be placed under rent control again.

In that case the hon. member for Durban Point may go and give evidence before it. He may go and try to convince them that there has in fact been exploitation. If he convinces them, they will recommend that the building be placed under rent control and then the matter will be rectified in this way.</p>

<p>I just want to say to the hon. member for Boksburg that I agree with him that we have done a great deal in recent times in regard to housing in Boksburg and I hope we shall be able to comply with other requests as well. Everything depends on how much money we have at our disposal. As far as the Coloured area of Reiger Park is concerned, there still are Indian traders; that is perfectly correct. We are doing our best to resettle the Indian traders there. I want to say to the hon. member that the question of the Indian traders on the East Rand, i.e. from Germiston as far as Springs and Nigel, will enjoy our very serious attention during the recess. Benoni cannot absorb all the Indian traders; it is quite impossible, but this whole question of Indians on the East Rand and of moving their businesses, will receive our serious attention this recess, and I hope we shall find a solution to that problem this year still.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Tygerberg requested something here to which I think the commission of inquiry will in fact give its attention. Recently I had a discussion with one of the members of that commission of inquiry. He told me they regretted receiving very little evidence from tenants. Well, that is obvious. The tenants are not organized, while, the owners of flats, on the other hand, are well organized. The commission receives little evidence from tenants, but I do not have the least doubt that they will pay very serious attention to the position of what the hon. member called the silent majority.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also said that the standard of sub-economic housing for Coloureds was too low. But the trouble is that as soon as one sets standards which are too high, it simply means that one can build fewer sub-economic houses, because one&#x2019;s money is limited and if the standards are raised, one simply has to build fewer houses for the same money.</p>

<p>It is not a long way out of town. With these lovely roads, Blouberg is as near to the centre of Cape Town as Parktown is to the centre of Johannesburg, or as Woodland is to the centre of Pretoria. The hon. member for Green Point says that only luxury flats are standing empty. Here is another advertisement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Accommodation: Peninsula: Flats from R40 per month; rooms from R15 per month; houses from R60 a month. Phone So-and-So, or call &#x2026; for viewing these places.</block>

<p>But according to the hon. member for Green Point, it is only luxury houses and flats which are empty. The hon. member must not talk such utter tripe.</p>

<p>*I am glad the hon. member for Langlaagte spoke about Lenasia; I appreciate it. He was perfectly correct in saying that Lenasia is as close to a model residential area as one can come. As far as the streets are concerned, I can only say that in Vereeniging, too, there are streets which become flooded in times of heavy rain. As yet all the streets there have not been tarred either. Everything cannot be done in one day, but more and more streets in Lenasia are being tarred.</p>

<p>As far as Page View is concerned, we are clearing it up. The hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion that we should purchase land to the south of Johannesburg, is definitely something which may be considered. I shall definitely discuss it with my department.</p>

<p>In actual fact the hon. member for Houghton only had one major objection. She said, &#x201C;we are resettling people who are already in good housing&#x201D;. Sir, this is the old argument of people who are not in favour of separate residential areas. It is the old argument of people who are not in favour of group areas. Sir, we must preserve the balance. I fully agree that we must house the squatter as soon as we possibly can, but at the same time we should also go ahead with our policy of resettlement, which we will in fact do. The hon. member for Port Natal may fuss as much as he likes; District Six has been declared a White area. Those Coloureds will be settled elsewhere, and they will be given better houses than those in which they are living at present. Sir, it is always said that people who are resettled, are put into the veld. What nonsense! Not a single Indian or Coloured who is resettled does not receive a better house than the one in which he is living at present.</p>

<p>Sir, I am grateful for what the hon. member for Vasco said about the Goodwod Acres and about what we have done there. As far as these communal television aerials are concerned, I agree with him. I, too, have seen these television aerials abroad, which look like crows&#x2019; nests and cobwebs. I do not think we have any <span class="col_7409-7410" refersTo="page_0659"/>authority in that regard. It is mainly a matter for the local authority.</p>

<p>As regards Crown Garden Cities, the hon. member himself said it had sufficient land for the next three decades. Therefore they already have cheap land at their disposal. The hon. member went on to ask us to make more money available in regard to this joint building society scheme. He said that at present they had money to provide only six or eight houses for the middle income group, and he requested that we should make more money available. It is difficult to say whether we can in fact do so. I can only promise the hon. member that we shall investigate this matter in the recess. We have discussed the matter with Mr. Meyer, the manager of Crown Garden Cities. He put forward certain proposals to us which we shall consider very seriously.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I think I could do no better than start by saying that one appreciated receiving a report from this department yesterday. May I quote the foreword of this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In most countries of the Western world, the entire State building programme, with the possible exception of Government-funded housing projects, is entrusted to the counterparts of the Department of Public Works. South Africa, however, with its relatively smaller economically active population and suffering from a chronic dearth in the professional ranks of the building industry, finds itself in the incredible position of having at least 22 State departments engaging to a greater or lesser degree in building activities. The extent to which functions are duplicated, the uneconomic deployment of manpower and the inefficient utilization of building sites are stupefying. And yet this state of affairs has been allowed to develop over the years and continues to develop to this day, with one and all deluding themselves that they are capable of excelling those who have been specially trained and are better equipped for this particular task. Cold, clear logic demands that an immediate halt be called to this proliferation of building organization in the public sector and that the whole matter be reconsidered in the light of the premise postulated in the opening paragraph.</block>

<p>If that is not sufficient to indicate to the hon. the Minister of Public Works what is necessary and what should be done and what is wrong with his department, I do not know what is. But when one looks at the report itself and considers the details, I think one must compliment the Secretary of the department for producing a report which gives equal attention to both favourable and unfavourable aspects in the department. One of the most alarming aspects is the staff shortages in so far as technical posts are concerned. I want briefly to refer to paragraph 11 of the report. It is extraordinary how this department even functions when one finds that the vacancies as at 31st March last year were the following: For civil engineers there were ten out of 19 posts; for electrical engineers, six out of eight posts; quantity surveyors, 19 out of 24 posts; and architects ten out of 30 posts. That is the staff position with which this department is attempting to operate. When one notes that fact one can understand why during the year under review here there were an additional 456 leases&#x2014;at least there are now 456 leases&#x2014;of property for Government use. On a rough calculation, the average rentals being paid throughout the country is 15 cents per square foot. I do not know whether that is a reasonable rent in the overall position. I want to ask the Minister in regard to leases: Who settles the rent? Is there a committee or a commission and, if so, who are the members of it? Who settles the details when the department enters into these leases? Because the rental which is being paid and which we are being asked to vote, is an increase from R7 553 000 last year to a figure of R10 187 000 this year for hire premises. The time has come that there should be a stop to this lavish spending in so far as the Government is concerned. But I want to raise one matter in the short time available to me and that is in connection with the design of Government buildings. I do not believe that there is a better example of the non-maximum economic use of building sites than one finds in the case of every Government structure that is put <span class="col_7411-7412" refersTo="page_0660"/>up. Are we getting the best out of the sites? I want to refer as an example to the new structure just across the way. In this building neither the ground floor in the side street or in Parliament Street is utilized for public purposes, and if one goes up a few steps one comes to another prestige floor which is on the level of the square and is not used. In fact, as one has found in visiting that building, it is either a chute for the South-Easter or a funnel for the rains which settle on that building. These buildings which are erected kill dead the locality in which they are erected because we have with the faade of these buildings the cold stone frontage on the pavement. I agree that if one looks at a building like the Verwoerd building from a nice distance, or if one could have it in the centre of a place like the Parade, it will be a most attractive building, but there is not the maximum utilization of the ground which is available where it has been built. Then there is a scheme for the development of Plein Street here in Cape Town. It would be a shocking thing if that development is going to result in what will really be an unbroken stone or marble wall from the top of Plein Street down to Spin Street. What use can be made? Surely when one looks at the area of properties which are hired for Government purposes, particularly for offices to which the public has access, surely the ground floors of Government buildings should be used for these purposes. Let me give some instances. Is it not possible to incorporate one of these smaller district post offices on the ground floor of these State buildings? Is it not possible to provide in these State buildings for revenue offices where people can make their payments and take out licences? Is it necessary that persons who want to apply for a passport, must go miles in any one of the cities and then go in a lift up to various upper floors? Those offices should be on the ground floor. Not only will it be a service to the public; it will also enliven the neighbourhood in which these State buildings are. It would enliven the neighbourhood and it would in addition to that not only create a convenience to the public, but above all it would mean the maximum economic utilization of sites by the State. I hope this matter will be taken into consideration. There are other buildings to which one could refer, which are of the same nature.</p>

<p>The other point which I am pleased to note in this report, and which I hope is being pursued, is the check on the demands made by the various departments for accommodation. I was pleased to note that there has been a possible saving by the reduction in the areas allocated to various departments, who have asked for more space. But if one looks at the schedule of spending, one can realize where some of the chronic difficulties of the building industry in South Africa have arisen. If one looks at the five-year period between the year 1966&#x2013;&#x2019;67 and the year 1970&#x2013;71 one finds that the tenders accepted by the head office of the Public Works Department, which were R15,4 million in 1966&#x2013;&#x2019;67, rose to R70,6 million five years later in 1970&#x2013;71, an increase of 460 per cent. Even in respect of the departmental and regional work which was undertaken, one has the same position. In 1966&#x2013;&#x2019;67 there was an amount of R3,8 million for regional work, which by 1970&#x2013;71 had jumped to R7,99 million, or by over 200 per cent. There are signs that this spending in the public sector is being curtailed and I hope it will be further curtailed, and my plea at this moment to the department is to ensure that they look at the sites and the property which the Government owns and which it utilizes to see that there is, as is sought by every developer, the maximum economic utilization of those sites, which I do not believe is the case at present.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point complained about the high rentals that are being paid for Government purposes and, if I understand the hon. member correctly, what the hon. member probably means is that instead of paying rent the Department should at some time or other provide buildings for those sections or departments in question. We very often find it difficult to understand the Opposition because one day they attack us because Government spending is supposed to be too high, while in this instance, they complain that we do not erect enough buildings and initiate sufficient activities. But I want to leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the reference made by the hon. member to the building across the street over here, the Hendrik Verwoerd Building, the official opening of which we could attend earlier this year. I must point out to the hon. member that this building costs many millions of rands and I believe that, on the part of the department, the services of only the best <span class="col_7413-7414" refersTo="page_0661"/>experts were used as far as the design is concerned, and not only the functional design, but also as far as the appearance of the building is concerned. Now, the front elevation of the building is not to the hon. member&#x2019;s liking, but when one considers the parking space and everything that has been provided, the front elevation of the building, seen from a particular angle, might not be to one&#x2019;s liking but I think that when one looks at the building from a functional point of view and when one considers the purpose for which the building has been planned and all the thin s it has to provide, we have a very fine building in the Hendrik Verwoerd Building.</p>

<p>We must also bear in mind that this building is not situated in a business area, but that the building is situated here where it must fit in with this complex. Now, the buildings do not fit in, but I believe that the activities which have to be carried out here were among the basic considerations, i.e. in what way this building would fit in best with the functional activities. To my mind these considerations are always taken into account as far as Government buildings are concerned, particularly in the case of the larger complexes such as the one we are dealing with here.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the foreword to this report. The hon. member for Green Point also referred to it in passing. I am not going to quote all the parts the hon. member has read out. The first paragraph reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ideally, the machinery of government should be functionally so geared that activities of a like nature are entrusted for execution to a single central authority. However, what may be ideal is not necessarily the most practical&#x2014;in other words, non-related considerations often determine that what may be ideal in theory needs to be adiusted in the interests of efficiency and viability.</block>

<p>I looked up some of the previous annual reports to make sure whether they did not also contain a similar foreword. However, I could not find any. For that reason this foreword was of particular interest to me. Since it is being said that this state of affairs is not a healthy one and that we should set ourselves an ideal, we find here that the wish is expressed on the part of the department that we should merely strive to achieve that ideal but that such ideal will never be realized.</p>

<p>Or is this a polite but firm warning to other departments, the activities of which are of a widespread nature, that they should prepare themselves because this department, which is equipped to carry out concomitant activities, is slowly gathering matters under its wing? It seems to me that this is the tone conveyed by this foreword. We should do it in this way, if necessary. We are living in modern times and if there are people whose wings have to be clipped for an excellent service that may be rendered, their wings will simply have to be clipped.</p>

<p>This report also contains one other very important matter. Reference is made to a study or a survey which has been carried out to determine or assess the housing requirements of Whites. This we find in paragraph 7 (a) on page 1, in the second column. Reference is made there to an investigation commenced in November 1970 and carried out in the Pretoria region in particular. We have this problem of having to make a proper assessment of the housing requirements of Whites. We have waiting lists, and so forth, and during the discussion under the previous Vote it was pointed out that waiting lists are, in fact, unreliable and of little practical use. Here we now have a study on a very important matter. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what progress has been made with this study, whether it has been completed and whether satisfactory results have been obtained with this study. What I mean is whether a set of principles may not be established in terms of which, for example, the housing requirements of Pretoria could be assessed, but which would be applicable to another area as well. If this could be done, we would have made tremendous progress and we would have obtained a reliable instrument on the basis of which assessments could be made as far as housing requirements are concerned. We shall be glad if this information could be made available to us so that we could see what it is all about. There may be quite a number of concomitant facts which may be used to assess the housing requirements. As I have said, if this is the case, we would have made a <span class="col_7415-7416" refersTo="page_0662"/>major break-through on a matter in respect of which we have some problems, and we would have found an instrument we have been looking for for many years.</p>

<p>The department has fulfilled a major task again this year. However, there is one matter which worries me and which I should like to refer to in conclusion. This concerns the backlog in Government accommodation and related services which at present amounts to approximately R1 164 million and which, according to the report, will be impossible to make up in the foreseeable future. I want to ask whether this figure is not misleading and I want to illustrate my statement. If I should decide to buy a particular article during this month and, owing to certain circumstances, am not in a position to buy such article, would I be justified to add the price of this article to some list or other and say that I am falling behind with my purchases? At a particular time in the course of the year I want to buy another article but owing to circumstances I am once more unable to buy it. I write this amount down for a second time and say that I am falling behind with my purchases.</p>

<p>Are we not multiplying this amount in this very same manner? If we cannot provide Government buildings and if a Government department or a section still has some accommodation somewhere, I do not think we can write down that figure and say that that is the extent to which we are falling behind as far as the provision of State accommodation is concerned. This figure, as it appears in the report, is an impressive one. and when one considers that it is a backlog. I feel that we do not have the correct picture of what the situation really is. I think that generally, except in a few cases perhaps, our Government departments are quite reasonably accommodated. We are also making some progress in providing the necessary accommodation in future for those Government departments which are not satisfactorily accommodated. We must do this without making these calculations and then saying that we have a backlog.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Germiston has dealt with the report of the Department of Public Works and has mentioned the housing requirements of Whites, which is receiving attention. However, we must bear in mind that this only deals with the position as far as Pretoria is concerned. We hope there will be an official report dealing with other aspects of the housing requirements. If one considers the question of the shortage of housing and industrial buildings, one can see that there is particular scope for this aspect.</p>

<p>I wish to deal with sub-head (15) of Loan Vote B&#x2014;Social Welfare and Pensions&#x2014;and I want to say immediately that we appreciate that the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions is present for this debate, so that certain items affecting his department may be raised at this stage. I want to deal with the item &#x201C;Accommodation for drug dependants&#x201D; at Cullinan, amounting to R130 000, R30 000 of which is to be voted this year, and also with the item &#x201C;Refuge for White males&#x201D; at Cullinan, a new item of R230 000, for which a token amount of R50 is to be voted this year. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister the manner in which these rehabilitation centres for drug dependants are established.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister officially opened the rehabilitation centre at Cullinan on 26th April, 1972, and gave a rsum, to an extent, of the rehabilitation provisions and other provisions of the Act which was passed last year by this House, namely the Abuse of Dependence Producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act (Act 41 of 1971). Here we a ree that the position as far as rehabilitation is concerned, is indeed a vitally important aspect of the administration of that Act. However, it appears that although this Act has only been in operation for a short period of six months, certain difficulties are arising as far as rehabilitation is concerned and the direction of drug addicts to the accommodation that is provided in terms of this Vote. It appears from replies given by the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions in this House that these rehabilitation centres have considerable vacancies. Indeed, the one rehabilitation centre situated in Bloemfontein for under 18 year-olds, which is administered in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act, is empty. I would therefore like the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions to give some indication to this Committee as to what the position is at the present time at the rehabilitation centre at Cullinan and to indicate to what extent accommodation is available, the maximum accommodation available, and perhaps also how many persons <span class="col_7417-7418" refersTo="page_0663"/>are presently receiving rehabilitation at these centres.</p>

<p>Therefore, I do not want to dwell on the question of the administration of the Act concerned, under which persons are committed to these rehabilitation centres, as we will have an opportunity of raising this matter under the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>The other question deals with this refuge for White males at Cullinan which, as I say, is a new item showing an estimated expenditure of R230 000, although there appears on the Estimates only a token amount of R50. I should like the hon. the Minister to give an indication of the reasons for the necessity of this type of institution in view of the position as it now stands and to indicate what type of White males will be accommodated at this proposed refuge. I must say that I think it is an unfortunate term to use when one describes any form of institution as a &#x201C;refuge&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The other question to which I should like to refer is the question of the Norman House Place of Safety, at Edenvale. Here too only a token amount of R50 appears on the Estimates, but there has been a considerable alteration in the original Estimates. A swimming bath and sports facilities and accommodation for educational purposes are to be provided. Places of safety and detention have been in the forefront of publicity. Fortunately, it is not a matter that falls under this Minister, but under another Minister, because it affects Coloured children. However, we should like to have some information in regard to this accommodation for educational purposes which is to be provided at this place of safety. The hon. the Minister should indicate to this Committee in what manner these premises will be utilized and whether it will be possible for all children who are accommodated at a place of safety, to receive educational instruction whilst they are so accommodated. This accommodation is regarded as a transitional period while being cared for under the Children&#x2019;s Act. I see that an amount of R20 000 appears on the Estimates in respect of the place of safety at Pinetown. It would appear that this place of safety is now about to be completed. The hon. member for Berea and I visited this place of safety. I should like to say that the type of institution which is being established there we consider to be an excellent one, an ideal one. The type of building that is being erected lends itself to the specialized work that has to be undertaken whilst these children are so accommodated.</p>

<p>The other aspect, another item under sub-head (15), deals with the purchase, conversion and renovation of a property to serve as a home for the aged at Dunnottar. The original estimate was R325 000 and the present estimate is R800 000, of which R30 000 is to be voted. Here, I think, a principle is involved in that this appears to be a State institution in view of the fact that it appears on the Estimates. This is a deviation from the normal policy of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions for the provision of such homes for the aged to be made through the agency of welfare organizations. I hope the hon. the Minister can give some information in regard to this particular project and indicate whether this is to be a State-run institution or whether it is the aim of his department to hand this home for the ased over to a welfare organization at a later stage so that it can be administered in the normal way that most homes for the aged are administered in South Africa at the present time.</p>

<p>In referring to the position of the rehabilitation centres for drug dependants, I feel that the hon. the Minister should also give consideration to encouraging the welfare organizations to establish registered rehabilitation centres where they consider it necessary. I think the welfare organizations to a great extent have an indication of the needs and the requirements as far as this is concerned. As we know, they have administered various registered rehabilitation centres for some years and have gained valuable experience.</p>

<p>I feel that it would perhaps be wise if the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions would consider this suggestion, which will mean that the Government itself will not be directly involved with these rehabilitation centres. The rehabilitation centres, the old retreats or work colonies, as they were known under the previous legislation, dealt mainly with parsons who were alcoholics and dealt with the problem of alcoholism. It is necessary, of course, that this good work should continue and that the basis of this work should be built upon. Therefore I hope that the hon. the Minister will give some indication to the Committee of the manner in which the welfare <span class="col_7419-7420" refersTo="page_0664"/>organizations are able to assist his department in making provision for the accommodation of persons who are alcoholics, drug addicts, or drug dependants, and also those persons who are requiring accommodation at homes for the aged where this has been the practice in the past. Perhaps the hon. the Minister could give some indication as to whether he intends to carry on with that practice or whether this is merely a measure which is to bring about a more expeditious provision of accommodation, accommodation which his department has considered necessary and which will be required as the practical application of the Act that was passed last year gains momentum. As the Act gains momentum more persons who are considered to be addicts&#x2014;not those who are convicted in terms of the legislation as dealers or pushers&#x2014;and who are seeking assistance and those persons who are compulsorily committed to these institutions should receive treatment in order to be rehabilitated so as to find their place again in society.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise at once to reply to the request made by the hon. member for Umbilo and to furnish the required information in that regard. A far more fruitful discussion of the whole question of the rehabilitation of drug addicts may be conducted under my Vote, which will come up for discussion within a day or two. Then we may go into the whole method which is followed. In this instance we mainly want to go into the question of the buildings erected with a view to serving as rehabilitation centres. I want to tell the hon. member that in order to put the Act into operation, my department would have to be able to provide rehabilitation centres and rehabilitation. If, in terms of the provisions of the Act. a person were to be committed to a rehabilitation centre by the courts, my department would have to be in a position to accommodate such a person immediately, otherwise the Act could not be promulgated and implemented. For that reason we asked at the time for the amount of money as indicated here, i.e. R130 000, for the erection of two rehabilitation centres at the Magaliesoord site, which we already own and where we have other buildings as well. This complex has now been completed.</p>

<p>For males and females?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, for males and females. There is accommodation for 36 males and 36 females in the beautiful centre, which, as the hon. member said, I opened in April. I am no prophet, but Ido not think we shall use the full amount that was requested. I think we are going to save a little on the amount, but at this stage I do not want to commit myself by saying how much the saving will be. I think we shall get off with a smaller amount than was originally voted for that purpose. This is the position as a result of very neat planning and the very friendly co-operation we obtained. The same applies to the institution at Bloemfontein, where we have accommodation for 36 youths under the age of 18 years. At that institution we also have accommodation available. In other words, I can say with an open mind that we do have accommodation available for durg addicts committed to institutions. In all three of these centres accommodation is available, and therefore provision can be made for the necessary in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether we would also encourage private initiative, and whether we would proceed with the idea that private initiative should also do welfare work in this regard. My immediate reply is that this definitely is the policy, and that, as is done in the case of other welfare work, we should like to see private initiative carrying on with this work and that the State will not only supplement it. In this regard, however, whereas I have statutory instructions to do rehabilitation work when people are committed, I could not rely completely and exclusively in private initiative. The State must see to it that there are centres. We encourage private initiative, and we shall go further to encourage them to complete this task for us.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also asked me&#x2014;I am following the sequence as I have it in front of me&#x2014;about the conversion and renovation of the hospital at Dunnottar. I may tell at once the hon. member that he is confusing two concepts in his mind. In the same vicinity we have Struisbult, where private initiative is in fact busy with a hospital and where we are paying them. That is not the same project as the one for which provision is made here. The item &#x201C;Dunnottar&#x201D; is an old mine hospital which was bought by the State, and which is excellently suited for conversion into a home <span class="col_7421-7422" refersTo="page_0665"/>for the aged. This old hospital, which was left after the mines had closed, was purchased and will be converted into a home for the aged which will be fully controlled and run by the State. It will be a State institution and not a private one. In other words, in his argument the hon. member confused the place with the Struisbult, which is situated in the same vicinity and which is in fact a private institution. But this is &#x201C;Dunnottar&#x201D;, and this is an entirely different situation. The amount of money which is provided, is for the conversion of that old hospital into a modern home for the aged, in so far as this is practicable. The idea is that this service will be covered by the loans we are negotiating here.</p>

<p>Then I come to the item &#x201C;Norman House Place of Safety&#x201D;, under which &#x201C;Swimming bath and sports facilities&#x201D; and &#x201C;Accommodation for educational purposes&#x201D; fall. We have experienced problems in the department with the education of these children who are kept in these transit houses in the meantime. These children do not find it easy to adjust to existing schools. It is not always easy, because of numerous problems, of which the hon. member is aware, to send them to existing schools. Consequently I have decided to make education facilities available at these schools, as far as this is possible, so that these children may receive instruction at the home itself. It is for that purpose that we have now requested this amount under this item. The date for tenders is 1st January, 1973. This accommodation is to be completed over a period of 15 months at an estimated cost of R296 000. Only R50 is budgeted so that a start may be made with inviting tenders at the given date. That is the first amount. The total amount is for the provision of education facilities in this case.</p>

<p>As far as the Excelsior Place of Safety and Detention is concerned, to which the hon. member for Umbilo and the hon. member for Durban Berea also paid a visit, I may say at once that this amount is requested for filling up the swimming bath, which was made too deep originally. The hon. member will agree with me that it was dangerous. Furthermore, it comprises the fitting of burglar-proofing, as well as retention moneys for the existing work which is being done there. That is what this amount is requested for.</p>

<p>Then there is the construction of the Magaliesoord Rehabilitation Centre for males, in respect of which provision is made for R50 only. In this case the idea is that the centre will be erected at an estimated cost of R168 000. Now, this centre is the one for drug addicts, alcoholics, at Magaliesoord, where we want to effect certain improvements, such as single rooms, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, the large amount which appears under this item, is in respect of the &#x201C;Refuge for White males&#x201D;, as it appears in the book. The hon. member is conversant with the facts. At the moment we have a refuge for males near Nelspruit, a refuge called Swartfontein. The entire complex of buildings at that place is a little antiquated, and the circumstances are not favourable. Furthermore, I find it very difficult to provide psychiatric services at a place as far removed as Nelspruit is, whereas we have psychiatrists available in Pretoria and Johannesburg. The object here is to build a modern centre, then to close down Swartfontein, and to move the people to Magaliesoord, where these persons may then be accommodated in one large complex. This would be better for the purposes of administration and psychiatric treatment. It would be an improvement in all respects. Ithink if we can spend these amounts in this way, they may be utilized profitably in the interests of the entire division. I think Ihave now replied to all the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on behalf of my colleague, the hon. member for Umbilo, I must say how much we appreciate the answers given by the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions and the fact that he was here to answer the questions. I am sure that, if the rest of the debate can be conducted in this spirit, we are going to do very well.</p>

<p>I want to come back for a moment to the question which was first raised by my friend, the hon. member for Green Point, namely the question of the Hendrik Verwoerd building. The hon. member for Green Point was making the point to the Minister that the Government had missed a golden opportunity here, particularly with the Hendrik Verwoerd building, although all his comments apply equally to other Government buildings which are being erected throughout the country, particularly the prestige buildings. Can the hon. the Minister just think what he could have done with the ground floor of the Hendrik Verwoerd building? Cape Town is the gateway to South Africa. Just think of the number of people who first arrive in South Africa here in Cape Town. Just think <span class="col_7423-7424" refersTo="page_0666"/>what could have happened if we had our tourist offices on the ground floor or the offices of the South African Airways, or information, immigration and passport control, to draw the people to the centre of Cape Town. This is our prestige building. When I say &#x201C;our&#x201D;, I mean South Africa&#x2019;s prestige building. This is the prestige building of the country, of the Government. They have missed this opportunity of using this building for that purpose. It would have been the show-window of South Africa; but instead of that, in the words of the hon. member for Green Point, it is going to be the &#x201C;centre of a dead area&#x201D;, because the Government is not doing anything to encourage the people to come to this particular area.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to refer to those items under Loan Vote B which apply to the Department of Defence. I start by saying that the Defence Vote, as it is totalled in the Revenue Votes, does not give a full picture. Therefore, unless one considers the Loan Votes, not only those under Defence for which R8,7 million is appropriated for shares in the Corporation, but under Loan Vote B as well, you do not get a full picture. What concerns me, is firstly that if one looks at the total under subhead 5, one finds that estimates of R14 812 million have now grown to R34 896 million. In other words, what the Department of Defence estimated originally would cost them R14 million is now going to cost them nearly R35 million. The Department of Defence works on a five-year programme, a budgeting programme on schemes. If this is the picture of budgeting under the Public Works Vote, how much value can we then attach to the estimates under other votes of the Department of Defence? If the hon. the Minister would look on page 14, he will find that the first column shows, as I have said, an amount of R14 812 million. This amount has grown to R34 million</p>

<p>What worries me secondly is not only the inefficient budgeting, budgeting which is nearly three times above estimates, 2&#x00BD; times as high as was originally estimated for the various services, but that over the years only R10,2 million of it has been spent. Only R3,2 million is to be spent this year and there is R21 million remaining to be spent in the future. In other words, this is not in fact a clear picture of what is being spent on capital works for Defence. I want to start with housing. In 1969 the hon. the Minister gave this House an undertaking that his target was 100 per cent housing for married members of the Permanent Force.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>We do not provide for housing under this Vote.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But housing must come out of the Loan Vote. If I compare Defence with Prisons, I find that on every item under Prisons there is a prison budgeted and with it there is the amount to be voted for housing to house the personnel at that prison. This seems to me a sound principle. I should like to know why the Department of Defence cannot follow the same procedure. Where a base is to be established, where it is known that RX 000 or RX00 000 or RX 000 000 is to be spent on a base, why does the Department of Defence not link the housing required for that base to the capital expenditure as it is originally planned? But what happens? We build a base and then there is no housing for the people who will have to operate the base. The hon. the Minister says that it is not under this Vote. I ask him to tell this Committee tonight what progress he has made in the provision under the Loan Votes which we have before us for married quarters for members of the Permanent Force. I have gone through them from one end to the other. I find plenty of engineering services. There are engineering services for married quarters and for different military construction work. My point is that the Department of Prisons has set a good example. When it plans its capital budget, it plans for both the requirements of the department and the people who must work there.</p>

<p>The Department of Defence works haphazardly and it builds as and when it can a few houses there and a few houses here without tying its building programme to the requirements of the specific projects on which it is working. Let me firstly take the question of the military hospital at Tempe. We have here an acceptance of this principle. We have &#x201C;conversion of existing buildings&#x201D; and then a &#x201C;nurses&#x2019; home&#x201D;. That is sensible. I am referring to <span class="col_7425-7426" refersTo="page_0667"/>page 11, right at the start of sub-head 5. You have the concept there of converting buildings and creating a nurses&#x2019; home at the same time. What do we find? Talk of this has been going on for many, many years, but we find that of a total of R460 000 only R46 000 has been spent, R21 000 is to be spent this year and R392 000 is still unspent. This is the pattern. I gave the globular total of R10 million out of nearly R35 million which has been spent already. Then we get these continuous R50 token amounts which are meaningless. People have to live under roofs, not under token figures.</p>

<p>Then we look at the question of protection for vehicles, covered accommodation for vehicles. I have raised this year after year.</p>

<p>The Controller and Auditor-General raises it year after year in his report. Millions of rands&#x2019; worth of vehicles are lying outside in the sun, the wind and the rain rusting and deteriorating. I cannot discuss the administration of this aspect, but I believe that these vehicles are not always correctly serviced. We find five different items for protecting vehicles. What are the items? I am referring to page 12. At Devon R50, at Ellisras R50, at Mariepskop R50 and at Simonstown there is at least R7 000. I am sorry the amount of R7 000 is for the construction of the new tidal basin.</p>

<p>At various centres you get the same thing &#x2014;totalling R400 000 out of R1,3 million. So one can go on&#x2014;I do not have time to deal with them all. One sees this item &#x201C;covered accommodation&#x201D; at various centres&#x2014; with a token R50. Except for one item the amount allocated is R50 per centre. However, we are voting millions of rands in this House for vehicles to be bought, put out in the sun and allowed to deteriorate. What are the priorities with which we are dealing? Surely, if we are to spend millions of rands on equipment, the priorities should be to ensure firstly that your men who work then are housed and secondly that that equipment is protected. However, when one looks at these estimates, neither is there a clear picture of a housing programme nor is there a clear picture of the protection of the vehicles themselves.</p>

<p>I now turn to another aspect, that of recreational facilities. Again we find this picture that where an amount is voted for recreation, it is a small amount. I find that on page 13 provision is made for the one reasonable amount for recreation and other facilities. There provision is made for R423 000, but for the rest we find that the amounts are piffling. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to tell this Committee how he does his planning. I have not got time to deal with the engineering Vote which follows, but I want him to tell us how he does this project planning, relating his manpower requirements to his security or protective requirements, against the overall vote of R2,3 million that we are being asked to vote tonight, out of a total amount of R34 million, representing the total value of projects. If the hon. the Minister can satify us on that and tell us how closely he is approaching his target of 100 per cent housing for married permanent staff, then we will be able to accept that perhaps these figures do not give the full picture.

<p>Sir, I am not able to reply in detail to the questions put here by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. But since we are now discussing the Public Works Vote, I think it is necessary, in the first place, to tell the Minister concerned and his department that this House is not only completely satisfied, but that we are sincerely grateful for the work that is being done, and what is being done is apparent from the report that has been tabled here and is available to all members, including the hon. member who has just resumed his seat.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. I ANSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am also speaking about the previous reports. I want to point out that the Department of Public Works is actually an executive department for numerous other Government departments. In some respects the department acts in an advisory capacity; in other cases it does the work itself, but it nevertheless does the work for numerous other bodies. I think the report for the past financial year speaks volumes for the first-rate work done by the department, and I personally want to express my appreciation to Mr. Howard, the Secretary, and his officials for the work so efficiently done, under difficult circumstances involving a staff shortage, increasing building costs and other related difficulties. But having said this. Sir, I want to add that I think it is high time, particularly in the light of what has recently been broadcast in <span class="col_7427-7428" refersTo="page_0668"/>public by the Press and by that party, that this House should record its appreciation to the Minister, who handles this department, for the way in which this work was done in the face of criticism on a scale which has assumed extraordinary proportions in recent years. Sir, the tactics of people who do not have a policy&#x2014;others have already pointed that out&#x2014;is to adopt the policy I have encounterd in the Bushveld. There one finds predators that want to attack one&#x2019;s livestock, and if they cannot attack the whole herd, they chase one to divert him from the rest and then they try to destroy him with the object of thereby harming the whole herd. That is precisely what has happened here recently, as is apparent from all the actions of the Opposition. I need not refer to examples, but if there is one target that has become a main target of the Opposition recently, it is the hon. the Minister who is in charge of his department. Aspects such as those the hon. member for Durban Point also tried to drag in here, are always being dragged in by every possible means. We are discussing here the Vote of the Minister of Public Works. The obvious tactics evolve around trying to lay the blame at the door of one Minister, thereby placing the Government and other Ministers under suspicion in an attempt to sow dissension. I want to tell the hon. member for Durban Point that if he has any knowledge of the procedures of Parliament&#x2014;and he has more experience in this connection than I have &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, much more but let me add that he has used his much longer time here much less profitably than I have used mine, because if he knows anything of the procedures of Parliament he would know that to investigate the way in which the budgeting is done and the way in which overspending or the non-spending of amounts voted is accounted for, there is a Standing Committee of this House that can regularly check up and ask questions, and that Committee is the Select Committee on Public Accounts, on which not only members of the governing party, but also members of the Opposition serve. If the hon. member for Durban Point wants to express criticism and ask questions about the way in which this important Defence Vote has been handled in recent years, he can go and look at the report of the Select Committee on Public Accounts for the past few years.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>Do you know what you are talking about?</p>

</speech>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I know exactly what I am talking about, because I listened to what the hon. member said. If it hurts I want to advise him not to show that it hurts. The hon. member referred to certain amounts in this programme for which provision has been made and which have not been fully spent, and he also referred to the Department of prisons which made provisions in a different way. Sir, provision can only be made on the basis of a five year projection, as stated with the utmost clarity in the report of the department for the past year. Planning is done five years in advance, but it is impossible for any department to say whether a start is going to be made on those works. It is impossible to determine what the pnorities will be during those five years. One of the specific achievements in recent years has been that preplanned works could be included in a five year programme. If a certain project is approved in principle, the procedure is that a small amount of R50 is set aside for it. If the work can then be continued with, there is at least provision for it in the Estimates. That is the reason why these amounts are listed here. If, in the next year, there is so much progress with the planning that the Department of Public Works can take over the works, these supplementary amounts are voted. But if, for practical reasons, the work cannot be tackled, the nominal amount still remains there to confirm that the work can be tackled at any time. The hon. member for Durban Point is one of the people who ought to know this. If he wants to level accusations at any department, to the effect that proper planning is not being done, I should like to refer him to the fact that in recent years hon. members of the Oposition and members of the Government have always been given the opportunity to ask why amounts that were voted, were not spent, or why there was overspending. There is someone else, who is far more competent than I am, and who has a full department at his disposal, who keeps an eye on this, and that is the Controller and Auditor-General and his department, which can pose questions about these matters, and if the hon. member examines the reports he will see that the questions are in fact asked. But this method of sowing suspicion, as if planning is simply being tackled, to use the English expression, in a &#x201C;haphazard&#x201D; way, and no progress is being <span class="col_7429-7430" refersTo="page_0669"/>made with the actual work, is an accusation that has become so general by now that it has become monotonous. I want to add that such stories that attempt to single out some or other Minister or department, thereby trying to do harm, have become so jaded as far as the public is concerned that no one believes those stories any longer. To come back to the Department of Public Works, the work that has been entrusted to this department has been carried out in such a way in the past year that I want to submit here, with the utmost responsibility, that during the years I served on that Select Committee, this department, under the Minister of Public Works, has had the honour of so few inquiries that this really ought to be mentioned with appreciation.

<p>That was obviously not the best speech the hon. member for Witbank has ever made in his life. At the start of his speech he spoke about a bushveld policy and then began speaking so haphazardly about planning and other matters that I eventually felt it was no longer the member for Witbank making the speech, but the member for the Bushveld. The minister in charge of this Vote asked me the other day to participate in this debate because he wanted to take me to task on a certain point.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>I want to submit four points to the hon. the Minister this evening. The first two are fairly easy. Firstly, there is the old gaol at Grahamstown and. secondly, the upkeep of the 1820 settlers&#x2019; Monument. Thirdly, I want to discuss military buildings, particularly in regard to messes. If the hon. the Minister had been here when I spoke on defence matters, he would know what I am talking about now. The fourth point is in regard to certain secret tactics which I may perhaps reveal here this evening.</p>

<p>I have had correspondence with the hon. the Minister in regard to the old gaol. This is a historic building, and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is building a new gaol there at the moment. I shall be very pleased if he can tell us this evening when it is anticipated that the new gaol will be completed and when the present staff can be transferred to the other place. The hon. the Minister knows that the provincial museum at Grahamstown, is particularly interested in that old gaol. Nobody is quite sure who built it. Some think it was Piet Retief and some think it was somebody else. However, it is just across the street from the museum and it could fit in very well with the Grahamstown museum. The hon. the Minister is agreeable in this regard, but we should very much like to know when this old building can be handed over to the Cape Province and, through the province, to the Grahamstown museum.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the question of the 1820 Settlers&#x2019; Monument, which is perhaps be a very important monument in the history of South Africa. That is where the hon. the Prime Minister has so much to say about national unity. We shall be pleased to receive further information in connection with the future upkeep of this monument. I have corresponded with the hon. the Minister in this regard as well. If he is unable to give us full details this evening, I shall be pleased if he can give the authorities in charge of that monument some indication in this regard to that they can plan ahead and continue with the building operations.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of army messes. In regard to messes&#x2014;I am speaking now particularly about Grahamstown, but I understand that this is the case in other places as well&#x2014;the Department of Public Works now controls military buildings in Grahamstown. I know that the three messes in the camp there, the officers&#x2019; mess and the other two messes, had to be renovated for health reasons. The walls had to be tiled and new stoves and windows had to be installed. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot appoint an official to his regional office who is a diplomat and who will be able to enter into agreements with the messes and with the military forces so as to avoid arguments. The argument in Grahamstown was in regard to how high the tiles should be for health reasons&#x2014; whether they should be three feet or five feet high. In my opinion, for health and maintenance reasons I would have tiled right up to the ceiling because then it would not have been necessary to paint. However, the difference between three feet and five feet had to be paid for out of regimental funds, and I think that was an injustice. I want to extend an invitation to the hon. the Minister. Let him come to Grahamstown with the hon. the Minister of Defence and pay a visit there and see what the regiment paid for. If he does so, he will feel sympathetic <span class="col_7431-7432" refersTo="page_0670"/>and the Department will then rectify the matter with the men of that regiment. If the Minister does come, I can assure him that he will be warmly welcomed and that he will have an enjoyable time there, and I am sure that he will become very soft-hearted towards those officers and men. I also want to say that I was pleased to see a new building being erected at the military camp at Grahamstown. It is a special building, and I am pleased to hear that the hon. the Minister made a concession in this regard and was not small-minded about it. This is a building where the parents of the national servicemen can be entertained, so that they will no longer have to sit under the bluegum trees. I think that this idea should be taken further and extended to every camp in South Africa. If one goes to visit one&#x2019;s son at the camp, there should be some place where one can sit down peacefully to enjoy a cup of tea with him. We are grateful that that building is being erected. I should think that by this time it would have been completed.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that this is the Minister who is experiencing a great deal of difficulty in regard to his buildings. Buildings are constructed in one place and then the people disappear and turn up somewhere else, and so he has to start erecting buildings there, with the result that he cannot keep pace with all the buildings. I shall tell you what the difficulty is. It is the United Party members on this side of the House, because you see, Sir, we have a secret policy. I shall conclude on this note. All those United Party supporters who disappeared from Oudtshoorn are in Brakpan today. [Time expired.]</p>

We have made so much progress that it was possible to state in the Departments&#x2019; report to me this year that in this field remarkable progress had been made in the provision of housing for married members of the Permanent Force. As far as single quarters are concerned, I want to tell the hon. member that he should go and have a look at Simonstown where one of the most beautiful places available&#x2014;and the hon. member for Simonstown will concede this&#x2014;was bought as single quarters for officers.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the question of covered accommodation for vehicles. An amount of R2 million is provided under the fifth continuation part of this programme for the provision of covered accommodation for vehicles. We have a specific plan in terms of which we shall, with a view to mobilization, provide covered accommodation at various points, so that we shall be able to decentralize. The hon. member asked: &#x201C;In what way does planning take place?&#x201D; Let me tell the hon. member in this regard that the Quartermaster-General draws up a programme of priorities. That programme of priorities is approved and submitted to the departments providing housing and operational buildings. As and when an amount becomes available to the Department of Defence from the overall Budget, so this programme of priorities is disposed of. We cannot dispose of the programme more rapidly than funds are made available. If the hon. member had wanted to raise these matters earlier on. I would have given him a detailed reply; I want to tell him that I am not going to do so this evening. We are wasting the time of my colleague now.</p>

There is a section for fortification and military works within the Defence Force. We have an arrangement with the Department of Public Works in terms of which certain services which we are able to carry out through that section, may be carried out by us. We cannot keep up with the work. However, we are definitely not going to build prestige buildings and the kind of buildings which the Department of Public Works alone can build. The work we do is more in the nature of maintenance and the erection of prefabricated buildings; temporary buildings are erected at certain bases. Accordingly, this work which is being done is reflected in the Estimates.

I see that the hon. the Minister has stated in the Estimates that a new Police station will be built in Sea Point, which will cost R565 000. According to the footnote this is an approximate estimate in the absence of full particulars. For that I wanted to thank him but he now makes it impossible for me. I am becoming a little doubtful, because I see that the amount that will be spent over the next year, will be only R50. Now he does not even know where the Police station will be built. Something has gone wrong between here and Brakpan. I am not thanking the hon. the Minister any more. I will thank him later on. For the time being, I will just say that I have noted the fact, namely that he is providing R50 towards the establishment of a new Police station for Sea Point. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I think so too, Sir,</p>

<p>I am pleased that the requests and representations by Sea Point for the building of a new police station there have been complied with. However, this does not mean to say that the old station is in a very poor condition. I honestly want to convey my thanks to other organizations and particularly to the community which made strong representations to the effect that a home for the aged should be built there. The Department of Police then graciously consented to exchange the land on which the police office is standing today for land which the city council made available for R1 for the old age home. For that reason I want to thank the hon. the Miniser of Police for having consented to exchange the land. I now, in greater earnest than a moment ago, want to make representations to the hon. the Minister to ensure that the construction of the new police station is proceeded with as quickly as possible. It is calculated that if a start is made now on drawing up the plans, this matter will not have been finalized until three years have elapsed. That is, if everything goes well. The House will realize that if it is to take three years for the new station to be completed, and if the Police then have to move from the present station to the new one, that it will take a very long time before a start will be made with the construction of the old age home. I am not promising anything, but I would want to say that if this Government does its duty, we will give them favourable consideration, when they have been lifted from those cushions, to be accepted into that home for the aged. But then they must behave themselves properly, and begin now with the construction of this home for the aged.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will be pardoned for not replying to the matters raised here by the hon. member for Sea Point. I think those are matters which should be dealt with more specifically by the hon. the Minister. I should like to refer to the report of the Secretary for Public Works, which we have here before us. I want to refer in particular to the paragraph dealing with the question of industrialized building techniques. This appears on page 2 of the Afrikaans text of the report. Therein it is stated that a sub-committee has been established to go into the entire matter of industrialized building techniques and conditions of contract. We are very pleased that this has been done. If we go back and consider the entire matter of building techniques in South Africa, as well as the question of facilitating the &#x2026; Mr. Chairman, I cannot hear myself speaking.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I know that it is also very difficult for you to maintain order here, because the people are talking too much.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if we want to expedite our building programme in South Africa, we will have to make use of industrialized building techniques. That is why we are pleased and we are grateful that the Department has caused this matter to be investigated. If we take into account the fact that skilled labour, particularly in the building industry in South Africa, is becoming very scarce, we must realize that we will have to make use of building techniques, techniques where one is able to make less use of skilled labour. The only way in which we in South Africa can do this is to make use of industrialized building techrfiques. That is why we are <span class="col_7439-7440" refersTo="page_0674"/>pleased that so much attention is being given to this matter. We hope that we will receive the report of this sub-committee soon, and that the recommendations of that committee will be implemented.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which caught our attention. If we look at the Estimates of this department, we are struck by the multiplicity of items which are still in the planning stage. I am referring to the items in which an amount of only R50 is involved. These are items which have been approved in principle by the various departments, and referred to the Department of Public Works for planning. The only reason why work under these items cannot really be proceeded with, is as a result of the capital cutbacks which had to be made. These capital cutbacks had to be made as a result of the lack of capital funds. I want to advocate this evening that an overall amount should be made available annually for the planning of this work. If we do not proceed with the planning of these various projects which have already been approved in principle we would, in my opinion, be making a fatal mistake. If we do not proceed with the planning, we will find that when we reach the stage where the capital funds for the implementation of these projects are available, the planning will not have been done. We must make provision to ensure that we have taken enough of these services right through the planning stage, so that they can be kept in cold storage. One day, when the capital funds for that purpose are available, we can then continue with those services. Those services must then have been finally planned in all their stages, so that when we take it out of cold storage we can proceed immediately with the building programme.</p>

<p>Another matter to which I should like to refer is a matter which the hon. member for Green Point referred to today. He referred to the further development of the site on which the Marks Building is standing today. Hon. members will recall that I also raised this matter under the same Vote last year. It is my conviction that this beautiful building we have here, the Parliamentary Building, will be absolutely dwarfed by these structures which are going to be erected on its eastern side, on Parliament Street side. The Hendrik Verwoerd Building has already been erected; it is an accomplished fact over which we have no further say. But I want to advocate here this evening, as I did last year as well, that as regards the further development of the site on which the present Marks Building is standing, as well as the other buildings fronting Plein Street, further thought should again be given to the utilization of that site. It is my view that for the foreseeable future that site, when the Marks Buildings and the other buildings have been demolished one day, should be laid out as a garden area, which could ensure that full justice is done to the front elevation of this building. An open space on the eastern side of this building will really cause it to stand out. Progress has already been made with the planning of a new structure on the Plein Street side, but it is my humble view that that planning should be held in abeyance awhile so that we can think about this matter again. I want to advocate here this evening, as I also did last year, that that building, which is in fact going to be a utility building for other Government departments which are established here in the Cape, should be moved back and that that structure should be erected on Stalplein, where that old hotel is standing, as a utility building for the other Government departments in Cape Town. I really feel that we owe it to our Houses of Parliament to ensure that they are not dwarfed entirely by other high structures erected on their eastern side.</p>

I can remember that it had been put up to the PWD, and we now, after seven or eight years, have R50. This is the dynamic Government we have.

<p>I shall confine myself to the stations I know. There is for instance Hibberdene, a station which was put up years ago. The Howick police station is as old as Methuselah and it is out of date. Pongola is on the Transvaal and Zululand border. That police station has been up for years. The point I should like to make is as follows: Man-hours are spent, not only by district commandants, station commanders, divisional commissioners but so it goes on right up to the Commissioner of Police. I know the Commissioner of Police does his best. He puts up his priorities of major and minor works. I want to know how the liaison works between the Minister of Police and the Minister of Public Works. The Secretary for Public Works&#x2014;of course he must be proud of his department&#x2014;has a difficult job and I admit that.</p>

<p>The Secretary for Public Works. He is carrying you, and you know it. The Secretary for Public Works is carrying you and your portfolio. [Interjections.] Be a man and admit it too.</p>

<p>The Secretary for Public Works works at these plans as well. We therefore have the position that after all these years there is this proliferation of wastage of manpower working out plans, working out priorities and we still come to these&#x2014;I nearly used an unparliamentary word&#x2014;very little paltry sums of R50. We get these amounts of R50 after months and years of sweating and the burning of the midnight oil.</p>

<p>On going through these votes I am amazed to see no provision for the complex of the Durban police headquarters, the Port Natal headquarters. I can remember that way back in 1964&#x2013;&#x2019;65 I had to give up all my work, get an architect and we then had to draw plans for the new police complex in Old Fort Road. It was a building of about eight or nine storeys&#x2014;I cannot remember so far back&#x2014;but that has been blown out. In the meantime a third of the appropriation has been spent on the new magistrate&#x2019;s court. It is to be conjoined with the whole Police complex with subterranean tunnels and what-have-you and all modern conveniences, but not a word is mentioned here about the new Port Natal headquarters. What has happened to those plans? Has that architect been paid, the man who spent hours and hours on this work? Who was responsible for this wastage? It is not the Commissioner of Police. I say it must have been the Minister of Public Works.</p>

<p>I want to ask another question. We take <span class="col_7443-7444" refersTo="page_0676"/>the prison which is also to be connected with the big complex. What is the position about a new gaol for Durban? We had publicity several years ago that it was going to be put up at Westville, but not a word under sub-head (14)&#x2014;Prisons! Surely, the Department of Prisons has said something about it, even if an amount of R50 is to be voted. I notice that in the meantime the Durban Point prison is to be repaired and for this purpose an amount of approximately R40 000 is voted for this year. The whole position is that departments work themselves out putting up their priorities, but when those priorities get up somewhere in the higher echelons when they are referred to the Department of Public Works, they seem to fade away.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department quite rightly, points out that it should be left to experts, but I maintain that if we were to leave it to the Public Works Department, we would not even be a tenth of the way on which we are here on this Loan Vote.</p>

<p>In all seriousness I want to say I think it has become necessary to take note of the following. In this connection I want to quote from the report of the department. I shall quote paragraph 22, on page 4 of the report, RP 41&#x2014;&#x2019;72&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The exceptional increase in the demand for accommodation since the late &#x2019;fifties necessitated a new approach in planning the provision of State buildings, and during 1967 new procedures were introduced.</block>

<p>All of us want to advocate what is best for our constituency. However, this can only be done, in the overall planning, in accordance with the needs of the country as a whole. I think it is only reasonable to expect every responsible member to regard the interests of his own constituency as being subservient to the interests of the Republic as a whole. I think that the department of the hon. the Minister of Public Works has, in the past year, made a first-rate success with regard to that object. I think it can rightly be said that these services, for which items of R50 are being placed on the Estimates, with the express purpose of holding out the prospect of something being done in connection with those services in the coming years, can only be planned in accordance with the needs in the rest of the country. If other needs become more urgent, earlier needs become subservient to one which has acquired greater urgency. In this report, on page 4, it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aim is to programme building and engineering services, which are the responsibility <span class="col_7445-7446" refersTo="page_0677"/>of this Department, in order of priority (both inter and intra-departmentally) on a basis of a five-year plan. To facilitate this, user departments, in compliance with Circular Minute No. 10 of 1967, issued by the Department of the Prime Minister, have to submit lists of the services required for consideration and inclusion in the programme. The programme is reviewed and adjusted annually and new projects are added on the basis detailed above.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not think any country, and particularly a country like the Republic, can afford to <i>ad hoc</i> planning and implementation. I think it has become urgently necessary to review the old policy according to which works had to be tackled on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as a result of the problems of the post-war years. Sir, I think that this experiment that has been put into operation by the Department of Public Works, has been a first-rate success. Earlier in the evening mention was made of the fact which I do not dispute, that we, the State, still make use of a great many rented buildings. In that connection I can just say that the Department of Public Works at present supervises about 7 000 Government buildings, and that there is further accommodation in about 1 400 buildings additionally rented for State purposes. But if one advocates, as I could at Witbank, that there should be new Police offices for the Detective Service, which is at present accommodated in rented buildings, one cannot argue, as hon. members of the Opposition argued earlier in the evening, that we should simply carry on holus-bolus with the erection of buildings. One needs capital for the erection of buildings. The hon. member for Green Point speaks of a rental of 50 cents to R1-50 per square foot that has to be paid by the State. Sir, if the State itself has to erect those buildings, provision must still be made for interest and redemption on the erection costs of those buildings. Not only must provision be made for interest and redemption, and for the necessary capital, but there is also the ground that is necessary; there is the staff necessary for planning and the staff necessary for the implementation of that service. Temporary buildings simply have to be rented. Before buildings are erected it is essential that a decision be taken, not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, but on a long-term basis. In this connection I want to mention one example. Just think of the development in the Eastern Transvaal, for example. There is no one who can say at the moment where exactly the centre of that development will be. It would surely be only short-term planning to erect huge buildings, at this stage, at one of the five, six, or seven towns situated in that area. It is surely much better to make provision for an amount of R50, to which hon. members on that side jokingly referred here, and then to wait and see what the developments are before one finally commences with the planning and the erection of a building for a special service.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude by once again referring to the work that has been done by the department. It is with gladness that I can refer to one service in Witbank, i.e. the completion of a post office building, which was tackled after many years, but which was carried out with such thoroughness that it will still fee serving its purpose for years to come. I would rather see the erection of a Government building delayed for a year or two and the later planning of an efficient building that will be serviceable for many years. I can say, if this needs to be recorded, that I do not feel happy at the fact that in the loan programme this year provision is being made for only one item for new buildings in Witbank, the constituency I represent here. But I want to add that I know that the planning is taking place in such a way, and that there is such a degree of co-ordination, that new buildings Which are being erected elsewhere are more urgently needed. With this five-year programme, and the proposed long-term programmes, I am sure that my constituency, and other deserving constituencies, will have their turn next year or the year after. I thank the Minister and his department.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Witbank appears to be very easily satisfied, and I hope his constituents are going to hear what he said here tonight, and that is that provision has been made on the Estimates for only R50 for one building in his constituency, and yet he still comes and thanks the hon. the Minister and his department.</p>

<p>The hon. member claims that he is a South African. He is a South African, but first he is a Member <span class="col_7447-7448" refersTo="page_0678"/>of Parliament and he should be looking after the interests of his constituents. I am proud to be able to say that in these Estimates provision is being made for an additional R10 million for my constituency, and I am not going to thank the Minister for it, because this is what we expect and what my constituents expect. I am also a South African, Sir, I do not have to thank the Minister to show that I am a South African, or that 1 am a good South African. Why did the hon. member for Witbank, when he quoted the report on planning and control, stop where he stopped; why did he not go on to the next paragraph, paragraph 24, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The implementation of these procedures resulted in systematic and co-ordinated planning and has eliminated the chaotic conditions created by shont-term planning under which financial control and the determination of staff requirements were well-nigh impossible.</block>

<p>Sir, notwithstanding all these words about &#x201C;co-ordinated planning&#x201D;, how much coordination, how much planning has there been in fact? The hon. member for Umlazi mentioned the Hammarsdale police station, which he says&#x2014;and he corroborates what I said to the hon. the Minister two years ago&#x2014;was first mooted and put up as a top priority item in 1964; but it first appeared in these Estimates in the 1968&#x2013;&#x2019;69 financial year. A sum of R50 was allocated then. In 1969&#x2013;&#x2019;70 it was estimated that the total cost would be R170 000. I accept that that was an estimate, in the absence of further details, but again R50 was voted and not a penny was spent. In 1970&#x2013;&#x2019;71 we suddenly find that the estimate has gone up to R240 000, and again only R50 is voted but not a penny is spent. In 1971&#x2013;&#x2019;72, all of a sudden, the amount goes up to R340 000. From 1969 to 1971&#x2013;&#x2019;72 the estimate of costs doubled from R170 000 to R340 000. and it is still only an estimate. We find that R20 000 was voted for this in 1971&#x2013;&#x2019;72. and how much was spent, according to the latest record? Not a single solitary cent. Is this planning: is this advance planning? What do we find in the 1972&#x2013;&#x2019;73 Estimates? Provision is made for R450 000. At last we have arrived at a figure which is not an estimate. The estimated cost is R450 000. The cost has escalated from R170 000 to R450 000 from 1968 to 1972, and once again, Sir, what is voted? R50. When are they going to get on with this job of work?</p>

<block name="quote">In general, this procedure has also contributed to a degree in ensuring a more even flow of work to the building industry.</block>

That is the approximate estimate in the absence of full particulars. But again only R50 is voted. Now I want to ask the Minister whether he is serious. Is he going to carry out these extensions to the school and if so, when will he carry out these extensions to the school, or when is he going to get his colleague to carry them out? And does he know what his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Planning, is doing in that area? Because what do we have at this moment? We have the situation that this Minister is planning extensions to the school for Indians but his colleague, the Minister of Planning has deproclaimed the area for Indians and has proclaimed it for Coloureds. In a moment the hon. the Minister of planning will ask the other half of this Minister&#x2019;s schizophrenic personality, the Minister of Community Development, to move those Indian people out and to move Coloured people in.

<p>I do not know why the hon. member is so sensitive. We also have the question of the police station at Hammarsdale which the Minister says he is going to proceed with, and I would like an answer on this. But we also have the question of the police station at Thornville, which is also in my constituency, a police station for which I fought for four years with the Minister of Police to maintain, because he wanted to close it. I finally won my case and I am now putting it to him that the conditions there are so shocking not only with regard to the housing of the staff, but also the office accommodation. I am very glad to see that now for the second year&#x2014;we are getting somewhere at last&#x2014;R50 is being voted for extensions and improvements to that police station. The hon. member for Umlazi has pointed out that this police station was built well over 40 years ago. At that stage it was not built as a police station. In fact, part of the offices were originally built as stables, but it is still being used to this day as the offices. I sincerely hope the Minister will get on and improve this police station and make these alterations which are required.</p>

<p>Then I want to come back to this question of the building across the way, the Hendrik Verwoerd Building. Let me say that we accept that this is a prestige building. I sincerely hope the Minister will take note of the positive suggestions which have been put to him from this side of the House, regarding the use of that and other buildings, and the planning in future.

The paving, the granite, the stinkwood and the yellow wood are very nice, but what was the cost of those finishes, and what was the cost of the furnishing, the carpets and the curtains, particularly the furniture, which are of an extremely luxurious nature?

<p>He asked whether it would be handed over to the Grahamstown Museum after that. Well, I am not opposed to the idea, but unfortunately the decision does not rest with me. I really cannot do anything about the decision. The point is that if my department vacates a prison, the Department of Public Works immediately has the say over it. They have the say on what will be done with it, and unfortunately I cannot be of any service to him in this regard. Furthermore, he asked me when this prison would be completed. I am afraid I cannot tell him this evening. As he knows, the building work is in progress. At the moment I do not know what the tender price is, but if he wants to come over to me during the week, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, I shall give him the information. That is the reply to his question.</p>

<p>I just want to say to the hon. member for Umlazi that I thank him for the compliment in regard to the Justice building in Durban. It is a wonderful proposition. I do not know what it is going to cost. Originally, I understand, it would have cost R15 million. There are 14 different buildings accommodating the magistrates and we have progressed so far now that we are erecting this central building. We are making good progress, and the seventh storey has already been reached. But he mentioned something else as well. He asked me about the Durban prison. A tremendous amount of publicity has been given to the matter. The history is that when our former Chief Justice, the late Mr. Nicolaas de Wet was Minister of Justice in 1916, he approached the City Council of Durban for the first time in regard to a suitable site. I can tell you that from that day until some time ago, we could not get any further, until I eventually found a site at Westville. But I did not obtain it as a site which the City Council had allocated to me; I obtained it in co-operation with the Department of Agricultural Credit. I assume it is under departmental planning, otherwise there would have been an amount of R50 for it on the Budget. I cannot say when the first sod will be turned. Then there is the Point Prison, to which he also referred. Briefly, the position there is that improvements are merely being made. The reason is that the climate there is warm and that it is fairly overpopulated there. We wish to make these improvements from a hygienic point of view.</p>

The allocation which the Department of Indian Affairs got from the Department of Public Works for buildings is just under R4 500 000. We have a series of priorities on which that money is spent. The R4 500 000 is practically absorbed by the priorities that we allocate. The hon. member made a big thing of the R50 voted in certain instances. The hon. member should know that these are purely nominal amounts that are provided for a proposed or suggested building which at some future date will be built when the funds are available. The reason for putting them on the Public Works roster is so that the hon. member and everybody can see what is intended. The R50 has nothing to do with the building itself; it is a nominal amount. What can one build with R50?</p>

<p>Until such time as the funds ar available and the building becomes a priority and takes its place in the Vote. That is the procedure that is followed.

This is the whole basis on which finance is run in the country; if there <span class="col_7453-7454" refersTo="page_0681"/>were R10 million available, more would have been built and there would have been fewer nominal amounts.

<p>Obviously, when it is made a nominal amount and something such as this should take place&#x2014;I do not know where the member gets his information from; no school building has been or will be built for Indians in that area. That is all it is. The hon. member tries to get a laugh out of the fact that it has been declared a Coloured area, but that is not the point at all. This is a matter of the financing of priorities as far as the Department of Indian Affairs is concerned, and that is how it is done. It has been done for years. In the United Party days it was also done, and everybody accepted it. Now of course, they make a big song and dance about it.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I was interested to hear from the hon. the Minister about the methods of financing in regard to public works. Firstly, it seems that R50 is nominally allocated to certain works on the Estimates, which I accept is the procedure. But there have been so many cases of amounts of R50 being voted and allocated for certain public works in constituencies that one wonders whether it is not a sort of sop to hon. members, particularly on that side, to tell them when they ask for a certain important building in their constituency: &#x201C;Look, we are going to build you this and we are going to build you that; just watch out for the Estimates; next year you will find it in them.&#x201D; In the next year it does appear in the Estimates but only with this minor amount of R50 after it. Then the hon. members can go to their constituencies and say, &#x201C;Look at this wonderful Government; we are going to build you a wonderful new public building; here it is on the Estimates&#x201D;, but they never mention the fact that it is only R50.</p>

<p>What I found surprising too is the way in which the hon. the Minister to a certain extent let the cat out of the bag when he said that his department is allocated a certain amount&#x2014;R4 500 000 in his case, he said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Surely, one deals with matters on their merit. One does not allocate R4 000 000 to this Minister, R10 000 000 to that one and R100 000 000 to another and say to them: &#x201C;Well, boys, there are your millions; spend them as you wish&#x201D;. One works out one&#x2019;s priorities. One does not give a certain amount to a single Minister and tell him to do whatever he wishes to do with it. That is an entirely wrong system.</p>

<p>There is one matter I would like to raise with the hon. the Minister, namely the whole question of the tender procedure, the acceptance of tenders and the policy followed with regard to tenders themselves. As is realized nowadays, with the growing costs when you have to build an important building, your costs escalate over the years. Very often you find your tenderers tendering for a certain amount and that they then find after a couple of years that they have to increase that amount. It has happened in the case of the P. K. le Roux Dam. Afterwards the Minister of Water Affairs said that he would not accept any tenders and that his department would build the dam themselves. I believe this department is not paying sufficient attention to this factor of escalating costs when considering tenders and when rejecting tenders. Very often they reject tenders which are higher and which are based on escalating costs and afterwards they then have to pay a much larger amount on account of having accepted a lower tender. That is the first point I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to raise concerns the hon. the Minister of Transport. It is in connection with the Jan Smuts Airport. Originally, in 1966, the hon. the Minister <span class="col_7455-7456" refersTo="page_0682"/>told me that the Jan Smuts Airport would cost R16 million. Now we see, although we realize that there have been certain changes in the plans, that it is going to cost much more than 100 per cent more, namely R39&#x00BD;million. A balance of R12&#x00BD; million will still have to be spent over the next four years. I have no objection to money being spent on the Jan Smuts Airport to make it one of the best airports not only in South Africa, but in the world, a gateway to South Africa, but when these costs escalate and the taxpayer has to pay these huge amounts it is time that we had an explanation from the hon. the Minister of Transport as to what is actually happening in regard to the Jan Smuts Airport, when it is expected that the whole project will be completed and what plans are being made not only for the present development, but also for the Jumbo Jets and later for the Concorde Jets.</p>

<p>*I now come to my next point. What policy is the hon. the Minister following these days in connection with statues that are erected outside public buildings, not only in Pretoria, but throughout the country? We have had very interesting developments in this connection. The hon. the Minister has received letters, complaints and deputations from bodies and persons in connection with certain statues erected in Pretoria and other places.</p>

He receives letters from the Rev. Dan de Beer and I also receive letters from the Rev. Dan de Beer because I praised the Minister once. I think we should establish a club of all the hon. Ministers on the other side who have received letters from the Rev. Dan de Beer. I should like to join that group. I should like to know from the Minister what policy he is following at present in connection with statues of that nature.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The next matter I want to raise is in connection with the beautiful building across the street, the H. F. Verwoerd Building. There was something in that building that struck me the first time I went there. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that in these lifts there were no notices segregating them. In effect, anybody of any race was allowed to use those lifts. It is an excellent idea. Can the hon. the Minister tell me whether this is a policy which he will be following and will advocate to his colleagues in regard to public buildings in future? I support that policy. There is a very important policy matter involved in this, not as regards this side of the House but as regards that side of the House. We on this side regard those lifts simply as lifts, but I have an important question to ask the hon. the Minister in this regard and he must elucidate this point. He must give us some insight into the thinking of his party. There we have these lifts which are open to people of all races. Can the Minister now tell us whether those lifts are multi-racial or multi-national? This doubt has been worrying me seriously all along and I trust that the hon. the Minister will elucidate this point and give us the reason for it. If they are not multi-racial, why are they not multi-racial? If they are multi-national, why are they multi-national?</p>

<p>*I went to the libary and consulted our best Afrikaans dictionaries. I searched and searched for the word &#x201C;veelvolkig&#x201D;, but there is no such word. I spoke to the hon. the Minister and I take it that he had earnest consultations with the hon. the Prime Minister on a matter such as: &#x201C;Are those lifts in the Verwoerd Building multi-national or are they multi-racial?&#x201D;</p>

<p>The last matter I want to raise with the hon. the Minister in connection with public works is the naming of public buildings.</p>

No, I think the time has arrived for the hon. the Minister to keep an eye on the naming of buildings which, to a fantastically uncontrolled extent, are named after people who really do not deserve it. This is an important matter. If the hon. the Minister examines the names of the schools in the Transvaal, he will find that 90 per cent are named after personss.

The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District has conceded in almost as many words that it is true, but he expects even more of us than we are giving them at present. On the Loan Votes concerning the Police. Loan Vote B and Loan Vote K, provision is being made for an amount of no less than R11 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>How much for this year? *</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is for this year. The hon. member should keep quiet now. He has already spoken and should allow me to speak now. That hon. member wants me to reply to him, but he was acting the clown when he was speaking. He cracked jokes and laughed while he was speaking, while he wanted to create the impression that he was serious about the matters he was discussing. On this Loan Vote, R7&#x00BC; million is appropriated for buildings and offices. I want to ask the hon. member for Umlazi or any hon. member on that side of this House whether provision has ever been made before for anything like that amount for the construction of police buildings in one year, It may perhaps have been last year or the year before, but never before has it been as much. It is a wonderful sum of money and the consideration here is not whether we need the police buildings. We need them very much. We inherited a tremendous backlog from the previous Government. Recently, a few weeks ago, I opened an office complex in Paarl. The previous police station in Paarl had been there since the beginning of this century. Our backlog was that big. The hon. members pleaded here for this nolice station and for that police station. I want to ask them rather to leave the matter to me, or where buildings are being constructed for the Department of Justice, to leave it to the Minister of Justice, to decide where the need is in fact the greatest. The fact of the matter is that we do not have sufficient money and cannot obtain enough services to meet all the needs in one year. The hon. member for Umlazi also spoke. and I know he is concerned about the political matters, but I just want to say to him that he should ask himself whether an amount of R7&#x00BC; million for nolice offices and buildings in one year is a reasonable amount, whether it is an amount which one can expect under the circumstances. I think that if he asked himself that question, he would reply in the affirmative. We have decided that we are going to provide 100 per cent housing to police officers. However, we cannot do it in one year: there has never been anything like this before. Not only must nolice offices be built in Durban, in Johannesburg and in all the other towns and places, but also housing. I am perfectly satisfied that as far as nolice offices and housing on Loan Vote K are concerned we are doing our duty towards the Police. I do not want to elaborate on the amounts of R50 to which reference was made. If a member finds a building in his <span class="col_7461-7462" refersTo="page_0685"/>constituency in these Estimates, he may regard himself as fortunate. He may regard himself as fortunate, because at least it means that the constuction of that project will be commenced. It does not mean that we will commence immediately. Sometimes, as in the case mentioned by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, circumstances change in the meantime and in the process of planning we decide that as a result of the development, the needs which exist are greater than those we planned for previously. The increase in costs is in all probability due to the fact that a larger building is required than originally planned. The amount allocated to us, will be allocated in accordance with the needs at the different places. As far as I am concerned, I think the Police are satisfied. I, as the responsible Minister, am satisfied and nobody is more eager than I to ensure that proper accommodation is provided for them. I am satisfied that I have received my rightful share in the Budget, and I shall try to apportion this where the need is the greatest.</p>

Sir, he asked who approved these buildings. There is a special sketch-plan committee in the Department of Public Works under the Chairmanship of the Chief Architect of my Department, Mr. Badnitz, who is one of the most brilliant men in South Africa. That committee approves these buildings.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District also passed certain remarks in regard to this building. He made certain suggestions, namely, that the tourism, airways, baggage and information offices should be accommodated on the ground floor. May <span class="col_7463-7464" refersTo="page_0686"/>I remind him that this is the Parliamentary complex. Can he imagine what the position would be if we were to have all those offices accommodated there? These decisions are taken by architects, people who know their job.

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Orange Grove that the tenders in respect of buildings are dealt with like ordinary tenders for the erection of buildings. These people tender, and if in due course it appears that the tenders were too low, negotiations are entered into with them.

<p>The office of Jan Marais, or of any big businessman, is larger than the ministerial offices in the H.F. Verwoerd Building. The office of any reasonably big businessman is larger. I do not blame the hon. member. He has never had an office in his life. The first office he had was the one he now has in this Parliamentary Building. So I do not blame him for becoming so terribly upset about the size of Ministers&#x2019; offices. I think I have now replied to all the questions put to me.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I ask for the privilege of the half-hour. When the hon. the Minister intensified import control on the 24th November last year, he made a number of very fundamental decisions. The unused balances of 1971 permits were reduced by 50 per cent, the free-import permit list of goods was substantially reduced, the 1972 permits became valid only in March as against the usual procedure of being valid as from January, and local quotas were introduced and pegged at 20 per cent. I think it is generally accepted in the business community of South Africa that these actions by the Minister were a breach of faith against the private sector. Had they been the actions of any other sector but the Government&#x2019;s, they would in fact have been actionable since every importer in this country had a document from the Government which entitled <span class="col_7467-7468" refersTo="page_0688"/>him to do certain things, but then by the cross of the pen those things were made invalid.</p>

<p>The decision to intensify import control was taken in the face of repeated statements by the hon. the Minister that there would be no intensification, and that the previous volume of imports would not be a factor. The decision was taken in the full knowledge that local importers, through no fault of their own, would be forced to break contacts with overseas suppliers, would have to dishonour obligations accepted under irrevocable letters of credit and it would badly damage the names of South African importers. Intensification of this control brought a great deal of hardship to a great number of people be cause a great number of people had built their businesses on undertakings that had been given by the hon. the Minister and by the Cabinet, that there would be no alternation in import control. <i>Commercial Opinion</i> of April sums up the position very briefly and correctly under the heading &#x201C;Unhappy Importers&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Recent import control policy has caused uncertainty, widespread confusion, financial loss, difficulty in forward planning and generally, higher costs among the commercial community with adverse effect on the consumer.</block>

<p>We do not know when the second round of permits will take place or to what extent the second round of permits will be issued. What we do know is that the original issue of 20 per cent really did not do importers very much good. Devaluation and price increases have reduced the quantitative value of these permits. In this article, Assocom indicates that in its opinion 20 per cent of the 1969 quota permits is equal to only two months&#x2019; supplies. What I want to ask the hon. the Minister is how the manufacturer, the importer, the wholesaler or the retailer is to carry on his business under these conditions; particularly when the hon. the Minister knows perfectly well that today one must place orders overseas at least six to twelve months in advance? Again we have the usual uncertainty associated with any action this Government takes. We were told that the whole policy of import control would be reviewed in May. I just want to remind the hon. the Minister that this is the merry month of May. We know there has been a considerable improvement in the balance of payments position, both on capital account and on current account. The hon. the Minister should now tell us&#x2014;and I hope he will in this debate&#x2014;not only that he is in a position to announce a second round, but what his policy is in regard to import control, and, basically, whether it is directed at our balance of payments position or whether it serves as an instrument for the benefit of industry.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we want to know what is happening. In 1970 I think, the Government sent a number of emissaries abroad to try to solve some of our problems with GATT. Last year the Secretary for Commerce and his officials went over to talk to GATT. What has transpired since then? How do we stand at the moment? We have been told extremely little. We have a statement by the Secretary for Commerce in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs has had serious implications for South Africa&#x2019;s future economic development. GATT trading rules are an unfair burden on South Africa. Although we are still a developing country, we have to obey the international trade duties of a developed country.</block>

<p>This was said on the 2nd May of this year. What is the Government doing? We know what it does, when it cannot find a solution to any problem it appoints a commission. This is standard Government practice. This is what it has done on this occasion. It has appointed a commission. What are the terms of reference of this commission?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To investigate and report on the measure in which South Africa&#x2019;s obligations under GATT are to be reconciled with the country&#x2019;s essential development needs and steps the Government could take to meet any problems arising from continued membership of GATT in respect of effective protection of local producers and industries.</block>

<p>I would have believed that the Government would have solved these problems many, many years ago. After all, GATT was conceived in 1947 and it came into operation in 1948; that is 25 years ago, and now we have a commission to find out what GATT means.</p>

<p><span class="col_7469-7470" refersTo="page_0689"/>I hope that this commission will get a move on with its work and that we will get some meaningful decision from it. What we want is very clear indeed; we want a programme of protection for some of our industries, a form of protection which will be internationally acceptable. We perhaps in some cases even want import control for certain key industries which are basic to the future of South Africa. We want an adaptation of transport rates that could also be effective. We want special consideration for those industries that can grow in scale. We also want consideration for those industries that have potential as growth leaders. Perhaps most important of all, we want a realization by people that we have to deal in this country with a population of 22 million and that the industries that merit specific and special consideration will be those industries that can absorb large numbers of semi-skilled and unskilled labour. We must go for industries that have the ability to export and for industries that have an international competitive advantage. Of course, to do any of these things we need a crash programme for labour. We have to train and re-train labour, because unless we do that, no scheme that we try to implement can be successful.</p>

<p>A second allied matter is the question of exports. We deal with this problem every year in this House, but we seem to make very little progress indeed. Today I received the statement issued by the hon. the Minister after the meeting of the Export Advisory Council which was held last month, and it merely confirms what we have been saying for many, many years. I want to quote from it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The urgent need for positive and concerted action by the public and private sectors to achieve a substantial increase in South Africa&#x2019;s total export earnings; this is the basic objective.</block>

<p>What we have to realize is that to achieve a growth rate in South Africa of 5,5 per cent per annum, it is estimated that at constant prices merchandise imports will have to grow at an annual rate of at least 5 per cent and that merchandising exports will have to grow at an annual rate of 6,8 per cent to pay for these imports, plus the country&#x2019;s net debit balance on Service Account. There is an awful lot of loose talk about imports and import control, but I want to repeat what I have said in this House a dozen times: 80 per cent of all imports that flow into this country are for capital goods or for materials for our industries, and only 20 per cent are consumer goods. Import control or no import control, we are basically going to be required to import 80 per cent of what our present imports are, because they comprise essentials. If you stop the importation of these essentials, you obviously adversely affect your whole economic development. The bulk of our imports has just got to continue if we want to have the growth that we all know is essential to help us solve the problems of this country; if we are going to be able to provide job opportunities for everybody, which is our prime consideration. The only way we can pay for our imports is by exports. What we want to know from the hon. the Minister tonight is what he is doing about exports. We know that certain things have been done. We know that limited tax benefits have been granted. There has been the export guarantee corporation; we have SAFTO the Export Advisory Council and now the commission. Nevertheless, I think the hon. the Minister will be the first to agree that none of these have provided the necessary spark to get our exporters going. We do not seem to be able to generate enthusiasm and dynamism; we do not seem to be able to get our exports off the ground. This is our basic problem. When we realize that in 1971 we exported less than in 1970, and that we exported less in 1970 than we did in 1969, the problem becomes very apparent. The hon. the Minister has taken some action. In November last year and in March of this year he sent two economic missions to the major EEC countries. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us whether the business undertakings in South Africa took advantage of these missions that went abroad. Did the missions serve their purpose, and were they successful? Following the experience of these two missions, is it the intention of the hon. the Minister to send further missions to the other EEC countries? On 5th August the hon. the Minister announced the appointment of the Reynders Commission, to which I have already referred, which was to go into the whole question of exports and to make recommendations to the hon. the Minister. I want to know from the hon. the Minister, in regard to the interim report he has received, whether it was discussed with the Export Advisory Council. It was not clear from the statement issued on the 14th. I also want to know <span class="col_7471-7472" refersTo="page_0690"/>whether this first report has been available to those sectors of the private sector that are vitally interested, because I do not believe that we can wait for the final report. I believe we have to take action now, and we have to take it fast. This is what SAFTO said in its February edition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If South Africa is to look back to devaluation with a feeling of achievement, South African goods will have to be marketed with an aggressiveness and singleness of purpose, not before seen in this country. We have to take advantage of the devaluation. We have to do things now.</block>

<p>On 10th September last year the hon. the Minister referred to a Cabinet Committee which, he said had been appointed with responsibility for all aspects of our trade with the EEC as a result of Great Britain&#x2019;s accession to the Common Market. He told us that full discussions have been held with interested parties, and that the results&#x2014;I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; will now be submitted by Minister Muller to the Cabinet Committee for consideration and the formulation of an agreed programme of action by the Government.</block>

<p>That was six months ago. What has happened? We want to know what programme of action has been formulated by the Cabinet. What is the programme of action referred to in this statement, where is this programme? What has been said about it? I have heard nothing about it. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us.</p>

<p>This question of exports is an issue which I regard and, I am sure, the hon. the Minister regards as one of the vital issues before the country. A SAFTO man had this to say on 21st April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Projections indicate the deficit in South Africa&#x2019;s current account for the balance of payment is likely to double to R2 000 million in 1980, according to Mr. Holdies. chief executive of SAFTO. He has called for a massive drive to boost export of a selected range of products to lessen this deficit.</block>

<p>This is what we will be faced with in the years to come. As I have said, we do not seem to be getting our exports off the ground. Year by year our exports are diminishing. Professor Reynders&#x2019; first comment, when he was appointed as chairman of this commission, was to stress the urgency of this issue. I want to add my plea to those already made to the hon. the Minister, that what requires to be done has to be done right now. I refer the hon. the Minister to <i>Management</i> of this month, where they discuss this topic and end off with the following phrases&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any search for a firm clear statement of national export policy still leads nowhere. Odd bits of what might be a policy can be culled with time and effort from odd bits of speeches, but the seventies will need more than that.</block>

<p>This is where we now stand.</p>

<p>I now come to another issue, namely that of pyramid or multi-level selling. I have here a copy of an Australian paper, the <i>Advertiser</i> of Adelaide, of 3rd January, 1972. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Pyramid selling was and is the most ingenious elaborate exploitation of the chain letter principle, and of sales techniques in modem commercial history. It has fed on the needs of thousands of ordinary decent people for more income, on the greed of many others for relatively easy fortunes.</block>

<p>What is this multi-level selling, this pyramid selling? It starts with a parent organization that supplies the product. Then you have the pyramid. You start with the general distributor, the &#x201C;general&#x201D; as he is called. He buys his stocks from the organization. Then he appoints and sells to a master distributor, or master distributors. The master distributors appoint organizers and sell stock to them. The organizers appoint and sell stock to the so-called &#x201C;girls&#x201D;. Different firms call them different girls. Each one on the way down takes a commission, but there are often a number of other conditions attached to these appointments of &#x201C;general&#x201D; and &#x201C;master&#x201D; and &#x201C;organizer&#x201D; and &#x201C;seller&#x201D;. Here is where the trouble lies. Firstly, each category in the chain is required to buy a fixed amount of stock. In the case of a &#x201C;general&#x201D;. I am told it can be as much as R3 600 and in so far as the &#x201C;girls&#x201D; are concerned, it can be as low as R35. Secondly, you move up from a lower sales position to a higher sales position by <span class="col_7473-7474" refersTo="page_0691"/>buying your release from the gentleman above you. If you are a &#x201C;master&#x201D; and you want to become a &#x201C;general&#x201D;, you have to pay the &#x201C;general&#x201D; to release you from being a &#x201C;master.&#x201D; In one case this costs R2 300. Then there are other conditions as well. In one company, for a &#x201C;master&#x201D; to become a &#x201C;general,&#x201D; he first of all has to find somebody to replace him as a &#x201C;master&#x201D; in the &#x201C;general&#x2019;s&#x201D; organization. He has to pay for and complete a course of instruction and he has to have as part of his organization, at least ten &#x201C;girls&#x201D; who will sell a minimum volume of goods each month. This type of operation has as its objective not selling goods; it has as its objective selling distributorships. This is all it trafficks in. It trafficks in appointments, the one selling an appointment to the other in a pyramid until everybody in the country, if you take it <i>ad infinitum,</i> is involved in this situation. Part of the deal is the commitment to high-priced training courses which can cost as much as R500 per course. Another condition is that the goods sold can never be returned to the company so that you can get your money back. Goods have to be sold at fixed prices. Overseas this offends against fair trade practices and in this country&#x2014; and this I want to bring specifically to the notice of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;I believe it offends against our retail price maintenance. Sales training is common in this multi-level selling but in some cases I believe this training has a frightening aspect. You are taught the philosophy that the product or the training or the method of selling can never be unsuccessful; you are told that none of these things can ever be wrong,&#x2014;the product, the training and the method of selling. If you yourself are not successful, it is you who are the failure and the loser. Therefore you are out. I have a letter here from a distributor who lost some thousands of rand. I quote from this letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The company repeatedly stated that they were not interested in losers; there was no such thing as a business failing, only people failing.</block>

<p>This is the psychological impact they are making upon these unfortunate people. You are taught to approach people completely unknown to you, in the streets and in bus queues. Here is an extract from the <i>Financial Mail</i> of the 3rd March. The footnote reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Last week in Johannesburg three men were accosting members of the public, including two S. M. staffers, outside the Colosseum cinema offering to tell them about the chance to make a great deal of money.</block>

<p>That is what is going on. They give you what they call an opportunity to amass great wealth in a very short time. They try to get you to come to what is known as an opportunity meeting. I am also told that if you try to wash out the deal and say to them that they are no good and that you want your money back, they turn round and tell you that if you decide to tell anybody that you think they are a poor organization and that they are not ethical, you are going to hear from their lawyers and this is going to cost you R100 000. They tell you that they will sue you for defamation; that they will sue you for libel. You are told that you are the failure and not the company, nor the product nor the method. These people get frightened, so we hear nothing about it, except for the few letters that I have had since it became known that I was going to raise this matter. This is the background of a selling plan that has taken root in many countries where unscrupulous people have made millions which have been lost by a host of very decent people. This is what the London <i>Sunday Mirror</i> had to say in its issue of February &#x2026;</p>

<p>I quote from the London <i>Sunday Mirror</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some people, it is true, do make money on Holiday Magic by recruiting new distributors on a massive scale and receiving a fee per head; others make a go of the successful individual selling business. <span class="col_7475-7476" refersTo="page_0692"/>But on the other side of the coin are the people who have been sucked in by this firm&#x2019;s emotional recruiting technique and found next day that they are lumbered with a load of cosmetics which they cannot sell. There are enough of these people to cause serious concern. They face an agony of debt and self doubt and feel an overpowering sense of failure.</block>

<p>This is the worst aspect of the matter. In this country today we have people selling cosmetics. We have people who are ostensibly selling touring. They tell you if you become a distributor, &#x201C;general&#x201D; or &#x201C;master&#x201D; in a sales organization for overseas tourists, you get cheaper tours. We have people who are selling discount distributorships. There is a whole list in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of at least a dozen companies&#x2014;there are more today&#x2014;who are doing this. I don&#x2019;t want to be misunderstood. I am not saying that all multi-level, and certainly not all direct, house-to-house selling organizations are bad ones. We have some first-class organizations in this country who for years have been selling house-to-house. They are reputable and everybody respects them. We have some multi-level ones who are doing the same thing. But we have to take some action against the unscrupulous ones. I have had letters&#x2014;I have lots of them here&#x2014; from firms who are involved in direct selling to ask for an investigation by the hon. the Minister. They are the ones who want it.</p>

<p>There has also been formed a Direct Sales and Services Association of South Africa. The object of this association is to protect the good name of the reputable firms and to try and provide a <i>modus operandi</i> for protecting the unfortunate people. But there are equally bad cases, as the hon. the Minister knows. People are being robbed through a combination of psychological brainwashing, untruthful presentation of facts, and promises of financial rewards that are quite impossible of achievement. This is what is happening. I believe we have to protect these people.</p>

<p>What we want first, is a complete investigation of the facts. When we have the facts, I believe there are ways in which this problem can be tackled. First of all, some of these multi-selling schemes, where a chain continues and continues, have been held overseas to be lotteries. Heaven only knows, our lottery legislation is tough enough. We should be able to bring these firms within the ambit of our lottery legislation, and they should be declared lotteries. That is number one.</p>

<p>But I believe we can tackle the problem in another way. We should introduce legislation that will provide that no distributor or salesman shall be involved in direct selling, which involves buying a distributorship, or buying stock, or paying for training courses, unless he first enters into a written contract. If there is no written contract, any agreement is void. Now this contract should provide, <i>inter alia</i> a cooling-off period of, say seven days after the signing of a contract. After the man has signed the contract, within seven days he can renege the contract. During this cooling-off period, he can say &#x201C;I do not want anything more to do with the contract&#x201D;, and the contract is then void. There must also be a buy-back provision in the contract, in terms of which if a person cannot sell goods within a reasonable period of time, for example six months or nine months, the company must be obliged to take back these goods at a small discount, because something must be deducted for interest, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that if we would do these three things&#x2014;deal with the matter under the Lotteries Act, but more specifically, provide by legislation that if you have to buy goods or a distributorship, or take a training course for which you pay, to get a selling job, that a written contract be entered into, where there is a cooling-off period, and that you will be able to sell back to the company the goods you have bought at a reasonable discount&#x2014;we will be able to kill this problem overnight. I hope the hon. the Minister will deal with this matter quickly, effectively, and in a way which will give protection to the hundreds and hundreds of people who need it in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, seldom in this House have I seen the hon. member for Parktown struggle as much as he did yesterday evening. I do not envy economic recession him his position, because in a time of it is very easy for an Opposition to criticize and to obtain general support on the wave of that criticism, but only a short while ago an ostrich upset the Opposition&#x2019;s applecart and at the moment the Exchange, too, is upsetting its economic applecart.</p>

<speech by="#members">

<from>*<person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>And Brakpan?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I had no intention of talking about Brakpan, but since hon. members have just referred to Brakpan, I should like to tell them that this morning someone remarked to me that we had not done so well in Brakpan. My reply was, &#x201C;Well, if we had not done well, then it means that the United Party had, in fact, done well&#x201D;. Now I should like to know this: If a party adds just over 700 votes to its minority within three months, has it in fact, done well? When one analyses the voting, one finds that the United Party obtained 709 votes more than it did in February; but surely those are simply the 784 votes which Mr. Louis Stofberg obtained in February and which they have gained now. [Interjections.] Sir, it is quite clear to me that the poor United Party is on the run to such an extent at the moment that it has to clutch at any straw to see whether it cannot bring it to an end. I can only tell him this: &#x201C;If he had ever believed that there had been a turning point in their adversity after Brakpan, three months ago, that illusion had been completely shattered now.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But let us rather come back to the economics of the hon. member for Parktown. I said that an ostrich had upset his political applecart a few weeks ago. Of course, his economic applecart was full of sour apples, those sour apples of complaints, grievances, and what-have-you. But fortunately for us the economy has now taken such a favourable turn and the economy has revived to such an extent, as is naturally reflected on the Exchange&#x2014;that sensitive barometer of our economic situation&#x2014;that the poor hon. member for Parktown really has a very difficult task. I am glad I am not in his shoes. When we were experiencing difficulties in a time of a world-wide recession, I issued a warning to the hon. member. I warned him that the day things were going better once more, I would remind him of how he blamed this Government for the slow-moving economy when we were experiencing difficulties as a result of a world-wide recession. I said the day would come when things would be going better once more with the economy and that I would remind him then of what he had said so that he could, by the same token, give this Government the credit for a stronger economy too. World events, of course, have much to do with the state of our economy. The prices of our export goods are increasing very nicely. I have in mind, for example, wool, diamonds, platinum, copper, nickel, etc. At the same time nature has been kind to us, because we have had a wonderful agricultural season and excellent agricultural conditions are still prevailing because of the favourable natural conditions we are experiencing. But, Mr. Chairman, I may most certainly attribute a large part of the improved economic climate to the steps taken by this Government and to the steps taken by the hon. the Minister whose Vote is under discussion, because that hon. Minister is working night and day to create an improved economic climate, and he is succeeding in this masterly. Everyone also agrees that the latest Budget introduced by the hon. the Minister of Finance has contributed a great deal to the creation of this improved economic climate in our country. I just want to mention a few of the steps which helped to create an improved climate. There is, for example, the relaxation of foreign exchange control restrictions, which leads to higher domestic liquidity, which in turn exercises a downward <span class="col_7479-7480" refersTo="page_0694"/>pressure on interest rates. The measures for the promotion of savings will also give rise to an easing of the pressure on the capital market. In addition there is export promotion. With regard to this, the hon. member for Parktown said the Government was doing nothing for promoting exports. I do not know whether he is living in another world, but surely he should have taken cognisance of the steps for promoting exports announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance. I want to point out that the relaxation of hire purchase terms for motor cars has also contributed to the creation of an improved climate. And then, of course, there is devaluation; that too, has contributed to our having a favourable economic climate at the moment. Now, of course, it depends on our entrepreneurs, especially our industrialists, whether they are going to make use of the concessions and incentives in order to stimulate our economy further, because these measures are calculated not only to promote exports, but also to stimulate import replacement. The production of industrial goods for export is definitely no easy matter. In order to be able to compete on most of the markets, our industrialists must, in the first place, overcome the problem of long distances to our markets, and that is not so easy. Our domestic market is limited, and it is common knowledge that for growing exports one&#x2019;s industry must be based on a strong domestic market. Thirdly, we have the problem that most of our industries are still suffering under the defect that workers in those industries have not yet built up a labour tradition in those industries, because we are a young industrial country and, finally, we have the new problem we encounter so often nowadays, i.e. the formation of strong trade blocs, such as the E.E.C. Therefore, if we want to promote our exports, we shall have to be far more selective in our industrial production. I want to refer, in the first place, to the refining of our base minerals, a field in which we can export far more. In this regard, too, the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated in his Budget speech that he was hoping the banks would utilize this greater liquidity for promoting the industrial production of base minerals. Furthermore, Sir, we shall have to give far more attention to the production of iron and steel goods, for we are in the very fortunate position that we produce the cheapest basic steel in the world and consequently we shall be able to compete far more easily in so far as we produce iron and steel goods, rather than goods in respect of which we do not have these natural resources as readily available. For that reason I say we shall have to be far more selective in our industries that will have to export. For this reason I see no problem; if we are more selective in our exports we shall indeed gain a place in the world market for industrial goods. Therefore, things are going much better with our economy, and I foresee that in the next few years it will go a great deal better, much to the discomfort of the hon. member for Parktown.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member for Paarl will excuse me if I do not follow his argument in detail. But I would like to say that this Economic Affairs Vote has to do with the material welfare of people, and that the material welfare of quite a number of members on this side of the House has been improved considerably since the Brakpan announcement today.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to return to a subject which I raised in the no-confidence debate at the beginning of the session and which was covered to some extent by the hon. member for Parktown last night, and that is the import control happenings of October and November last year. I raise it because the manner in which import control was intensified in November last year, and the events which preceded that intensification, have led to so much harm and so much confusion and so much loss of confidence in business circles that I regard it as vital that such a sequence of events should not be repeated. I said on that occasion that there had been no new elements entering on to the economic scene which would affect the balance of payments position between 22nd October&#x2014;when the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs gave the green light to importers to make their plans to import for 1972 on the same basis as they had imported for 1971&#x2014;and the 25th November, when that policy was revoked and harsh and retrospective import control restrictions were imposed in its place. In reply to what I said on that occasion, the Minister indicated that the rapid deterioration of the foreign exchange reserves in November, 1971. was the factor which was responsible for the reversal of his policy at the end of November. I would like to point out to the hon. the Minister that our foreign exchange reserves had been falling every single month for more than two years before <span class="col_7481-7482" refersTo="page_0695"/>November, 1971, and in November, 1971, the deterioration of the reserves was no worse&#x2014;in fact, it was not as bad as it had been in the corresponding month of the previous year. I would also like to point out to the hon. the Minister that the currency uncertainties which were triggered off by the American decision in the middle of August last year to suspend the convertibility of the dollar into gold, had been with us for more than two months before the Minister made his announcement on 22nd October, giving the green light to importers. Sir, with those currency uncertainties still unresolved in October last year, clearly there was an amber light shining over the balance of payments position, and yet the Minister chose to turn on the green light, and it was only about a month later, realizing that he had switched on the wrong light, that he had to switch on an emergency red light in an attempt to put the whole mechanism into reverse.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this was a sorry, distressing episode in our economic history. It led to the imposition of unprecedentedly harsh measures on innocent importers and innocent overseas suppliers, who had acted in perfectly good faith. It forced importers to cancel and to repudiate contracts, which in turn damaged their own commercial reputation as well as that of the country as a whole; it caused losses to importers and suppliers alike, and it caused a great deal of confusion in the business world. It also resulted in innocent importers having to pay heavy deposit penalties and to raise money at high rates of interest to do so. It is because this episode led to all these unfortunate repercussions that I hope that the Government has learned its lesson from this sorry tale of mismanagement and misjudgment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, South African importers may by now have been able to sort out the problems which were put in their laps as the result of the decision of 25th November, but little is being done now to help them plan for the future so that they can make the best of import allocations that are granted to them. Since November importers have had to cope with a 50 per cent cut in the balance of their 1971 permits; they have been given only 20 per cent of their 1969 import allocation for this year, which was only valid from March, and they have had to live on the promise of a review taking place this month. On that, their ability to plan for the future has virtually been taken away from them. They cannot possibly risk entering into commitments knowing what happened last November, until the Government has made a clear and definite statement of its policy. I wonder if the hon. the Minister appreciates that goods from overseas have to be ordered well in advance, and that with all these obstacles being placed in the way of imports, with the delay in obtaining imports from overseas, the probability is that a vacuum is going to develop in the months ahead in certain lines of merchandise. Already it is too late for some importers to place orders for next summer season. Already it is too late for wholesalers to order toys for the Christmas season from Japan. One would have hoped that this vacuum would be filled by local manufacturers, and to some extent it has been, and that is a very welcome development, but the South African manufacturers themselves have their problems. They have their labour problems and their own problems caused by import control and the dislocation of their own sources of supply, of raw materials and plant. As a result of this and as a result of the switch in demand from imported goods to local goods which has resulted from import control the delivery period of local manufacturers is becoming very extended, and costs and prices are tending to go up. I would like to make an appeal to the Minister as a matter of great importance. First of all an announcement in regard to import allocations should be made timeously. Only if they are made timeously can importers plan properly and make the best use of those allocations, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of the country as a whole. Now is the time, in fact the time is past when the announcement of the second round should have been made, and surely the reserves are in such a position that such an announcement can be made. Secondly I would like to appeal to the Minister, that when the announecment is made, it be made on as liberal a basis as possible in the interests of fighting inflation. With the pressure that is building up on local manufacturers, and building up it is, if that pressure becomes too heavy it can only lead to increased costs and to increased prices.

<p>The hon. member for Constantia himself does not know what he wants. It seems to me that if he had been the Minister of Economic Affairs and had to apply import control, he would go to the Press and tell them he was going to apply import control in two months&#x2019; time. The hon. member proclaimed the sad news here of what happened after import control. I do not know where I stand with that United Party. Last year, at their congress, the hon. member for Parktown criticized the Government terribly because of the fact that our balance of payments had shown a downward trend and had fallen so low. In truth, although not in so many words, he asked that something be done to save our balance of payments. Eventually the Government applied import control, and he is the hon. member who agreed afterwards that import control was necessary, but it seems to me as though the hon. member for Constantia has not agreed to that as yet. He is still complaining about it. Last night the hon. member for Parktown came along here and used these words. He said the introduction of import control &#x201C;was a breach of faith with the business community of South Africa&#x201D;. But, surely, if one introduces import control, then that is what one is doing; surely one cannot do it half-way. [Interjections.] We did this in the past, and the department has gained very good experience in this respect. But if one were to introduce it, certain people would have problems. We cannot help that. Certain people are going to have problems, and there will be hardline cases, but these are in the minority. But why was it done? It was done in the interests of South Africa, in the interests of the economy of South Africa, and if a small minority has to suffer as a result, then this is simply the way it is with most of us, who have to suffer at some time or other when certain measures are introduced in the national interest. But they are always so negative. They ask for something and then they complain about the same thing for which they asked. They do not state here what the benefits are which we have derived from import control. They do not make any reference to the signal success we have had up to now in regard to our balance of payments. They do not think of the major benefit this has brought to all the other people in the country. All they do, is to complain about the few who have been prejudiced, those people who live on imports alone. There is nothing else one can do. If people live on imports alone and that source of making a living is cut off, what can be done about the matter? When it is said that those few people are unhappy, I want to tell hon. members that hundreds of industrialists in this country are quite happy because import control has been introduced and their goods can be sold again.</p>

<p>Just take a look at our balance of payments and our economic position at present; in doing that, we will realize what major benefits import control has brought about. I think those hon. members should decide whether at that stage they were for or against import control in principle. After all, if they are in favour of import control, one must introduce it. One cannot do so in two ways; one can only do so in a properly ordered manner. Import control has been applied very sympthetically and judiciously by the department. If there are people who were guilty of misconduct and had to pay fines, they should have known beforehand that this would follow.</p>

<p>On several occasions we have heard it being said on that side of the House that our State corporations are going too far and are entering upon the domain of private enterprise. Today I want to pay tribute to our State corporations in this country. We on this side of the House are people who make a very strong point of the principle of free enterprise and the principle of the profit motive. However, I do not know where South Africa would have been today if we had not had State corporations which could assist in developing the country. We are a country with a small population. Private enterprise was not prepared to provide the risk capital for bringing about key development and other important development in the country. State assistance was necessary. We are thinking of the Railway, for instance, which provided the infrastructure. We are thinking of the Department of Posts in so far as communications are concerned. Then there is Iscor, which provided a sound basis for certain developments. If we did not have these, where would we have been? Private enterprise was not prepared to do these things. Then we also have the IDC. Strangely enough, the IDC was established under the leadership of that party. Now they want to tie the hands of that body which has helped to build the country. That is what they want to do. Whenever any of those hon. memers criticize <span class="col_7485-7486" refersTo="page_0697"/>State corporations again, they should tell us according to what formula they want State corporations to operate. They should tell us in what spheres State corporations may operate and in what spheres they may not. They should tell us exactly how matters are to be arranged. This is not so easy, for State corporations have, as I said before, grown out of a need which existed in the country for that type of development; a demand arose for it. To that I must add that State corporations developed as a result of the faith, dedication and love of the National Party and the National Party Government. Those corporations were inspired by this side of the House. As regards State corporations, <i>inter alia</i> the IDC, I think that the role played by them is being exaggerated to a certain extent. I know that the IDC has played a major role in this country. What does the IDC do? It takes the hand of private capital, and together these two take the risk of bringing about certain developments in the country. I found the report of the IDC very interesting. Let us see what the investment in industry in South Africa was over the past five years. The IDC only invested R24.8 million in industrial development. What did private enterprise invest by comparison? Over the past five years private enterprise invested R462 million. Therefore, only 5,4 per cent of the total investment came from the IDC. The people are saying now that the IDC and the other corporations are posing a threat to private enterprise. This is not true. I think this is quite exaggerated. The IDC has made a tremendous contribution in helping to bring about decentralization. I know what attitude that side of the House adopts in respect of decentralization. They say it must be economic, whereas we say it has to be done on an economic basis, but also to promote our ideology. We are not concerned about what that side of the House has to say in regard to that side of the matter. We are governing, and we believe that our ideology is right. What is more, we believe that we must implement it. It was for that reason that we started with border area development a mere 10 years ago. In looking back, we shall see that in the economic life of a people a period of 10 years is nothing. However, we. have had conspicuous success in that sphere. I do not have the time to furnish all the particulars now, but we have made very good progress. As we developed, we once again had to follow a course, a unique course, and formulate a policy. It is essential for such a policy to be flexible so as to provide for all the circumstances, because the problems of Pietersburg, the problems of Newcastle and the problems of Pretoria are not the same. The one differs from the other. For that reason our policy must be flexible. Now I want to say that at a place such as Pietersburg the cost factor, the wage structure, presents our greatest problem, for in border area development the cost factor of services is the greatest problem. Furthermore, Pietersburg is situated far away from the metropolitan markets. To influence an industrialist to invest and develop there, one must be able to lure him by way of cheaper production costs. That is something one cannot do if the wages are the same throughout the country. For that reason I want to make a special appeal to the Minister today, and I want to ask him to use his influence. I am also making an appeal through him to the Decentralization Board to make an appeal to the industrial councils &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietersburg in his remarks criticized the hon. member for Parktown for his criticism of the Vote. He criticized the hon. member for Parktown with regard to his remarks on import control. Surely he realizes that the steps which were taken on import control were disastrous as far as South Africa&#x2019;s good name was concerned. The hon. member for Parktown&#x2019;s criticism was valid, and he was supported in it by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>Then he went on to deal with the IDC. I want to ask the Minister to indicate his policy with regard to the IDC. He has appointed one of his senior officials as chairman of the IDC. I think it is time that a Select Committee should deal with the IDC and similar utility corporations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg, who is not listening at the moment, suggested that the IDC had done constructive work. He did not tell us of the disastrous efforts of the IDC in the National Growth Fund.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>He did not tell us how the country was misled. I think it is high time that a Select Committee should <span class="col_7487-7488" refersTo="page_0698"/>be appointed to deal with the IDC and similar organizations. Then we can see how far they are going. I am not asking that we should examine every investment and every loan to individual companies, but where they have the controlling interest in the company, surely it is in the public&#x2019;s interest to know where the control and the influence lies. They must know where they will be up against it in competition. When we see and we hear of companies receiving finance from the IDC, where the IDC is the major shareholder, or the shareholder with virtually the control over the company, and that company is not successful, they have no opportunity of criticizing that company. There is no opportunity in this House, since we do not get the details in the Accounts. I think it is high time that we should get more information than that which is given in the Accounts.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister to indicate to the House what his policy is. He appointed a senior official to the board and it is obvious that he must have given him certain instructions. While we value the good work the IDC has done over the years, we think that there should be more control and more information given to the country than was given up till now. The annual reports and accounts for 1971 together with the balance sheet show that the total issued capital amounted to R248 500 000. The revenue reserves amounted to R47 548 000. Under the heading &#x201C;assets&#x201D; the following is shown: Financing of industrial undertakings, section 3 (a)&#x2014;R118 541 000. No details of the type of companies are given and there is no breakdown of those companies. I suggest that where the investment is in shares and such shareholding amounts to a rigid control, those companies should be named in the schedules. The following is also shown under the heading &#x201C;assets&#x201D;: section 3 (b) general&#x2014;R127 113 000. Under &#x201C;Export finance&#x201D; an amount of R32 180 000 is shown and under &#x201C;Border are a development&#x201D; we see a total of R87 751 000.</p>

<p>To what extent is that border development financed to carry out Government policy and to what extent is it based on sound economic lines? If it is based on sound economic lines, we shall support it, but if it is just to satisfy Government ideology, then we should have an opportunity of criticizing it in this House. The details should therefore be available to this House. The summary in the report shows under the heading &#x201C;General financing of the various border areas&#x201D; an amount of R88 000 000. Under &#x201C;Sasol&#x201D; an amount of R109 751000 is shown and under &#x201C;General IDC&#x201D; an amount of R109 000 000 is shown and under &#x201C;General IDC financing&#x201D; an amount of R42 million.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister is to support the hon. the Minister of Finance, who assures the country from time to time that he is in favour of private enterprise, surely he should reassure the country by dispelling the fear in many quarters that through the IDC the Government is competing with private enterprise and industry. That is the fear of private industry in many sectors. They fear that the IDC is the instrument of the Government to compete with them. This is particularly true in certain sections of the metal industry and certain sections of the clothing industry. The fear is that the IDC is exerting an influence which is unhealthy. The public is entitled to a more frank disclosure than is made in the annual report and accounts. There are other examples of reports with glossy covers, but the only information they contain is the information which can be obtained from the annual reports. I refer in this regard to the Bantu Mining Corporation, the Bantu Investment Corporation, the Xhosa Development Corporation and the Coloured Development Corporation. The report of the Coloured Development Corporation is significant because of the total of R4 400 000 given as assistance, more than half was given in respect of liquor and hotel businesses and the rest is distributed amongst cinemas, sawmills, panel beating, furniture stores, etc.</p>

<p>I come now to another aspect of the administration of this department and that is price control. I should like the hon. the Minister to indicate his policy with regard to price control. Price control is supposed to be spasmodically applied. I raised this matter in the Budget debate. The hon. the Minister did not have an opportunity of replying and therefore I raise it again now. Many activities are not subject to price control and in other cases price control is strictly applied. In effect, price control is profit control. The importance of the matter was emphasized by the recent escalation in the price of gold. If the price of gold continues to increase, it is possible that it may cause a further devaluation of the dollar. It is significant that the British <span class="col_7489-7490" refersTo="page_0699"/>Prime Minister called his Cabinet together to deal with inflation. One is entitled to ask the hon. the Minister whether he intends to use price control as the machinery to control profits, in which case he will be expecting the private sector to absorb the increased cost of further devaluation.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister to indicate to the House what he regards as a reasonable rate of profit. When the IDC receives an application for financial help in the private sector, it considers the viability of the industry. A figure of profits is then suggested as a reasonable figure for financial assistance. With price control there is another idea, and yet the same vote covers these two departments. The one department considers a certain percentage as a reasonable return on investments, while the price controller has different ideas. He considers the marginal profit against the demand. The IDC considers the marginal profit in relation to the investment in that industry. It is difficult when you are faced with the position that while one department considers a certain rate, the other department considers another. If the profit margins are to be controlled indefinitely, then development will be hindered. I think it is time the hon. the Minister took us into his confidence and indicated to the public the guide-lines which he wishes to apply in his policy of price control. He is not controlling everything, but only a certain selected number of items, a selected number of firms. Industry and commerce do not know what his main objectives are and I think it is time that the Minister indicated the guide-lines of his policy, so that we will know where we stand.</p>

<p>I now come to import control, which is also part of the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility. It has been dealt with by the hon. member for Parktown and the hon. member for Constantia, but I wish to refer to the Swazi gap in imports. As the Minister knows the Government is having talks with the Government of Swaziland about the threatened Swazi gap which could open South Africa&#x2019;s structure of import control. The point is that although Swaziland is bound to South Africa as far as import duties are concerned, by virtue of its membership of the Customs Union with South Africa, it is not bound by the South African import control regulations. The Swazis receive a share of South Africa&#x2019;s customs revenue which forms an important part of their national income. On the other hand there is the possibility that overseas concerns may find conditions to be easier in Swaziland and establish industries there, which will be subject neither to South African import regulations nor to South African wage and employment restrictions. With the prospects of accelerated development in Swaziland, I wish the hon. the Minister to tell us what he intends to do about the Swazi gap. It is possible that the same problems which exist with the Swaziland gap can develop in countries like Botswana, and Lesotho because the same problems exist there. I suggest that the hon. the Minister should have regard to the present customs duty agreement between South Africa and these territories. There is this possibility of an import control gap, and I want the hon. the Minister to tell us how he will overcome this difficulty.</p>

<speech by="#pansegrouw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens in a speech in this House on 10th April, made some very cryptic remarks about the motor manufacturing industry in particular, but also about the motor industry in South Africa as a whole. I do not think that we can allow that to go by unchallenged. The first point the hon. member made was that this department, this Minister and this Government, have failed in every single step they have taken in Phase III of local component control in South Africa. At this stage I wish to put it to the hon. the Minister that we should not hesitate for one single moment to go ahead with Phase III of the local content programme. Because of the lack of time, I wish to give only three reasons for this appeal. Firstly, those people with full responsibility, and those who believe in the future of South Africa, have financially committed themselves heavily over the past two years and for the next two years in that interests of the motor industry in South Africa. For that reason alone these people who have trust in the future of the motor industry and in the future of South Africa, it is a must that we should continue.</p>

<p>*In the second place I want to make another important statement; the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens referred to the 43 models that are now available in South Africa. Everyone who is interested in the motor industry agrees with him that that is not a good thing. Does the hon. member want the Minister to <span class="col_7491-7492" refersTo="page_0700"/>specify which models must disappear from the South African market? It is this Phase III, <i>inter alia,</i> which will determine, as a result of the enormous capital investment, which models will be able to continue and which not. I want to content myself with the statement that no foreign company can spend these enormous amounts in this country unless it markets approximately 30 000 to 40 000 vehicles of one model annually. It is true that there are companies that have made these investments in the recent past, but, Sir, we want to tell you they are doing so at their own risk.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Thirdly&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014; the hon. member made those cryptic remarks; but now I want to make this one remark, that the motor industry in Phase III will be one of the main foreign exchange savers in this country. I wish to refer to a certain model that I know of. In the C.K.D. pack&#x2014;that is the &#x201C;completely knocked down&#x201D; pack&#x2014;a car of which 100 per cent of the components are from the country of origin, is costing in South Africa R1 840. With a 66 per cent local content in South Africa, where we try to put the lifetime of a model in South Africa at 5 years, and supposing that 35 000 odd vehicles of this certain model will be sold, it will mean a saving over that five years of R40 million. If that is not important, then I do not know wihat is important. Furthermore, Sir, to incorporate that 66 per cent local content into this vehicle, we will have to spend roughly R5 million in tooling and dieing, but that R5 million is money spent in South Africa&#x2014;in other words, a wonderful contribution to the economy of South Africa. We do not have much time, and therefore I cannot say much more about this matter.</p>

<p>Now I am proceeding to a second remark which this hon. member made. Why he did it, I do not know. The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens said that in South Africa&#x2014;that is in his Hansard&#x2014;the Volkswagen Beetle is costing 43 per cent more than in the land of origin, viz. Germany. I must say to the hon. gentleman, that is not true. The fact is&#x2014;here I have it in front of me&#x2014;that the Beetle actually is costing 59 per cent more in South Africa than in Germany. If we take into consideration a 4,7 rise in the price of that car in Germany recently, another 5 per cent in the next few weeks, then this is very far away from 43 per cent. According to this member&#x2014;it is in his Hansard&#x2014;a certain model of the Toyota Company in South Africa is costing 100 per cent more than in Japan. That is far and away; because this Corona car mentioned by the hon. gentleman costs in Japan 727 000 yen, equal to R1 817. It retails in South Africa at R2 867, 57 per cent and not 100 per cent higher than in Japan. That is a very far way off. But, Sir, there is a reason for this difference in price. Indeed, there are many; but because we do not have the time, I can only mention one. The one that I want to mention is the matter of purchase tax. For a certain model with a 1200 cc engine, the purchase tax in South Africa is R264&#x2014;in Japan it is R157. For another model in South Africa it is R334 &#x2014;in Japan it is R195.</p>

<p>*In other words, Sir, this tax is being levied by the Government for purposes approved by this Parliament. But now that hon. member wants to give out that it is the fault of this department and this Government that we in South Africa have to pay more for our cars. Finally, I want to tell the House and the country that this statement made by the hon. member that we in South Africa have to accept cars in which all the safety devices&#x2014;he used the word &#x201C;devices&#x201D;&#x2014;devices that are available to other people, are not built in, is not true.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In South Africa motorcars are being manufactured to be as safe as they are anywhere else in the world. My time has almost expired, but I should like to quote just one instance. In this particular car was one of our most famous South African cricketers. In this car were built in all these safety devices. This cricketer was in a very bad accident, and that car broke up progressively fore and aft. But the cab was intact and that cricketer was saved for South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Smithfield is an acknowledged expert in the motor industry to the extent that he has considerable vested interests in the industry. In replying to him today, it is my intention not to speak from the point of view of vested interests, but to speak more objectively, on behalf of all the motor manufacturers in South Africa, the big three who have considerable vested intests in seeing the elimination of the lesser nine, the component parts manufacturers, who have great vested interests <span class="col_7493-7494" refersTo="page_0701"/>in the future of the country and also the South African motoring public, all two million of them, who have one vested interest, namely to see that they are given a reasonably priced motor vehicle, a motor vehicle at a price which they well can afford. In these days, when the public is paying some R1 000 000 per month, in order to run vehicles, in respect of taxes and the cost of maintenance on the roads, the public certainly has an interest. I want to say immediately that I shall merely quote a man who should know a little about the motor industry. He was recently in this country, in the office of the Minister of Finance. I refer to Dr. Raffaello di Nola, the head of Italy&#x2019;s State-owned Alfa Romeo motor works, who came from Italy last week and put this view squarely to the Minister of Finance in Cape Town: &#x201C;Please, Mr. Minister, think carefully about this important problem of your Phase III.&#x201D; This, according to the report I have, he said with old world courtesy. He appealed to the Minister to slow down on Phase III. That view was supported by no less a body than the Franzsen Commission, who indicated to the Government that at this moment in time, with our inflationary tendencies, it had no right to give priority to the expenditure of an additional R160 million of local capital in the motor industry, at a time when the economy was over-heated. I should merely like to indicate that the hon. the Minister of Finance, during the Budget debate, devoted only a few words to what is regarded as one of the most important industries in the country. He indicated that the industry was suffering from a loss of sales and therefore he made a slight concession to the industry in respect of H.P. terms and sales taxes. The contribution of the motor industry forms 7 per cent of our national income, which compares favourably with the 10 per cent of agriculture and 12 per cent in the case of mining. It provides employment to 113 000 people, of whom 43 000 are in manufacture. The motor manufacturers presently represent 14 per cent of the total industrial investment in South Africa. The imports of this sector amounted to R230 million in 1968. and the total direct investment of the industry in South Africa amounts to R10 000 million. Our taxes are R1 million a day. One has only to read the papers of the last few days to see that the motor industry has fallen on evil times. At manufacturing level, there is apparently a state of chaos. More and more appeals are being made to the Minister of Economic Affairs to revise his thoughts about the continued enforcement of Phase III. It has been recognized that the attainment of Phase III objectives has proceeded a fairly long way, namely two years out of the five, but if the industry is to be saved economically, Phase III capital investment must be spread over a longer period. In order to do that, one can only look to the present price increases in motor vehicles. There have been five in the last two years. Only a day or two ago, the Leyland Corporation announced increases of between R40 and R235 per model. The motoring public feels today that not only is it being overtaxed, but also that we are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. In this regard even the Government must have an interest, because last year the hon. the Minister of Finance lost some R11 million from excise and sales tax because of the drop in motor vehicle sales. This drop-is drastic. Only last month sales again dropped, and it was the largest drop since April a year ago. Then, too, we have to realize that because of the Government&#x2019;s present policy of overtaxing and over burdening the new passenger car industry, they have driven car owners to the use of light commercial vehicles. It has been pointed out that there is nothing wrong with an individual, a farmer or a commercial user, making use of a light commercial vehicle. But the trend away from passenger car sales has been so alarming that our annual sales are in danger of dropping this year to 155 000, as against a record of 202 000 two years ago. The economic plan for South Africa envisaged a growth rate for the motor industry of 8&#x00BD; per cent, on which they thought they could warrant the introduction of Phase III. This drop in sales of some 50 000 models per annum, is absolutely critical as far as the new car manufacturing industry in concerned. Equally the component parts manufacturers are also suffering, and as a result of reduced runs in the new car industry, the prices of components are increasing. Again I quote Dr. di Nola&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;We are not against the policy of local content.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;We have proved this by our decision to make a greater investment in this country but it could be advisable to postpone the programme to a more favourable period.&#x201D;</block>

<p><span class="col_7495-7496" refersTo="page_0702"/>I have been appealing to the Minister to do this for the last two years. This report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What he is really driving at is the poor quality of some locally-made components, the besetting problems of plants that buy out most accessories. And not only their quality. Some cost twice as much here as in Europe, says Dr. di Nola.</block>

<p>This is understandable, Sir, The late Dr. Kuschke indicated that as far as the Phase III concept was concerned, &#x201C;the main purpose was and still is to increase local content of motor vehicles progressively, without (and I stress this) affecting the country&#x2019;s economy (in other words, adding to our inflationary trend) or the cost structure of the motor industry detrimentally.&#x201D; This is just what has happened ever since 1971, when Phase III was introduced. Then the late Dr. Kuschke went on to indicate that in this country we are up against the question of short manufaturing runs. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As you are no doubt aware, new motorcar sales last year (1970) reached a record figure of nearly 202 000 units. This represents an average of about 5 000 units per locally manufactured model. The average annual production per model in some European countries is: France, 45 000; Italy, 120 000; West Germany, 100 000; and England, 60000. Taking into account our South African average of 5 000 units per model, compared with the calculated optimum production volume of more than 60 000 units for assembly, approximately half a million for engine manufacture, and one million units for bodybuilding, then we realize to what extent our cost structure must be adversely affected by a small market in relation to the great number of models.</block>

<p>The Government is engaged in empire building in the sense that they want the IDC to enter the motor industry, and all this is being done at the cost of the motoring public. There are indications, too, that more and more new models are coming into the country. Only last week Dr. Wessels indicated that he intended introducing a two-door model and that he had a new Toyota model for Phase III. Then we also have Alfa Romeo being entered for Phase III. I wonder, against this background, whether the answer that I received to a question which I raised in the House just recently in regard to the allocation of Borgward permits, is excusable or explicable. Hon. members will remember that Borgward Motors ceased to manufacture some five or six years ago. These permits were not withdrawn from the Borgward interests, but they were allocated amongst a number of other interests, as a direct result of which a number of new cars came into the country in an assembled state. I refer to the Rover, the Jaguar, the Triumph, the Alfa Romeo, the Lancia, the NSU and the BMW. If we are genuine in endeavouring to build up a sufficient volume of local manufacture to lower production costs, what justification can there be for distributing permits which had expired to other newcomers to bring in new vehicles, at a time when the country&#x2019;s policy is to use South African vehicles and South African vehicles only?

<p>The hon. member for Gardens has once again discussed here the question of the local content of motor cars, as well as motor manufacturing in South Africa. Once again he came forward with the same story we heard him telling here before. We, on our part, believe that the Minister should proceed with this Third Phase Programme. We think it is in the national interest that the third phase should be proceeded with, and we believe this for various reasons. We are making use of local materials; in that way we are creating opportunities for employment for our people and we are saving an enormous amount in foreign exchange, apart from the investment of foreign capital which we have in our country in this way. I think it is important for us to keep these aspects in mind. We should weigh the one against the other, and if I had to make a choice, I would support the Minister fully in his decision. The hon. member for Gardens said we had to defer the third phase to a more opportune moment. He has now been saying for the past two years that the moment is not opportune. Sir, I ask myself when, in his opinion, the moment will ever be opportune, if this is not the case now.</p>

<p>May I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>No. I have only ten minutes. In terms of this programme we shall have rationalization in the motor industry, which will enabl us to market <span class="col_7497-7498" refersTo="page_0703"/>these vehicles with the available capital at a reasonable price. This will in fact restrict the choice of vehicles to a certain extent; we grant that, but it is right that this should happen. But we shall get the vehicles on the market at a reasonable price, and we shall also have the other benefits flowing from the local manufacture of these vehicles. I am not frightened of a downward trend in the sales of motor vehicles. With the rise in the standard of living of South Africa&#x2019;s total population, I think that the market for motor vehicles will only show an upward trend, and not a downward one. Actually, the non-White market has not even been exploited as yet; it has still to be exploited. I firmly believe that the hon. gentleman is unnecessarily pessimistic about the motor industry.</p>

<p>However, I want to refer to another matter that was mentioned by the hon. member for Parktown last night, i.e. certain business methods applied in regard to sales by multi-level sales organizations. We know that we in our country stand for absolute freedom of trade, and that the dealer may actually feel free to sell his wares as best he can, and one does not want to impose too many restrictions on him. This is the general principle which is interwoven in our business methods in South Africa. In fact, the old maxim says <i>caveat emptor</i>&#x2014;let the buyer be cautious and know what he is up against when he enters into a transaction. The question that arises now is whether it is the duty of a government to protect a gullible buyer. I shall grant that in this regard we already have legislation, which indicates that we protected gullible buyers in the past, buyers displaying poor judgment. One calls to mind the Hire Purchase Act and one calls to mind the Act we passed here last year in regard to the purchase of immovable property on the instalment system. All of these are legislation with the same kind of tenor. They protect the buyer against exploitation by reckless businessmen and dealers. I nevertheless believe that in spite of this tendency to protect the buyer, we should move ahead cautiously and see to it that we do not precipitately impose curbs on the freedom of trade of our dealers. I personally believe that the action on the part of the Government, and on that of the companies as a whole, should be concentrated on properly informing and instructing one&#x2019;s buying public, in the sense that they are warned against such abuses and exploitation. Now I say that control may be considered, but we should move ahead with the greatest caution in regard to creating new controls which may restrict freedom of trade in this country. We should not find later on that as a result of passing certain legislation, we created precedents which are going to impose even more restrictions on our freedom of trade. We should proceed with caution in that respect. Even so, when we speak in this House and also outside, and whenever we have the opportunity, we should call attention to the reckless exploitation of the buying public by some dealers. Recently there was a report in the Press concerning a company&#x2014;it seems to me as though this also comes from the Transvaal&#x2014;which sent out worthless detergents by mail, and one had to pay R5 in order to collect the parcel at the post office, a parcel containing something one did not even order at all, and in the end one paid R5 for something that was not even worth R1. Only this morning it was brought to my notice that a certain Watra Yellow Pages Proprietary Limited, also in the Transvaal, had simply given notice to a company here in my constituency that their name had been included in the Yellow Pages. They did not ask for it; they are simply notified that their name is being included, and an account for R55 was sent to this specific company. The company in question happens to be a company which owns a block of flats, and there is no need for them to get their name into the yellow pages. If they do not reply within a certain time, this will be regarded as a contract which will be held against them.</p>

<p>No, I do not know. All they say, is &#x201C;Watra Yellow Pages Proprietary Limited, computerized world-wide yellow pages for commerce and industry&#x201D;, and they merely state that they are sending an account for R55 and that the above address will be included in the yellow pages. This is the class of thing I have in mind. This company was not asked: they were not recruited, there is no contract, the account is simply rendered to them, and unless these people consult their attorney and lodge an objection to it or write letters back to this firm, they may later on land in a situation where they will need legal aid. This is the type of <span class="col_7499-7500" refersTo="page_0704"/>thing we should guard against, and it is our duty to take steps against it when it comes to our notice.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to refer to another matter, and that relates to our export drive. This week we are experiencing an episode in our short-term programme to promote our exports. It has been called the event of the year; it is our first ever national trade fair which was opened on Monday by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. This fair has been organized by the Transvaal Chamber of Industries and the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society and I think we should congratulate them on their initiative and on the way they have managed this affair. The Government should also be thanked for its participation and its enthusiastic support. They have recalled no fewer than 34 trade commissioners from foreign countries to be present at the fair to advise people from overseas. The South African Airways have taken part inasmuch as it has arranged for tourist-cum-business trips, combining business with pleasure. I have been informed that some 200 exhibitors are taking part in this fair, that some 200 000 invitations have been sent out and that some 500 foreign buyers are expected. Those who have organized this undertaking should be heartily congratulated on their initiative. Fairs and expositions of this nature have a double value. In the first place, it introduces foreign markets to our South African products and, in the second place, it proves to our local consumers that South African goods can hold their own <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the imported produce and that we can do without the snob value attached to imported articles. South Africa can deliver the goods. That is the most important lesson that we learn from a trade fair such as this.</p>

<p>The South African export drive, I think, will only be properly co-ordinated and stimulated after we have had the recommendations of the Reynders Commission. In the meantime we must carry on with the <i>ad hoc</i> planning as we have been doing in the case of this fair. ur export drive is beset by quite a number of problems, of which I should like to mention a few. Firstly, there is the question of increased shipping rates and distant markets. Secondly, there is the situation of our main manufacturing centres in the interior.br of our country far from the coast with the attendant high cost of railage to the coast. Sometimes it costs more to bring a product from the factory to the harbour than from the harbour to Europe. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is right that I reply at this stage to certain matters raised so far in this debate. The members of the Opposition, and particularly the hon. member for Parktown, who is the main speaker on that side of the House, do not under the present circumstances have such an easy task as they would have liked to have had. The hon. member for Paarl pointed out that there is every sign of an upsurge in the economy. There is every sign of an improvement in the economy as a result of the monetary and fiscal measures adopted by the Government. Naturally this makes matters more difficult for the Opposition. I am not saying this because I think that the hon. member for Parktown takes delight in things going badly for South Africa economically. However, it makes his task far easier if he wants to criticize the Government and wants to find fault with its policy, if he is able to find weak spots on which he can hammer.</p>

<p>Approximately two years ago I took over as Minister of Economic Affairs. I must admit in all honesty that things are going better for me today than at any stage during the past two years. Since I became Minister of Economic Affairs we have been through a difficult time economically; a very difficult time. Hon. members are all aware of the international and internal problems which arose and which made things more and more difficult for us. I do not want to go into details now. However, the Government has in the meantime adopted the necessary measures, and we now see all around us movements which were started as a result of those measures. We are looking forward to a much brighter economic future in South Africa in the months and years which lie ahead. I shall have more to say about that later, but I think it would be better if I at this stage dealt instead with the mattersraised by hon. members. I should like to deal now with the subjects raised by the hon. member for Parktown. After that I r shall deal with the other matters. The subjects which were raised by the hon. member for Parktown, were also touched upon by other hon. members on that side of the House. In so far as I am therefore dealing <span class="col_7501-7502" refersTo="page_0705"/>with the subjects as such, I hope that it will be regarded as a reply to all the hon. members who discussed them.</p>

<p>The first subject I should like to discuss is import control. I really do not know why the events of October and November of last year had to be raised to such an extent again today. Yesterday evening this matter was raised by the hon. member for Parktown, and again today by the hon. member for Constantia. We have in fact discussed this matter on a previous occasion, and it would seem to me as if they do not really have a better subject to discuss. For that reason, we shall have to rehash this topic again. The fact of the matter is that it is customary to make an announcement during September or October of every year in regard to import control for the ensuing year. So it happened that last year, when the time arrived, I felt myself called upon to make announcement in regard to import control. At that stage there was a measure of concern regarding our balance of payments position. Matters did not look as favourable as we would have liked them to have been. This concern was not as grave as it subsequently was on 25th November, 1971. It was in fact the case that no decision had yet been taken at that stage. In order to eliminate uncertainty among importers, it was necessary for me to say something and make an announcement. In the absence of any other decision, I made the announcement that import control for 1972 would be the same as that for 1971. Then, later in November of that year, we had to announce measures because of the events which had taken place&#x2014;I do not want to elaborate on that. The hon. member for Constantia referred in passing to the most important reason which had given rise to that, viz. the dollar crisis in the United States. At that stage we had felt ourselves compelled to intensify import control. We did not do this without taking other considerations into account. There were many other considerations and measures which could be taken into account, and which we did in fact take into account. Once again I do not want to elaborate on the merits of that step. The fact of the matter is that we decided that import control had to be intensified. I want to point out that we should not draw the conclusion and we should not say that import control was introduced, for at that stage import control did already exist. Hon. members will recall that at the end of 1969 the International Monetary Fund had withdrawn its consent, enabling us to apply import control on the grounds of the balance of payments position. Consequently we had then relaxed import control completely as from the beginning of 1971. Despite that we still said that a certain degree of import control would be maintained on certain commodities. We said that it would be applied to certain commodities in respect of which we were tied and were not at liberty to offer local industries the necessary protection. Therefore a degree of import control remained in force, but it was really a very small degree. Because it was such a small degree, goods then flowed freely into South Africa. We then decided that the most desirable of all the means we were able to apply was to intensify import control. The hon. member for Parktown consequently stated that we had in fact committed a breach of trust against certain importers. When he makes this statement he must have based it on two considerations. The one is that I had first announced what the policy for 1972 was going to be and had subsequently retracted it, and the other is that the unused permits for 1971 were at one stage reduced. This may be true, but it was essential and in the interests of South Africa that we intensify import control. Since it was so essential we were obliged to do so.</p>

<p>At the moment I do not know of any goods which are in really short supply. The hon. members for Parktown and Constantia are concerned about this and say that we must make an announcement on what import permits we are still going to release in the immediate future. They allege that these people are beginning to suffer hardships. I do not really believe it can be said that any shortages exist at present, or that any special hardships were experienced. Hon. members on the opposite side know as well as I do that there was a large measure of stockpiling last year. When we introduced import control on 25th November, 1971, there were tremendously large supplies here in South Africa. The traders were then to a large extent able to live on those supplies.</p>

<p>At the time we announced in regard to the permits that had been issued for 1971 but not yet used, that 50 per cent of those permits&#x2014;the amount involved was approximately R900 million&#x2014;would be cancelled. They could, in other words, use only 50 <span class="col_7503-7504" refersTo="page_0706"/>per cent of those permits. I think that we were quite fair and reasonable towards those people throughout. We told them that they had to cancel any orders they had placed immediately. However, we also told them that in so far as the goods were already on their way from the factories of origin, we would grant the necessary permits. It so happened then that we had to return a certain percentage of the 50 per cent we had cancelled. We had to do this for various reasons. Some of the importers had already placed larger orders than had been allowed by the 50 per cent unused permits they still had in thier posession. In other cases, this was done in respect of goods which we could not divide, such as heavy machinery. After all, one cannot import only half of a machine. That is why we were subsequently compelled to return permits for approximately R120 million of the 50 per cent which were cancelled.</p>

<p>We made a further arrangement that those who had goods on order, but did not have the necessary permits, could pay a fine on the goods which were imported. A committee was established which consisted of officials as well as of representatives of the private sector. That committee would form an opinion on the payment of the fine. Questions were asked in the House about the extent to which fines were paid and the extent to which the fines were repaid. I have already replied to those questions.</p>

<p>To cut this story short, I want to point out that I am at present considering the extent to which we are going to allocate further permits. To a considerable extent the hon. member for Parktown supplied the answer to that question himself. In fact, he blew hot and cold, for he and the hon. member for Constantia want us to announce what permits we are going to issue. Then the hon. member for Constantia says we must be liberal.</p>

<p>Yes, he said we must be as liberal as possible.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member need not be concerned about that; I shall come to that. My reply to the hon. member is that I am almost unable to cut back on the import permits for that 80 per cent, for if we were to cut back on capital goods, it would mean that I would be curbing the expansion of the factories, machinery, the infrastructure, and so on. There would therefore be little chance of saving anything on the importation of capital goods.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall furnish the hon. member with particulars in a moment of how we are dealing with this situation in respect of those goods. First I want to complete my argument. This 80 per cent consists further of raw materials which are used in our industries. The position is different now to what it was in earlier years. We have expanded in the manufacturing and industrial spheres and we now need raw materials for processing here. If the import of these raw materials is not allowed, it would mean that our factories would have to close down. We would want that even less, not so? So I have to fall back, as it were, on cutting down on the 20 per cent consumer goods. But there are local factories which manufacture most of those goods themselves. But we are not getting any co-operation from the public, nor, partially, from the importers in the trade. After all. there is this idea that everything which is imported is inevitably better, and that it is not possible to live without these imported goods. Therefore, these people are continually pleading with us to issue more permits. If I were to issue all the permits for the consumer goods which these people want, all my import control efforts <span class="col_7505-7506" refersTo="page_0707"/>would have been in vain. So I simply cannot do it. Initially we granted 20 per cent of the permits issued in 1969 in respect of consumer goods, and we are now considering to what extent we can issue further permits in regard to certain goods. I hope that we will be able to make an announcement in this regard within the next three weeks or so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point referred to the uncertainty which exists. Where does that uncertainty exist? Our policy is that our import control effort is based for the most part on three different commodity lists. The one is the free list, as it was previously, which was cut down considerably as a result of the extension of import control. The second consists of a quota list of 18 different commodities, not necessarily all, which we deal with differently to a certain extent. Among those 18 commodities on the quota list, the first I want to mention is raw materials. Raw material permits for industrialists&#x2014;and I take it this is what the hon. member for Durban Point referred to&#x2014;are allocated on a four-monthly basis according to the consumption. In other words, industrialists are not being curbed. As far as the trade is concerned, there are certain raw materials which do not go directly to the industrialist, but reach them through the dealers. These raw materials are also made available through the dealers on a four-monthly basis according to sales. So where are all the hardships in respect of raw materials? There need be no hardships if there is proper co-operation among importers and the department.</p>

<p>As far as capital goods are concerned, where these are required directly by industrialists, permits are provided on the end consumer basis. In other words, as far as capital goods are concerned, the people say what they want and what they want permits for, whether it is for the expansion of factories, or anything else for that matter. They then receive the necessary permits to import what they want. All the other commodities on this list, of which I could just mention a few, for example, agricultural tractors and implements, passenger motor vehicles with the approved manufacturing programme, motor cycles and scooters, aircraft, professional and electronic equipment, hand tools, pharmaceutical products, fungicides, hard timber and lastly all classes of consumer goods not specifically mentioned here are all goods in regard to which I can exercise my import control.</p>

<p>This is why I ask, Sir, how hon. members on that side can expect me now to be liberal and grant import permits according to the requirements and the request of these people&#x2014;&#x201C;as liberal as possible&#x201D;, as the hon. member for Constantia said? Then my entire effort would have failed completely. No, Sir, I want to make a plea here today for commerce and the importers, as well as the people who buy, to co-operate with us by buying South African goods. There are enough South African goods manufactured locally. But no, they come to me and ask for permits, because they specifically want imported goods, probably because they make bigger profits from them. But South Africa&#x2019;s interests are not always taken into consideration. I want to ask the hon. main speaker on that side to help me in this repect instead. Last Monday I held talks with Assocom. I shall during the next few weeks hold further talks with the responsible organizations. Then I shall, just as soon as possible, make a statement in regard to the issuing of further permits. I may as well undertake to be as &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; as possible, but I am afraid that that is not going to be all that liberal, otherwise there would be nothing left.</p>

<p>The next matter which the hon. member for Parktown raised, was the matter of GATT. As far as our commitment to GATT is concerned, it is also rather seriously tied in with import control. You will appreciate of course that when we introduced import control last year, we first had to receive the necessary exemption from the I.M.F. Afterwards, a meeting of the GATT executive was held, and Mr. Steyn, the Secretary for Commerce, and other officials, went there to hold the necessary talks. We are one of the founder members of GATT. We joined approximately 25 years ago. Circumstances today&#x2014;it is unnecessary for me to tell you this&#x2014;are completely <span class="col_7507-7508" refersTo="page_0708"/>different to what they were in those days. The hon. member for Parktown now expects me to perform miracles to solve our problems with GATT. It would have been better if the hon. member&#x2019;s own party had arranged matters to better effect in 1947 when we became involved in this.</p>

<p>Very well, I shall not turn this into a debating point. But this agreement was concluded in 1947, in the time of the previous Government. Be that as it may, I do not want to advance any arguments on that basis, but the fact of the matter is that we have many problems today as a result of the agreement concluded at the time. You know how ironic it is, Sir, that in 1947 no less a person than the Prime Minister of the time, General Smuts, made an appeal to the persons responsible for the negotiations of that time to the effect that we should be sympathetic, that we should make sacrifices in our negotiations with GATT, so that we could help with the reconstruction of Europe.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>We were a rich country then.</p>

<p>*The MINISTER. That was after the war. Europe had of course to a large extent been razed. We made those sacrifices. Great sacrifices were made at that time. Whether this was as a result of General Smuts&#x2019;s appeal, or for whatever other considerations, the fact remains that major sacrifices were made. Where do we stand today? Our hands are, as it were, tied behind our backs. The countries which were down and out then, for example a country like Germany&#x2014;where does it stand today? All the other countries of Europe which are joined together in the EEC, are speaking harshly to us today, while our hands are tied. We, as a young, developing country, do not have the means today to afford our own industries the necessary protection in order that we may develop. That is the problem we find ourselves facing.</p>

<p>This GATT contract, to which we are a party, is a binding contract. But it is not a bilateral contract, so that we may go to the other parties and say that we want to terminate it, or that we want to change its conditions. No, it is a multilateral contract; there are many other countries who participate in this contract, and which made this matter so much more difficult. There are two important obligations under this agreement. The one is the provision for tariff concessions according to which the different countries are mutually bound, and the other is that a member can only apply import control if he has problems in regard to his balance of payments.</p>

<p>As I have said, I do not want to elaborate at too great a length on this, but you will recall that in 1969&#x2014;or rather from 1970 onwards&#x2014;we were compelled to lift the import control we had previously had. Consequently we did lift it. You know what has happened since then. Last year, when we introduced import control again, we were told to attend a meeting of GATT, which took place in January of this year in Geneva. On that occasion other member countries argued that South Africa had no legal right to maintain these intensified import restrictions, after having devalued the rand in December by a greater percentage than the monetary unit of any other country was devalued. These countries insisted that South Africa should immediately lift its intensified import restrictions. There were hard discussions, according to the reports made to me.</p>

<p>South Africa&#x2019;s representatives at these talks, held in Geneva in January of this year, adopted the standpoint that we could not relax import control until such time as there had been a real and permanent improvement in our current account, as distinct from the capital account. This is one of our problems today, namely that our balance of payments has improved fundamentally, and on the basis of the improvements which have taken place in our balance of payments, it is now being argued that South Africa no longer needs to apply import control.</p>

<p>But in the meantime we have had a very heavy inflow of capital into South Africa, and it is also true that our balance of trade recovery has not been altogether satisfactory. Therefore it is our standpoint&#x2014;and we believe we have irrefutable arguments in favour of this&#x2014;that we should be able to maintain import control until such time as our balance of trade is on a sound, permanent and stable basis. Eventually, <span class="col_7509-7510" refersTo="page_0709"/>at those talks, GATT decided that nothing should be done at that stage, but that South Africa should try to do away with this import control as soon as she was in any way able to do so, and that further talks should be held towards the middle of this year. I think that we will one of these days be obliged to hold further talks with GATT in regard to our import control position. As I have said, the standpoint which we adopt is that we want to make certain that our balance of trade has first been permanently placed on sound basis before we are able to relinquish import control, because we would like to have permanence instead of the uncertainty which will otherwise continue.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked why we have now appointed a committee to inquire into the Republic&#x2019;s position under GATT. Recently a senior technical committee was appointed consisting of representatives from the public and private sectors, under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Commerce, on which members of the Public Service are also serving. I really believe that this technical committee will have to do everything in its power to see what is possible for South Africa in order to improve our position in respect of GATT. I have been informed that this technical committee envisages having its report ready for us by the end of August. All that I can say is that I believe sincerely that there are perhaps ways and means, which this technical committee will be able to establish, whereby we will be able to cope with the problems to better effect than we have in the past. Naturally we have constantly in the past been negotiating in regard to tariffs. We are perhaps good negotiators, but when one ventures into this sphere, one finds that there are people who are much harder and tougher than we are. We are unable to make much headway there.</p>

<p>The next matter raised by the hon. member for Parktown was the question of exports. In this connection he referred in particular to the Reynders Commission, which was appointed to investigate all aspects of our exports. I want to agree with one thing the hon. member for Parktown said, and that is that there are too many people who have something to say about exports, and that there are too few people who are doing something about it. Then, I should like to point out to the hon. member that it is not the Government which exports. All we can do is to assist industrialists and to stimulate exports. But it is not the Government which exports; it is private initiative which has to export. All that we can do is to create the necessary climate and to assist where we possibly can. We have a very good export promotion service which is at the disposal of private initiative.</p>

<p>Recently in his Budget speech the hon. the Minister of Finance also announced various incentives, and one sincerely hopes that the private sector will not only make use of this export promotion service, but also of the incentives in order to promote our exports in this way. Sir, this is perhaps a very serious thing to say, but I feel that we must identify where the best fields for our exports lie. We must identify the best export fields; and we are working on that. Once we have completed this identification, and if the private sector is not in favour of promoting exports in those fields, the Government will probably be obliged to render the necessary assistance through some or other State corporation or by establishing a State corporation, or by doing something itself in this connection.</p>

<p>However, one hopes that the private secfor will play its part in this matter. The Reynders Commission has already submitted an interim report, and some of the proposals made by the commission have already been included in the proposals made by the hon. the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech. We expect that it is likely that the commission will hold its last meeting in July/August of this year; that it will then be able to complete its activities; that the report will then have been translated by about November of this year, and that we will be able to have the report on the Table immediately after the opening of the session next year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown asked whether SAFTA, for example, had perused this report. The answer is &#x201C;No&#x201D;. This interim report was a report made to the Government, and it was used only by the Government. I expect the Reynders Commission to submit a very wide series of recommendations, which wil be aimed at promoting our exports. I agree with the hon. member that we should try to import less, that we should try to be more independent in regard to imports, but it is equally necessary, and more necessary, that we should promote our exports.</p>

<p><span class="col_7511-7512" refersTo="page_0710"/>Then the hon. member for Parktown asked whether there had appeared to be any benefits from the overseas visits of the recent economic missions. Sir, I approved of these two missions. The one visited the Benelux countries&#x2014;the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg&#x2014;under the leadership of Mr. Neil Malan. The first mission went overseas in November 1971. The other mission was under the leadership of Dr. Etienne Rousseau, and this mission visited Germany and Austria. I think that we were fortunate in having had two most outstanding men as leaders of these missions. As far as the missions themselves were concerned, we were fortunate in finding very good men to represent the various sectors of our industries. Generally speaking, I think that these missions were valuable to us. In the first place I want to say that these were not sales promotion missions, as the hon. member for Parktown will realize. These missions had been given general instructions to investigate the possibility of closer financial, industrial and commercial co-operation among South Africa and those countries they visited, and to make an alysis of the possibilities of trade with these countries. I have not yet received the report of the mission under the leadership of Dr. Etienne Rousseau, but we have received the report of the other mission under the leadership of Mr. Neil Malan, which visited Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg, and I should like to give hon. members a few of the impressions of this mission. In the first place it was found that the business climate in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg was favourable, under prevailing circumstances, and that these countries were well-disposed towards doing business with South Africa; secondly, that opportunities for exports from South Africa existed, particularly for the products of labour-intensive industries, including <i>inter alia</i> clothing and also goods the manufacture of which causes pollution, such as castings and forgings, and refined raw materials. They also say that there are opportunities for joint ventures between entrepreneurs in those countries and entrepreneurs in South Africa. Another remark made by this mission was that a more aggressive marketing method should be developed in South Africa. In fact, this was also the finding of the other mission, which I shall say a few words about in a moment. There are promising prospects for trade. One Netherlands factory displayed an interest in the purchase of castings from South Africa to the value of approximately R6 million per annum. This interest, as well as the interest in clothing and other goods, is being followed up. Sir, before I conclude my remarks as far as this mission is concerned, I should like to place on record my appreciation for the work done by these two missions. Apart from the secretaries to the missions, they were all private people who went overseas in their own spare time. I think that both these missions worked very hard and made great sacrifices. I had an opportunity yesterday of discussing matters with Dr. Rousseau, since I had not yet received a report from his mission. The general impressions which Dr. Rousseau recounted to me, are very similar to the impressions which the mission to the Netherlands and Belgium received. They say the climate is there and that the disposition is favourable for doing business with South Africa. In particular, Dr. Rousseau tells me, and this seems important to me, that it seems as if those countries, Germany and Austria, will be prepared, owing to the altered circumstances which have now begun to obtain there, to relinquish certain industries which they have been operating for hundreds of years. These are industries which are labour-intensive, for in Germany alone there are 2,5 million foreign labourers, who create many problems for them, as we have also experienced. Therefore they want to try to eliminate those industries of theirs which are so highly labour-intensive. In the second place, they have the same concern in regard to smoke and pollution as is being felt in the Netherlands and in Belgium. Therefore there is particular interest in our iron and steel products. In this way, Dr. Rousseau tells me that it takes approximately two tons of ore to make one ton of steel. If one has two tons of ore, one can expect to get anything from between R12 and R15 for it, i.e. R6&#x2014;R7,50 per ton for iron ore; but if one makes one ton of steel, blister and steel, out of the two tons of iron ore one could probably get R60 for it. But now the industrialist from Germany comes along, in so far as he is prepared to buy blister steel from us instead of the iron ore, and he takes that ton of blister steel and processes it into a motor car or a washing machine or a refrigerator, and with the development and processing of that ton of blister steel, he eventually sells that ton of blister steel again for perhaps R1 000. In other words, instead of laying claim to the difference <span class="col_7513-7514" refersTo="page_0711"/>between the original R15 and R60, he says we may as well take it; South Africa is welcome to it for they are still able to develop that blister steel further and then derive the benefit of processing it further.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a further fundamental interest in the ferrous alloys which are being manufactured by Amcor, including <i>inter alia</i> ferro-chrome, ferro-manganese and ferro-silicones. These are ferrous alloys which are sold for prices in the region of R140 per ton. Dr. Rousseau informs me that it is expected that it is possible to conclude 10, 12 or 15-year contracts for goods of this type, and that one is not dealing with small enterprises, but with major, gigantic enterprices. He also tells me that he thinks our selling methods are obsolete; our selling methods have to be more aggressive, not only in the presentation of one&#x2019;s product, but it must be sold.</p>

<p>There is one aspect Dr. Rousseau also brought to my attention which I should like to mention. He said the exporters in those countries spoke with one voice. I think we could probably learn a lesson from this. I am thinking of Saldanha for example. The hon. member for Von Brandis knows very well what the position is. While we are trying to sell iron ore, the people to whom we want to sell the iron ore are laughing because we are arguing among ourselves about the sales of iron ore; while Dr. Rousseau says that if one goes there, it is not this or that organization which is buying; it is the country which is buying. There is a homogeneity in the negotiations of the different enterprises in that particular country, and this is something which we should also apply in South Africa. When South Africa sells, the sales should not be made by individuals who are perhaps in conflict with one another, but it should be South Africa doing the selling. So, all things considered, I think we can say that these missions were reasonably successful, and that the results are likely to be good.</p>

<p>The last topic I should like to deal with is the matter of the EEC. The hon. member for Parktown also raised this matter yesterday evening. Allow me to express a few ideas in this regard. There is no doubt that we do have problems as a result of the British entry into the EEC. Up to now these problems have not really emerged. But the problems are there. Up to now we have not felt or experienced any serious problems yet. But they are on their way. Finality will be reached early next year about the inclusion of Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. Over and above the enlarged EEC, which will then consist not of six but of ten members, there will in addition be a large number of associated members of the EEC. Trade agreements will also be concluded by the EEC with other countries. In other words, it will be a large and powerful trading bloc. They will have free mutual access to one another, and will do business freely. We can expect them to discriminate against countries outside the EEC, to the detriment of those countries. In so far as we will be a country outside the EEC&#x2014;it cannot be otherwise&#x2014;we must expect that we are likely to experience disadvantages as a result of this mighty bloc which is being welded together. We will therefore receive different treatment to what they are giving one another.</p>

<p>I want to sound a serious note this evening concerning the general development of world trade. Whether the establishment of the EEC and the expansion thereof can be justified on economic grounds, is not relevant. Whether it is correct in accordance with the provisions of GATT something which has been much discussed and argued about in the past is not relevant. The practical implications which this holds for us, are the things which are relevant to us, and with which we have to live. To my mind the question arises whether the development of economic discrimination in the world is in the long run going to be to the benefit of the world in general. Hon. members are indeed aware that where people are prejudiced in their business relations, and where countries are prejudiced in the economic sphere, it creates discontent and dissatisfaction. I am afraid that if this entire matter of the enlarged EEC and the degree of discrimination which goes hand in hand with it is not handled well, it could very easily create strained relations in the world in the political sphere. I also think that the major commercial countries of the world should give thought to this matter. In fact, they have already to a large extent realized their problems in this connection. It is now being envisaged&#x2014;and the EEC has also spoken along these lines&#x2014; that a need exists for the revision of international economic relations. That need for the revision of international relations must be admitted and international conferences must be held to review the entire trading <span class="col_7515-7516" refersTo="page_0712"/>position in the world. We have associated ourselves with this idea, but we have stated four very imporant reservations in respect of the discussons on world trade which are being envisaged and which will, it is hoped, commence next year. In the first place, the economic structural changes which have taken place since GATT was established 25 years ago, must be reviewed. In other words, we must not merely continue on the foundations as they exist today, but the economic structural changes which have taken place during this 25 year period must be taken into account. In the second place, the various developmental requirements of the countries affected must be taken into account. In the third place, the new and changing pattern and geographic distribution of world trade must be properly reviewed. In the last place, an attempt must be made to find a solution to the need for a stable condition for world trade in primary commodities. These are the four provisos which we have expressly stated, when we associated ourselves with the idea of negotiating on a high level on world trade.</p>

<p>The entry of England to the EEC holds serious implications for us. From next year onwards problems in respect of the export of wine, apples and pears will begin to crop up for us. Recently, two or three months ago, serious talks were held in Britain on official level in regard to this matter. It will also be necessary for us to holds talks on this matter with the EEC, for this new arrangement will take effect as from 1st February of next year. Time is running out. The hon. member for Parktown asked me what we have done. I should like to state what we have done in the meantime, for we are very concerned about this whole matter. In the first place, the hon. member referred last year to it having been mentioned or announced somewhere that a Cabinet committee had been established. That is true. There is a special Cabinet committee which is going into EEC matters. The Cabinet committee meets from time to time and holds talks when matters are submitted to it for discussion. It then considers what action we should take in respect of the British entry to the EEC. The first step we took after we had convened the committee last year was to establish what harm would be done to South Africa when Britain entered the EEC. Any possible harm must, in other words, be identified, and then it will have to be established what harm has been done. The Department of Commerce then conducted personal negotiations with all the different industries which could possibly be affected. We then tried to identify the real damage. Certain of the spheres which we had previously thought would be prejudiciously affected were eliminated, and that possibility no longer exists. In respect of certain spheres we arrived at the conclusion that no harm would be suffered, and they were therefore eliminated. Among others there are in fact real dangers of harm which may be caused. We then decided to address an official petition to the EEC to discuss specifically with them the problems we have now identified. Now I want to tell hon. members that the EEC in Brussels is a prodigious organization. The people there are extremely busy and the first and greatest task is simply to gain access and sit down across a table and so have an opportunity of discussing a particular problem. As one could expect, one arrives there and finds that the people are sympathetically disposed towards one. One talks over one&#x2019;s problems, and then they say that they will see what they can do about it. but after you have left, you find that nothing has happened. That is why I went there last year, and I did not announce this in public. When I arrived in Brussels in October of last year, it was my intention to make an announcement so that the hon. member for Parktown and other people who have an interest in the matter, could know what we had achieved. When I arrived in Brussels, however, I decided for very good reasons that I was not going to announce for what reason I was there and what my <i>modus operandi</i> there was going to be. What we did was this: I went with an official petition to the president of the Ministerial Council, Mr. Moro, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. I had a personal interview with him in Brussels, and I had an official document drawn up in Italian. I handed this document over to him, in which we simply requested that South Africa should be afforded an, opportunity of going to discuss with the EEC its problems which would be experienced with the British entry on a product for product basis. Before this document was handed over I met the responsible Ministers of the different member countries and told them that I was going to do this. I was afforded every possible opportunity. On the last evening prior to my departure I had discussions with the Ambassadors of the various EEC countries. We <span class="col_7517-7518" refersTo="page_0713"/>had pleasant and sympathetic talks. But to date no arrangements have as yet been made to enable us to have that opportunity of discussing our problems on this basis. What are we doing now? We are waiting, and we keep knocking at the door, for we should like to have an opportunity to be able to do something. There are things which can be done. For example, something has already happened in regard to our citrus fruit. I think that something can be done in regard to our other products as well. In the meantime we have a permanent ambassador at the EEC in Brussels. As the House knows, this is Dr. Naud. He maintains contact with the EEC, and keeps us fully informed. The Cabinet Committee decided that one of the requests we should make is that the Minister of Economic Affairs should, if it is possible, be able to hold annual talks with a committee or some or other organization within the EEC if South Africa so desires. Last year I attended a conference of our ambassadors in the EEC countries in Lodon. I regarded it as a very fruitful conference. I think it would be a good thing if such a conference could be held annually so that there may be proper coordination among our ambassadors in the different EEC countries. In this way we remain in contact and we must do whatever we are able to do. We drew up a very comprehensive document in which all our problems as identified in the interviews which the Secretary for Commerce had with the various parties were dealt with. We are prepared at any time to go to the EEC with this and discuss our problems one by one with the EEC. But up to now we have not yet been told when we will be afforded that opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I shall conclude at this juncture and reply at a later stage to the other subjects which were raised.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to reassure the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs immediately that I shall not touch on the question of iron ore exports this afternoon. We shall leave that, perhaps for a later date, when the facts will have caught up with the hon. the Minister. We may then continue the discussion.</p>

<p>We must thank the hon. the Minister for a very extensive review which he has given on matters affecting our imports, our exports and our relationships with GATT. I think it is a pity that there appears to be in the approach of the hon. the Minister a degree of inconsistency in regard to these matters. He was dealing, in the first place, with the question of import controls. These import controls which are being maintained contrary to the requirements of GATT, but permitted in terms of article 12 under certain conditions, were justified but it appears that they are to be continued for some indefinite period. In respect of exports, we are pleading with the European Common Market to give us commodity agreements, I presume, or reduced tariffs which will enhance our trade. We have spoken about various techniques which might be used for improving our trade with the rest of the world, and with the Common Market in particular. It is the purpose of GATT to do precisely these things, to encourage precisely these things. It is the purpose of GATT in terms of the Articles of Agreement to remove the barriers to trade, to reduce discriminatory factors and to enhance and develop the economies of the contracting parties to GATT by the reduction of tariffs and by the removal of controls or forms of discrimination. We cannot have it both ways. If we are in favour of freer trade, if we are in favour of enhanced trade, if we are in favour of the development of international trade, then we must also be reasonable in our approach to these discriminatory factors and these tariff barriers. The hon. the Minister indicated in his announcement last month, that he is appointing a committee of inquiry into the question of our GATT obligations and how these can be reconciled with South Africa&#x2019;s developmental needs. He has also asked the committee to investigate what steps the Government could take to protect local producers against the effect of the GATT obligations. It seems to me that in terms of the GATT agreement the time will soon come when the Minister must in fact abandon import control. Import controls are permissible under GATT where there are serious balance of payments difficulties &#x2014;I think this is article 12&#x2014;but there are conditions attached. The main conditions are that the extent of the trade restrictions applied to assist the balance of payments must not exceed the need which arises; in other words, the measures must not be excessive in relation to the remedy that is required. Secondly, these restrictions must be relaxed as soon as and while these conditions improve. In other words, they must be progressively relaxed as the balance of <span class="col_7519-7520" refersTo="page_0714"/>payments of the country concerned improves. We either believe in the principles of GATT or we do not believe in the principles of GATT; we are a contracting party to GATT, or we are not a contracting party to GATT. I believe that we cannot expect to get the advantages which GATT offers unless we also meet our commitments as members.</p>

<p>I now want to touch very briefly on this question whether the United Party in 1947 married South Africa innocently to a beast with cloven hooves, a tail and horns. The fact is that in 1947 South Africa was mainly an exporter of raw materials. South Africa did not have a highly developed industry and it was therefore entirely to South Africa&#x2019;s advantage to be able to export its raw materials abroad against low tariffs and to import, in return, manufactured goods from abroad. For anybody to enter into that sort of agreement in 1947, made perfectly good sense.</p>

<p>Rather short-sighted, don&#x2019;t you think?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>But how short-sighted? It is still true in 1970 that the bulk of South Africa&#x2019;s exports are raw materials. If one looks at the export figures for 1971 one finds that we exported R1 410 million&#x2019;s worth of goods. Of these only R27 million worth of goods were in fact articles ready for retail sale or consumer use. The rest was mainly raw materials or semi-processed materials. We are still importing a great deal of manufactured goods. As the Minister has said when he spoke a while ago, 80 per cent of our imports are essential imports. They are capital goods which we must have. They are exotic materials which are not produced locally and we must import these things. Out of our total import bill of R2 800 odd million last year, only R486 million in fact consisted of manufactured goods, goods for consumer use. I do not believe that this GATT agreement is nearly so dangerous or so detrimental to South Africa&#x2019;s overseas trading position as the Minister pretends, and the figures prove it. I think that we make too much of this thing. If we are considering higher tariffs we must consider both the advantages and the disadvantages. What will the advantages be? It will certainly not assist our exports if we were to change or to get our tariffs with GATT unbound. We have insufficient productive capacity for consumer goods in this country to satisfy the needs of the country itself. If our producers need tariff protection in order to protect themselves against imports from abroad, how can they be competitive abroad where those very goods come from?</p>

<p>If the tariffs are needed to reduce our imports or to protect local industries let us consider that already in terms of our GATT tariffs, on the average, import duties worth approximately 5,5 per cent of the value of our imports are affected. So there is already an average duy of approximately 5,5 per cent. In addition to this, we have already devalued, which adds 12,28 per cent to the cost of imports. Some of the supply countries have also revalued, which adds a further X per cent to the cost. Then there are transport costs. When we add all these together, our producers in South Africa have a natural protection exceeding 20 per cent, running in some cases to 25 per cent or higher. If there is to be further protection over and above, 25 per cent, it can have only two consequences: One is that it will shelter uneconomic industries, that is, import-replacement industries, which will be protected behind the barrier of 25 per cent high, when you calculate all the factors involved. Secondly, it will be highly inflationary, in that either the goods which come in or will come in despite this high tariff structure, will include the high price factor which the tariff adds; or our manufacturers will be encouraged by this high barrier to produce locally at high prices. So the effect is clearly inflationary and it is certainly uneconomic. I hope that when the Minister considers the recommendations of the committee of inquiry, he will bear in mind that his first duty is to the South African taxpayer, the ordinary public of South Africa. They should be protected by being assisted to obtain the goods they need for their comfort and necessity at reasonable prices. This kind of thing is not assisted by tariff protection. In fact, we come back full circle to the purposes of GATT. We joined GATT because we believe in freer trade. We believe in the removal of trade restrictions. We believe in economic competition, because these factors together produce a strong economy and a contented population.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis accused the Minister of not always acting in a very consistent manner, but the hon. member did not furnish <span class="col_7521-7522" refersTo="page_0715"/>us with the real facts. If he does have so many objections now, he should spell out the matter to us in exact terms, so that we may know where the Minister has been so inconsistent. This afternoon the hon. the Minister covered the matter here very widely and furnished all the facts&#x2014; not only today, but also in the past&#x2014;as to why steps were taken in the past. This was not done because this Government and the Minister were being inconsistent; it was as a result of factors abroad. We know, for instance, why import control was introduced. South Africans had simply started buying and importing wildly. We had the overseas monetary crisis, etc. Therefore this Government has never been inconsistent at all.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said these things involved a number of disadvantages. He said the hon. the Minister had to have regard to the fact that we had to protect the interests of John Citizen. But that is what this National Party Government has always done. We realize and understand the problems he mentioned there. The hon. member need not be concerned on that score.</p>

<p>But I should like to come back to the hon. members for Parktown and Pinetown. The hon. member for Pinetown spoke about the I.D.C. this afternoon. He was very worried, because he made certain vague complaints. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Pinetown specifically what his complaint against the I.D.C. is. He asked for the appointment of a Select Committee which would have to determine where the control, etc., was to be found; the public had to realize who was competing against them. The hon. member should tell us definitely what his charge is, to what industries established by the I.D.C. he is objecting. Then he should also tell us what industries in South Africa are being prejudiced. We know that the I.D.C. did finance industries in the past. An Act was passed here in Parliament to provide for the sale of an industry to private organizations. Now the hon. member has asked here for a Select Committee, and he has come forward with a charge which is unfounded and which he cannot substantiate. I should very much like him to tell us; I should like to follow him up at a later stage. He asked for a Select Committee; but the hon. member for Parktown said yesterday that this Government did not know what to do, and whenever it did not know what to do, it appointed a commission. See how these two are contradicting each other, Sir, The one asks for a commission and the other one says, &#x201C;No, there are too many; we do not want more.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown referred to the GATT yesterday. He spoke about our imports, etc., and then he levelled the accusation that this Government appointed commissions when it did not know what to do. Now I should like the hon. member also to tell us what commission was appointed by this hon. Minister, or this Government, which should not have been appointed. Does the hon. member have it against that technical committee which had to investigate the matter of the GATT, yes or no? Is it that commission?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, but in that case this person must at least be coherent in making a speech.</p>

<p>Of course, there are certain things on which I am in complete agreement with the hon. member. I am in full agreement with him as far as our exports are concerned. He is quite correct in saying that our imports are high. Our gold is not sufficient to pay for them; our exports cannot make up for them. As we know, our gold production amounted to 984 000 kg in 1970. It is estimated that it will only be half of that in the year 2000. Our exports will increase tremendously; I shall come to that later on.</p>

<p>The hon. member also stated here that the Government was doing nothing to, as he said, get the exports off the ground, and that nothing was being done. But the hon. member should at least give us the credit that this Government is doing the maximum. I want to tell the hon. member that I agree with him that more should be done, that there must be exports. That is correct. But the hon. member should not lay this at the door of this Government and the Minister. He is appealing to the wrong <span class="col_7523-7524" refersTo="page_0716"/>body. As the hon. the Minister said, it is not the Government that has to provide for the exports. I am now going to say what is being done. The Department of Commerce has no fewer than 4 full-time offices, namely in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban and Pretoria, with a full-time Director of Exports in Pretoria. These people are doing everything in their power to advise our manufacturers and exporters. As the hon. member can see for himself in the Estimates, we have a very large number of trade representatives all over the world. In these very same Estimates mention is also made of the South African Foreign Trade Organization, which is being financed by an amount of R140 000 per annum in order to enable these people to make publicity for our exports and to find a market for us abroad. We also know what financial assistance is being given in that regard. The Government has even gone so far as to pay devaluation compensation to our importers and exporters who had to suffer losses as a result of devaluation. The hon. member knows this. In that respect the Government has done its share. I am thinking of the promotion of exports. How much have we not already voted for that purpose? The hon. the Minister gave us R9 million in the Estimates&#x2014;that is what it will amount to in one year to stimulate our exports.</p>

<p>We may also take a look at other aspects. We must have telecommunications with the outside world. South Africa&#x2019;s system of telecommunications is as good as we can get. As recently as 29th April, the Postmaster-General opened the direct telephone cable to West Germany. In that sphere England has not even progressed to such an extent that we may have a direct line to that country, but West Germany has in fact done so. All of this is a result of steps taken by this Government to help our exporters. I want to tell the hon. member that I agree with him that exports must be promoted; but it is not this Government which is not doing its share. I want to say that we should lay this charge, or rather request, at the door of, mainly, three bodies: the Federated Chamber of Industries. the Chamber of Commerce and the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut. After all, these are the people who are manufacturing and trading, it is they who have to export. It happens to be the position in South Africa that SAFTO is charged with the publicity that has to be made. But it does not manufacture; it is not the body that sells. Much less does this apply, on the other hand, to the Government. It does not enter into business transactions. This has to be done by an intermediate body or bodies. If these three bodies which I mentioned, do not want to do this individually, they should do so jointly. I want to say that in that respect I will agree that if they do not want to do their share, the Government must do something to induce them to take steps in this regard. If they as three individual organizations do not want to do this, an organization will then have to be established by them for the purpose of handling this matter.</p>

<p>Throughout the world we find that trade zones are being formed. For instance, we find the EEC, the European Free Trade Community in which the United Kingdom has been included, and we must realize that more than 50 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s exports go to these two bodies. Then we also find the Latin-American Free Trade Area, the Central American Common Market, as well as quite a number of others which I shall not mention now. It is a fact, and it is important, that our manufactured goods will account for a larger percentage of our exports. In the course of the Budget debate I argued that for a start our salvation was to be found, in the first instance, in our base metals and minerals. That is the first place where we should strike in order to export, to supplement our adverse balance of payments. We have seen, of course, that as far as manufactured goods were concerned, there was a flattening between 1959 and 1964. But between 1964 and 1969 there was an increase. It increased at an annual rate of approximately 15 per cent, and it is estimated by authorities that during the next two five-year periods until 1980, it may increase at an annual rate of 15 per cent. But then we must know that our people will pool their resources. In order to export, they will have to avail themselves of the Government&#x2019;s assistance and the advice that is given.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, time does not allow me to deal this afternoon with the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> or the <i>Suiderkruis</i> or the Sarusas 1972 awards, or the non-observance of the conditions of the white fish consortium licence in South-West Africa. Nor, unfortunately, does it allow me to discuss with the Minister the <span class="col_7525-7526" refersTo="page_0717"/>rock lobster industry of Luderitz or of Port Nolloth, or the very interesting Lusitania rock lobster export quota concession granted in the Republic last year. I am also unable to discuss, for reasons of time, the continuing destruction of mussels, oysters and perlemoen beds off our coasts, and the wiping out of prawns, worms and red bait in some of the coastal areas. But I can say this, Sir, that just as the reckless policy of the Government in granting quotas and licences has resulted in the present parlous state of the rock lobster and pelagic fishing industries of the Republic and South-West Africa, so our sea-shore life off the Republic is being systematically plundered, and for this too, the Government must accept responsibility, because of what I call an inadequate administration, its ineffective control and regulations.</p>

<p>Time does not allow me to deal with the position of the Fishing Commission which was appointed in September, 1967, which still has not reported, although it has admittedly issued three interim reports, or to deal with the Fishcor report that was only tabled yesterday. I want willingly to acknowledge the good work that is being done by the hardworking and underpaid departmental staff. But it is a fact that both our research and our patrol services are hopelessly inadequate, and the present position is this: Either we are going to have a well-run and a well-paid and efficient fisheries department or else we are going to have to face the continual danger of the depletion of our marine and seashore life, which is today causing considerable concern not only to marine economists, but also to nature conservationists. Mr. Chairman, this afternoon I want to warn the Deputy Minister. While acknowledging that his predecessors, especially Dr. Diederichs and Mr. Jan Haak, are mainly responsible for the years of avaricious assault on the pelagic fish and the rock lobster resources of the Republic and of South-West Africa, nevertheless today it is his responsibility because he has been in office for two years. He must bear the responsibility at least for the present state of affairs. He knows that there has been serious overfishing, and so apparently does the Administrator of South-West Africa, because only last week in his Budget speech he said this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact that revenue from the fishing industry was less during the past financial year than in the previous year must to a large extent be attributed to a steady decline in our fish population.</block>

<p>*In spite of this fact, the Deputy Minister recently approved quotas for 165 000 tons for the <i>Willem Barendsz,</i> the <i>Suider-Kruis</i> and the Sarusas company, and I understand that he is allowing three factories to use pilchards for fishmeal because the factories concerned do not have canning facilities. As the Deputy Minister ought to know, a ton of pilchards which is canned is worth seven times as much as a ton of pilchards which is used for making fishmeal. There is no reason, to my mind, why the companies concerned cannot be compelled to have their pilchards canned by other fishing companies in Walvis Bay, because they (the other factories) do in fact have sufficient capacity to do this. Even worse, Sir, is the fact that the Deputy Minister has not yet decided whether or not he can accept Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s recommendations. Dr. Lochner has already warned him not to allow more than 150 000 tons of pilchards to be caught this year, but the existing quotas for South-West this year far exceed this figure, and approximately 140 000 tons of pilchards have been caught up to now. I want to appeal to the Deputy Minister this afternoon to take the initiative himself and to bring Dr. Lochner and the experts of the department together under his chairmanship so that they may discuss their differences and try to find a solution.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I do not believe for one moment that the fishery scientists, with Dr. Lochner, cannot arrive at a suitable solution.</p>

<p>*But, Sir, to do nothing is nothing but criminal negligence.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The generations that follow us will never forgive this Government if our marine resources are eradicated.</p>

<p>*Sir, there was talk recently of subsidies to the fishing industry. I should like to state my attitude on subsidizing this afternoon, because we on this side of the House can only agree to subsidies provided the Government is prepared to take effective steps to save the South-West African pilchard resources, for the taxpayers&#x2019; money cannot be used to subsidize the fish barons and then to destroy the resources still further. That is our attitude.</p>

<p><span class="col_7527-7528" refersTo="page_0718"/>Then I just want to say a few words in regard to the recent price increases. On 4th May this year factory prices were increased by R9 for fishmeal and by one cent a tin for canned fish, without any definite stipulation that the fishermen and the boat-owners will receive a share of these increases. These people, the fishermen and the boat-owners, are the ones who have to be helped in these critical times, otherwise they are going to go bankrupt. This is a simple fact. The fishing companies have the licences and the quotas, and recently they got this price increase, but the fishermen received neither shares in the fishing companies nor a fair price for their product from the companies. Before this Government began destroying these fish resources the boat-owners incurred heavy expenses, but their catches were also large at that time, and I want to mention a few figures this afternoon.</p>

<p>&#x2020;First of all a boat which cost the boat-owner in South-West Africa R46 000, was helped with the Fishcor loan of R23 000, repayable over a period of ten years, and the present quarterly rate of capital repayment and interest is no less than R2 450. A boat that cost a boat-owner R180 000, received from Fishcor a loan of R100 000.</p>

<p>*This is also repayable over 10 years, in the form of quarterly instalments of R7 900 at the moment. Sir, who in Walvis Bay can afford these instalments today, particularly in the light of the quota restrictions and the rising costs? Boat-owners and the fishermen need Government assistance. I appeal to the Deputy Minister at least to subsidize the interest of the boat-owners during this lean year. This is also being done in the case of some farmers in the Republic. I go further and say that both the boat-owners and the fishermen should be assisted by being granted realistic prices for their products by the factories. Otherwise they, too, must receive direct assistance from the Government.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, what is the position of boat-owners at the moment and the prices they receive for their products? In 1954 the boat-owners received R8 per ton, of which they had to pay the crew R4. In 1969 they received R9.30 and in addition to that 65 cents for diesel, and then the crew received R4. In 1970 they received R10 and free diesel and the crew received R4, but in respect of 1970 Mr. A. P. du Preez&#x2019;s companies claimed back from the boat-owners and from the crew an amount of 30 cents. In 1971 there was a small increase and the boat-owners received R11 per ton and the crew R5. At the end of 1971 an additional R1,20 in respect of back pay, was paid, but both Konsortiumvisserye and A.P. du Preez&#x2019;s companies refuse to make payment of this R1,20 to the boat-owners and the crews under their control. Now the present position is that the boat-owners have been offered by the factories R13,65, of which the crew receive R5,85. With the present fishmeal price increases of R9 per ton, which have been passed on to the factories, the crew are expected to be satisfied with the small increase recently announced of 85 cents per ton, and the boat-owners with 60 cents per ton for the raw fish they produce! !

I cannot think of anyone else. I cannot think of anyone who has done more for the fising industry of South-West Africa than specifically the Minister. But the hon. member&#x2019;s facts are so wrong. One moment he says, in the same speech, that <span class="col_7529-7530" refersTo="page_0719"/>the fish prices have been increased but the workers have not shared in the increase, and the next moment he says how much they obtained and he then complains that this is too little.</p>

I shall tell you today what happened in the past. In the past, small quotas were allocated to people who were not financially well-off, and then the big men bought them up, so much so that at one stage the Afrikaner had been sold out of the fishing industry. I personally support the granting of those quotas to large institutions whose shareholders are here in South Africa and not 6 000 miles away overseas, because the country benefits and the shareholders of those companies benefit, and not individuals.</p>

<p>The Afrikaner has shares in this company, and in this way they are obtaining their share. But there was the Land Bank story, and then there was the story about the fish to besmirch our leaders, and we are tired of that. I want to say that the biggest act of deceits I am aware of in this country is how the Afrikaner&#x2019;s land was stolen from under his nose for the sake of its gold and mineral sources. That was deceit. Afrikanerdom did not share in the riches of South Africa. We became poor whites, virtually our entire nation, and then the South African electorate decided in 1948 to entrust this country to the National Party, and the National Party made that same poor white people prosperous. The Afrikaner has become so prosperous since the National Party has ruled this country, because the country has become prosperous and the Afrikaner has begun to obtain a small share in the riches of South Africa. It is only a small share, because people who know say that today the Afrikaner does not yet have a 10 per cent share in the economy of South Africa. But we have become prosperous. We have also had Afrikaner millionnaires under the National Government, because they have obtained a small share in the wealth of South Africa, and they cannot stand that; they want everything for themselves, the way they kept it while they were in power. There was a stage before 1948 when it was generally known that there was one rich Nationalist in South Africa, and that was the late Mr. Bruckner de Villiers, and do you know what his estate was the day he died? R400 000. But he was regarded as the richest Afrikaner and the richest Nationalist in South Africa. That shows the way in which the Afrikaner was kept down, and they have always wanted us like that. They can have this story of theirs about deceit for a present. It is this Government&#x2019;s duty and task to allow a part of the wealth of South Africa to accrue to the Afrikaner.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about import control. I think import control must never be relaxed. There are occasions when we need certain capital goods and there must consequently be relaxations and concessions. But it can never be abolished, and I shall say why. Trade is never particularly patriotic in any country of the world. In South Africa the major portion of trade is not only unpatriotic, but also politically hostile. The major portion of the trade world would very much like to destroy this Government because it does not see eye to eye&#x2019; with the policy of this <span class="col_7531-7532" refersTo="page_0720"/>Government. Whenever there was unrestricted import, our balance of payments was virtually destroyed. It was the National Party with its take-over in 1925 which introduced a protective policy for South Africa&#x2019;s industries. Since 1948, when import control was introduced, it is interesting to look at the growth and the decline of our reserves. This also reflects the growth of our exports. Our 1947 imports amounted to R570 511 212. In contrast our exports amounted to R181 million. In 1948 import control was introduced. In 1950 the value of our imports was still R578 million, only R8 million more. In contrast our exports quadrupled to R453 million. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not propose to follow either the speech or the example of the hon. member who has just sat down because it seems to me that that type of speech has no place either in this century or in this debate. I could just as equally get up and complain that of the farming land in South Africa only 15 per cent is owned by English-speaking South Africans. All one can say of the hon. member is that he is following the example of his provincial leader, the hon. the Minister of Defence.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister earlier on made reference to the fact that he felt that the industrialists of South Africa did not do enough to export their ploducts. I must say that I agree with him. Overseas businessmen say that our own businessmen here do not do enough to sell their products in the outside world. But there is one exception which is invariably quoted as a notable exception, viz. the sugar industry. When one talks to overseas businessmen, they quote the South African sugar industry as a shining example of what should be done to develop markets in the outside world. I must say that this is an industry in regard to which I would like to say a few words this afternoon. As the hon. the Minister knows, the sugar industry is noteworthy for two things. Firstly, it operates under its own industrial agreement and secondly it has virtually run itself for many, many years. It has virtually run itself not only in the administration of its affairs, but also in practical fields, such as the financing and the running of its own experimental stations and extension officers. This is a long tradition in that industry and it has extended to the extent that the Minister is required to interevene in really only two spheres. The one is the question of the establishment of the price and the other is where there had been disagreement between the growing section and the milling section. Such disagreements are usually on how the cake should be divided between them. Then the Minister has to come in and decide on that issue. I would like to make a plea to the hon. the Minister to limit his intervention in the industry to the traditional fields, and to allow the industry to operate on its own accord. I had the opportunity earlier this year of raising with the hon. the Minister, although merely in passing, the question of the extension of quota land which he granted last year to a sugar interest in the Transvaal. This caused a great deal of disquiet in the industry. It caused such disquiet that for the first time in the ten years that I have been in this place&#x2014;together with the hon. members for South Coast, Pinetown and Pietermaritzburg District, I have the honour to represent virtually the whole sugar industry&#x2014;I have been specifically asked to raise an issue across the floor of this House relating to the internal affairs of the sugar industry. This is the grant by the hon. the Minister against the unanimous opinion of the organization of the sugar industry of an additional quota to certain interests in the Transvaal. When I raised this previously, the hon. the Minister said that I did not know what I was talking about when I said that he was responsible for the grant of quotas. I quote his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not grant them, you are stupid.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. the Minister said to me. Later on in an interjection he said: &#x201C;You do not know what you are talking about.&#x201D; I do not know what caused the hon. the Minister to make those remarks, but both in terms of section 17 and Schedule G of the Industrial Agreement, it is quite clear that the hon. the Minister and the Central Board are the two bodies which can grant quotas or which can bring about an extension of quotas by an amendment to Schedule G. This. I think, is what the hon. the Minister did in the instance that I am referring to. I raise it in the short time availble to me to establish the following point with the hon. the Minister: It creates the very worst impression when the hon. the Minister takes a decision against the unanimous advice of all sections of the industry, which has the effect of benefiting one section only. This is so because the inference which is drawn, is <span class="col_7533-7534" refersTo="page_0721"/>that the Minister has bowed to political pressure in order to benefit one section of an industry. That inference has been drawn, it has been widely drawn, and it is a most regrettable circumstance.</p>

<p>The other aspect which I want to raise is in regard to the question of price. Of course, wrapped up with price is the question of the stabilization fund. The stabilization fund is in itself, in my view, a very good thing, but I would ask the hon. the Minister, when it comes to the question of price negotiations year by year, not to penalize existing growers in the industry by putting too great a slice of the cake into the stabilization fund at the present time. That is to say, I would ask him to lean in favour of building up the stabilization fund over a period of years so that the burden of establishing that fund does not fall principally on those who happen to be growers in the industry at the present time. I say &#x201C;growers&#x201D; because at the present time the growing section of the industry is in my view, and I believe it is correct, in a far less happy position than the milling section is fortunate enough to be in. The point is that I would like to ask the hon. the Minister when the price of sugar is altered, particularly altered downwards, to do it in a manner which brings about some real benefit to the consumer. Just before the Brakpan by-election, and it may be fortuitous that it happened at that time, but I have my doubts, the price of sugar was reduced, but it was reduced in such a manner that the reduction of the pound of sugar to the ordinary housewife was negligible. The principal reduction went to the bulk buyer, the man who could afford to pay for the sugar and the housewive, whom it was presumably intended to benefit, got virtually no benefit out of it at all. The persons who benefited principally were the manufacturers who use sugar, i.e. the manufacturers of cold drinks, sweets and things of that kind. I do not know of a single commodity in the manufacture of which a substantial quantity of sugar is used where that reduction in price, which cost the industry about R7 million, has been passed on to the consumer. I do not know of one single instance. The result of this was the minimal benefit to the housewife or rather the fractional benefit to the housewife, the substantial benefit to the large consumer and the manufacturer&#x2014;which could not have been the intention but resulted from this&#x2014;together with a reduction in the amount of money available to the grower and the miller. This was done at a time and with a result which has suggested that it was a political manipulation to benefit the governing party in a by-election. I say this is not the way to treat a major industry which is of substantial benefit to this country. I would ask the hon. the Minister to adhere rigidly to the acceptance of the past in his future dealings with the sugar industry. This means that the industry should be allowed to govern itself and that the hon. the Minister should follow the unanimous opinion of the sugar organization which does represent this industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is general knowledge that South Africa has rich fishing grounds, and over many years these fishing resources were the responsibility of the Executive Committee of South-West Africa and fell under the direct control of the present Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs. After the entry of the factory ships, and especially the entry of the <i>Suiderkruis</i> as a large factory ship, it was clear to all of us that the resources would not be able to withstand these additional onslaughts. Accordingly representations were made to the authorities for the withdrawal of these factory ships from the fishing waters. However, in season and out of season we are blamed for having made those representations in good time. This withdrawal of the factory ships was finalized this year.</p>

<p>It was finalized by the same person who has been responsible for the protection of the fishing resources all these years. The industry and everyone who has an interest in these fishing grounds are grateful for the fact that these factory ships have been withdrawn. On behalf of all interested parties I should like to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for his zeal and hard work to bring about a compromise in this regard. He was loyally assisted by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and we should like thank him too.</p>

<p>It is not true that quotas of altogether 165 000 tons of pilchards were granted. What was granted, was a total quota of 165 000 tons, of which only one third may be pilchards. This means that for the three quota holders it is only a total of <span class="col_7535-7536" refersTo="page_0722"/>55 000 tons as against the single quota of 200 000 tons last year for the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> alone.</p>

<p>All the observations indicate that, as a result of the strict control measures which are being applied, the pilchard resources are recovering remarkably, if there was in fact any great damage. Large shoals of pilchards are plentiful in the vicinity of Walvis Bay and excellent catches are being made. The Secretary for Industries also informed me that the head of the Division of Sea Fisheries will shortly station some of his staff on fishing vessels in order to gather even more information and to cover a wider field daily. The fishing industry in Walvis Bay is experiencing a record canning season, because large and abundant shoals of fish are available in the immediate vicinity of Walvis Bay. The programme has reached such massive proportions that the tin factory at Walvis Bay cannot meet the demand at all, so that tins have to be transported from Cape Town and Vanderbijlpark to Walvis Bay. We trust that these additional measures the Division of Sea Fisheries is going to take will enable them to continue their good work by finding out, in an efficient way, as much as possible about these resources and to endeavour to determine the extent of these resources as thoroughly as possible. We believe this survey will result in a relaxation of the restrictions on the catching of pilchards, because we have great confidence in that industry and know that there is not at all such a crisis as is being suggested here. I should also like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention the two factories, i.e. Suid-Kunene and Konsortium-visserye. It is true that a restriction was imposed on their licences, a restriction which prevents them from canning fish. That was necessary as a result of the circumstances at that time. If these concerns were to lodge an application, I should just like to ask for favourable consideration to be given to the making available of canning facilities to them.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Simonstown. He is in actual fact the hon. member for dead fish. This hon. member thinks it fit to attack and discredit the hon. the Deputy Minister morning, noon and night. I want to tell the hon. member that this Deputy Minister is also the leader of the National Party in South-West Africa. Since assuming office in 1950, this hon. Deputy Minister has done more for South-West Africa and its people than that hon. member, his party and all their cronies will be able to do in an entire lifetime. For years the hon. member has been engaged in smelling out Nationalists and Afrikaners in the fishing industry. However, there are other people as well in the fishing industry. There are also people who speak his language and who share his political views. It is a pity that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not present, because I should very much like to know from him whether people from those ranks have not yet spoken to him. Have people from those ranks not yet appealed to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to silence this hon. member? Have they not yet told him that he is harming Walvis Bay and South Africa and the fishing industry?</p>

The record of the United Party in South-West Africa is an extremely poor one and he is making it even poorer. The record of the United Party in South-West Africa contains entries such as: The depriving of language rights, the closing of schools, the internment of people, the expropriation of farms and the deportation of people. That is the proud record of the United Party in South-West Africa! South-West Africa has no room for the United Party. Sout-West Africa has no room for people such as this, people who only break down and do not build up. These people and the officials who are working in the interest of the fishing industry deserve our thanks and appreciation. The United Party is engaged in decrying and running down.

They should go and find out for themselves with what risk to their lives these people toil and moil at sea in order to gather information in order to ensure that these resources are preserved for posterity.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Omaruru really is an amazing personality. In a previous speech he once told the hon. member for Simonstown that he was in Jaap Marais&#x2019;s camp. Today, however, my hon. friend for Simonstown is a Boer-hater. I do not know how the two things go together. The hon. member for Omaruru asked for a judicial inquiry earlier on because he was so afraid that this fishing industry which is of such importance to South Africa would be destroyed. He has now listened to quite a few speeches by the hon. member for Simonstown in which he painted the dangers vividly. I am surprised that the hon. member did not plead here this afternoon for that judicial inquiry, because he should know better than many other people how extremely parlous the position of the fishing industry is.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I wish to approach the hon. the Minister about an issue for which I make no apology. I wish to raise once again the question of establishing an ore terminal, a modem one, while Saldanha is not operational. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I do not wish to criticize Saldanha or the decision of the Government to continue with this project. I would only like to remind the Committee that the estimate by Iscor of R400 million was rejected by the hon. the Leader of the House during the discussion of his Vote, because he thought that a more correct estimate would be in the vicinity of R600 million to R700 million. I plead with the hon. the Minister to reconsider the claims of the promoters of the St. Croix scheme. They claim that their project, to be financed from private capital, would provide an immediate answer for our growing volume of ore exports and would be complementary to the Saldanha Bay scheme. I raise this issue because it has come to my notice that Japanese steel interests have decided to extend the deadline for the expiry of Consolidated African Mines&#x2019; iron ore negotiations. The original deadline was April, but they have now decided to extend it. Mr. Wilhelmi, the managing director, has said that he has in writing an undertaking that they would enter into firm agreements should the Government grant St. Croix the same conditional approval as was granted to Saldanha. The additional quantities of ore which are visualized in this Press report, are 3 million tons by 1976, rising to 5 million tons by 1980. In reviewing the St. Croix Scheme, I would ask the hon. the Minister to consider the following. Ten years or more would elapse before this vast Saldanha Bay scheme could become operational. Secondly, the technological breakthrough achieved with the introduction of diesel traction has increased the capacity of the existing Sishen-Port Elizabeth line to 10 million tons of ore per annum. Theoretically the ore installation in Port Elizabeth can handle 6,3 million tons per annum. But due to the shallowness of the harbour, and the fact that only relatively small carriers can operate there, the through put is only 4,7 million per annum. An additional berth could be built and the export of manganese and iron-ore be separated, that is true; but the shallowness of the harbour remains the limiting factor <span class="col_7539-7540" refersTo="page_0724"/>and would handicap us in trying to become truly competitive in the international ore trade. Port Elizabeth is known in international ore circles as a delay port. This fact naturally pushes up the freight. Shipping circles estimate that if the freight of one ton of ore were to be eight dollars on a 40 000 ton carrier, the freight of one ton on a 150 000 tonner would be four dollars.</p>

<p>*It will be possible to handle carriers of 150 000 tons and more at St. Croix. St. Croix will provide South Africa with a constantly growing basis in the international ore trade, and will also be a guarantee that the ambitious Saldanha scheme, when it gets under way, will be an economic enterprise. Shipping costs are low at the moment, and experts claim that this is the obvious time to enter into new ore agreements. When we start exporting iron ore from Saldanha Bay, manganese can still be shipped from St. Croix.</p>

<p>In previous debates dealing with the St. Croix project the hon. the Minister tried to disparage this scheme by means of misrepresentations.</p>

<p>I shall withdraw it, Sir, In Hansard (col. 4517, 1970) the hon. the Minister said that the swells in the sea at St. Croix can change from nothing to 30 feet within half an hour. Sir, the harbour captain of Port Elizabeth says this is nonsense. In col. 4518 he said that St. Croix was such a small island that some of the ships would be larger than the island itself. The length of St. Croix is 650 metres, while the length of a 350 000 tonner is only 365 metres. In Hansard (col. 1121, 1972) the hon. the Minister said that the cost of construction of St. Croix would be R220 million. He arrived at this by taking the cost of construction of R47 million and adding to this R93 million for improvements to the Sishen-Port Elizabeth line and R80 million for rolling stock. And then the hon. the Minister compared the R220 million which he got in this way with the R400 million for St. Croix, but surely that is quite wrong. The R93 million is the amount which was mentioned by the hon. the Minister of Transport as the amount which would be necessary if the capacity of this line were to be increased to 50 million tons of ore a year.</p>

<p>The promoters of St. Croix have always said that St. Croix was designed to handle 10 million tons of ore a year and that this could possibly be increased to 15 million tons a year by incurring further expenses. They have never mentioned 50 million tons. The Railways are acquiring the rolling stock at the moment, not for St. Croix, but for the existing installation in the Port Elizabeth harbour. How can these two amounts then be added to the R47 million? Surely the comparison is R47 million as against R400 million, or rather, R650 million, according to the hon. the Minister of Transport. Why does the hon. the Minister not tell the House that the recommendation of the departmental commission of inquiry, according to rumour, was that St. Croix should be given priority? Sir, it would be economic sabotage of South Africa for the Government to keep blocking the St. Croix scheme without good reason, because if it is blocked, the Government is going to prevent South Africa from earning an extra R400 million, approximately, in foreign exchange, while Saldanha is being constructed. What is the Government&#x2019;s motive in continuing to block this scheme?</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, increasing our ore and mineral exports is the first step we should take to improve our balance of trade. Secondly, the Government should vigorously encourage the export of manufactured goods. Industrialists will not venture into foreign markets unless the return on their investments is adequate.

<p>The hon. member referred to the annual report of Fishcor, covering a period which ended last year in, I think, September or October. If he would only read that report he would already find indications of this in that report, regardless of what the position is at the present time. The hon. member came here and spoke of the quotas for the <i>Willem Barendsz,</i> Sarusas and the <i>Suiderkruis</i>. He reproached me for having granted quotas. It is not true; it is not correct. What happened in actual fact was that the quotas of approximately 570 000 tons which those people legitimately had, were reduced to 165 000 tons, besides the pilchard restriction. They were prepared to settle for 270 000 tons in Walvis Bay, but because the department, the Minister and I were adamant, it was eventually fixed at 165 000 tons. It was reduced from 570 000 tons to 165 000 tons. Sir, if at this stage the hon. member feels he has made a fool of himself, it is not my fault. Then the hon. member spoke of factories without canning facilities and said that they should be compelled to install canning facilities.</p>

Today, when the situation appears to be completely different, those people may have canning facilities if they want them, but would it be advisable at this stage before there is absolute certainty about the situation? Sir, on a previous occasion I asked the hon. member whether he would be prepared to implement Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory just like that if he were to come into power. He did not reply to me at the time. Will he reply to me this afternoon? Will he tell me today that he would prescribe 100 000 tons of pilchards per year for Walvis Bay if he were in power?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, he recommended 100 000 tons for this year&#x2019;s catches, and if the hon. member feels that he has made a fool of himself in that respect as well in that he does not even know what Dr. Lochner recommended, it is not my fault either.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of subsidies to the industry. This industry is not in such a condition that subsidies from the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket are necessary. The hon. member complained here about the fishermen&#x2019;s remuneration and he complained because no conditions had been attached to <span class="col_7543-7544" refersTo="page_0726"/>the increase of the price of fish. There was an understanding with the fishing industry when that increase was granted. The hon. member does not know what that increase really implies. The increase is R9 per ton of fishmeal; this is apart from canned fish; and one ton of fishmeal means 4 tons of raw fish. Only half that tonnage of fish is marketed in South Africa. In other words, the increase is only on approximately one half of the fish which is processed. Now the hon. member may make a little calculation, if he is able to, and he will find that these factories receive approximately R1 per ton extra on their raw fish. Then the hon. member may do a little calculation to establish what is paid out to the fishermen and if he feels he has made a fool of himself in that respect as well, it is not my fault.</p>

<p>What is more, Sir, the fishermen of Walvis Bay and the boat-owners know that as far as remuneration is concerned, their interests are being looked after. They know their interests were looked after last year. Last year the fishermen were placed in the same position as if there were catches of 90 000 tons. They know that on my instruction the department negotiated with the industry and that an increase of R1,20 per ton was agreed upon. Furthermore, as far as this matter of Du Preez and the Consortium is concerned, I have already made provision for that matter to be taken up with them, and a meeting in this regard will take place one of these days. If the hon. member finds that he has made a fool of himself in this respect as well, it is not my fault. These matters cannot be determined just like that in this fluid situation we have.</p>

<p>The fishermen, the boat-owners and the factories know that the department and I intend examining this situation every year as the catches develop. But we must first reach the end of the season and establish what sort of catches have been made. At the moment it seems that the catches are going to develop unfavourably in the sense that pilchards are in fact reasonably plentiful but that there is very little other fish. This creates another difficult situation of which the hon. member is probably not even aware and which he has not taken into account, and if he wants to make a fool of himself in that regard as well, it is not my fault either. Then he spoke of the interest of boat-owners which should be subsidized. This has already been arranged with Fishcor. It is not a subsidization of interest, but a special approach in respect of the position of the boat-owners in these difficult circumstances. And it was arranged long before the hon. member put forward the idea that interest should be subsidized. If he feels he has made a fool of himself in that respect as well, it is not my fault. Then there is the transfer of the increased prices of fish to the fishermen. In that regard I have indicated to him how that money is transferred to the fishermen, and consequently he has made a fool of himself in that regard as well.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member suggested that if we could not do anything else we should look for legislation to do three things; Firstly, that there should be a written contract, as the hon. member suggested, and, secondly, that there should be a seven-day cooling off period and, thirdly, that there should be a take back provision. I think those are the three conditions the hon. member suggested last night. We have had a closer look at this whole matter, and it was felt that we could do something under section 9 of the <span class="col_7545-7546" refersTo="page_0727"/>Price Control Act, but I would like to put this to the hon. member now and I would like him, if possible, to react to my suggestion, because I would like to hear from the Opposition if I can rely on their support if I do anything of this kind. The Price Controller could, by proclamation, prohibit sales of this kind, but I fear it will then also apply to all those others to which the hon. member referred last night and which he regarded as being reasonably respectable. The suggestion is that the following proclamation should be published in the <i>Gazette</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I (i.e. Mr. Steyn, the Price Controller) acting under the powers vested in me by section 9 of the Price Control Act, 1964, hereby prohibit the sale of goods on conditions in terms of which if the goods are sold to the purchaser at his dwelling or working place, or sent through the post to the purchaser &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then follow the three conditions&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If they are sold at his dwelling place or his working place, or through the post, the sale is prohibited if:</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the purchaser is denied the right to withdraw within seven days after having so bought or received the goods from any contract into which he may have entered in connection with the purchase of the goods and to return the goods within the said period to the seller.</li>

</ol>

<p>That provides for the first condition the hon. member suggested last night&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(b) The purchaser is denied the right to recover from the seller any amount which he may have paid to the seller in respect of the goods returned to the seller as specified in paragraph (a); and (c) the purchase price of the goods exceeds by more than 50 per cent the cost price of the goods to the importer or the manufacturer thereof; and (d) an invoice &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now this is the written part of the contract which the hon. member suggested&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; an invoice or order form is presented to the purchaser for signature, on which the cost price referred to in para graph (c) and the name of the manufacturer or importer does not appear.</block>

<p>I would like to hear from the hon. member or from other hon. members opposite, what they think of a suggestion of this kind. This is the only thing we feel that we can do at the present moment without further legislation. I realize that it would also affect other sales at dwelling houses or at working places and in the circumstances I think it might be a serious thing to do, as it might do harm to certain other possibly reputable sellers of goods of this kind.</p>

<p>*I think hon. members may perhaps discuss this proposal later. This is the only thing I can suggest in this regard at the moment. I must say we are very concerned about this type of sale. In the absence of a better word, I can only call it a racket. Unfortunately it is the position today that to a large extent our people expect the Government to look after everything. Hundreds of people let themselves in for this type of thing and instead of using their heads and asking themselves whether it is the sensible thing to do to concern themselves with an organization of this kind, they do it nevertheless and in the end there is a tremendous explosion and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people suffer losses, and then it is for the Government to ensure that they are not done in in that way. But this is the position, and we should like to combat it. At present I do not have anything better to suggest except perhaps legislation, apart from the fact that we have handed the matter over to the Police who may perhaps take action in terms of the Gambling Act. That is another possibility. The matter was brought to the attention of the Police some weeks ago, and they are conducting investigations.</p>

<p>Another subject I should like to discuss now, is the matter in respect of price control which was raised by the hon. member for Pinetown in the Budget debate and once more this afternoon. I want to say that I hold very definite views on price control and that I shall not hesitate to express my very definite views in that regard today. In December, 1971, we were obliged to intensify price control materially. As you know, there has always been price control in respect of certain commodities, but in December last year we <span class="col_7547-7548" refersTo="page_0728"/>were obliged to intensify it materially. It happened as a result of circumstances which had brought about a measure of imbalance in the economy, i.e. the intensified import control which we introduced, as well as devaluation. As a result of these two steps on the part of the Government, some exploitation and malpractices occurred. Consequently the Price Controller received many complaints and initially, in December last year, we froze the prices o&#x2019; certain commodities. Instead of the frozen prices introduced initially, maximum prices in respect of certain commodities were laid down at a later stage. I must say we would have been failing in our duty if, in the prevailing circumstances, we had not asked and had not intensified price control. The malpractices which resulted from import control were simply price increases which were imposed in anticipation of goods becoming scarce.</p>

<p>The prices of certain imported commodities sold in South Africa, suddenly rose the day intensified import control was announced. The prices rose simply because of the expectation that the articles were going to become scarce and that there would be a greater demand for the goods because as people rushed to buy goods which would suddenly become scarce. There were some exploitation and malpractices as a result of devaluation, because the prices of goods which had been imported at pre-devaluation prices rose at once without any justification as though devaluation prices applied to such goods.</p>

<p>These are the circumstances which brought about the degree of imbalance and which afforded people the opportunities of applying malpractices and of exploiting the public. The Price Controller conducted discussions with trade and industry. I think these produced very fruitful results. As hon. members know, in the meantime it was necessary for us to combat inflation as well. I think there were perfectly encouraging signs as a result of the discussions conducted between the Price Controller and trade and industry. It is our responsibility of course, to ensure that exploitation does not take place, but I think we must admit in all honesty today that an equally important duty rests on the consumer. I must honestly say that the ideal and most effective price control rests with the consumer. It rests with him provided commodities are obtainable fairly readily.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the commodities are available and the consumer makes a point of buying the articles at the place where he can obtain it the cheapest, it is in my opinion, the most ideal and most effective method of price control. In that case the prices would be forced down to a level where the seller is still able to make a living but below which he cannot drop without showing a loss. It seems as though our buying public do not discipline themselves properly, and I want to address a serious appeal to them. As far as their purchases are concerned, they must discipline themselves, buy carefully and buy at places where the prices are the lowest. I know that not everyone can save, but those who have good earnings, should save, not only in their own interests, but also in the interests of South Africa. It is a misconception that regardless of circumstances, the public should, in respect of prices, be protected by the Government at all times. I want to say unambiguously the price control cannot be applied in order to prevent price increases. If circumstances justify an increase in prices and it becomes essential for prices to be increased, we cannot keep prices constant by means of price control. What we can in fact do, is to ensure that no exploitation occurs in disturbed circumstances and that such circumstances are not abused. In recent times, of course, we have had the problem that large quantities of goods are imported&#x2014;goods of which the prices also increase. The number of goods subject to price control at the present time, is in fact relatively small in relation to the large number and variety of goods which are available.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Pinetown of my philosophy on price control. I believe that price control should be restricted to a minimum, especially under normal circumstances in which there is the customary competition and in which the consumer and the buyer themselves are able to play a role in keeping prices low. In such cases price control should be resticted to a minimum. Furthermore, I believe that profits should be made if we want our economy to run smoothly and especially if we want it to flourish. We cannot expect the entrepreneur to invest his money in a business if he cannot make a profit. Therefore <span class="col_7549-7550" refersTo="page_0729"/>it is my added belief that price control cannot and should not be applied to prevent a seller from making his ligitimate profit in the business he runs. That is why I say unambiguously that as far as I am concerned, price control should not be applied to prevent businesses from making reasonable profits. It is true that there has to be price control in certain cases. In this way we have always had price control in the past. I can mention a few examples. For example, I have in mind the few commodities in respect of which the Government pays subsidies. It is necessary for the price of such a commodity to be laid down, because it forms part of the calculation to determine the subsidy. There are certain basic goods, for example building materials, in respect of which it is desirable that there should be control from time to time. It is essential to control the prices in the case of certain industries where there is rationalization. In this regard I have in mind, for example, the chemical industry and cement. As far as the ordinary commodities are concerned where the supply is reasonable, I believe that if conditions are at all normal, it is unnecessary to have price control. I believe that where commodities are available, prices should find their own level. Since we have extended price control considerably at present in respect of a larger volume of commodities than before, I want to state unambiguously that it is not my policy to maintain this position. I think that as soon as these imbalances which were created by import control and devaluation, have been eliminated, we shall have to examine the situation once again so that price control in respect of those commodities for which there is a reasonable supply, may be removed. At the moment I believe that the imbalances still exist, and for that reason I regard it as a duty we have towards the consumer public to ensure that prices do not rise unreasonably when such rises are not justified. I hope this gives the hon. member for Pinetown some idea of my policy and philosophy in respect of price control.</p>

<p>For the present I want to confine myself to the hon. member for Zululand. I have singled him out as he is a different sort of member from other hon. members. The hon. member always sees spectres. He always sees suspicion. He simply loves talking about &#x201C;there is suspicion with the public and you cannot blame them for suspicion&#x201D;. This afternoon again he bruited a few things abroad. It reminds me of what he once said, i.e. &#x201C;It reminds me of maggots feeding on a corpse.&#x201D;</p>

I am sick and tired of it. The hon. member did not render the sugar industry a service here this afternoon. There cannot be a better relationship between me and any other industry than there is between me and the sugar industry. There is nothing wrong with it. I want to congratulate the sugar industry on the prosperity it has had in recent years. Now the hon. member blames me for having exercized my right last year. What happened? The sugar industry made a recommendation in regard to the extension of the quota at TSB, viz. a sugar area in the Eastern Transvaal. The recommendation of the sugar industry was that we should increase the quota by 4 000 acres. It is my right to accept or reject the recommendation of the sugar industry. The sugar industry, which is a sound industry as it is, and I am placing the industry on an even sounder basis. There is the odd weak link in the sugar industry. Our first task is to eliminate the <span class="col_7551-7552" refersTo="page_0730"/>weak links in the sugar industry and at places where the quota is such that the mills cannot operate profitably as a result of a shortage of production, to ensure that the production there is expanded so that those mills will be able to produce economically. This mill, TSB, has never made a profit since it was established. The recommendation was that I should increase the quota by 4 000 acres. The mill had requested an additional 7 000 acres. I decided to increase the quota by 5 500 acres. It is my right as a Minister. Now the hon. member comes along and makes a fuss about it. And what does he say? He says I create &#x201C;the inference that I bow to political pressure&#x201D;. He does not come here with an idea like any normal, sensible person, but with his sick mind he sees all sorts of suspicion and motives why I had supposedly done so.</p>

<p>Yes, but I do not exercise it. The hon. member ascribed it that to me that I had given individuals quotas. I gave no individual a quota. The only thing I approved, was the increase of the TSB quota by 5 500 acres. That is all I did. That is why I tell the hon. member that he is still stupid. The hon. member went further. As is typical of supporters of United Party, it was of course something as bitter as gall for him when we succeeded in announcing a decrease in the price of sugar. The hon. member said here that we had done so just before the Brakpan election and he called it &#x201C;political manipulation&#x201D;. Surely I did not do so on my own. After all, I did so in close consultation with the Sugar Association, his people there in Natal. When the Sugar Association and I agreed that we could decrease the price of su ar in South Africa, I announced it. If it had a political motive, why does the hon. member not blame the Sugar Association as well?</p>

<p>However, he sees siniter motives because we have decreased the domestic price of sugar. There is always suspicion in his mind. Goodness knows what will happen if he is to be placed in a responsible position one day, because then one can only practise those things one always has in mind and which one always wants to ascribe to others. When we announced this reduction in the price of sugar, something like Brakpan was not in my mind at all. The hon. member need not believe it if he does not want. I did so in close consultation with the Sugar Association. Does the hon. member know what this concession is worth to the consumers in South Africa? R9 million per year. My negotiations with the Sugar Association place R9 million per year in the pockets of the consumers of South Africa. Now the hon. member pretends that that is working. It is only half a cent per kilogram, but it nevertheless comes to a total of R9 million for the sugar industry. I do not think it is worthwhile speaking to the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that the hon. the Minister in the latter part of his reply lost his &#x201C;cool&#x201D;, as one might say, because I had gathered two things from the hon. member for Zululand. The one was that his appeal to the hon. the Minister was to leave to the sugar industry those things that belong to the sugar industry, and, secondly that the hon. member <span class="col_7553-7554" refersTo="page_0731"/>was speaking on behalf of the sugar industry. I want to assure the hon. the Minister that he is much more effective in his more pleasant frame of mind than he was a few moment sago.</p>

<p>We were glad to hear from the hon. the Minister about his policy in regard to price control when he said that it was not his policy to impose price control and that he would impose it to as limited an extent as possible. We hope the limited extent will be very limited. I think this is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own wish and I am sure that as time goes on he will get rid of more and more items that are controlled. I think there is one thing that one has to be very careful about with the question of price control, viz., that through price control you can stop the expansion of the production of a commodity where greater production in due course would reduce the price. In other words, if you have control of an item a businessman may say that it is not worthwhile his investing to produce a product which will only fetch X for him. If it was X plus something, he would extend his capacity and eventually the price would come down. Anyway, we are reasonably happy with what the hon. the Minister had to say.</p>

<p>I now want to say something about multi-level selling. I am gratified that both the Minister and his Secretary of the department are keen that something should be done. I think this is a very important step that the country now knows that the Government is giving this matter very serious consideration. We will have to study this document. It is not something on which I can give the hon. the Minister a snap answer, although it does appear to me right at the beginning that it is not going to do the job, especially if you read the fourth line&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the goods are sold to the purchaser at his dwelling or working place, or sent through the post to the purchaser &#x2026;</block>

<p>This would not seem to be applicable to some of the distributors who never see goods and other distributors who take their goods from the factory. But we will be very happy to co-operate with the hon. the Minister. We will go through this document if he so wishes. We will meet with his economics group and see if we can find a <i>modus operandi</i> which will give an &#x201C;oplossing&#x201D; to this problem.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I want to deal with, and that is a point raised by my friend, the hon. member for Sunnyside. It is the question of our exports and private industry. I agree with him entirely that private industry has to play its part. I take the opportunity whenever I go abroad to always call on our embassies, particularly to discuss export matters with the officials concerned. I agree with what the hon. member has said; because I have seen documentary evidence of inquiries to South African firms for exports sent to nine or ten companies, and perhaps one reply was received. The South African industrialist is not getting on with the job. But this is not uncommon. What I believe we have to do, is ignite something, spark something off, get something going. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that it is as important to export as it is to create new industries, in many cases. But look what happens in regard to the creation of new industries. Let us take Ireland as an example. In Ireland, if you are prepared to establish a new industry at Shannon, as the hon. the Minister knows, I think you can get your profits tax-free for seven years. If any industrialist wants to go to Israel and establish a factory there, for a period of years his profits are tax-free. If I remember rightly, I think Taiwan is doing the same thing. If anybody wants to go to Taiwan and establish a factory, for a period of time his profits are tax-free. We have something very similar here. If you want to go to the border industries&#x2014;or you have got to go to the border industries&#x2014;a certain proportion of your profits are tax-free. What I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister is what I have already suggested in this House before. We have to do something dynamic, spectacular. These tax benefits we are offering to the exporters I do not think are enough to generate exports. I mentioned briefly during a previous debate in this House this publication &#x201C;Disc&#x201D;. This is, as the Americans would say, &#x201C;hot off the Press&#x201D;. It was only published on January 24th of this year. It is Domestic International Sales Corporation legislation introduced in America. In terms of this legislation, what actually and basically happens, is that 50 per cent of all exports are not taxed, provided they are not distributed, but used in the production of the product that is exported, or provided they are used to finance the export of the product. Here is the great United States of America. We <span class="col_7555-7556" refersTo="page_0732"/>know she has been running into a balance of payments problem; but what is her total export today? A maximum of about 5 per cent. Yet, she has gone as far as to say to her exporters: &#x201C;If you will export, we will make 50 per cent of your export profits free of tax&#x201D;. That is in effect what it means. They set out very fully how you calculate export profits, and so on. I think this is what the hon. the Minister should try to get his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, to agree to&#x2014;something dramatic, something that is going to mean something to the exporter. He should say to the exporter, &#x201C;For a limited period of time&#x201D;&#x2014;whether it is three years, five years or seven years is something to be determined&#x2014;&#x201C;whatever profit you make on your exports will be tax-free; whatever your additional profits are from today, for that period of time your tax will be only 50 per cent.&#x201D; Sir, if that is done, then I believe our industrialists would start exporting. In the same way as Ireland has built up a fantastic industrial sector in Shannon on a tax-free basis, I believe it is important that we should do the same for our export industry. Sir, let us be bold. This is a critical stage in the industrial development of this country.</p>

<p>I quoted some figures from SAFTO, which is almost a <i>quasi</i>-Government organization, as to what our position is going to be in the year 2000, which is not very far off. Unfortunately, I do not think that I will be here to see it, but it is not very far off. We have an obligation, not only to ourselves but to posterity to plan now to take care of the problems which are going to arise in the future. What we have got to do now is to try to create that incentive, that excitement, that willingness to do something, which will make the exporter really get off his chair and go to work. I do not think that anything we have done up to now has given him that incentive. He makes his profit locally. Jan Kitshoff, in a speech which he made the other day&#x2014; a very good speech indeed&#x2014;said to the exporter, &#x201C;We acknowledge that your first consideration is the profit you make.&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, you will never change an industrialist. This will always be his first consideration. If it is easy for him to make his profit here, he will make it here. If it is difficult for him to make his profit abroad, he will not make it abroad, unless the incentive is such that it will pay him to export. Give him the incentive of a tax reduction now, and then he will build up an export trade, and after three or four years it will be automatic. We will then start a chain of events&#x2014;not like multi-level selling, but a better chain of events&#x2014;and I think we can then establish a pattern of exports, a concept of exports, a philosophy of exports, which will do the things which the hon. the Minister wants as much as I want them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I do not want to comment on the arguments of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I think the hon. the Minister will be able to do this with much greater authority than I would. I nevertheless think that he pleaded a very good case, i.e. in connection with assistance for our exporters.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a matter which has perhaps not been mentioned in this debate yet, but which can become a very important aspect, in my opinion, as far as our future economic activities are concerned, a matter which should perhaps be mentioned here so that the hon. the Minister can inform this Committee in so far as the matter affects his department. I should like to focus attention on the possible introduction of television into South Africa within the next few years. I think it is an irrefutable fact that the introduction of television in South Africa can become a tremendous stimulus, over a very wide area, for our economy and our economic activities. I accept that the hon. the Minister and his department will play the role of allert watchdogs to try to protect our own industry here and to encourage it, and that very strict control will be exercised over the import of television sets. If we are to be chiefly dependent upon the import of television sets, it would cost our country a tremendous amount in foreign exchange&#x2014; probably between R80 million and R100 million per year for the first few years. Therefore I want to advocate, firstly, that very strict control be exercised over the import of sets and, secondly, that very sympathetic encouragement be given to the manufacturing of the local product. Possibly the hon. the Minister will be in a position to inform this Committee about steps which his department is planning to encourage the establishment of a television industry in South Africa. I believe that the establishment of such an industry would start up many supplementary activities in the public and private sectors in our national economy. As far as the public <span class="col_7557-7558" refersTo="page_0733"/>sector is concerned, the Post Office would undoubtedly be compelled, for example, to extend its microwave system even further and, in particular, to erect a ground station for the satellite transmission and receiving of TV programme. While I am speaking about satellites, Sir, it would be interesting to know, although I do not think this matter relates to the Minister, to what extent we will make use of satellites, since the beaming distance with respect to a television set is about 60 miles and problems will therefore be experienced in our country with its wide reaches. According to newspaper reports, it is calculated that in the first year about 130 000 monochrome and colour sets will be needed; in the second year about 140 000 sets will be needed and in the third year about 210 000 sets, and that over-all sales in the first five years will exceed 500 000 sets, which will yield an over-all amount of R500 million. That is a great deal of money, Sir, but I have only obtained this figure from a newspaper report, and I do not know how reliable that is. I should like to know whether the Minister and his department can make any accurate estimates in advance. It nevertheless would appear from this that the manufacture of television sets can develop into a tremendously comprehensive industry in South Africa. What already appears to be essential is that careful attention be given to planned and scientific research so that the industry can rest on proper scientific foundations. The sound establishment of a television manufacturing industry can inevitably lead to tremendous technological development and can serve as a stimulus for the establishment of an electronics industry, a facet which has perhaps not yet received quite enough attention in our industry. There are some of our industrial cities that complain that the industrial areas, which have border area benefits, are drawing the industries. If we have an electronics industry, established, it will be labour-intensive, and this can again give new life to our existing industrial cities which are perhaps on the decline.</p>

<p>Sir, in conclusion I want to ask whether it is correct, as Press reports indicate, that black and white sets will also be manufactured. I have the utmost sympathy for people with small salaries who could possibly not afford the more expensive colour sets. But according to what I have personally seen in Europe, it does seem to me that the black and white sets are on the way out, and I am just wondering whether it would not be a question of buying more expensively if one also makes the black and white sets available, because it is frequently the people with the small salaries that have the biggest radiograms and similar items, and I do not know whether they would not simply buy the black and White sets provisionally and then trade them in for colour sets after a year. Sir, I am asking these questions because we are still groping around in the dark, to a certain extent, with respect to this matter.</p>

<p>In addition I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether a decision is going to be taken on the standardization of television sets. I want to advocate that we do not make the same mistake, when we start out in this industry, that we made with our motor cars, with the result that one has 101 different types of motor cars, a situation that entails great financial expense. In conclusion I should like to know whether provision will be made for reasonable hire purchase conditions for television sets. It is probably important, particularly if black and white sets are not being made available. But personally I doubt whether it would be sensible to import black and white sets, but I am no authority in that field. But I believe that if colour sets are made available, and reasonable hire purchase conditions are allowed, everyone will eventually be able to afford the colour sets.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>I ask the hon. member for Algoa to forgive me if I do not react directly to his speech, because I want to deal in just a few words with a product which is not as foul-smelling as rotten fish nor as sweet-smelling as fresh fish. I want to refer briefly to an extremely uneconomic practice followed by the Department of Economic Affairs. In reply to a question put by me to the Minister, he said it cost his department approximately R96 per ton to collect guano on the islands off our coast. This guano was then sold to our farmers at a price of R47 per ton. In other words, the State suffers a loss of R49 per ton. The figures for 1971 are not available as yet, but the loss on the sale of guano during 1970 is calculated at R127 000. Nobody in this House can congratulate the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs on such a transaction. No matter how keen we are to help our farmers along, no business concern can afford to sell its product at a loss of approximately R49 per ton. But this is not the worst of it. <span class="col_7559-7560" refersTo="page_0734"/>Apparently the Minister is not satisfied yet. His department also pays an additional subsidy of R2,26 per ton to the farmer for every ton of guano he buys. It is clear, therefore, that the taxpayer subsidises the farmer by approximately R53 per ton for this guano. Now, it is common knowledge that guano is a highly sought-after fertilizer. The gardeners of our country would very much like to use it too, and the same goes for our nurserymen, but what do we find? To the man in the street this is almost unobtainable. The man in the street has to subsidize the farmer, but he himself cannot buy it. To the man in the street guano is taboo. It is as clear as crystal that if the Minister were to permit the consumer trade to distribute the guano, or if it could be made available to the man in the street in retail quantities, the Government could easily sell this guano, not at a price of R50 per ton nor of R100 per ton, but probably at R150 per ton. This is the kind of economy which the taxpayer of South Africa does not understand at all. Now I wonder whether the Minister will agree that as the Minister of Economic Affairs he simply cannot afford to proceed with such an uneconomic policy. Therefore my request to the Minister is that he will ensure that the guano will not be sold to our farmers at much less than it approximately costs the Government to supply it. If not, the man in the street should also be permitted to buy smaller quantities at economic prices so that he may also grow vegetables in his own garden, and in that manner it may help to bring down his high cost of living to a certain extent.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In the few moments remaining to me, I also want to refer to the Steenkamp report on co-operative societies, dated 1967. I merely want to enquire from the hon. the Minister if it is his intention to react to this report in the foreseeable future, in particular in respect to certain aspects where the trader&#x2014;very often the small trader in the country&#x2014;feels that he is at a disadvantage in relation to the cooperative society in certain co-operative practices. *</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member must excuse me if I do not venture into the field of guano. However, I should like to come back to that matter which the hon. member calls the &#x201C;economic affair&#x201D;. I do not know to which affair he is referring, but I should also like to come back to that &#x201C;economic affair&#x201D;. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central today launched a very serious plea for St. Croix. I want to tell hon. members that we recently had the privilege of paying a visit to Sishen. We also paid a visit to Saldanha, with a view to possible development there. In expressing myself about this matter today, I am merely doing so objectively, because I am perhaps in the privileged position of representing a constituency where we already have a steel industry. My constituency&#x2019;s problem is actually that the development there is perhaps too rapid. For that reason I can speak objectively about this matter. As the hon. member put it here, St. Croix will only be able to handle ships of 150 000 tons in future. As I have said, we had the privilege of paying a visit to Saldanha. We also had the privilege of paying a visit to the C.S.I.R., which has a model of the Saldanha harbour and where research is being done in that connection. There is not only the research which the C.S.I.R. has done, but some of the best consultants have also been approached. It is very clear to us that Saldanha offers possibilities for much larger ships than the 150 000 tonners which the hon. member spoke about. With today&#x2019;s modern developments, with the shipping and transport problems, it is of course much cheaper if one can make use of ships with a larger tonnage. I think that in that respect Saldanha lends itself far more to a harbour that can be used for the exporting of ore. As has been proved, Saldanha will also be able to handle ships of 250 000 tons in future. Those ships can be properly brought into the harbour; they can be handled and loaded in such a way that they can also tackle the open sea without too many problems. When inquiries were made about weather conditions, it was proved, it is true, that this could create problems for the big ships, but it was also proved that in the course of a year there would be very few days on which problems would be experienced in bringing large ships into the harbour. I think this is not only a question of the development of the Saldanha harbour. because that harbour can also be converted into a bigger harbour than all the harbours in South Africa. Saldanha Bay lends itself to being developed into a much bigger harbour than Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Mossel Bay and Durban put together. Another reason why it is very important for the project to be developed, is the opening up of the entire North <span class="col_7561-7562" refersTo="page_0735"/>Western Cape. Since not only ore, but also other minerals lie hidden still in the North West, one would be creating an opportunity there for the opening up of the entire north western areas. This will also entail the possibility of creating employment opportunities for people of that area. I am thinking in particular of the greater utilization of the Coloured labour. As far as I am concerned, the only question is whether the iron ore should be shipped and disposed of in ore form or whether the iron ore should not be exported as semi-manufactured products, &#x201C;billets&#x201D;, &#x201C;blooms&#x201D; or &#x201C;slabs&#x201D; as we call them. The Minister rightly said that this could bring much more foreign exchange into the country for us. However, it is a question that will have to be investigated. The only question I want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether it is reasonable for Iscor alone to incur that tremendous capital expenditure for the development of so large a project. I think in all humility that as far as that is concerned, the State should contribute its rightful share to the development. So much for the Saldanha project.</p>

<p>I want to come to another matter which I think affects the general public very acutely. It concerns the motor industry, the garages and the quality of the service which the motor car owners obtain in South Africa today. With all due respect I think that the quality of the service we obtain from our garages is certainly of the poorest in the world. Here I do not want to level accusations at all the garages, but the simple fact of the matter is that the service we get from the majority of them is extremely poor and the public is exploited on a large scale. What it amounts to is that when the car is serviced and is then returned because this was not done satisfactorily in the first place, the public must repeatedly pay for the same service.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to new vehicles. A service is performed which is known as the &#x201C;pre-delivery&#x201D; service. The agent, who is the representative of the relevant article, is supplied with a certain sum of money by the manufacturers to furnish certain services prior to delivery. I do not believe that that service to the vehicles is done properly. Cars are sent from the factories to various distributors, and under such circumstances the distributors are supposed to check such a car properly for the remuneration they receive for that purpose from the manufacturer. I believe there are hon. members who have personal experience of the circumstances to which I want to refer. I have clippings in connection with a case where a person bought a car in Witbank, for example. The car had covered only 100 or 200 miles before it was brought to the Cape. Here some defect or other was found in the car and it was brought to the local agents of the same article. To get rid of the person concerned the repair work was done by the Cape agents after a fashion. If the car is still covered by the 6 000 mile guarantee the local agent tells one that one should simply pay the account and that one can recover the amount at a later stage from the garage owner from whom the car was originally purchased. I ask whether this is being reasonable. One can never get to the right place and person. And so that burden is simply placed on the purchaser of the vehicle again.</p>

<p>I myself have had that experience. I bought a vehicle, and after 6 000 miles I saw that the tyres were wearing down fairly unevenly. I then took the car back to the garage where I had bought it from. I asked them whether the wheel alignment was correct and the wheels had been balanced. I was informed that the wheel alignment was correct and that the wheels had been balanced. After 9 000 miles the tyres were in such a condition that I had to throw them away. I took the tyres back to the garage and I was then informed that there was something wrong with the rubber; the rubber was of a poor quality. I was then advised to consult Firestone in Johannesburg. I took all the trouble and went to consult Firestone in Johannesburg. There I was informed that there was nothing wrong with the rubber and that there was a mechanical fault in the vehicle. That is how one is sent around from one place to another. But when one buys a motor vehicle from a garage, one does not buy the tyres from Firestone, the battery from Willard and the hooter from Bosch. One buys the vehicle at Leon Motors or at Currie Motors. I really think the time has come for the motor vehicle owner to have greater protection.</p>

<p>As far as repair services are concerned the position is the same. I ask whether the time has not come for garages to be classified like hotels, so that certain requirements must be met. The mechanics should for example, be in possession of certain qualifications so that it is not simply a matter <span class="col_7563-7564" refersTo="page_0736"/>of anyone lifting the bonnet and pottering around in the engine. When one gets the car back, believing it has been repaired, one finds, for example, that the lights still do not work, and if they have been repaired one finds that now the hooter does not work any more. So it goes. I really think that the time has come for us to grant protection to the motor car owner.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come to another subject altogether, and I am sure that the hon. member who has just sat down, will forgive me for not following his line of thought. I want to come to the question of oil pollution and the danger to our seaside resorts as well as to our territorial waters. In this connection I will touch upon the question of the breakdown of responsibility for dealing with oil slicks or oil spillage. Over the past 3 or 4 years&#x2014;and I am now referring particularly to my own province, Natal&#x2014;a committee has been established and meetings have taken place in that province under the chairmanship of one of the MECs, Mr. Archibald, now Mr. Watterson, for the purpose of dealing with oil slicks when the oil comes ashore. Various measures have been debated and discussed with a view to dealing with that particular problem of oil pollution on our beaches when the oil comes ashore under circumstances which bring it under the jurisdiction of that particular committee. But there are times when it comes ashore in the area of a local authority. Then the local authority has to deal with it, that is when it is in the form of a small slick. Here at once I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that the present arrangement is completely unsatisfactory because there are no definitions. There is no definition as to what a small slick and what is a big spillage. I want to point out how impractical it is to have a system whereby a dividing line is established between the control of oil spillage by the department as opposed to control and modification by the committee or a local authority. That dividing line is the difference between the water and the dry land. I want to bring it to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention because this has been going on for some years. With everyday that passes we are running the risk that the law of averages is going to bring us a major disaster on our coast. This is not the first time that this matter has been raised. In this connection I think of the <i>World Glory</i>, the <i>Tigres</i> at the entrance to Durban harbour the other day, the <i>Silver Castle</i> and the <i>Wafra</i>. We have missed a major disaster by the narrowest margin in every one of those cases. But, Sir, it cannot go on forever. One million tons of oil per 24 hours goes round our coast. It is inevitable; it is coming. Now, Sir, I say that this dividing line between the edge of the water and dry land is a completely impractical dividing line. You may have a big oil slick coming ashore. The committee with its people and all the forces which it can command&#x2014;and they are very small&#x2014;must sit on the beach supine, with their hands folded. They cannot touch that oil slick because it is on the water. It belongs to the department. But when once that oil is washed upon the beach, then they can get stuck into it to clear it up. I am sorry, but this is not reasonable. We have no grounds whatsoever for calling ourselves <i>homo sapiens</i> when we allow a thing like that to happen. Surely, the place to stop the pollution of the beach is while the oil is on the water. It is true that under certain circumstances the department will do its best to deal with that slick whilst it is on the water. That is particularly the case, for example, with the offshore mooring buoy, near Durban. There they have a boat stationed with supplies of detergents and dispersants all ready and handy because they know that is a place where the spillage is continually taking place. That is why they are ready to handle it at this particular place. But a wrecked ship or a ship that breaks apart does not first give warning and say: I am going to do it off the Port of Durban or near Port Elizabeth, Algoa or near Cape Town. That is not known; it is just one of those things that happens. That is what it is so unfair about asking a local authority to bear the cost of an oil pollution when spillage comes ashore as though it was responsible for that spillage. This is the work of fate. A local authority is not responsible for the cost of washing its beaches and cleaning up the mess&#x2014;it is a shocking thing to try and clean up&#x2014;merely because it has come ashore from a certain spillage which fact decreed should be opposite that particular local authority. Durban can have a big spillage which could pollute its beaches but that is the chance of fate. That ship may just as easily have broken up down here in Cape waters and affected one of the beaches of the Cape sea-side resorts. It is by chance that it goes ashore or that it breaks up opposite Durban. Why should Durban have to carry the costs? Durban <span class="col_7565-7566" refersTo="page_0737"/>makes no profit if that ship doesn&#x2019;t break up. It is a national profit and a national undertaking. It is up to our national economy to see that we get our oil to our shores safely. If something goes wrong with it, and the profit belongs to the nation in the event of success, then in the event of disaster the nation must carry the responsibility. It is surely most unfair that the responsibility should be carried by the local authority in whose in-shore waters a disaster may take place, when the oil is on the beach. Again I ask what the difference between a major spillage and a minor spillage is. Nobody knows; it is not defined. Here we have a lack of definition.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that one of the problems we have to deal with here is the question of the ships that come into our waters which are oil carriers, the big oil tankers that come into our waters. The time to prevent spillage is before a tanker gets into territorial waters. Let them have their spillages out at sea if they want to have them. Once you have a tanker in your territorial waters and spillage takes place, you are in trouble, because you already have the oil spill on your in-shore waters. This year particularly I have flown up and down from Durban over and over again. I can assure the Committee that we had in some cases up to four tankers inside our territorial waters at any one moment. This could be seen from the aircraft when visibility was such that one could see what was going on down below on the sea. I think I am not missing my guess when I say that one in five is trailing a more or less serious trail of oil. It may be a very small quantity of oil, it may be washing out of its tanks, or anything else. There are a lot of excuses and reasons put up. But what is the net result of this for South Africa? This is not a matter for this province, or that town, but a South African matter. What it means is that the accumulative effect of all those small spillages is building up against our shores. We still do not know what the ocean currents are doing with that oil. and I want to say at once that I am not going into the question of the damage that is done to our marine ecology by using dispersants on oil slicks. It is accepted the whole world over, and in America this practice is barred in some places. They will not allow dispersants to be used on oil slicks because of the damage that is done to the under-sea marine biology. I rule this factor out and simply say that I hope that everybody who has given any thought to this matter and has done any reading on this subject, will come to the conclusion that we have to stop dealing with oil spillage by means of dispersants on the surface. That goes for the big off-shore mooring-buoy outside Durban as well. It goes for that the same as for any other spillage that takes place. There are other means of dealing with this problem, and these other means have to be used.</p>

<p>There are developments that are taking place in the scientific world at the present time and we can learn the lessons that come to us from other people. It is there in the papers. We know what is happening elsewhere. We know what is happening in America and we know what is happening in Great Britain. These spillages have to be dealt with in a different fashion, and I want to come back to my point that you only have a spillage to deal with if you allow these ships to come into your waters. In regard to that, I think that we have to adopt a new approach altogether. We cannot have aircraft and naval vessels tailing tankers around our coasts to sea if they obey the law, that they do not infringe the provisions of the law which we have passed to punish wrongdoers. In practice that is quite impossible. There are too many ships, they travel by night and do all sorts of things under cover of darkness, and they cannot be identified. There is one thing we can do, however. We can go along the line of insurance. I have found that the tankers that pass our coasts in fact come under two different sets of insurance. I see the hon. the Minister nods his head, and I am glad. No doubt he is well informed on this subject. I will be surprised if he is not, because he has some very well informed officials who can give him information. I think we can deal with these ships through insurance. Unless a ship is carrying, and for want of a better term I will say, a general insurance&#x2014;not merely a third party like a motor-car&#x2014;we should not allow that ship to enter our territorial waters. The ship that only carries third-party cover should be told to stay out of our territorial waters and must not be allowed in. They must be told that they are not adequately covered by insurance and are therefore a risk which this country cannot afford to carry. We do not want to quarrel with the international interests and we do not want to quarrel with other countries. We try to be friends with countries <span class="col_7567-7568" refersTo="page_0738"/>overseas. We do not want to do something that is going to blacken our name, so far as overseas countries are concerned, but we are perfectly entitled to say that if a ship cannot get adequate insurance to satisfy the demands of our own department here in South Africa, then that ship cannot come into the South African territorial waters.</p>

<p>Too many of these ships that are having accidents are flying flags of convenience. Why are they sailing under flags of convenience? Why do various big, financially very, very strong corporations in other countries run their ships under flags of convenience? It is because those ships are being run as cheaply as they possibly can. They are badly constructed, badly manned, and running on as cheap a shoestring as they possibly can to compete in this oilcarrying business. We allow those ships to come into our waters; and around the world, as well as around the South African coast, you see case after case where a ship flying a flag of convenience has broken in mid-ocean, run ashore, had a collision, or what-would-you.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the matter raised by the hon. member for South Coast is a very important one. I am convinced that the hon. the Minister would like to avail himself of the opportunity to react fully to that. Consequently it is not my intention to take the hon. member&#x2019;s argument further, but I think today is a suitable opportunity to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to the department, and especially to Mr. Japie Venter for his actions in regard to and handling of a few matters in recent times, matters which in actual fact could have proved disastrous to our shores if quick and effective action had not been taken. Therefore I think it is fitting for us to pay tribute to Mr. Venter for his positive action in having prevented possible disasters in this regard.</p>

<p>I also want to associate myself with the argument which my friend the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark advanced in respect of the motor industry. Last year we dealt with certain aspects. I do not indend to go into them again on this occasion, but there is nevertheless a matter I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister, and that is the question of the transportation of new motor vehicles from the assembly plants to the various distribution points in the interior. I want to refer in particular to the long convoys of new motor-cars which are brought by road from the assembly plant to the distribution point. Owners of new vehicles are complaining more and more that they are having engine trouble at a very early stage in the life of those motor vehicles. When the matter is investigated, it is found that this trouble is largely due to the high speed at which these vehicles are driven from the assembly plants to the distribution points. I really think the time has arrived for consideration to be given to having the distributor of a vehicle indicate along which route that vehicle was transported and brought to that distribution point.</p>

<p>I should also very much like to refer to another aspect. Earlier this afternoon the hon. the Minister went into the question of price control very thoroughly. Now, I do not want to return to the whole question of price control, but at this state, in the first instance, I want to express my appreciation on behalf of my constituency to the Price Controller, who has been so kind as to instruct the price supervisor at Springs to keep his eyes open for unjustified price increases. I want to assure the hon. the Minister that, on our part, we call on the buying public to report such price increases immediately.</p>
