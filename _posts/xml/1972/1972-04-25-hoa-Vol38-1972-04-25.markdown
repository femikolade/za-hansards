<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from> 

<p>Yesterday evening the hon. member for Odendaalsrus expressed his appreciation to the Minister and the Mealie Board for the way in which they are handling the maize industry in South Africa. He also expressed his appreciation for the new maize price, which makes provision for the fact that the farmer&#x2019;s price is decreasing by 13 cents, despite the fact that the production costs have increased tremendously, while the consumer price has also increased; i.e. the gap has widened. There is now a difference of 33 cents. Sir, this song of praise was strange, coming as it did from a previous director of Sampi, who wanted to move heaven and earth to have the maize price improved and to destroy the Mealie Board as such. But the hon. member is a maize farmer; he represents the maize farmers, and I shall leave him to the maize farmers of his constituency, leaving them to decide whether he was right when he was a director of Sampi or whether he is now right in being so thankful.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am sorry. I do not have the time. But I want to come to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Yesterday evening, when the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City advocated that milk should be supplied to the chain stores at wholesale prices so that they can distribute it in the cheapest way possible, the answer from the hon. the Deputy Minister was that the small shopkeeper must also be taken into account. Sir, that is our difficulty. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s duty ought to be to keep the price gap between the producer and the consumer as narrow as possible, but here all kinds of other considerations intrude, for example the shopkeeper must now also be protected.</p>

<p>Do you want to create a monopoly&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister speaks of creating a monopoly, but the milk distributors have the monopoly. That is what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City advocated, asking whether the Minister was going to allow that monopoly of the milk distributors to be broken, but then the Minister said the shopkeepers must be protected. Does he now think he is the Minister of shopkeepers in South Africa&#x003F; He is surely the Minister of Agriculture and must surely look after the interests of agriculture. On this side of the House we are continually advocating that the price gap between the producer and the consumer be narrowed.</p>

<p>Let us take meat as an example. Yesterday the hon. the Minister announced a new meat scheme. We hope this is for the best. I have already mentioned in this House how the butcher in South Africa exploits the producer and the consumer. I mentioned the figures indicating that there are 5 800 butchers in South Africa and that on the average they handle only six carcasses per day. As far as the question of meat marketing is concerned, if the Minister would allow decentralized abattoirs to be erected in the rural areas, and the necessary refrigeration trucks are supplied and one can have those meat factories selling the cuts directly to the chain stores, one can obtain a much cheaper distribution. But every butcher in South Africa has invested a tremendous amount of money in machinery, cold storage facilities <span class="col_5693-5694" refersTo="page_1310"/>and the premises he must rent, some of which cost up to R1 500 per month and must be maintained; this must come out of the pocket of the consumer and the fanner. But if one is prepared to have free distribution, knowing full well that every chain store has a refrigeration unit and can obtain those cuts direct from the factory and distribute them directly, we can thereby make the meat much cheaper for the consumer. There will consequently be a much greater consumption of meat with a better price for the farmer.</p>

<p>When the hon. members for Mooi River and Pietermaritzburg City lodged pleas for the milk farmer, the Minister asked whether all products should now be subsidized. I now want to state very clearly here that our answer on this side of the House is that one cannot make a better investment than the subsidizing of food in South Africa. If one had a well-fed population in South Africa, as a result of the subsidizing of food, one would not have the wage demands one does have.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Here R41 million per year is being spent on health. If one had a well-fed population, particularly amongst the non-Whites, one could cut out many of those costs. R9,5 million is being spent here on tuberculosis. If one could supply milk to these people at a cheaper price&#x2014;one could even reintroduce the milk scheme which existed under the United Party Government to give milk to the schools. There is now talk here of surpluses. The Minister spoke of the difficulties the farmers have as a result of the climatic conditions in South Africa. One year one has a surplus and the next year one again does not know what to do with the surpluses. I am saying they must be thankful that those surpluses are there. Those surpluses can be assimilated. They can be assimilated through the schools. They can be distributed amongst the people and thereby the price that must be paid for those products can be greatly reduced. Thereby the people can be kept in a well-fed condition.</p>

<p>I want to mention another aspect of the matter. R24 million per year is being spent on pensions for Coloureds alone. This includes, <i>inter alia,</i> R6 million per year in maintenance and foster-parent allowances. It is quite right that we should care for</p>

<p>those aged. I want to raise a point here which I hope will not be misconstrued. I say that an inquiry must be instituted into the misuse of these pensions, particularly in the rural districts. In the rural districts today we find that young people are living on those old people&#x2019;s pensions.</p>

<p>I want to come back to this matter of subsidies. Subsidies are being discussed at great length. The farmer is always being reproached as far as subsidies are concerned. What I am saying is that the subsidy the South African farmer obtains is a meagre one. There are very few subsidies that are paid out directly to the farmer.</p>

<p>I want to come back to subsidies. The South African farmer is criticized for the total of R35 million in subsidies on maize products. This is surely not a subsidy to the South African farmer; it is surely a consumer subsidy.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister asked clearly whether we must subsidize all these products. I am mentioning this because the South African farmer is being blamed each time. Even the hon, the Minister asked me the other day:&#x201C;What about the subsidies the farmer gets&#x003F;&#x201D; However, when the other industries in South Africa are subsidized, that is of no <span class="col_5695-5696" refersTo="page_1311"/>consequence. What is import control and what are import tariffs other than a method by which the industries of South Africa are subsidized&#x003F; To give you an idea of the problems the South African farmer has to cope with, Sir, I am taking the question of bags as an example. The maize price which the producer receives, had to be decreased, but what about the price of his bags&#x003F; I think that today he pays up to 52 cents for a bag. What is the position&#x003F; I do not know what the position is as far as bags are concerned, and that is why I recently asked a question about that. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is very interesting that the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town has mentioned this story of the subsidies, professing that in reality the farmers obtain a meagre subsidy. In the meantime, of course, they are continually suggesting in the rural areas that higher subsidies should be paid to the farmers. This is completely at odds with what other hon. members opposite have told the urbanites. It is also at odds with what his candidate in Brakpan said about the subsidizing of agriculture, which allegedly takes place at the expense of the consumer.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to an aspect set out by the hon. Opposition on the other side, and to a feeling which emanates from their ranks. The hon. members create the impression that agriculture is a very hazardous industry. I was always under the impression that the mining industry is the most hazardous industry in South Africa&#x2019;s national economy, but after having listened to all the lamentations emanating from the opposite side, I have come to the conclusion that agriculture is much more hazardous than the mining industry, notwithstanding subsidization by the State. I want to say that the Opposition is doing agriculture no service by making farming a jeremiad of lamentations. We are making the farmer increasingly dependent on the State, and eventually we reach the stage where the farmer, as the backbone of the country, is completely eliminated. One must always adhere to the philosophy that the man who is governed must remain the governor of those who govern. According to the philosophy being expounded here, one finds that the farmer is becoming increasingly subject to State control.</p>

<p>With the present trend of the curtailment of State expenditure, it came as a surprise to me that under the South-West Africa account a larger amount was voted under the &#x201C;Agricultural Technical Services&#x201D; Vote than last year. I am glad to see that there is no reduction in the expenditure, but in fact a slight increase. The agricultural community of South-West Africa is grateful to the hon. the Minister and his department for having made this concession. I notice that, in comparison with last year&#x2019;s expenditure, the amounts being voted this year under various subheads have been increased quite considerably. I want to mention the amount of R2 574 000 for the past fiscal year, as against the amount of R3 257 900 that has been voted for the coming financial year. For veterinary work alone R1 878 000 was voted for the past financial year, while for the coming financial year an amount of R2 094 000 has been voted. As far as I am concerned these larger amounts are proof of the seriousness with which the hon. the Minister and his department regard the combatting of stock diseases in agriculture. What applies to South-West Africa, in this connection, applies also to the Republic, because I notice that the amount voted in respect of agricultural technical services exceeds that of the previous year by almost R7 million. I notice that the amount voted for trigonometric, cadastral and other surveys, in the case of the Republic, is less than that of last year, while that in South-West Africa is the same as that of last year.</p>

<p>This brings me to an aspect which has not been mentioned under this Vote to date. I am referring to the question of aerial photographs made available to the public by the Surveys Division and the security measures involved in this. This also applies to maps in this connection. It is a fundamental requirement for a developing country that accurate maps must be available for various departments and for the national economy. No department can, in actual fact, work without them. I am interested in the mining industry, and I find that this industry, in particular, needs quite a number of these maps for its mineral exploration work. We find that here we have quite a bit of red tape in respect of the security aspects when it comes to these maps and aerial photographs being made available. In my opinion there is quite a bit of unnecessary delay involved in this. It costs quite a bit to produce these maps. What is happening is that the bodies needing these maps and aerial photographs incur the same costs the State incurred in having these maps and photographs made <span class="col_5697-5698" refersTo="page_1312"/>on their own initiative; duplication is therefore taking place. They take their own aerial photographs and produce their own maps and then proceed from there, without any delay, in carrying out their exploration work. There could have been a saving, in respect of those costs, if the State would make those photographs and maps available more quickly. Of course, eventually they are made available. There is no doubt about that. I want to mention another example: In South-West Africa a firm is at present engaged in the erection of electricity transmission lines from Windhoek as part of the Kunene scheme. These lines will form a network over the northern part of South-West Africa. That body is working with inferior maps while the department concerned has better and more accurate maps in its possession. We find that a great deal of trouble has to be taken, in the absence of accurate maps, when it comes to laying out these transmission lines. In my opinion this is really unnecessary. In fact, in this modern century we are living in, accurate aerial photographs of South-West Africa and the whole of Southern Africa, are being taken from the satellites circling the earth. With the aid of these photographs accurate maps are drawn and these maps or aerial photographs are for sale at cartographic institutions in Houston, Texas. If these maps are available elsewhere in the world, these security measures, which can retard the development of the country to a certain extent, are in my opinion quite unnecessary. Procedure apparently dictates that one has to obtain either a permit or permission, and that one must reveal one&#x2019;s <i>bona fides</i> before one can obtain such a map. When such a map is eventually obtained after three or four months, one can imagine how much manpower is being wasted by the relevant body that must do that work.</p>

<p>In this connection I should also just like to refer to certain contrasting statements sometimes made by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the Department of Transport. The Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing states that the export of cattle in South-West Africa is being restricted by the Department of Transport because inadequate transport facilities are being made available.

<p>If one looks at all the arguments the United Party used in the debate about this Vote, and one then looks at <i>Die Afrikaner</i> of 31st March, one sees that the arguments advanced by the United Party to discredit agriculture in South Africa are precisely the same arguments the Hertzog Party is using. I therefore unquestionably want to link up the two parties as blood relations. There is fraternization between these two parties to discredit agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>That is so. I challenge the Opposition to compare their Hansard speeches and <i>Die Afrikaner</i> of 31st March. All the arguments are exactly the same. In this country the Opposition is continually engaged in discrediting agriculture. From day to day they are discrediting the farmers of this country, the control boards and also the prices of their products. These people may continue in this vein; we on the National Party side know that here we have Ministers of Agriculture who sometimes have to encourage the farmers under very difficult circumstances. If that party were to come into power, with that hon. shadow Minister as Minister of Agriculture, in this country there would not be a single farmer who would be able to keep up his courage because of the standpoint of that party. Talk centres only on the failures in agriculture, and on nothing else. We on this side also like talking about the successes. I have here, for example, a photograph of a farmer who bought a farm from another farmer who had to sell. It is the farm of a certain Mr. Grobler of Karrookom, Vierfontein. This man is well known to me. He began from the bottom. Indeed, as often happens in South Africa <span class="col_5699-5700" refersTo="page_1313"/>when someone has to sell his farm, in this case it was also a farmer who made a bid for that farm and bought it for R285 000. When he was asked about the payment, he said that he would tremble a little, but that he would nevertheless be able to write out the cheque. We on this side of the House would like to try to hold up such success stories to our fellow farmers and our children who have to succeed us. However, on the opposite side of the House the efforts of farmers are only discredited. The hon. member for Mooi River tried to make a big issue of credit in agriculture. He said that the Land Bank cannot help him in his constituency. I just want to say that in my constituency last year, from 1st January to 31st December, 65 farmers bought land and obtained R1 701 000 from the Land Bank. I am glad of this, and glad of the fact that we have people in agriculture who are not dispirited. I just want to tell the hon. member for Mooi River that if he cannot obtain money for the people in his constituency, he is probably not doing his duty.</p>

<p>While I am speaking about the Land Bank. I just want to mention one aspect. In 1971 25 530 mortgagors, or 91 per cent of those involved with the Land Bank, were insured for R304 million. This is something that has never been mentioned by the United Party. Since the inception of this mortgage insurance scheme. R30 million has already been paid out to the farmers of South Africa. This is not the only insurance the farmers have. Why does the United Party not also speak about these things that are done by this side of the House to help our farmers in respect of the debt they have, a position which is merely exploited all the time by the United Party&#x003F; These people only want to belittle agriculture at all times. Our Government has always had confidence in the farmer. On this side of the House there are about 50 farmers who represent farming constituencies, more than the total number of Opposition members. This agricultural debate is going to last for nine hours. There is not a single other debate held in this House of Assembly that lasts for nine hours. The one that comes nearest to it is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote of 7&#x00BE; hours, thereafter Bantu Administration of 7&#x00BD; hours, while the other Votes only take up a maximum of four hours each.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have full confidence in the farmers of South Africa, and the farmers have full confidence in us. But, Sir, I want to show up the ambiguity of the opposite side of the House in respect of prices and other matters, which I shall come to very shortly. On occasion the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke about the re-demarcation of constituencies with respect to their loading and deloading. I should very much like to know from the hon. member for Newton Park if he agrees with them that when they demarcate constituencies in future they are going to do away with the loading of the farming constituencies. They are the people who court the farmer&#x2019;s vote while adopting the very strong standpoint that their power, not only economic, but also political, is vested in the cities.</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>It is necessary for the farmers of South Africa to take note of this policy of the United Party, i.e. that with a future demarcation, if they were to be in power, this loading and deloading would be removed from the Electoral Acts. But I want to come back to the ambiguity of the United Party. The hon. member for Newton Park said:</p>

<block name="quote">We say that if the farmer&#x2019;s production costs rise, he must obtain an improved price. But if that difference that has to be given to the farmer causes the consumer price to rise, it must not be done, unless the consumer is subsidized.</block>

<p>Sir, in thinking of this year&#x2019;s maize price I firstly want to thank our Government very much for this abnormally large amount being given to the maize industry this year. This subsidy cuts both ways: it is beneficial to the consumer, but also beneficial to the farmer.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City was a little more approachable. He said :</p>

<block name="quote">Because the price of maize has dropped a little there is great dissatisfaction. But it is not possible always to keep the prices high if you are dealing with a great export commodity such as maize.</block>

<p>But the hon. member for Newton Park, the shadow Minister, just wants to increase the prices all the time.</p>

<p>From the back there the hon. member speaks about rising costs, the hon. member who wants to relinquish his Afrikanerhood. The actual price rise this year in the maize industry was 12,9 cents per bag. But our yield increase evidenced a difference of 15,3 cents per bag. This has resulted, this year, in our having a decrease in production costs of 2,4 cents per bag. Is the hon. member for Newton Park also going to include this increased yield per morgen in his calculations when he wants to determine the maize price&#x003F; No, Sir, these hon. members tell us one thing, but they do another.</p>

<p>I should like to take a slightly closer look at the maize industry. Since 1948 the number of morgen given to the cultivation of maize has doubled, i.e. from 3 million morgen to 6 million morgen. The total yield increased from 18,2 million bags to, it is hoped, 113,2 million bags this year, i.e. six times more than in those days. Our yield per morgen has increased from 5,5 bags per morgen in 1948 to 18,04 bags in 1972. The producer price was R2-20 in 1948, when the United Party was in power. Today the net producer price is 351,5 cents. In those years the consumer price was R2-021; this year it is, calculated on an average basis for white and yellow, about R3-85&#x2014;almost twice as much. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>We shall be watching the position. If he is suggesting that politics comes above competence of the Land Bank officials in deciding on the merits of cases, then we shall want to know a lot more about what is going on.</p>

<p>He also made mention of the fact that our two Ministers of Agriculture, the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister, can be tested by their deeds. I want to test them this afternoon. We have had two hon. members from South-West Africa enter this debate. I was surprised to hear that neither of them dealt in any meaningful way with the most important thing that has happened in South-West African agriculture in the past year. The hon. member for Etosha talked about aerial surveys and the hon. member for Karas, in fairness to him, did express his sympathy, even at this late stage, for the farmers of the Hardap irrigation settlement who have suffered through the floods that have taken place there. As we all know these floods occurred in the middle of March. Perhaps we should have heard something from the hon. member who should have been most concerned with what was going on there, namely the hon. member for Marienthal.</p>

<p>I know an awful lot. I want to make one thing clear to these hon. members. As long as hon. members on that side of the House do not do their duty in their respective constituencies we shall do it for them. I want to suggest that what we need from that side of the House is rather more than sympathy. What we first want are signs of action and what we also demand are some answers to very material questions connected with the flooding that occurred at Hardap.</p>

<p>Let us turn to these questions first. The particulars I want to give the House were only established through questions in this House. It is common cause that the Hardap irrigation settlement was planned and laid out long after the first warnings had been given officially by the Administration in South-West Africa that this area lay in a flood belt. The first warning was given to the Marienthal Municipality according to answers given to me by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, on the 21st September, <span class="col_5703-5704" refersTo="page_1315"/>1953, i.e. nearly 19 years ago. A further warning was given on the 23rd July, 1965, nearly seven years ago. Yet the irrigation settlement at Hardap was planned and laid out long after the first warnings had been given. Then, Sir&#x2014;and here again I am indebted to the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs&#x2014;we know that since 1966, which is six years ago, there has been planning for flood protection works in the area. I refer to a reply given to me by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs a few weeks ago in this House. He then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since 1966 planning for flood protection works at Marienthal started and this is being considered in conjunction with road approaches to the town. The planning &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is six years later&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is far advanced and a decision as to whether such works will be economic and what works can be built is expected within 12 months.</block>

<p>In 12 months&#x2019; time it will be seven years since they first started looking at the threat of flood damage.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>I am entitled to know as a member of this House. You see, Sir, I appreciate that the floods came too late for any provision to be made in the current Estimates, although there is provision for an amount of R500 which is the same as last year, for distress relief and other financial aid to Hardap settlers. But this obviously is going to provide for a very small proportion of the actual damage caused. What we have tended to see on the part of the Administration is the dragging of feet when it comes to seeing what has to be done. I should have expected by now that in an event of this magnitude a statement would have been made to this House about the damage caused and what is going to be done about it. We had it in the case of the floods at East London and Port Elizabeth. What is wrong with South-West Africa; what is wrong with Marienthal&#x003F; Why should they be neglected in this manner&#x003F; What we want to know is what assessment is being made of the damage, what is required to be done, how much it is going to cost and when we are going to see the rehabilitation of the farmers. It is quite clear to those who know the area that the main damage that has been caused has been to low-lying plots and areas that have been levelled for subdivision. Most important, Sir, is that there has been a grave loss of topsoil, especially in the sandy areas where the soil has been classified as A1 or A2, the best type of soil available, and it seems at this early stage, in the absence of any explanation by the hon. the Minister or the Deputy Minister, that the damage might be quite serious indeed.

<p>I am not speaking about those matters; I am speaking about things I know of. What I can in fact tell the hon. member is that the Land Bank grants its loans on merit. In many cases the M.P.s help to clear away certain misunderstandings, and therefore we can say that we do our work in our constituencies by taking our constituents to the Land Bank when there are sometimes aspects that are not clear.</p>

<p>Sir, last year it was not difficult to know what the United Party men were going to speak about here. We knew they were going to come along with cattle quotas. The previous year we also knew what they were going to come along with, because then the farmers were having a difficult time of it and there was drought, and they consequently exploited the drought. This year the world around us looks lovely; there is not such a great demand for cattle quotas, and the United Party men therefore did not know what they should come and say here. Their display in this agricultural debate was nearly the poorest I have ever witnessed in an agricultural debate in this House. This makes me think that they are following the advice their newspapers gave them about staying away from the rural areas because, after all, there they would not obtain any votes.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to speak about the very important announcement the hon. the Minister of Agriculture made yesterday in connection with abattoirs. Here we have frequently advocated greater flexibility in our meat scheme. I know that the hon. the Minister has always been sympathetic to greater flexibility in the meat scheme. Yesterday he said so himself in the course of his speech, when he said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of our problems in regard to abattoirs, was that we had put our entire meat marketing pattern into a straitjacket.</block>

<p>Yesterday he gave us great hope for the future of meat marketing in South Africa. He said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#du_toit">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. DU TOIT</person>:</from>

<p>There have always been commissions of inquiry, after all, who have investigated that aspect, and we have always been working along these lines. The hon. member knows very well what the upshot was. It was as a result of the intercession of this Minister that we have today come so far that we can be proud of the scheme they worked out for us and which gives us new hope when it comes to the slaughtering of our cattle and our small stock. Sir, just to give you an idea of how our scheme did not previously fit in with modern marketing methods and modern methods of distribution, I want to quote you a passage from the report of a deputation which instituted investigations overseas (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The firm of &#x2018;Benjam&#x2019; of London was established to sell 10 to 12 cubic foot refrigerators to the public with the object of then providing the consumer with frozen meat, vegetables and fish on a wholesale basis. &#x2018;Benjam&#x2019; itself has a number of refrigeration units&#x2014;40 to be precise&#x2014;on its premises, from which it conducts sales on a self-service basis. For example, meat is cut by its wholesaler, in a frozen state, into portions and then placed into plastic bags in 10 lb. lots. It is a crude method, but is nevertheless eagerly accepted by the housewife. This idea was so successful that within the space of one year the same firm established two additional depots and they still have big plans for development. In London the idea has made such an impact on the consumer that in future chops and other cuts are to be neatly packed into cartons.</block>

<p>I want to state that we in South Africa could not apply these marketing methods as a result of the inflexibility of our present system. In this debate we have also heard a great deal&#x2014;and I shall be coming to that in just a moment&#x2014;about the wide gap that exists between the producer and the consumer, as if it is the middle man who takes all the profit. This is not the case at all. In the Meat Board&#x2019;s regulations it is provided that every butcher must have a blockman. Surely the idea is that there should be depots that can cut meat and distribute it to the various butchers. You know yourself that blockmen are very expensive to keep in one&#x2019;s employ today. I know of a company which recently brought 20 new blockmen into the country. They specially went to select those men in England and Scotland, but the blockmen had hardly <span class="col_5707-5708" refersTo="page_1317"/>landed here when they were given such big offers that the company has only six of them left today. And yet we cannot see why this system of depots, where the meat is processed by blockmen and qualified people under hygienic conditions, cannot be extended to butchers. This is only one single factor I can mention why we welcome the fact that the meat scheme will now be more flexible. In addition, as far as making meat more freely available is concerned, one is dumbfounded by the reason why meat must only be sold at certain hours, and why meat cannot be more freely available. I want to express the thanks of this side of the House to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for having taken this big step of eventually placing our meat industry on a much sounder footing than previously. Then I come to this other point that was made by the hon. member for East London North, who spoke of R6 per sheep, and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town who spoke of the tremendous gap between the producer and the consumer. Here I have an analysis of super lamb based on the average price which prevailed in Johannesburg in February of this year. The weight of this super lamb was 17,273 kg and after it was slaughtered it realised R12-50. The hon. member for East London North says we obtain R6 or R7 per sheep.</p>

That is what the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town has just done by speaking of the tremendously wide gap between the producer and the consumer. This same lamb is retailed at R17-50. Only 28 per cent is added in respect of the sale price.</p>

<p>I can give you the same figures for a grade I beef carcass. The hindquarter of a grade I beef carcass weighed 48 kg. It cost R37-78. Twenty-eight per cent was again added and it was retailed at R52. But now we sometimes make the mistake, as some members on this side of the House have also frequently indicated, of taking those expensive cuts which are sold at 136 cents per kg and then thinking that all the meat from that hindquarter is worth 136 cents, though it decreases to as much as 89 cents per kg. 10,1 per cent of the hindquarter is bone, 5,4 per cent of the hindquarter is fat. In view of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture&#x2019;s announcement yesterday, we are looking forward to a new meat scheme and a new dispensation in the meat industry which will benefit the producer and the consumer, and we thank him very much for that.</p>

<p>It is not in Oudtshoorn. The production of Virginia tobacco-seed goes back to the time of the Transvaal Government in the years 1906 and 1907. Shortly after Union this important function was taken over by the experimental farm at Rustenburg. Since 1934 this essential function of the cultivation of tobacco-seed was undertaken by the Hartebeespoort experimental farm, situated in the district of Brits, in order that the Rustenburg experimental farm could concentrate on research work. Since 1947 the tobacco station at Brits has been the only producer of Virginia tobacco-seed in the Republic. It was quite disturbing to learn that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services intends closing down the Hartebeespoort tobacco station in Brits. <span class="col_5709-5710" refersTo="page_1318"/>Fortunately I have been given the assurance by both the Minister and the Deputy Minister of Agriculture that they have not reached a final decision yet.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on a point of order : I am quoting.</p>

<p>Now I want to make this urgent request to the Minister and I am advancing a plea and I also know that he will, in the interests of the tobacco industry, acquiesce. In the first place, I want to ask that the Minister will agree to have an interview with a delegation from the tobacco group. This delegation consists of the hon. members for Rustenburg, Brits, Nelspruit, Marico, Wakkerstroom, Parys, Waterberg, Potgietersrus, Humansdorp, Malmesbury and Oudtshoorn together with Sentabak, which is the central body of all the co-operative societies in the Republic of South Africa. I just want to mention that the tobacco group had a meeting this morning and after due consideration of the matter this collective action was decided upon. My services are being used in this connection because, unfortunately, I spoke about ostrich farming and this the United Party did not like.</p>

<p>In the second place, I ask that the Minister should decide to maintain this specialized service there at all costs. In the third place, we submit that the ideal experimental station, the Hartebeespoort experimental farm, should be retained. I should like to emphasize the most important reasons for the continuance of this specialized departmental function which has been carried out so effectively and with so much devotion by our officials and which, to my mind, undoubtedly forms the indispensible and sound basis for a sound tobacco cultivating industry. In the first place, I want to mention the extreme suitability of the seed station in question for the cultivation of tobacco-seed. In this connection I want to mention the following factors: In the first place, the size of the experimental farm. On approximately 20 of the 60 morgen fine, fertile and fully scheduled irrigation land approximately 100 000 ounces of Virginia tobacco-seed is produced annually, all of which is snapped up by tobacco producers.</p>

<p>The Hartebeespoort tobacco station has the ideal size for the essential crop rotation in order to cultivate the seed effectively. Furthermore, in addition to the experimental farm being suitable on account of its geographic situation, it is also isolated, as the United Party is at present. It extends over a narrow region along the Crocodile River which makes the isolation of a large number of <span class="col_5711-5712" refersTo="page_1319"/>varieties in a fairly small area possible. This isolation has various advantages, and I want to mention them. The seed-buds do not have to be covered on the land because cross-pollination between varieties is prevented as a result of the isolation. The production of the bare seed-buds is twice that of the covered seed-buds. In the second place, only a small portion of the farm adjoins the road and it is situated away from the critical eyes of producers who would like to cultivate seed themselves, often from hybridized varieties which are unacceptable to the industry. In the third place, I mention the fact that the absence of tobacco and tobacco cultivating material in the area promotes the production of true-to-type seed which is free of disease organisms such as brown rust and anthracnosis which may spread epidemics in concentrated production areas. [Interjections.] These are diseases, and I am not talking about the United Party, which is the major epidemic in South Africa.</p>

<p>Please give me a chance because I am dealing with something in the interests of the tobacco industry. If the hon. member wants to fight over politics, I shall come back to it in a moment.</p>

<p>The soil is mainly alluvial with a very sound growth potential and drainage. This ensures higher production per morgen and, what is more important, a stable production from year to year. Hon. members know that we have had excessive rains in the past year, torrential rains, but that area is never saturated because one finds a dark red loamy soil there, suitable for the cultivation of that seed.</p>

<p>In regard to the availability of water, I may say that the farm gets scheduled water from the Hartebeespoort Dam which is brought to the farm by way of an old furrow. As far as the latter is concerned, it can be said that it has been proved in the past that this is the most reliable source of water below the Hartebeespoort scheme. Furthermore, it is well known that the Hartebeespoort Dam is the most reliable irrigation dam in the whole of the Western Transvaal.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the equipment on that important farm. The farm is specially equipped for the cultivation of tobacco with the necessary water pipes, irrigation canals, storage dams, sheds, seed</p>

<p>cleaning machines, seed-sheds, etc. Furthermore, it is also a very important production area. Brits is the most important kilndrying area in the country and the cultivation of seed in the production area does not only inspire confidence but also creates opportunities for the carrying out of cultivar tests which, otherwise, would have to be replaced by demonstration experiments. What is more, the area is not subject to hail damage, because it is not situated in the hail belt.</p>

<p>Hon. members continually interrupted me while I was dealing with a scientific aspect, an aspect which is absolutely indispensible to a sound tobacco industry. Do hon. members know what the tobacco industry means to South Africa&#x003F; The industry plays a tremendous part in our national economy. This is the goose that lays the golden eggs, because indirect taxation and excise duty from 1960 to 1970 amounted to R85 million of the country&#x2019;s Budget. During the financial year 1970-&#x2019;71 it amounted to R19 million. And during the financial year 1971-&#x2019;72 it amounted to R111 million. It is estimated that it will contribute R112 million towards the Budget during the coming financial year. Do hon. members know why the hon. members on that side of the House interrupt me&#x003F;</p>

I believe that any industry, farming industry or whatever industry it may be, will flourish provided the people have confidence in that industry. I was grateful that that hon. member, who might have made a contribution, spoke about the marketing of meat. However, he will not take it amiss of me when I say that it put me very much in mind of the hand of Esau, but the voice of Jacob. It was the voice of a person who represents farmers, but I had a strong feeling that I detected the hand of Assocor in regard to the abattoirs. I want to leave it at that.</p>

<p>I now want to come to another point. At this stage I must object to what another hon. member said previously about the hon. member for Kensington. He took the hon. member for Kensington to task for looking after the interests of people who do not live in the Kensington constituency. The hon. member for Kensington was, of course, quite right in doing so. A member of Parliament is elected in a certain constituency to help to represent the whole of South Africa. This he must naturally do; it is his duty. That is why I say that the hon. member for Kensington need not be ashamed at all of raising the interests of people in this House although those people do not live in his constituency.</p>

<p>But I want to come to those people who live in the constituency of the hon. the Minister, the constituency I also live in, and to those people who live in the whole of the Western Province. I said nobody could have any confidence if he was not sure that the future of an industry was safe. I now want to talk man to man to the hon. the Minister. Would he allow his sons to continue their farming activities if he is not <span class="col_5715-5716" refersTo="page_1321"/>sure that they will have the labour on their farms in future&#x003F; The hon. the Minister should look at me. There are no workers in the gallery; his sons are not there either. I say I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he would be happy to allow his sons to farm and invest money in the land if he knows that the future of labour is not safe&#x003F;</p>

This he will not do. He will not even nod his head to indicate that he is, in fact, satisfied. What is the position&#x003F; A previous Minister appointed committees to ascertain what the effect of the Bantu policy of this Government would be on the Western Province. Those committees have never submitted a report, nor will they ever submit one.

<p>There are other subjects I can discuss as far as that hon. member is concerned. I do not want to hit back at that hon. member who is getting under my skin now. He knows that I will hit back hard. I want to repeat, that we find ourselves in the position that we will have to look for labour. The hon. the Minister knows it. We cannot continue the way we are carrying on at the moment. The Minister does not take any notice and I do not know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister has the courage to say something. Is he in favour of the system as it is at present&#x003F; Is he also reading a document or is he not&#x003F; No, he is just laughing. Surely, we cannot continue in this vein. Are we afraid to face the facts&#x003F; Surely the Minister is &#x201C;our&#x201D; Minister of Agriculture. Is he ashamed or afraid to plead for the interests of the farmer&#x003F; The word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; means servant, and the Minister is the servant of the farmers. However, he does not want to serve us. He does not want to help us; what do we do with him&#x003F; We cannot continue as we are carrying on at the moment.</p>

<p>Let me deal with a second point. In regard to Coloured farm labourers, I have pleaded on numerous occasions in this House for the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to arrange short courses in order to improve our Coloured labour and to improve their knowledge of the work. However, this is not done. Why is this not done&#x003F; It is not because this Minister does not appreciate how essential it is. He has been forbidden to do it because everyone is placed in a small compartment, and the Department of Coloured Affairs must take care of the Coloureds on the farms, while the Department of Coloured Affairs knows nothing about the whole affair. This is the position throughout. The Minister agrees with me that those people have to be trained. Let him or the Deputy Minister now tell me that they do not agree with me. Those labourers have to be trained by technical staff who know their job.</p>

<p>No, you may not. There is a second point I want to mention in order to show in which way the farmer is being discriminated against. The industrialist gets his employees here in the city where they live in sub-economic houses. The State advances money to the employees of the industrialist or to the local authority at &#x00BE; per cent interest in order to provide them with housing. However, when it comes to the poor farmer who gets a loan from the State, he has to pay 5 per cent interest in order to provide housing for his farm labourers. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Sea Point is quite worried about labour conditions in the Western Cape. The hon. member, in his speech, made a certain number of statements. I just want to tell the hon. member that I know grape farmers who do not use Coloureds to prune their vines. Those farmers will be upset when the hon. member tells them that those Bantu destroyed their vineyards through pruning. They do not supervise their farming activities in such a poor way. There are many farmers who never employ Coloureds to prune their vines. However, there is some merit in the speech of the hon. member, and that is that we will have to make adjustments as far as labour is concerned. However, the hon. member should not be so pessimistic as to say that the Minister of Agriculture has no sympathy and no interest in regard to the labour problems in the particular area in which the hon. member farms. What I am worried about in regard to labour in agriculture, is that we are going to reach the stage where we shall be unable to accommodate all the labour. The hon. member should not make the mistake by saying <span class="col_5719-5720" refersTo="page_1323"/>that there is no sympathy for these particular farmers who are not allowed to make use of forced labour any longer. The matter is being approached very sympathetically, but it is not for us to make all kinds of announcements across the floor of the House. This is a delicate matter which should be handled with great care. The hon. member mentioned training. We have farmers here who have never had a trained Bantu or Coloured, but after he has worked for them for three or four years that labourer is highly trained. The farmer trains the labourer himself.</p>

<p>I promised the Whip I would speak for only seven minutes. The Minister will reply to the questions of the hon. member. I want to refer to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. He shouted, raved and said that we wanted to create a monopoly among the distributors of milk. He asked: Why not allow the distributors and the retailers of milk to go under and give the supermarkets the opportunity&#x003F; That is what it amounted to. I told the hon. member yesterday what would happen if one would allow the supermarket to use milk as a loss leader. I am in favour of inexpensive foodstuffs for the public. Just take those areas where the housewife says that she wants the pint of milk delivered at her house.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>She cannot go to the supermarket. Not all of us is in a position to storm into a supermarket at 6 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. One must remember that the Milk Board, the Dairy Board and all these bodies are the representatives of the farmer and all hon. members have done so far, is to speak disparagingly of them. Hon. members say: Let us divide into zones. Let Sea Point be served by one distributor. Why must four distributors be allowed to enter one block of flats&#x2014;the one distributor delivers at a particular block of flats while the other distributor delivers at a different block of flats, as is the case with the delivery of fuel today. These are practical methods which are being applied for the very purpose of cutting costs and not to increase costs. I can argue with hon. members for half an hour about this matter, and they will come back to me and agree with me. If we do what they ask, the ultimate result will be that the supermarkets with their bargaining powers will be able to cut the price of milk to such an extent that the retailers, against whom the hon. member now has it and who provides an excellent service, will go under and then we will have to pay quite a different price for our milk because it will then be a monopoly. But now the hon. member comes along and raises the cry that it is the attitude of the Government to make foodstuffs as expensive as it possibly can.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that we should subsidize all foodstuffs without exception and that feeding schemes should be encouraged. Two months ago there was a shortage of fresh milk in the Witwatersrand area. Suppose we introduce all these feeding schemes the hon. member propagates and suppose we introduce the subsidies and what-have-you in order to combat tuberculosis and other diseases and we suddenly find that we have a shortage of these foodstuffs. These schemes do not work the way the hon. member wants them to work. What the hon. member was really trying to do was to catch votes, to raise a popular slogan and to raise the cry in this House. &#x201C;Make foodstuffs cheap to the public&#x201D;. This is the major aim of this Government; but it is not child&#x2019;s play to implement this. It is not an easy thing for anybody to be able to say that he has succeeded in reducing the price of foodstuffs while, on the other hand, costs do not go up at the same time.</p>

<p>I just want to discuss something with the hon. member for Newton Park. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet asked the hon. member quite clearly to explain the statements made by his candidates in the cities, who are now in the field, viz. that we have introduced the stock withdrawal scheme solely for the purpose of taking R100 million out of the pockets of the taxpayers to subsidize the farmer in order to make mutton more expensive. The hon. member, as the leader of the agricultural group of the United Party, will have to take up a standpoint in regard to this matter. If he wants to be politically honest he will have to say that he repudiates that candidate who goes from house to house and tells lies to the people. But we are not dumb either. Remember, we also talk in that constituency.</p>

<p><span class="col_5721-5722" refersTo="page_1324"/>The hon. member for Etosha made out a good case for the surveys in his area. These we are carrying out. We shall reply in writing to the representations made by members on our side. I am thinking specifically of the speech made by the member for Heilbron, who dealt with the positive side of the matter. It is wonderful to hear for a change that there is a farmer in a constituency who has made a success. There are quite a number of them in his constituency. This he does not do for himself or for the National Party. He does it for his children. The hon. member for Smithfield said we should encourage agricultural extension and persuade students to take an interest in agriculture. If one speaks as the hon. member for Vryburg did, one will find people who have an interest in agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brits advanced a plea in regard to tobacco seed. I can just tell the hon. member that the attitude of the Department is that the industry should undertake its commercial seed production itself through Sentabak or the Tobacco Council. We are having discussions at the moment. The Department also stated that it was not the intention at all to close down the Hartebeestpoort Dam station. I want to put the hon. member&#x2019;s mind at ease: If it is justified and if there is a need for it &#x2014;because we are considering whether the industry could not be taken over gradually &#x2014;we will see to it, until the year 6666, that it will continue to exist there. As in the past, the Department of Agriculture will continue to show an interest. I can tell the hon. member that, on account of the representations he made, we will not close down the Hartebeestpoort Dam research station. This is characteristic of our side, Sir.

I had a look at these documents when he gave them to me a little while ago, and it is shocking to see how people are being misled on account of an advertisement. An enormous amount of research has already been done in this regard and we do not want people to invest the little money they have in an inadequate and declining rabbit industry while money can, in fact, be made out of rabbit farming if it is done in the proper way.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if hon. members on the opposite side who spoke this afternoon had said something worthwhile replying to, I should like to have followed up on what they said, but my time is limited and they will pardon me if I do not continue in that vein. It remains a strange phenomenon to me that there should be so many people who complain about farmers and who complain on behalf of the farmers, while the farmers hold their peace. I find it a strange phenomenon because the motives are not completely obscure, but are sometimes very conspicuous. I should now like to say something in favour of our farmers in South Africa. The complainers about them and the complainers, so-called, on their behalf, do not take into consideration the fact that our farmers in South Africa are people of particular mettle. They are people who are not easily led by the nose, people who do not allow themselves to be taken in. They are people who think for themselves. Recently we again had conclusive proof of this in Oudtshoorn; they are people who think for themselves.</p>

<p>To my mind the South African farmer is a wonderful person in another respect. Despite all the jeremiads, despite all the plagues and setbacks they have had to cope with, despite the fact that a gloomy picture of agriculture in South Africa is constantly being painted for us, and despite the fact that we hear of so many different figures in respect of the number of farmers, I want to say that there are still more than 90 000 of them. There are not many of them; as a matter of fact, they are impressively few. This number of farmers in South Africa are still feeding the entire population of South Africa, and they shall <span class="col_5723-5724" refersTo="page_1325"/>continue to do so in future. The longer the National Party stays in power the longer they will continue to do so. What is more, this group of farmers in South Africa do not only meet the immediate requirements in respect of foodstuffs. If we were to be honest today, and if we were to make an analysis, we would see that there is no single group representing the national economy of South Africa upon whom so many people are directly and indirectly dependent as upon these 90 000 farmers. Just think of all the non-Whites making a living on every farm, directly out of the pocket of that particular farmer. Just think of all those, for example the industries, which are responsible for supplying the farmer with all his requirements. We can continue in this way to mention numerous examples. I sometimes think, precisely in regard to that aspect, that the farmer is too heavily burdened.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to mention a last point here which is of special importance to me. As you know, we have trade unions and similar bodies in respect of most industries, bodies with bargaining rights, mostly with the object of seeing whether they cannot obtain higher wages for the members of their unions. We have organized agriculture in South Africa; we know what the work of organized agriculture is; it is no longer news today, but I have already asked myself whether it is not time organized agriculture in our country also considered whether it should not obtain some kind of bargaining right, not in order to send the prices of agricultural produce soaring, but in order to bring down the prices of agricultural requirements and implements. Sir, the farmer needs implements, fertilizer pesticides, etc., and the stock farmers require other commodities. There are so many organizations producing or supplying these things. Once they have finished designing and producing these things and the time comes to market them, they send any number of people scurrying all over the countryside in order to boost those commodities. There is tremendous competition among those organizations, but it does not contribute to forcing down the prices of commodities such as agricultural implements; the prices are more likely to rise because the farmer ultimately has to pay the salary of those people doing the propaganda work as well. For this reason I honestly think it is time we gave thought to this matter. From time to time the farmer simply hears that the price of this or that commodity has gone up, and he can do nothing about it. Recently, for example, the price of fertilizer went up again, but the farmer has no say in the matter. In the region of every co-operative one finds numerous representatives driving around offering the farmers the fertilizer manufactured by their companies. Sir, to my mind this is an unnecessary expense; here is something which is really not consistent with what we should like to see. Another formula should be found so that this continual rise in the prices of farming or agricultural requirements may be halted. The farmer himself can do nothing whatsoever about it; he can only watch dolefully how prices are constantly rising.</p>

<p>&#x2026; when he replied to a speech I made some days ago on the question of the Dukuduku land. The hon. the Minister on that occasion made a number of accusations against me, which I am becoming used to, but a number of them must be dealt with. He said on a number of occasions that I had denied receiving the letter sent to me by the Secretary of the department, and he castigated me for the apparent delay in raising this matter in this House. If the hon. the Minister will look at his own Hansard, he will find that at no time did I deny receiving that letter. I merely corrected him when he said that it was a letter from the Minister, because it was not. The other point, the question of the apparent delay in raising this matter, I think I should deal with at rather greater length. This matter was first raised by me in 1966 by means of correspondence with the then Minister. That was two years after this lease was entered into, the lease having been entered into in 1964. At that time the lease and the preparation of the land in terms of that <span class="col_5725-5726" refersTo="page_1326"/>lease had the appearance of normality because it was a lease to clear land and to plant sisal, and in 1966 that was apparently being done. Sir, it is what took place after that that has caused this matter to have interest not only in my mind, but in the minds of many people who know the facts. But what has taken place since then&#x003F; Not only has a new owner come in to take the place of the person to whom the land was originally leased, but since that time one has seen the gradual abandonment of the production of sisal, which was the very reason for the granting of the lease. In addition to the evidence, which was there for all to see, of the gradual abandonment of the production of sisal, there have been rumours that this land is to be converted to sugar production. Coupled with that, we have the fact that the Minister of Economic Affairs has recently granted additional quotas, against the interest of the industry, and these things brought matters to a head a year ago. It was as a result of that that I placed on the Order Paper a year ago the questions to which I shall refer a little later. Having placed a full list of questions on the Order Paper, what happened&#x003F; Absolutely nothing at all in this regard. The position there continued to deteriorate. In September last year I pointed out the situation from an aircraft to the hon. the Deputy Minister, where he himself, together with his officials, saw what I now allege, and that is that at that time their was an abandonment of sisal production to the extent that the sisal fields were returning to grass and had thorn trees growing in them higher than the sisal plants themselves. Sir, this was seen by everybody who was in the aircraft at the time, including the hon. the Deputy Minister. But still nothing happened after that; and then what does one find&#x003F; Virtually every term of this lease, not only its advertised terms but its amended terms, are broken; they are not adhered to by the lessee concerned. People are incensed because they know about this, and, Sir, it is apparently regarded as remarkable that after all this I should raise this matter in this House as I did some weeks ago. Let us look at the two speeches which have been made by the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister in an attempt to justify this situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister said to this House that 12 years ago when sisal was a completely unknown product which had to be boosted, this lease was granted. Sisal has been grown and processed in Northern Zululand for the last 50 years. Ever since I have been on this planet, sisal has been produced there. There have been decorticating plants and the stuff has been produced as a fibre, but we are now told that 12 years ago this was a completely unknown product in this country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is a subsidiary of Ropes and Mattings, which is one of the biggest industrial companies in Natal. We are told that this person Who got the lease had all the know-how, the capital and the machinery required for a successful enterprise, and yet not a paragraph later we are told that he had to be allowed to grow sugar from the commencement of his lease because he could not get his capital and machinery out of Tanganyika and he was in financial difficulties. Finally, what are we told by the hon. the Deputy Minister and by the Minister himself&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister said there was no future for the sisal industry and the Minister said there was a tremendous drop in the price of sisal, so much so that the sisal industry finds itself in great difficulties today. And yet what does the hon. gentleman tell us in the next breath&#x003F; That some 1 200 acres of this land are at this moment being cleared and planted with sisal. What on earth for&#x003F; Both Ministers tell us what we all know, namely that there is no future for the sisal industry and that the bottom has dropped out of the market, and yet in the next breath we are told that this man is to go ahead, apparently for a successful financial venture, to plant another 1 200 acres of sisal.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, this is absolute nonsense. In ten years the hon. the Minister agrees that this man has planted a mere 400 acres out of 5 600 acres of land that he has got. Are we to expect that this lease now is apparently to go on for the purpose of producing sisal over an additional 5 000 acres&#x003F; What then is going to happen&#x003F; Nobody <span class="col_5727-5728" refersTo="page_1327"/>will believe that this man is to go ahead to plant sisal when there is no future in it, as both Ministers have admitted. That is why there is such concern at the present time, and that is why I raise this matter, because there is a grave suspicion that the purpose for which this land is to be used is to be changed. I say that if there is to be a material change in the purpose for which this land is to be used, then it has to be readvertised for that purpose. Will the Minister give this House the assurance that no additional sugar will be grown on this land without readvertisement&#x003F; I hope he will give us the assurance, both on his own behalf and on behalf of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, who issues sugar quotas.</p>

<p>No, but he has a quota for which this land was never advertised. Had the public known at the time when this land was advertised that a sugar quota would be made available for it, there would have been dozens of additional applicants waiting in the queue for this land. [Interjections.] As I have said, this lease was signed in July, 1964, on the Minister&#x2019;s own statement, and it was backdated to February, 1964. In the first half of 1964, on the Minister&#x2019;s own statement, it was known that this man could not get his capital out of Tanganyika and could not get out his heavy machinery, and those are two of the principle reasons why he was granted the lease in the first place, because, we are told, he had the capital and the equipment, and the cash necessary for this enterprise. So, knowing that the two main reasons for which he was selected for this lease no longer applied, this lease was proceeded with at a time when it was known that the sisal industry was already going into a decline. The hon. the Minister went further and said that investigations that were conducted towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year proved that the lessee had planted 24 ha of bananas. Sir, why was that investigation undertaken&#x003F; It was because I pointed out to the hon. the Deputy Minister what was going on on this property, when I flew over it with him in September last year. But here one is castigated for raising this matter at the time when one did so.</p>

<p>Let me come to the final point in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement in this House. He said that this land was let initially, for 20 years, at a rental of R3 000 per annum. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Zululand will forgive me if I do not follow up on what he said in his speech, for if I were to do that I would not find the time for the topic I should like to deal with. Actually, I just want in passing to refer to a short speech made a few minutes ago by the hon. member for Kensington when he said for the benefit of hon. members who represent South-West Africa here that if we do not do our duty in respect of South-West Africa the Opposition will. He then referred to the flood disaster in Mariental. That flood occurred on 16/17 March. The hon. members of the Opposition had ample opportunity of discussing it. They had such an opportunity in the Budget debate and also afterwards in the debate on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. Today, more than a month after that disaster, they come and discuss it. I shall now tell the hon. member for Kensington what the hon. members who represent South-West Africa did.</p>

<p>On 20th March, only a few days after the disaster, the hon. member for Mariental, in whose constituency the disaster area falls, was already on the spot. At the first opportunity he had of getting there, when the water had subsided, he was on the spot. He then looked after the interests of his constituency. He had interviews with members of the Executive Committee, and with the Administrator. He then brought the matter to the attention of the Government, and at that stage already the hon. the Prime Minister had also acted. But today, more than a month after that event, the hon. member for Kensington comes along looking for political gain. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What I actually want to discuss is another matter. I want to discuss automation in agriculture and the role which the Department of Agriculture can play in giving added momentum to automation in agriculture. <span class="col_5729-5730" refersTo="page_1328"/>I think we can describe the development of agriculture until now as the mechanization of agriculture. While I am speaking my mind goes back to the days when we still ploughed with wooden plough shares and drew water out of the well with buckets, and so on. I think we are living today in an era in which even mechanization is something of the past, and that we will have to think of automating agriculture. We will have to consider this when we take into account the great demands made on agriculture in providing food for the peoples of the world. It can also be said that we are today standing on the threshold of the greatest revolution in the sphere of agriculture. By this I mean the next few decades up to the year 2000.</p>

<p>I want to put it that of all the fields of science, agriculture is more than any other the one which lends itself to automation. We have a very fine Afrikaans saying which goes &#x201C;A farmer will always devise a plan&#x201D;. That is very true. I maintain that agriculture in particular lends itself to plans for mechanization and automation. This is the case because of the wide ramifications of farming activities. If one thinks of stock breeding, agronomy and its subdivisions such as viticulture, the wheat industry, the maize industry and so on, one realizes how much room for opportunity there is for automation in each of these spheres.</p>

<p>The topographical aspect of agriculture lends itself in particular to this. We have farmers who live hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town. If something happens on the farm such a farmer cannot rush through to town to fetch a spare part; he must devise a plan and discover something himself to solve the problem presented by the broken component. In addition there is the urgent nature of the problem, but in particular, what inclines us to automation in the farming industry is of course the tremendous shortage of labour. We must admit that the mechanization which we have had so far must be attributed mainly to the skill of the farmer and to the fact that he knows his subject. If a farmer discovers a patent it is easy to say that he should go to the patents office to have the patent registered. The fact of the matter is, however, that the farmer is simply a different kind of person. If he has discovered a particular patent for the agricultural industry he does not want to make a profit from it. He utilizes it in his own farming practice, and his neighbours may perhaps make use of it as well, but he will never have that patent registered so as to try to make money out of it. If we consider the mechanization in agriculture it is interesting to note that it is always people other than the farmers who try to make something out of it.</p>

<p>Let us now consider a modern farm in South-West Africa. To mention only one example, let us look at the different kinds of gates, and the way in which the gates are opened and closed automatically. One finds it there, and I can tell hon. members that it is fantastic to see all the patents. In the cattle-farming regions we can take a closer look at the different methods applied in crush pens, and the different head clamps with which an animal is handled when it is branded or dosed. Such progress has been made already that it is virtually unnecessary to lay a hand on the animal. It is possible to brand and dose and do everything to it without having to touch it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>You can also milk it in that way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you can milk cows without touching them. If one considers the different water devices and the different levers attached to windmills to cause them to work more easily, it is astonishing. The gentlest breeze can today abstract water from a thousand foot borehole. Then there are the different grinders with which farmers shred different kinds of shrubs and bushes in order to provide the animals with fodder. It is simply fantastic. I have seen patents there which virtually forced me to shake my head and ask myself whether it is possible that such a simple farmer could display so much originality. Then there are, in addition, the different fodder patents. Hon. members are aware that there are livestock preparations on the market today which an animal cannot consume too much of, otherwise it may die. I know a farmer in Grootfontein who took a fly-wheel from a big engine and mounted it on a large basin in which the fluid is placed. The animals lick at the wheel, which revolves, and in that way they get a constant supply of the fluid, but not too much at a time. They tell me of another farmer who took this a step further. He mounted a number of different wheels according to a similar process. The <span class="col_5731-5732" refersTo="page_1329"/>animals stand in a row and lick at the wheel, and this causes the wheel to revolve. With the motive power thus obtained the farmer pumps water automatically. A farmer from Grootfontein took an ordinary old tractor and devised a patent for himself with which he removes bushes. This is a fantastic apparatus, and the largest caterpillar tractor cannot achieve as much success as that farmer achieves with his patent. It is worthwhile seeing something like this in operation. Hon. members know that kudu are a very great hazard in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Last year more than 400 people died in motor accidents in the territory in this way. A farmer from Otjiwarongo devised a patent to counteract the kudu danger. He simply attached a cross-piece to an ordinary fence and attached two strands of wire to it. He erected an ordinary fence of 4 foot 6 inches with the cross-piece and the strands of wire over it, and a kudu will not go over it. A kudu will simply not go over it, while, hundreds, thousands and even hundreds of thousands of rand are being spent on the erection of game-proof fencing. In Somerset West I saw a farmer who had designed a new cylinder, a cylinder which he alleges&#x2014;and it has been tested&#x2014;can work for 50 years before it will be necessary to extract it and replace its parts. This is a fantastic patent if one knows from what depth water has to be drawn in the part of the world I come from. There it sometimes takes days to extract borehole pipes, repair and reassemble it. After that it is only a matter of a few months before the various parts are worn again. This farmer discovered this patent in order to eliminate the problem. It is a fantastic patent. I saw it, and I had to shake my head and admit that it was worth a great deal to the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>I can spend a very long time discussing these different patents, but I want to advocate today that a special branch be established in the Department of Agriculture which would conduct a survey among the farmers of these different original patents which are being used in agriculture. They could keep a written record of such patents, with the necessary sketches, and then channelize the matter. They can test them, and also distribute them. It may even be possible to pay these farmers a fee for those patents which they discover. In this way we can encourage automation in agriculture further. I foresee the day, within decades, within this century in which we are living, when agriculture will have been automated to such an extent that a farmer who practises agronomy, for example, will get up in the morning, put his tractors in operation on the lands, and then go home while those tractors plough the land for him.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to avail myself of this opportunity to break a lance for the small farmer who has to farm on a small unit. I do mot have time to react to the speeches made by hon. members on that side of the House. I do not want to discuss tobacco (<i>tabak</i>) at all, for hon. members opposite spoke enough nonsense (<i>twak</i>).</p>

<p>There is a great deal of speculation and gossip-mongering in regard to the small farmers on the small units. Many objections are being raised and misgivings expressed in regard to the place the small farmer has to occupy in the agricultural structure, the entire agricultural set-up in South Africa. It is true that in most agricultural countries of the world the number of farmers is decreasing tremendously. This is the case in America; this is the case in Europe. Here in this country we talk about the depopulation of the rural areas when we refer to the decrease in the number of farmers in the rural areas. Agricultural economists and other organizations state that it is scientifically, technologically, and for economic reasons as well, quite correct and that it is inevitable that the numbers of the smaller farmers farming on the smaller units will decrease progressively, and that they will subsequently disappear. It is being predicted that by the end of this century scarcely 40 000 of the present 90 000 farmers, actively engaged in farming will remain. Recently, too, there were articles in the Press under banner headlines about a possible 30 000 small farmers who will shortly be on their way out. Unfortunately, and quite unjustifiably the name of our hon. the Minister of Agriculture is being associated with this by means of subtle distortions. Hon. members on the opposite side in particular, when they find themselves in the rural areas, state this in such a way that it must seem as if it is the policy of the Government that the small farmer must be eliminated from the agricultural industry. This is untrue. This is not Government policy. What actually happens is that confusion is created in regard to the concept and the meaning of the &#x201C;small farmer&#x201D; and the <span class="col_5733-5734" refersTo="page_1330"/>&#x201C;uneconomic farmer&#x201D;. The confusion becomes greater when the small farmer is associated with an uneconomic unit. The fact of the matter is that a small farmer on a small farm with economic agricultural potential can farm very profitably, while a big farmer on a big farm may sometimes farm uneconomically and never achieve the production potential of which that farm is capable. It is this calibre of small farmer who has to be protected and who must be kept on the farm. We could preferably subdivide the big farm of the land baron and make the smaller subdivisions available to small farmers for them to cultivate intensively and obtain an in creased production yield per unit on it.</p>

<p>The rural areas may not become depopulated. For us, as Afrikaners, the rural areas have endless significance. Until recently we were still known as the <i>Boerevolk.</i> We are still proud of being called the farmers, or the <i>Boerevolk</i> of South Africa. The character of our people is orientated to the soil and the rural areas. Our forefathers were not wealthy people or land barons, but they, relatively speaking, supported and educated large families on small units. The intensively cultivated small farm, together with its owner, must be protected, cherished and preserved. This could maintain the balance of the population between the cities and the rural areas and make the distribution more equal. It can never be equal in numbers, but it can be equal in significance as long as the rural areas are able to retain their picturesqueness and character; as long as one still has the small farmer there. The big farmers and company farmers, who for the most part live in the cities and have their farms in the rural areas, will contribute to these areas losing their character as a result of the decrease in the population there. I feel myself at liberty to state that the retention of this type of small farmer is a matter the Minister and the Government have at heart, because they know that the most important factor in agriculture is the production per unit. They are aware that it is in fact the small farmers on small farms who can comply with this requirement, owing to the opportunity a small farmer has of maintaining more efficient supervision over his whole farm than the big farmer with his extensive farming enterprise. I make so bold as to say that all forms of State assistance to agriculture and to the farmer are directly and indirectly calculated and geared to keeping as many farmers as possible in the rural areas. Of this the small farmer is in fact receiving a considerable share. Therefore the Government and the Minister may not be accused of having geared their policy in respect of assistance to the farmers to causing the small farmer to disappear from the rural areas. My view is that the production ability of the small unit, as against that of the extensive unit of the big farmer should be retained, and its place in our agricultural set-up should be retained. This view is emphasized in article in <i>Agrikon,</i> quarterly journal of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and I should like to quote a few extracts from it to prove this. They say <i>inter alia</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Measures adopted by the Government in the interests of agriculture tend almost throughout to favour entrepreneurs on smaller units. <i>Inter alia</i> this is the case with the consolidation of units, credit facilities, interest rate subsidies, the stock fodder subsidy scheme and the stock reduction scheme for example.</block>

<p>Then they make this very significant statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farming throughout the world is one important sector of the economy which has not yet been able to prove throughout that the application of large scale production methods constitute many economic advantages.</block>

<p>This is what the Department of Agricultural Economy and Marketing has to say. They then go on to state their reasons&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The management of a smaller unit constitutes definite advantages, for decisions can be taken and carried out more readily and more rapidly. There are few alternatives to the personal supervision of the farmer. In agriculture the personal interest and the eye of the master is undoubtedly of cardinal importance.</block>

<p>The Department also states that it is some times over-emphasized by farmers that when they purchase implements on a large scale for use on large units and utilize labour on a large scale it is more economic. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have reached the final point which I <span class="col_5735-5736" refersTo="page_1331"/>wish to raise with the hon. the Minister, and it arises again from the reply that he gave in this House some days ago. The hon. the Minister said in answer to me that the Cabinet had decided in 1963 to lease &#x201C;the land on their recommendation &#x2026;&#x201D;, that is a committee which the Government had appointed, &#x201C; &#x2026; to Mr. Bassiliou at a rental of R3 000 per annum for a term of 20 years&#x201D;. Last year I put questions to the hon. the Minister on this very point, namely the question of the rental. What did he say then&#x003F; He said that the rental was to be R300, not R3 000, per annum for the first six years, R600 per annum for the next four years, R480 per annum for the next ten years, and R650 per annum for the next five years&#x2014;an answer completely at variance with the reply that he gave to this House last week.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t know what the average is, but we are not concerned with averages; we are concerned with the actual rental. If the hon. the Minister was property advised, he would probably find that, like so many of the other conditions with which this lease began its life, the rental too has changed during the period of the currency of the lease, changed in favour of the lessor. What is the principle that emerges from all this&#x003F; We are dealing here with 5 600 acres of State-owned land in a high rainfall area, a very considerable acreage of potentially highly productive land. The proper procedure is gone through, that is to say, that the land is advertised and tenders are invited. Now, Sir, what is the object of inviting tenders&#x003F; So that the State can get the best advantage for State-owned land&#x2014; that is the first point. The second point is so that everybody is placed on an equal footing when they apply for that particular piece of property. In order for this to apply in a way that is fair to everybody, not only must the conditions upon which it is advertised remain the same and not be altered when once the person whom the Government wishes to lease to, has been chosen; but if there is any material change then the land must be readvertised.

If he is to be given permission to plant a different crop in the place of sisal, then I say, this land must be readvertised for the new purpose for which it is to be used. It must be readvertised and the conditions must be adhered to. If the position is that, once having excluded a number of people because of the severity of the terms under which you advertise the land, you then find somebody who is prepared to go in on a basis of no-one-else-will, and as soon as he has got his foot in the door, he persuades the department to change materially almost every condition which caused the others to be excluded, then you have favouritism towards that individual in question.

The fact that sugar was permitted in the first instance was never made known to the public generally. Had it been known that sugar could be grown on this property, the Minister would have had a queue of people at his door, asking for this land. What is more, sugar is profitable on a comparatively small acreage. This property is 5 600 acres and it could support dozens and dozens of people if it was to be used on the basis of sugar. All I ask is that the hon. the Minister should adhere to the principle, namely that everybody is fairly treated when it comes to leases of this kind. Secondly, I ask that he gives this House an undertaking that no permission for a material variation of this lease from the existing conditions will be given without this land being readvertised, so that everybody can have a fair chance of obtaining the benefit from it.</p>

<p>No, Sir, it would have been easy for me to react to them if I had taken some trouble to pay attention to them, but I did not.</p>

<p>I want to make a few observations on a question which is becoming increasingly real in agriculture, namely that of the succession by younger people in agriculture. In 1970 we passed the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act. In terms of sections 4 and 5 of that Act, the subdivision of agricultural land is made subject to the approval of the Minister and uneconomic units will not be approved in future. We are already noticing the tendency, quite rightly a sound tendency, that units of agricultural land are increasing in size. In the future we shall have the position that, since agricultural units are becoming larger and at the same time fewer, and therefore more intensively capitalized, the question of succession by heirs will become increasingly real. In the first place, although these matters do not necessarily fall directly under the Minister of Agriculture, I want to plead that in the years ahead we should again pay careful attention to the question of estate duty and donations tax. These are two taxes which, because of the appreciation of agricultural land, will make succession difficult in particular cases. It would be profitable if we paid continual attention to this. My personal opinion is&#x2014;I repeat it is my personal opinion&#x2014;that considerable relief can still be granted in respect of estate duty in order to facilitate succession by heirs. I would appreciate it if the Minister concerned, who is responsible for agriculture, would also give this his support if we plead with the hon. the Minister of Finance about this matter in the future.</p>

<p>Sir, I also want to plead that what is advocated by the Commission of Inquiry into the Agricultural Industry should become the fixed policy of the Land Bank, i.e. that the standpoint should be adopted that if a farmer wants to borrow money in order to make succession possible, or if he wants to make a unit large enough for succession or wants to expand a unit so that both he and at least one son can obtain an economic unit, it would be a question of policy that in such a case a Land Bank loan would be granted.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, then we come to the question of young farmers. From cases I have had to deal with I have gained the impression that we have not thought deeply enough yet about our young farmers. We will have to arrive at a definite policy in respect of our young farmers. However, I want to qualify my statement at once by saying that I am not including any young farmer in this. One has reached the stage in agriculture where one can no longer say that because the father is farming and the son would like to farm, he should be helped. I want to qualify it very clearly by saying that I am pleading for the young farmer who, according to certain prescribed norms, has the necessary knowledge, perseverance and character to deserve assistance. I think we should arrive at a definite policy as far as these people are concerned. A very important agricultural country such <span class="col_5739-5740" refersTo="page_1333"/>as France has a definite policy in regard to these people. France lends its young people money at an interest rate of 4 per cent for 30 years for the purchase of land, and for 15 years at 4&#x00BD; per cent for livestock, equipment, etc. I feel the time has arrived that we should place those people in a particular class as well. We should do something specific for these people who meet the prescribed norms, so that we may ensure sound succession in agriculture.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which is becoming a bottleneck in agriculture. What I am going to say now is my personal opinion, and I do so with the greatest appreciation for what the Land Bank and the Department of Agricultural Credit are doing in respect of financing agriculture. I want to qualify it further by saying that, in their valuations of land, these institutions are called upon to place a damper on the price of agricultural land so that it does not reach unsound heights. However, I should like to ask in all courtesy whether the time has not arrived that these institutions should be a bit more realistic in their valuations. I am not requesting that their valuations should be market valuations; that, of course, is impossible. However, I feel that they are too conservative. That conservatism drives a certain type of progressive farmer who wants to get assistance from them, to private financial institutions. I feel that that type of farmer should also be helped by these institutions.</p>

<p>Furthermore&#x2014;and I want to conclude with this&#x2014;I want to ask whether the time has not arrived that the Land Bank should be enabled to spread its wings so that it may also help the well-to-do farmer and the strong average farmer, even if it has to do so at a higher rate of interest, as recommended by the commission of inquiry. This class of farmer is responsible for a very large proportion of our production. I think it would be in accordance with the new line of thought of the Land Bank, i.e. that it should do more towards financing agriculture, if it were enabled to help this class of farmer as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me that it is going to become a tradition in this House for the hon. member for Mooi River and myself to confront each other in the agricultural debate every year about the position of the fresh-milk farmer. The hon. member expressed his opinion yesterday&#x2014;as he has every right to do&#x2014;on the fresh-milk industry in South Africa. I appreciate it that he is looking to the interests of that section of our farmers, but I just want to tell him that I think he was a little pessimistic. I should like to take up a more positive attitude in this regard today. I just want to remind my hon. friend of the fact that the Milk Board was established by the present National Government, by the present Minister of Agriculture. Since the establishment of the Milk Board the milk farmer in South Africa has enjoyed security. Before the Milk Board appeared on the scheme, the fresh-milk farmer sent his milk to the milk-shops in the cities and towns and did not even know whether he would get all his money at the end of the month. He had no guarantee. Today the Milk Board gives him that guarantee, in other words, he can now plan ahead; he can build, because he knows the price he is getting and the percentage of his milk for which he will get the full price. Another great advantage which the milk farmer has, in addition to the security he gets from the Milk Board&#x2014;I want to concede that he has problems too&#x2014;is that he never has a crop failure. His profit may sometimes be smaller, but he never has a crop failure. He always gets his milk cheque, whether there is a drought or whether it has rained.</p>

<p>Sir, then I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Deputy Minister said yesterday about the milk farmer. Here, once again, it is a matter of efficiency. The fresh-milk farmer, who is not only a farmer, but also a businessman, will always make a good living. Sir, I have some of the biggest fresh-milk farmers in my constituency. Some of my efficient farmers have had a complete calculation of expenses made in order to find out what it costs to produce one gallon of milk. They arrived at 28 cents a gallon. If we look at last year&#x2019;s report of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, we see that the price was 37.8 cents a gallon. In other words, according to the calculation of those farmers they made a profit of 9,8 cents a gallon. I want to give you the example of a few farmers in my constituency. I have a big fresh-milk farmer in my constituency, who produces 2 000 gallons of milk a day. The profit of 9,8 cents a gallon gives him R5 880 a month or R70 560 a year. The hon. member advocated a higher milk price yesterday. If you were to give that big dairy farmer two cents a gallon more, he <span class="col_5741-5742" refersTo="page_1334"/>would make an additional profit of R1 200 a month, or R14 400 a year, which would then increase his profit to R85 000 a year. Let us take the smaller dairy farmer, who produces 200 gallons a day; his net profit is R588 a month. The profit of the average farmer who produces 400 gallons a day is just over R1 100 a month, or R14 000 a year.</p>

<p>I want to put another matter to the hon. the Minister, however. We find from time to time that we have a surplus of maize in South Africa. I want to put it to the Minister and the Deputy Minister like this today: In the light of the fact that we were told yesterday that our slaughter facilities would drastically improve in future, I want to mention the possibility of investigating the position and making a study of it in good time, so that our surplus maize may be used for the production of export beef in future. It is alleged that here is a shortage of beef practically everywhere in the world. In this way experts say, for example, that there is a shortage of 200 000 tons of beef a year on the continent of Europe at the moment. If you calculate this in terms of cattle, it means 800 000 carcasses of young cattle weighing more or less 500 lbs. each. It is further calculated that there is a shortage of 500 000 tons of beef a year in Japan. One finds the surprising fact that the <i>per capita</i> consumption of beef in Japan is only 15 to 20 lb. a year. This means that the annual shortage of 500 000 tons of beef in a country such as Japan represents approximately 1,5 million head of cattle. This shows us that there is a tremendous potential for the export of beef on the world market, and I think it will be worthwhile to make a study in this direction so that we will in future be able to use the surplus maize for the production of beef here in our country, and particularly with a view to exporting overseas.</p>

<p>Furthermore we find in the annual report of the department that 130 000 small calves were slaughtered in the controlled areas alone during the past year, calves which were more or less three weeks old. I want to suggest that if yellow mealiemeal could be used to save these calves in future, so that they need not be sent to the slaughter-house at this early age, they, too, could be used for the production of beef. I want to say, therefore, that I expect our maize industry to form a firm cornerstone for the production of export beef in future, and I am fully confident that our hon. Minister and his Deputy, with their department, will undertake the necessary study and research in this regard in good time.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the few minutes left to me in this debate, I would like to raise with the Minister the position of Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. I do so, because Kirstenbosch is at present threatened by a proposal by the City Engineer of Cape Town to the City Council to build a six-lane highway which will go along the boundaries of Kirstenbosch for quite a large portion of its length, a highway which will incorporate right opposite the entrance to Kirstenbosch a 20-foot high viaduct and a highway which will cut across ground at present used by Kirstenbosch for its nursery. I believe that this highway would do an immense amount of damage to Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, for a number of reasons. The first reason is that this highway, incorporating as it does this viaduct right opposite the entrance to Kirstenbosch, would spoil the visual approach and the environment of the gardens. Secondly, I believe that this highway and the traffic that it would carry would be the cause of noise pollution as far as Kirstenbosch is concerned, because owing to the topography of that area the highway would go through a bowl which would serve as a form of megaphone and amplify the noise of the traffic. Thirdly, the fact that this highway would cut across land at present used by Kirstenbosch means&#x2014; and I get this information from the director of Kirstenbosch&#x2014;that it would take away from Kirstenbosch some of the comparatively scarce ground which is suitable for nursery purposes. Kirstenbosch has plenty of ground overall, but I am advised that for nursery purposes one needs gently sloping north facing ground, of which there is a scarcity within the boundaries of Kirstenbosch.</p>

<p>I realize that I am raising this matter at a very early stage because the proposals have not yet been considered by the City Council of Cape Town nor, of course, have they gone to the province, but I think that this may well be the last opportunity for me to raise this matter in Parliament before the matter reaches a more final stage. I would like to appeal to the hon. the Minister, particularly during the recess to watch this position very carefully indeed and should there be any danger of Kirstenbosch being jeopardized, to take the <span class="col_5743-5744" refersTo="page_1335"/>necessary action. I do not know what the necessary action would! be, but I am sure that the Minister and his department would be able to exercise considerable influence in this matter. If it is necessary for a highway to be built joining Newlands to Lower Constantia, as this planned road would do, there are other possibilities which the city engineer of Cape Town has already investigated. I make this appeal because the proposal which has been published has evoked a tremendous amount of protest, not only from residents of my constituency, but also from the whole of the Cape Peninsula and in fact the whole of South Africa. In fact, protests have been received from far and wide, some from America, and I have seen one from as far away as Hawaii, and I suggest rightly so. I do not need to tell hon. members of this House what a great national heritage and national asset Kirstenbosch is. It is recognized as such, not only in South Africa but by world-wide botanists. I think it is difficult to surpass in the grandeur and beauty of its setting. It is difficult to surpass in the wealth of its flora. It is unique in that all the plants grown at Kirstenbosch are indigenous South African plants, and I think it is unique in the tranquillity and the peace which it provides at a distance of no more than 7 miles from Cape Town. It is wonderful that we should have that tranquility and peace so close to the city.</p>

<p>As an indication of the world-wide fame of Kirstenbosch I would like to quote what Prof. Knut Faegri of Bergen. Norway, who is the secretary-general of the International Union of Biological Sciences, has to say.</p>

<p>He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kirstenbosch is one of the great botanical gardens of the world; perhaps the greatest. These are very big words and I perfectly well know&#x2014;many of them from personal visits&#x2014;that there are many other fine botanical gardens both in the old world and in its new parts, but I know of not one which can properly be compared with Kirstenbosch.</block>

<p>T appeal to the hon. the Minister to keep his eye on this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I identify myself completely with the standpoint of the hon. member for Constantia, who wants to retain the botanical gardens at Kirstenbosch as they are. I just want to say to the hon. member that their side has always levelled the accusation of mismanagement and ineffectiveness on the part of the Government and its Ministers. I assume that the hon. member, with the true political feeling he has, probably ought to have very great influence with the Cape Town City Council. It was their engineer who made the recommendation. I am prepared to support the hon. member in his representations. But I do think that the hon. member would probably have more influence with the United Party City Council of Cape Town than a Minister who has &#x201C;mismanagement&#x201D; in the departments under him. The hon. member should make his representations to the Cape Town City Council. I seem to think there was a time when he himself was also a member of that City Council.</p>

<p>I am still coming to that hon. member. I say that I agree fully with the plea of the hon. member that we retain as much of Kirstenbosch as we possibly can. But when the State intervened in some or other situation, hon. members opposite immediately accuse this side of the House of depriving local authorities or provincial authorities of their powers. In spite of this the hon. member has made a plea to me that I prohibit the Cape Town City Council from doing certain things. Surely the hon. member has the remedy in his hand.

If he can convince them that they should not do it, I would fully agree with his standpoint and support him.</p>

If that had not been his intention, he would have told me beforehand that he wanted to talk about that matter. It concerns a transaction which took place in 1962, and which was changed in 1964. Therefore, it did not happen in my time, but in that of my predecessor. The hon. member cannot expect me to have here all the available data on that farm. The hon. member raised the matter late in the afternoon, hoping that the Minister would not be prepared to reply to it, so that he could proclaim a new scandal on the front page of the <i>Sunday Times</i> on Sunday.

<p>Surely that is the reason why the hon. member came to this House with that story. There are certain things which one should always know and which one should always take into account; there are certain things, animals and people, who must always be hit on the snout when they are seen, because if they are not coming from the place where they have done mischief, they are about to do mischief! The hon. member came to this House with this sort of story and tried to sow suspicion. He can get all the replies, and I have given them to him. In addition, he can get all the reasons why that farm was leased in that manner at the time. He can get the reasons why tenders were invited. It was regarded as essential that it should be leased in that way, because we wanted to encourage the sisal industry. I gave him the reasons why the lessee of that farm was given the opportunity of deriving an income from other crops. The reason is that by that time he had already spent large sums of money on that land. I gave the hon. member the answer as to why he was allowed to cultivate sugar cane. It was done because it does not merely take a day or two before one starts drawing an income from the sisal industry. I gave him all the reasons why his contract of lease had been changed from 20 to 25 years. In addition, I gave him the average price at which the land was being leased for 20 years. It was leased at an average amount of R3 000 per year. I gave all the information to him, without hiding anything from him. and today the hon. member said that he wanted an assurance from the Minister that that land would be readvertised if it was going to be leased for the production of sugar. The contract which the lessee of this land has with the Government, stipulates that he shall produce sisal there. It is the contractor&#x2019;s problem whether the sisal market collapses or not. If the contractor has problems as a result of that, and if he does not want to grow sisal in future, he may ask for his contract to be amended or suspended. If that is done, a decision is taken: as to what should be done with it. But the hon. member indulged in suspicion-mongering and suggested that that contractor would receive those 5 000 acres for the production of sugar in advance at this stage already. When this land was put out to lease at the time, the recognized sugar institutions investigated the possibility of producing sugar. It was said at the time that that land, which, to a large extent, consists of sand-hills, was not suitable for the production of sugar. The hon. member knows that this is true. Now he says, &#x201C;It is overlooking the Bell property.&#x201D;</p>

I want to say something to the hon. member: When such an industry was encouraged in the past, especially in Natal, State land was made available for those purposes. How many sugar mills were not established in the past, in Natal, where the mill carries on its production on State land&#x2014;State land which was leased not for 25 years, but for 99 years&#x003F; Where such an industry was started, it was the practice to lease State land to the sugar industry in Natal for a period of 99 years. Why does the hon. member not mention that&#x003F; I want to go further. The hon. member said that something underhand must have taken place.</p>

<p>That is the impression the hon. member is creating. On the strength of a promise the United Party put land out to lease in the Monzi area to soldiers who had returned from the war. Thirty of them were housed there and land was given to them. Now the hon. member complains because R3 000 has to be paid in rent for land from which bushes still have to be cleared. On what conditions was that land given to those people at the time&#x003F; That land was given to the returned soldiers at a price of R6 000 per 120 morgen. According to the hon. member himself, that land includes some of the best sugar land in Natal. That land was given to them. But over and above that 120 morgen which they bought for R6 000, an additional 20 morgen was given to them. Furthermore, they received communal land from the State, land on which they could lay out a golf course. Every 120 acres of that land is worth at least R100 000 today, in spite of there being no buildings on it. But when that soil was washing away and when the drought started affecting those people, even more State land was allocated to them, land on which they could produce sugar so that they might make up for the losses they had suffered. But the hon. member does not talk about that, because those who are gossiping with him in Natal are, after all, a lot of English-speaking United Party supporters. That land was not put out to lease. After a year that man had produced enough sugar to pay the price of the land in full. There was a time when those 30 farmers in Monzi possessed the largest number of private aeroplanes of any community in South Africa.</p>

<p>That is not the point. The point is that when those people were in difficulties as a result of droughts, it was right for the State to grant them assistance to overcome them. But here we have a person to whom land was leased. He had difficulty in getting his machinery here. He cleared the land of bushes. The land originally allocated to him, was taken away and other land was given to him. All these things were done. Because he had problems with his income, 84 acres of land was leased to him for the production of sugar. After 20 years that land will revert to the State. The land was not given to him at R6 000 per 120 acres so that he could produce sugar. This person spent large amounts of money on deforestation, but because the State has now given him this undertaking to enable him to get an income, it is an evil thing that has happened. The State is not supposed to assist this lessee. But these other people who received land from the State almost as a present, are to be assisted on every occasion. I repeat that if his name were not Papanicolaou but in fact Cadman or Mostert or Mitchell or, for that matter, Webber, that hon. member would not have said a single word about it.</p>

<p>Do not cry about that now. Because of problems which arose there, this lessee was allowed to do certain things so that he could have an income. That income which he receives, is spent again on deforestation and improvements on the farm. But those other people who are living next to that hon. member on the Monzi plain, received production loans from the State. In addition, they received loans for taxes, deforestation, etc. Every penny which has been spent by this person up to now, has come from his own capital. He has not received as much as a tickey from the State in the form of a loan. I can understand that the hon. member is disappointed. The hon. member tried to dish up some gossip, which has now boomeranged. That is why he has come here this afternoon looking the way he does.</p>

<p>But there is a second matter which I just want to touch on briefly. The hon. member for Sea Point referred to the shortage of labour in the Western Province, and asked what the Minister intended doing about it. There are labour arrangements for farmers in the Western Province. Apart from the Coloured labour, the Department of Bantu Administration has a scheme in terms of which farmers may go and recruit non-White labourers. I, too, what is more, I am not agreeable to Bantu labour being able to enter the Western Cape in an unrestricted manner.

<p>The hon. member need not be so sensitive about it. Now I want to come to the hon. member for Kensington. He referred here to Mariental and said that the Minister had not made a statement on Mariental and an the floods which took place in the vicinity of the Hardap Dam. However, I do not know why I should make a statement to the hon. member on the Hardap Dam. What interest does he have in it&#x003F; If the hon. member had had a farm lower down from the Hardap Dam, he would have known what the decision was on what is going to happen there. Then it would not have been necessary for him to ask me.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply to the hon. member, but does he expect me to make a statement on it&#x003F; South Africa is not concerned in what happens at the Hardap Dam, but it is of interest to the people concerned in it. If the hon. member had been concerned in it, it would not have been necessary for me to make a statement to him. If that were the case, he would have known what steps the Government had taken and what measures had been introduced. What was in, fact done, was that the State repaired the damage to those people&#x2019;s lands. The State provides those farmers with assistance for repairing the damage to their lands. Where plots have been flooded to such an extent that they cannot be restored, we shall consider giving them other plots, if possible. If the hon. member wants to know what measures have been taken, I can tell him that they concern the loss of crops. Loans will be made available to those people so that they may sow again. Now I want to ask the hon. member again, why he thinks I should make a statement to him on the matter. The hon. member was dissatisfied because I had not made a statement, but he should not think he is so important that <span class="col_5751-5752" refersTo="page_1339"/>someone has to make a statement on whatever enters his head.</p>

<p>I should like to come now to the hon. member for Von Brandis. I want to congratulate the hon. member on the speech be made here. It was a constructive one in regard to our problems in respect of the Common Market and the steps which should be taken. I want to assure the hon. member that steps have already been taken on various levels. They concern grading, phytosanitary measures, the naming of wines, and many other things as well. Steps are also being taken in regard to marketing. The KWV and some of our officials have just returned from Europe, and the officials of the Deciduous Fruit Board are over there at present. From time to time the Departments of Commerce and Industries, particularly the Department of Commerce holds discussions in order to secure for us as favourable as possible a position within the Common Market. At the moment I do not want to elaborate any further on this matter. The hon. member will of course realize that when one has to deal with a market such as the Common Market which can impose levies on one&#x2019;s products one may with the best will in the world smarten up one&#x2019;s marketing procedure as far as possible but if that Common Market imposes so many levies on one&#x2019;s products that one cannot get one&#x2019;s goods on the market the position can become impossible. These are some of the matters in respect of which we are negotiating with the Common Market. In respect of other matters raised by hon. members, matters which do not really have anything to do with the policy in the agricultural industry, the department will furnish detailed replies in writing. This also applies to representations made by hon. members.</p>

<p>However, I want to come back, once again, to the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from> 

<p>At the start of this debate I levelled the accusation at the hon. member that as far as agriculture was concerned, the United Party indulged in double-talk. I told him that when they arrived at certain places, they told the consumer that it was the fault of the Minister of Agriculture and of the Government that the price of consumer goods and food was so high. Then they talk about &#x201C;butter scandals&#x201D; and &#x201C;meat scandals&#x201D;. However, when they visit the farmers, the hon. member for Newton Park, for example, is sometimes in such a hurry that he nearly misses his aeroplane in order to go and tell the farmers how the Minister has failed to offer assistance to people who have been hit by floods and how the Government leaves the farmers in the lurch and does not ensure that they get decent prices for their products. The hon. member still owes this House something. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet put a very clear question to the hon. member. The hon. member said that the United Party&#x2019;s candidate in Brakpan had said that the stock withdrawal scheme was the cause of the consumer having to pay so much now and that the stock withdrawal scheme was costing the country R120 million. In addition, he said that the Government was giving the farmers R120 million not to farm, and thus to make the consumer pay high prices.</p>

<p>I do not want to know whether Civin was given the wrong information. The hon. member himself very often has the wrong information as well. I want to know whether the hon. member is prepared to say in public and also to this House not only that Mr. Civin was given the wrong information, but also that he does not at all agree with him in respect of that statement he made. The hon. member should repudiate that statement. If, in mitigation for Mr. Civin, the hon. member for Newton Park wants to submit that he was given the wrong information, he has every opportunity to do so. I do not blame the hon. member for trying to extricate himself. All I am asking, is that the hon. member for Newton Park should repudiate Mr. Civin and say that speaking on the wrong information, if the hon. member wants to put it that way, he made an absolutely untrue statement.</p>

<p>That is ridiculous.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not ridiculous. These are facts. After all, I have just mentioned a fact to the hon. member. And he is not prepared to deny this fact. The hon. member himself does this. When butter was exported at a lower price at the beginning of the year, the hon. member, together with the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, was the first to go to the Press and speak of a &#x201C;butter scandal.&#x201D; What, in fact, was the scandal in regard to this butter&#x003F; The scandal was that the hon. member had implied that the Government&#x2014;he did not say the Dairy Board&#x2014;was exporting butter to Iran at a lower price&#x2014;and immediately it is clear that the intention is in respect of Iran. He said the Government was exporting butter at a lower price to a country in the Middle East, while the consumers in South Africa had to pay more. This was the &#x201C;scandal&#x201D; to which the hon. member referred. However, the hon. member pleaded in this House for various agricultural products to be exported in order to stabilize the domestic price. Furthermore, he pleaded in this House that the Government subsidize the domestic price, and that when there was a surplus, the product be exported at a lower price. Surely that is only logical. However, when this is done, and it is possible for the hon. member to make some butter politics of the matter, which is going to be of no use to the housewife, he is quick to do so. If that butter which was exported to Iran, were distributed throughout South Africa, it would have meant a reduction of only half a cent or one cent on a pound. However, when the hon. member can make some butter politics, he plays Mr. Civin&#x2019;s game. Then he, too, has been given the wrong information. Then he also comes forward with the excuse that he has been given the wrong information. He does not say it, but this is the impression he wants to create. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Newton Park is the shadow-Minister of Agriculture on that side of this House. I do not want to take much notice of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. If one took notice of that hon. member, one would get nowhere. Because the hon. member for Newton Park holds this important position in the United Party, and if he hopes to become Minister of Agriculture in 20 or 30 years&#x2019; time, he should also accept his responsibilities in this House and put his party in its proper place. He should rise now and say that Mr. Civin had been given the wrong information and that he created an absolutely false impression in regard to the situation. Then the hon. member would be a man. However, I know he is not the man to do so, and therefore I shall leave him at that.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the half hour&#x003F; We approach this Vote following a private member&#x2019;s motion earlier this session and the Bill which is at present before a Select Committee. The latter eliminates from discussion today certain matters, including that of conscientious objectors such as the Jehovah Witnesses, and so on.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to deal with the Vote before us now against a broader background, against the background which faces the country as a whole and that of the neighbours who are friendly towards us with the problems which they face. For instance there are the problems which are faced by the Portuguese in Angola and Mozambique and by the Rhodesians in Rhodesia where pressures are building up against those territories or provinces. Those pressures are placing strains and creating dangers which we in this country have to face, just as we have to face the dangers on our own borders in the Caprivi and in <span class="col_5755-5756" refersTo="page_1341"/>South-West Africa, where there have been land mine incidents, where South African lives have been lost and where South African men have been wounded. It is an area which, I may say, I had the privilege, through the courtesy of this Minister and the Minister of Police, to visit during the recess, as I had the opportunity to visit Mozambique and see all three of the forward districts of Tete, Nyasa and Cabo Delgado, by courtesy of the Portuguese Embassy and the Portuguese authorities. Therefore, Sir, when I speak of these things, I speak about something which I have not only read about, but also on the information, as far as one is able to gather it, obtained by having been there and having talked to the people concerned&#x2014;both our own and those of our friendly neighbours. There is no doubt, as this House and South Africa know, that communist aid has been stepped up&#x2014;in arms, equipment and men. It is a fact which we have to face but a fact which seems to be ignored by dogooders in the Western countries. It also seems to be ignored by people who should know better, including churchmen who speak of the terrorists and what is going on there as &#x201C;freedom fighters&#x201D;. But we are better informed, and we in this country know what we are facing and what is behind it. We face, amongst these threats, the problems of the Indian Ocean, which again I do not need to deal with at length. They have been dealt with before and we know where we stand. The problem there is also one of getting understanding across to people who should be our friends. This then, Sir, is the background of threats against which we meet here this afternoon.</p>

<p>There is a brighter side in the development and progress of our own arms programme to counter the boycotts and the embargoes against us, the greater self-sufficiency that we are achieving, the glimmers of realization that the Cape route is of importance to other countries and not just to South Africa; the joint exercises in which the British Navy again took part last year, and the fact that we now have two submarines, with a third one to come out shortly. In passing I would like to congratulate the crews of those submarines on the magnificent way in which they have adapted themselves to form part of the defences of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the background. These are the facts which we have to face in South Africa. They lend to this Vote which is before us now an added importance from which we cannot escape, because every citizen of South Africa is concerned with the money which this House is now being asked to vote. This demands of every South African citizen a dedication and a determination to defend South Africa as one people, united in purpose, in intent and in willingness to sacrifice. I want to take this opportunity, against this background, to call upon those who support this side of the House, and to call upon all South Africans, to place the defence of our country, the defence of our nation, above personal feelings, above personal profit and above personal inconvenience. Whatever the provocation may he, whatever the bitterness or the hurt may be, or however deep it may go, the duty of every South African remains one of dedication to the security of our country and our nation. I appeal to national servicemen to accept the responsibilities and the inconveniences and the discomforts and the losses which they necessarily have to suffer. But I want to make another appeal, Sir. [Interjections.] I am not prepared to be diverted by the irresponsible and childish interjection of the hon. member for Carletonville. I want to make a special appeal to a group to whom I am going to refer later, and that is the volunteers in the South African Citizen Force. Many of them have spoken to me in recent weeks and before that. I know that many of them have been resigning, and that there are others who are unhappy. I want to appeal to them to stay in the Forces and to play their part, and I want to show in a moment why I believe that this is so important for South Africa. Sir, I have said this deliberately; I have said it because I want to indicate the spirit in which we on this side of the House approach the request which the Government is making to this House today to vote R335 million on Revenue Account, R3,2 million on Public Works for defence structures, and R8,7 million on Loan Account, a massive total of R347 million, which we are being asked to vote in a year of stringency, in a year of losses on the Railways and in the Post Office in a year of deficit budgeting and of cuts in Government spending. Here we are not cutting but increasing this Vote by R18 million. I want to say at once that we on this side of the House accept that increase. We accept it because we regard security and defence as one of the major priorities, without which we would be wasting our <span class="col_5757-5758" refersTo="page_1342"/>time talking about other things, because if there is no country that we control, if our defences should fail South Africa, then all the rest is a waste of time. But we as an Opposition have a duty, and I want to try to carry it out by querying and questioning some matters which flow from this Budget.</p>

<p>Dealing with expenditure I want to start with the amounts voted to Armscor, the Defence Equipment Fund and Arms Procurement. Armscor itself is big business today, with a balance sheet of R137 million, but at the end of 1970-&#x2019;71, according to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, it finished with a surplus of R44 million. The Defence Equipment Fund, which has spent R546 million on special defence equipment, finished that year with a surplus of R53 million, and Arms Procurement finished with R17 million, which has been set off against the Budget this year. That means a surplus of R97 million, as at the date of the last Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, that is available to us. What I want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether that surplus has now been spent, or whether in this Budget we are voting an additional amount of over R120 million towards these funds when there are idle surpluses invested at a low rate of interest which could be used to meet the correct requirements. It seems unnecessary, at a time of economic stringency, simply to build up credit balances if we have enough money available to purchase our requirements.</p>

<p>*Then there is the money spent on men and on machines and the question of the division of that money. When we look at the Budget, we find that there is a total of approximately R123 million which can be identified as money spent on the human element of our Defence Force. Then there is R202 million which is spent solely on equipment or machinery.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This division between men and machines is one which I believe has to be looked at very carefully. I find, for instance, that the expenditure on sport and recreation is a mere R150 000 out of a Budget of R335 million. This is an item affecting men.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I say again that this balance between men and machines is one which I believe we have to look at again. The task of this department is the task of turning R347 million of cash into security, and the way in which that money is turned into security depends to a large extent on the human hands which handle and control the machines. The responsibility for this expenditure rests on the accounting officer, the new Commandant-General, to whom I would like to extend our congratulations and our best wishes in this tremendous task. This is the first occasion on which he has been with us in his new official rank and I can assure him of our full support and all the influence we can bring to bear to make his task an easier one. If I could perhaps give him a motto for the task that lies ahead, it is the immortal words of a man who was himself a soldier&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;If you can keep your head, when all about you are losing theirs &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>That will be a task which all of us in South Africa will have to face&#x2014;to keep our heads when others about us may be losing theirs. I say again that in this task men, their availability, their morale, the way they are armed and the way they are used are the key factor. We have said before&#x2014;the hon. member for North Rand has raised this&#x2014;that the ideal would be to have a Permanent Force Brigade available to us&#x2014;always there, highly trained, well-equipped and intensely mobile. That is the ideal as far as dealing with what one might call &#x201C;grass fires&#x201D;, are concerned, the small blow-up here or the isolated blow-up there. But it is not the total answer to our security. <span class="col_5759-5760" refersTo="page_1343"/>That answer rests and will always rest in South Africa with the Citizen Force and with the Commandos. The Citizen Force depends and will continue to depend on its leadership, and the leadership will continue to depend on its volunteers. That was why I referred earlier in my remarks to the volunteer leadership in the Citizen Force. I sometimes wonder whether we have not allowed ourselves to make too many sums, to calculate that if &#x201C;X&#x201D; number of men are called up every year for ten years, at the end of those ten years you will have &#x201C;Y&#x201D; number of men and then you will have achieved your target. But it is no use saying&#x2014;Hey presto! There is my target! It is no use having 100 000 men under arms if those men are leaderless because it is the leadership which will determine whether they are of any use in the defence of South Africa. Plans on paper are not worth the paper they are written on, and the sums are not worth working out unless there are the people there to lead them when the time for action comes. National service leadership will help but it will help mainly at platoon level, with platoon commanders, and perhaps at company commander level. But above that your leadership cannot come from a ten-year national serviceman doing the amount of training that he does. It must come from the volunteer who is dedicated and who makes this his mission. Therefore, I believe that our first task is to ensure that this volunteer leadership corps is strengthened and built up and that it is recognized as the important factor that it is.</p>

<p>I believe that there are four things militating against it. The first is that the spread of training over ten years is too long, and that it is destroying unit spirit because it calls for too big a sacrifice from the volunteer officer. It calls for a sacrifice which rebounds on his private life, on his family life, and on his economy to an extent which makes it difficult for many of them to stay. I want to take as an example the camps, the normal full-time camp of 26 days which every serviceman attends every third year. Tn practice most firms give three weeks&#x2019; leave a year. Those extra five days mean that a person cannot take his normal annual leave for which he is paid to attend a camp. He must in addition take unpaid leave and if he must utilize extra leave, many firms do not pay him for that. I believe that the simple reduction from 26 to 21 days, which would not affect the efficiency of your training, would make a tremendous difference in the approach of people who only get 21 days leave a year. But when one raises these matters often the reaction is : &#x201C;Oh, you just want to cut down&#x201D;. But the effect all this is having is breaking the hearts of many of our commanding officers.</p>

<p>The result is, and I make this my second point, that many units today are sufficiently under-officered to have serious consequences on the operation of that unit. There is not a Citizen Force unit that I know of in South Africa which does not have a serious shortage of officers. This reacts on the men because there are not the officers to maintain the leadership and to give them training, and to maintain control. This leads to reaction amongst the lower ranks.</p>

<p>This leads to what I believe is the third problem, that the men lose interest. They come to regard their responsibilities as wasteful and as a petty annoyance, and so you get absenteeism, which according to figures given this session ran to over 1 300 people over a year who were find over R28 000&#x2014;all in one year. And that is only the fines in civil courts for absenteeism.</p>

<p>Tt leads, fourthly, to a situation where when a regiment is called up only some 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the actual men on the strength of that regiment attend that camp. The others receive deferment or exemption. You are therefore not getting a thousand men when a regiment attends a camp but you find only 200 or 350 available for that camp.</p>

<p>Now, it is easy to criticize but what are our suggestions&#x003F; I believe that the first thing should be to reduce the ten-year period to four years, but to maintain the same number of camps, so that the men come in every year for three years, or three out of the four years, and so maintain the link and contact with the unit and so counter the destruction of unit spirit, to which I referred. The officers know their men and the men get their commitment over within a limited time, when they are still younger, and then they can go out into civilian life without this continual feeling that next year or the year after he may not be able to nay the rent or his hire-purchase commitments for a month while he is in camp. I believe it will strengthen our forces tremendously and I believe that we could work out some &#x201C;sums&#x201D; on this and fit it in to achieve the same objective which we now have in mind. I believe we should reduce the 26 days for camps to 21 days; they <span class="col_5761-5762" refersTo="page_1344"/>would fit in with the normal leave. I believe that we should replace the non-continuous parades where a man simply comes on parade, attends roll-call and has his hair inspected and perhaps attends a lecture&#x2014; that we should replace them with two or three week-end bivouacs where they can do something useful and feel that they are part of the machine. If we have a war, we will have to fight on Sundays, because the enemy is not going to stop and it is nonsense that we should not use a long weekend to have a full three days bivouac. Defence, I believe, is something which should take place on 365 days a year, and would, if we were attacked. Therefore I believe bivouac over a long week-end replacing this monthly parade will do a great deal to raise morale and to change and improve the approach towards training. Fourthly, I believe we must look again at the nine months&#x2019; training to see whether we cannot make better use of the last three months of it which, although there has been an improvement, is still a source of continual complaint and dissatisfaction which, I believe, weakens morale. These are the practical things which I believe we can deal with to improve the manpower situation. If we look at this Budget we find that out of the increase of R18 million only R4 million is devoted to salaries and wages. I believe that we could spend more on the men, on their salaries and wages, on their transport to get home during their leave or during long week-ends and on their recreational facilities, so that we can get a more dedicated approach by all National Servicemen towards defence.</p>

<p>In the few minutes left to me, I want to deal with one or two aspects which other members will follow up or to which we may come back later. The first is the question of the Public Service Commission. The Defence Force, that is the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, does not like Government offices, work from 8 o&#x2019;clock to 4.30. You cannot apply to it the standards and ranks of the normal Public Service. One of the effects of this is that you get a top-heavy rank structure, because the only way you can pay a person what you need to pay him and what he deserves is by promoting him. You should be able to nay not simply the rate according to rank. Consequently you have to create a ton-heavy general and brigadier structure. But you should be able, within the Force, to have your own salary structure which complies with the requirements and with the duties and responsibilities of the different posts. Let me take another simple issue. Apprentices at Simonstown were granted an increase in January, 1971, that is 16 months ago, but they have not yet received it. They have not received it because there has been an argument between the Minister of the Interior and the Public Service Commission, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Defence. This has been going on since late in 1970. It was approved last year, but the arguments between the Public Service Commission and the Department of Labour have only been sorted out recently. I hope that these apprentices will now soon get their back pay. This is not the way to create good feelings. This is not the way to build up a feeling of dedication towards the job. I feel that this is an aspect which must be looked into.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the call-up in January before the matriculation results are known and before the boys know whether they have passed, whether they are going to the university or whether they have to go back to school. Then you get the sort of thing which happened this year with the Nuffield Week and with the matriculants. I believe that this is something which has to be investigated. The allocations themselves are still showing weaknesses. Take for instance the case of a merchant seaman. He is obviously a person who should belong to the Navy. We are not taking into account chaps who have done three or four years as merchant seamen crew; when they come back here they are attached to a commando unit. They have to guard petrol tanks or things of that nature. We must make the best use of the capabilities and the future occupations of the men. I raise it year after year and still I do not believe that we have achieved the objective. I do not know what the reason is, but the answer is obvious. It is to pay more attention to the training, the background and the aptitude of the men who are called up.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the question of the notification to parents of illness or accident to their children. There has been an improvement but it is still not right. I get continuous complaints from parents who say that they have only heard by accident that their son was in hospital. Many are told that he was not seriously ill and therefore they were not notified. You just try to tell a mother whose son is in hospital that he is not critically ill ! It seems a simple matter to notify a parent immediately a person is injured or goes into <span class="col_5763-5764" refersTo="page_1345"/>hospital. I take a thing like dental treatment where all a trainee can get is a temporary filling or an extraction. These boys are in for a year. In a year that temporary filling can lead to deterioration, so that he has to have major dental treatment. Surely, when you are spending R335 million, you can give a man a filling in his tooth instead of a temporary filling.</p>

<p>I refer to the delay in notification and the pathetic scale of compensation for boys killed or injured on duty. I do not have time to develop that, but it is something to which we will return. The workmen&#x2019;s compensation scale is a pathetic one for somebody who loses his life in the service of his country. I believe there is far too long a delay in finalizing affairs regarding funerals with the parents when there has been a death.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one of my colleagues will deal with civil defence. Another of my colleagues will also deal with vehicles.</p>

<p>I want to question the progress with Advokaat and with Decca. There have been delays in this regard. There has been an increase in cost. I ask the hon. the Minister to tell us what it is.</p>

<p>I want to make a plea for pistol clubs to be incorporated into civil defence and to be entitled to buy ammunition at cost price from Armscor, not for nothing but at cost price. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the start of this debate I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Admiral Hugo Biermann, the new Commandant-General of the South African Defence Force, on his appointment to this high office, and express the hope that as we got to know him in his long career of distinction in the South African Navy, his term of service in this high office will also hold nothing but the best for South Africa in the sphere of defence.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then, Mr. Chairman, I have the opportunity of congratulating another gentleman in this House, namely the hon. member for Durban Point. It is really a pleasure for me to congratulate the hon. member for Durban Point today on the most positive and most responsible speech he has ever delivered in this House on defence matters. I can only express the hope that the hon. member and his colleagues will proceed on these lines in future.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I believe that in view of the threat with which we are dealing, nothing could do more to discourage our potential enemies than a demonstration of unanimity on a matter as serious as defence. If our enemies were to gain the impression that discord and confusion prevailed amongst the population of South Africa, it would be like giving them the green light. For that reason it is my privilege to congratulate the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, an hon. member has just said: &#x201C;That is the kiss of death.&#x201D; I really want to draw that hon. member&#x2019;s attention to the fact that we are dealing with a very serious matter here today. I believe that members on that side of the House are intensely interested in the security of our country. I find it a pity that that hon. member could not restrain himself and nevertheless made such a remark. The hon. member for Durban Point and I disagree many a day, and I suppose we shall also disagree in the course of this debate. But I think we have one thing in common, and that is that we take a serious interest in the security of our country.</p>

<p>I said that if our enemies had to gain the impression that discord prevailed inside South Africa, it would be like giving them the green light to step up their activities. The new Commandant-General told us recently that the incidents of terrorism on our borders and in our neighbouring states would increase in the years ahead. This is the reality we are dealing with. I know that whenever one makes these statements voices are often heard to say: &#x201C;You are fanning a war psychosis.&#x201D; I want to express the hope that we shall not view it in this light today, but that we shall view it in deadly earnest as the reality in which we are living.</p>

<p>It is a source of joy to me to be able to say today that after many years of, I almost feel like saying, adversity which we have had in this sphere of convincing friendly Western countries of the gravity of the situation here, and after years of sustained efforts on the part of responsible leaders in our country to convey the reality of the situation to the greater world, a ray of light has filtered through in the sense that more and more people in positions <span class="col_5765-5766" refersTo="page_1346"/>of responsibility abroad, namely the Western world, no longer shrug off the security of Southern Africa, but have started to look at it with intense interest. On the occasion of a previous debate on the private motion of the hon. member for Middelburg earlier this year, I referred to the opinion of a person such as Gen. Kruls of Nato who, after an assessment of the situation on the southernmost point of the African continent, stated unambiguously that South Africa was to be brought into the defence set-up of Nato. He stated unambiguously that South Africa had an extremely important role to play in the joint defence of the Free World, apart from its own security. There were other opinions as well. There were not only opinions; there were also actions by friendly powers. I do not want to mention their names here today, but there were the actions of friendly powers who had started to see the gap in the Indian Ocean and the danger it created, not only to the Western World, but also to South Africa. They are prepared to proceed to taking action.</p>

<p>There is an increasing interest in our strategic situation. There is a rush of people with authority and knowledge to South Africa. This does not appear in the newspapers every day, but we who share that interest, are aware of it and come into contact with those people. They are coming to South Africa in increasing numbers in order to observe the position for themselves. Many of them do not hesitate to support the standpoint which we have emphasized persistently over the years.</p>

<p>That is why I say that in the midst of the hard realities of the situation we have, this is the ray of light. Today I want to pay homage specifically to the hon. the Minister of Defence as the person who has at all times persisted in drawing attention to this aspect in all quarters, here as well as elsewhere in the world. In this process the hon. the Minister suffered many undeserved set-backs and blows in other part of the world, sometimes in South Africa as well. But he did not only persist in that standpoint; in the administration of his department he also set the example which won him the confidence of our entire Defence Force. He practises what he preaches in the administration of his department. That is why one gets the testimony of a person such as Alan Forrest, who wrote as follows in the week-end edition of the <i>Cape Times</i> on 18th December, 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is due to this Minister that politics have been rigidly excluded from the country&#x2019;s armed forces and the result is the healthy atmosphere. All ranks have a deep respect for him and on his part he has ensured that they have the best equipment that money can buy. Mr. Botha appoints the best available man to executive rank and an example of this attitude is the appointment of Vice-Admiral H. H. Biermann to the head of the forces when Gen. Hiemstra retires very soon.</block>

<p>This is a testimony which also comes from inside South Africa. I believe that that view is shared in those quarters where the hon. the Minister has, also in countries abroad, persisted in stating our case and our standpoint. That is why we have progress in this sphere today. My time will not allow me to say much more and to deal with points raised by the hon. member for Durban Point. However, I just want to refer to one aspect. He mentioned salaries and facilities for the human factor in the Defence Force. I want to agree with the hon. member that one has to do one&#x2019;s utmost for the human element. However, I want to remind the hon. member of the fact that increases were announced two years ago, and that this Government has always shown that if and when it is necessary, it does give proper attention to this aspect as well.

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is a very happy day for me, because I can welcome in the discussion of the Defence Vote an old colleague with whom I served in the Defence Force for years, in war and peace, namely Admiral Biermann. It is a unique position which Admiral Biermann has to fill. As far as the organizations of defence forces of the Western world are concerned. I do not know of any admiral who has been set the difficult task of handling the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. The appointment has come in difficult times and it will most certainly be a challenge to him. I do not have the slightest doubt, however, that with his integrity and his ability he will perform that task in a commendable way. This is not only a feather in Admiral Biermann&#x2019;s cap, but I think we can congratulate the Navy as well. It is the youngest of our <span class="col_5767-5768" refersTo="page_1347"/>Defence Forces and in a short time the head of the Navy has been promoted to head of the Defence Force. I think we can congratulate the Navy on this as well. From this side of the House we wish Admiral Biermann all the best for the years ahead. We are sure that it will be a difficult time, but we are equally sure that he possesses the ability and the quality to handle this task.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Stellenbosch said, we are mainly being threatened from the north today. We cannot expect that threat to diminish. As long as there are do-gooders, people who should know better than to encourage these people, the threat will grow. We must take cognizance of the fact that there are people who have their eyes on Africa. The one bulwark with which they are faced is the Republic of South Africa. This red stream which I am talking about is the one which is now rapidly flowing through Zanzibar into Tanzania and from there into Zambia. When that railway line has been completed, we can expect that the people who will make use of that railway line will not all be railway workers. So we cannot expect that threat to diminish.</p>

<p>But there is another matter which worries us, and that is the position which is developing in the Indian Ocean today. As we all know, the British Navy, which occupied a very strong position there for years, is so weak and widely scattered now that it can no longer play the part which it played in the past. We also know that the Soviet Union is building up its naval forces in the Indian Ocean. We do not know what pattern it is assuming. We do not know where the emphasis is going to be placed, but we know that that power is growing stronger and stronger. Unfortunately for us it is here in the Fast that we are at our most vulnerable. The one commodity for which South Africa is still completely dependent upon the outside world is oil. We get our oil from the Middle East, across the Indian Ocean. With the equipment we have it is impossible for us to protect that route on our own. We ask ourselves at once: What are we doing to come to an agreement with people who have the same problem as we have&#x003F; I am thinking, for example, of the fact that we have countries east of us which should normally be very favourably disposed towards us, countries such as Australia and New Zealand, countries which have fairly strong navies. West of us we have the Argentine and, fortunately for us, mighty America. We know what the position has been up to now, that people have not been very favourably disposed towards us, but fortunately signs of change can be perceived, and it seems as if they are now realizing how valuable our strategic position here, and how valuable our harbours and technical resources in South Africa can be for them, as well as for us, in time of war. We hope that such a change will now take place. Now we ask : Is something being done&#x003F; Can something be done to come to an understanding with these people&#x003F; We do not have a strong understanding with Britain, but a similar understanding with the other countries would be of immense value to us. Since the arms embargo was lifted, the relations between South Africa and the British Navy have been excellent, and one would very much like to see the adjacent powers wanting the same relations with us. I ask: Is something being done to promote these good relations&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman. I would like to come back to one matter which my colleague from Durban Point has raised, namely the question of civil defence. We know that the Minister has quite a big staff at his disposal for handling civil defence. I have no doubt that they are doing good work. But the general public does not know what is going on. The general public does not know what these people are doing: they do not see anything being done, and what is worse is that I do not think the general public is in a position today to know what their task would be in an emergency. According to a reply from the hon. the Minister we seem to have officers in charge of Civil Defence at the various commands and we seem to have N.C.O.s, but unfortunately we also see that very few directives have been issued. Directives are still being drawn up. Public first-aid training programmes and demonstrations have been discontinued since 1971. Sir. I do not think that this is good enough. It is very important that we should have an efficient civil defence organization. It is very important that the general public should know what to do and where to do it in times of emergency, not only in time of war, but in times of disaster such as floods, fires and that sort of thing. With a staff like this it seems to me that there should be no difficulty in getting this machine going and showing the public that something is being done. I think I can say that the public is not happy about what is happening in the sphere of civil defence. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I want to concentrate more on local affairs and matters affecting the Defence Force, for which provision is made in this Budget. I appreciate the thoughts expressed by hon. members on the international situation. In the first place, I should also like to extend my very sincere congratulations to the Commandant General, Gen. Biermann, on his appointment to this post. I have already communicated with him on behalf of this side of the House.</p>

<p>Sir, a matter that it affords me great pleasure to bring to the attention of the House this evening, is the increased interest in the art of shooting evident in South Africa at all levels, and the interest in Defence Force affairs in all units of the Defence Force, and especially in remote parts, in commandos and other units. Sir, to give you an idea of this interest, I just want to refer to the increase in the number of persons participating in the national bisley, which is again in progress in Bloemfontein at the moment. This increase is attributable mainly to what South Africa has received through the agency of the hon. the Minister and his Department in the past five or six years. Since 1966 the number has risen from 424 to 740 this year. What is of particular importance, is that about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the members taking part in this bisley at present, are quite young members who have completed their national service, or who are taking part in this bisley as a result of an interest their fathers nurtured in them. That is what this House had in mind with all the benefits which the Government was asked for and which the Government granted. But another important reason for this is the weapon manufactured by Armscor&#x2014;our own RSA rifles. These rifles are of excellent quality; they compare with the best in the world, and South African as well as overseas marksmen are achieving absolutely brilliant results with these rifles. This achievement, which is attributable to a product manufactured by our own people, also contributes to this greater interest in the Defence Force. But, Sir, there is a problem I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister, and it is this : As a result of this greatly increased interest in shooting, it is found today that our Defence Force ranges are becoming too small to cope with the traffic on those ranges. I know that it has already been decided in principle to move the De Wet rifle range at Bloemfontein to another part of the site where it is situated today. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister, if it is at all possible in the light of our present financial position, to give priority to this within the next year or as soon as possible, and also to see to it that this range, which easily will have to handle numbers of 1 200 and more on occasion within the next five years, is planned in such a way that it will be able to accommodate 1 200 marksmen and more. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that there is so much interest in this matter that men in Bloemfontein have said to me in the past few days : &#x201C;If the hon. the Minister tells us tomorrow that we have the right to enter that site, then we should like to obtain his permission to sink a borehole there at our own expense, and also at our own expense to plant hundreds of trees there to provide shade and to beautify the site, especially in that part where the building will be erected for use later on.&#x201D; I therefore want to ask the hon. the Minister to give priority to this matter if possible.</p>

<p>Another matter that I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister by way of inquiry is this : I have heard&#x2014; and I think it has already been made known on a limited scale&#x2014;that consideration <span class="col_5771-5772" refersTo="page_1349"/>is being given to the establishment of a training college, which will probably be called the advanced staff college or combat college, and which will also be related to the existing army college. I would appreciate it very much if the hon. the Minister, when he replies to the debate, could perhaps give us more details, if it is possible to say at this stage what is being planned in regard to such an advanced staff college, and also where these various colleges will be situated and what is being planned in regard thereto. Connected with this there is the question of colonels&#x2019; posts and other senior posts which have become redundant to some extent in the past year, since the last session of Parliament, with the result that some of these gentlemen had to be accommodated in other spheres and that others will retire from the Defence Force in the normal way in due course. I wonder whether it will not also be possible for the hon. the Minister to give this Committee an indication of what the position is regarding the organization and/or reorganization of officers holding that rank and perhaps even higher ranks.</p>

<p>Then there is a last matter I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister, and this concerns drivers&#x2019; licences in the Defence Force. We have the situation in South Africa that a person can get a Defence Force driver&#x2019;s licence at the age of 17 years. That driver&#x2019;s licence enables him to drive light vehicles and under certain circumstances, heavy vehicles on provincial and other public roads, but as soon as he, without having a provincial licence drives on the same road in even the smallest car that he owns privately, he contravenes the Act and may be arrested. He must have a provincial licence to drive a private motor vehicle, but with a Defence Force licence he may drive on the same public roads without having a provincial licence. This creates confusion. I think this is unnecessary duplication, and I shall appreciate it if the hon. the Minister will repeatedly&#x2014;it is sure to be repeatedly&#x2014; make representations to the provincial authorities requesting them to give serious attention to working out a formula in accordance with which a licence that will also apply in the Defence Force may be issued, or, alternatively, that the Defence Force licence should be recognized for all purposes by the provincial authorities. Sir, the test set for a Defence Force licence is as difficult as, or more difficult or more intensive than, the test for a provincial licence. We have this ridiculous position today that a licence for which one has been properly tested, entitles one to drive military vehicles on our roads, whereas one is not allowed to drive a private vehicle on those roads. I think one of the most important factors in this difficulty is the R6 an applicant for a licence has to pay. I do not think that the amount that may be involved in this for the provinces is so large that it need cause a hitoh in any negotiations between the hon. the Minister and the provinces to find a uniform formula for these licences. I hope that the negotiations can be continued in the future and that this confusion will be eliminated, because I have had to deal with several court cases where youths were charged with driving a motor vehicle without a licence, and then they said to me: &#x201C;But, Sir, I have my Defence Force licence; I know I was told in the Defence Force that I had to obtain a provincial licence as well, but later on I forgot about it; after having driven military vehicles for nine months or a year, I became so used to it that I thought I was covered by a valid licence, and now they charge me because I do not have a provincial licence.&#x201D; I think it is time that confusion was eliminated, and I personally shall greatly appreciate it if the Minister can attend to this matter once again.</p>

<p>In this connection there is another matter which has been worrying me for a long time&#x2014;I have already brought it to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;and this is the large variety of vehicle models in our Defence Force. I do not know whether this is quite the right thing. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can give us a reply to this to reassure one a little, but I am of the opinion that a smaller number of models, for which a smaller variety of spare parts need be kept, could perhaps bring about a saving in costs.

<p>I should like to associate myself with previous speakers who congratulated Admiral Biermann on his appointment to the highest post in the Defence Force of South Africa. We all know that it is through his competence and gift of leadership that Admiral Biermann reached this very high position. I want to congratulate him and wish him every success for the future.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is only natural, since we are today discussing this most important Vote on <span class="col_5773-5774" refersTo="page_1350"/>which we are going to spend, within the next twelve months, the sum of R323 million for the defence of our country, that we should be calm and collected in our discussions here this afternoon. There is no need for anyone to become excited. We are very proud of the fact that here on the southern tip of Africa we today have the strongest army in Africa. We have certainly come a very long way to reach this high position which we hold as Whites in Southern Africa. Previous speakers have been discussing the Vote in general, and while we are all very proud of our army with its generals and our admirals and the personnel who are running the army and supervising everything to the best of their ability, we all acknowledge that there are areas where we can make improvements. One point which does worry me as a member of Parliament is the way many of our young men are being called up to do active service. As you know, our national servicemen are given preference in serving in South Africa&#x2019;s defence forces. In the first place we know that while they are still at school a guide is sent out to prospective servicemen to help them to fill in the questionnaire. This guide is very helpful. We know, too, that they are given a preference, and in many cases they are given a second choice as well as a third choice. There is nothing wrong with this. Many of our matriculant boys advise the selection board through the questionnaires what their preference really is. We know that the Navy is a very popular choice and so is the Air Force. We also know that these two services cannot accommodate all the boys who wish to go there. What disturbs me in the first place&#x2014;and this is something which causes trouble and confusion towards the end of each year&#x2014; is that when boys state in the questionnaire that they want to go to university, they clearly stipulate they would like to go to either the Navy, the Army or the Air Force, but that they would like to start approximately on the 8th January when the training normally commences; but invariably we find that boys who are not going to University and have not stipulated that they want to go to university are called up during that period and those who want to go to university are very often called up to start their training on about the 9th July, ending on the 17th June the following year. I believe this can be avoided. In East London, I have a lot of trouble towards the end of each year, in telephoning the Exemptions Board, the registering officer and his personnel in Pretoria, in order to try to clear up these problems. I must admit that the registering officer and his personnel are always very obliging indeed. They do all they can to assist one in solving this problem. They find themselves trying to make the best of a bad job, which should not have been necessary in the first place. I believe that there is something wrong with the selection board&#x2019;s review of the questionnaires which all boys have to fill in before leaving school. Then there is another matter I would like to raise. As I have said, I have had cases of boys wanting to join, the Navy and wanting to train for skindiving, simply because their fathers and their grandfathers were men of the sea, who themselves had served in the Navy, and because the boys themselves are very good swimmers. They have taken up swimming from an early age while at school and they have turned out to be champion swimmers for their particular area or even province. These people then ask to be allowed to take up skindiving. Some of these boys are notified that these posts have already been filled, but invariably you find that boys who have not even learned to swim, are accepted for skindiving. We have the old saying that you must first learn to walk before you can run, and surely you must first learn to swim before you can dive! These boys are going to do skindiving although they have never learned to swim or cannot swim very well. These are the problems which I believe we should try to solve. I know it is difficult when you have to call up between 23 000 or 25 000 young men for national service every year, but these are problems which I believe can be solved. I feel that all those in authority should do their best In trying to solve these problems.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I see that the amount of R5 000, instead of R3 000, is being requested for the coming year in respect of medals. This has made me look back at the beginning of our series of South African medals. I should very much like to draw attention to one or two of these exceptional medals or decorations with South African motifs, and then make a plea for the supplementation of our series of military decorations and medals. When we look at the decorations and medals of our Defence Force, one of <span class="col_5775-5776" refersTo="page_1351"/>the two most attractive ones to me is the Cape of Good Hope decoration.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, this decoration is the highest South African decoration. It can be awarded for signal acts of valour on the battlefield. It is made of gold and is in the shape of a five-pointed star, representing the Castle of Good Hope. The obverse has the very interesting point of a raised centre depicting the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck in his flagship, <i>Dromedaris,</i> in Table Bay. The scene is surrounded by a wreath of proteas and leaves.</p>

<p>*This is as typically South African a decoration as we can get. Furthermore, one of the most attractive decorations, which was introduced in the fifties, is the Southern Cross medal. This medal, which may be awarded in times of peace or war in recognition of exceptional conscientiousness, has already been awarded to several hundreds of members of the Defence Force. This is also typically South African; the obverse is in navy blue enamel and depicts the night sky with the stars of the Southern Cross in silver. It is something out of the ordinary to see this on the uniform of a member of the Defence Force at ceremonial parades.</p>

<p>Whenever we have very great occasions in our country&#x2014;I am thinking, for example, of the past two Republic festivals; the first one in Pretoria and the second one here in Cane Town last year&#x2014;it strikes one that on neither of these occasions the Defence Force had a special medal struck to be awarded to every member of the Defence Force who took part in the proceedings on that occasion, whether on land, in the air or at sea. I think it would perhaps be a good idea if on the occasion of the next Republic celebrations special medals were to be struck and awarded to all members of the Defence Force taking part in the celebrations, especially those members of the Citizen Force and Commandos who will perhaps have that privilege only once.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to put forward the suggestion to the hon. the Minister that, especially in view of the fact that at present our youth are showing exceptional interest in the Defence Force and everything connected with it, a colour-illustrated chart of all our medals and decorations should once again be published, especially for high schools and units where national servicemen are receiving training. That would be very informative.</p>

<p>The second matter I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister is the matter concerning the instructors in our Defence Force, who are rendering such an outstanding service to our Fatherland in the training of these thousands of national servicemen. These instructors from the very important point of contact between the officers and the national servicemen, who are left in the hands of these men virtually straight from their parental homes. Every year I have intimate contact with many hundreds of these national servicemen, and I want to say that I have never heard any national serviceman saying an ugly word about our instructors. This goes for the Army as well as the Air Force and the Navy. But there is no way in which the corps of instructors may be identified. By and large they wear the same uniforms and badges as do other members of the Defence Force. When they are in civilian clothes, there is also nothing by which they may be identified. To what extent one may grant recognition to these people, more than mere financial remuneration only, I cannot say at this specific moment. But I just want to tell the hon. the Minister and this House that the corps of instructors is doing wonderful work, and that some or other tangible way of recognizing the good service rendered by them, would probably stimulate them to further effort and strength.</p>

<p>The third point I want to submit for consideration by the hon. the Minister, is the return to the horse in our commandos where such opportunity offers and where the terrain permits. One of the commandos that falls under my constituency, the very good commando of Bronkhorstspruit, brought the horse into their training programme a few years ago. I can tell the House that horses were extremely popular until the commandos started encountering problems. It was especially the young men of the town, who did not have the opportunity of learning the art of horseback-riding, who kept horses on the shooting range. Stables were also built. What is most significant to me in this whole set-up, is that this commando achieved very good results with their night exercises against &#x201C;terrorists&#x201D; in the wooded area to the east of Bronkhorstspruit in the direction of Cullinan. Unfortunately, this practice had to be stopped because of problems that were experienced. If we look at our extended frontier-line, following the course of the Limpopo River along the border of Botswana from Gaberones up <span class="col_5777-5778" refersTo="page_1352"/>to Messina and beyond, I am reminded of the saddle-horse which played such a special role in the military history of this country. One thinks of famous warhorses such as Flew and Somerset and the thousands of chargers that died with the burghers and the combatants on both sides in the Anglo-Boer War. One also thinks of the monuments erected to horses in our country. There is one in Windhoek; there is Gen. De Wet&#x2019;s horse in Bloemfontein and various other splendid equestrian statues. I think I have also seen a very fine statue in Port Elizabeth or East London. That goes to show that the horse is connected with the army in our country. If the horse could be introduced in the commandos in some way or other, it would be able to operate very usefully, especially in the wooded area on the northern border of the Transvaal. The advantage of a saddle-horse in the bush is that it does not make a noise, which cannot be said of a jeep, a land-rover, or a helicopter, irrespective of how useful those helicopters may be. I do not think that a landmine would easily explode under the four legs of a horse. What is significant, is that it can move quietly and is also effective at night. I should very much like to submit this suggestion to the hon. the Minister and the Army Command so that the saddle-horse may be brought back in its traditional role wherever it is opportune to do so.</p>

<p>As far as the staff is concerned, there is only one matter which I also want to raise with the hon. the Minister and the Supreme Command on behalf of retired members of the Defence Force who have re-entered the service, namely the case of persons who performed specialized duties, such as the work of a sergeant-major, which cannot easily be performed by two, three or four newcomers to a post. When that retired person is re-employed, he often has to do exactly the same work at the same desk or table when he voluntarily applies for a post and is reappointed. The basic problem is that that person&#x2019;s remuneration is so much less in such a case I know that this is in keeping with the provisions of various regulations and rules, and this is probably correct, but I believe that there are exceptions Some of these people render valuable services to the Defence Force in what are virtually key posts. By those means manpower is saved and other men can be released for doing other routine work. Therefore I actually have no hesitation whatever in asking the hon. the Minister to adapt that policy, which is rather rigid at the moment, in such a way that, in a case where a person rendered exceptional service for 20 or 30 years and comes back for three, four or five years to do the same work and in doing so releases other men for doing other useful work, such oases may be reconsidered on merit so as to see whether such a person may not come closer to the remuneration he received at the time of his retirement.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, by this time it may be a little late in the day, but I do feel the need to associate myself with some of the previous speakers and to convey to Admiral Biermann my congratulations and those of my constituency on his very special promofor a considerable time. We are privileged tion. Every one of us has the utmost confidence in him. Most of us have known him to have in this man and his wife two dignitaries who will truly be able to occupy their high positions with dignity and distinction. On behalf of my constituency I should like to wish them a very long period of service and may their road which lies ahead be a smooth one and not become too bumpy.</p>

<p>Another heartfelt need I have is to express to the hon. the Minister and his department my appreciation of the wonderful work done at the Danie Theron military school in respect of the restoration and conversion of the old Alexanderfontein Hotel. It is a place which is very rich in history. In pursuance of the many anecdotes I have heard from older people. I have often thought that it would probably be very interesting if one could find someone who might have the necessary information to record the history of that special place for us with reference to the restoration of the hotel. Some of us know it to some extent and others may hardly be aware of its existence. That is where there were diamonds in abundance. They made that area gleam and there was money in abundance as well as other things. In contrast to the stormy days that old place saw, we have discipline and order today. What I am particularly pleased about is that the restoration actually served three purposes. In the first place, that historical building was preserved, I believe, for posterity. It was converted into the Jack Hinden officers&#x2019; mess. I hope I am not wrong <span class="col_5779-5780" refersTo="page_1353"/>and the hon. the Minster will probably tell me whether or not I am. In the second place it serves a special purpose. There were times at the commencement of that work when particularly comfortable accommodation was not available for the officers. For that reason we are particularly grateful because this building again is in a position today to occupy a very worthy place and play a role ini the lives of our men of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>I just want to express another idea here which is constantly in my mind, and that is that we must get away from the idea that our Defence Force exists solely for safeguarding our individual and joint lives and to protect them against onsloughts on the borders of our country or merely to protect our material possessions. To me it really goes further than that. The way I want to express this is to say that if one has a strong Defence Force, one which is worth its salt and which demands respect, it may also serve as a means of making the enemy keep its distance. In that case the enemy will not readily take up arms against one. However, a strong Defence Force also promotes a strong economy. The economy is promoted to a very large extent through trade and negotiation with other countries outside a country&#x2019;s borders. A country&#x2019;s growth is not derived solely from within that country itself but also from its trade with other countries. Through that a country grows strong and through that the world becomes aware of the economic strength of a country. That causes other countries to look at one&#x2019;s country with eager eyes and ardent desire. But such a country will not readily take up arms against one when it knows that one has a strong Defence Force. I think it is definitely worthwhile to inculcate this idea in all our people.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to express my appreciation of the particularly fine spirit which has prevailed in this debate up to this stage. I want to agree with the hon. member for East London North that when one is discussing an important matter such as this and when there is so much at stake, one has to do so calmly and dispassionately.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to associate myself with the other hon. members on this side of the House in extending my congratulations to Admiral Biermann on his promotion to this very, very high rank. I feel that the experience Admiral Biermann will bring to bear in this position will bear fruit and I feel sure that he will not fail South Africa. I have great confidence in his future as chief of our forces in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point has pointed out to us here the serious position that we face in our country today on our borders. We are told that the position is not going to improve, but rather escalate over the years. It is a position that we in South Africa have to take note of. One listens to the radio and reads the papers, and one is disappointed to find that countries overseas, which are probably very ill-informed, are lending support to so-called &#x201C;freedom fighters&#x201D; and so-called &#x201C;oppressed people&#x201D; on our borders. One wonders whether they really know what they are doing. But we are also faced with inroads from Communist China and the infiltration of Russia in their very subtle way of peaceful penetration. These things we have to face in this country of ours. Therefore, it is necessary for us to be prepared.</p>

<p>We are apt to think lightly of the &#x201C;bright side&#x201D; of war. Of course we all know, those of us who have had the experience, that war is a complete waste in every way. The money you spend on war machines and war products is really unproductive; but it is an insurance policy as far as a country is concerned, and the responsibility is upon us to produce the best fighting force that we can put in the field. Coming to that, one looks at the Estimates. I want to refer to the provision made here for mechanical transport. We find that a substantial amount, nearly R5 million, is going to be spent. Over R5 million was spent last year on mechanical transport. We find that the very substantial amount of R2144 000 has to be spent on motor spares in order to maintain this transport. Then we find under sub-head R&#x2014;Contribution to Defence Special Equipment Account, that an amount of R3 787 000 is going to be spent on technical and fighting vehicles.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned last night, I was dealing with subhead K&#x2014;Mechanical Transport&#x2014;and an item under subhead G, namely the purchase of spare parts. I then went on to subhead R and dealt with the purchasing of new technical and fighting vehicles, as well as subhead S, namely the procurement of armaments. If you look at these items, Mr. Chairman, you find that these various subheads deal respectively with the purchase of vehicles, the purchase of vehicles and spares, and again the purchase of vehicles and spares. Under subhead S&#x2014;Procurement of Armaments&#x2014; one finds too that a very substantial amount of something like R19 million is to be set aside for the purchase of vehicles. The point I should like to make is this : Why is it that we have these items split up in this way&#x003F; Surely, bearing in mind the policy that the purchase of armaments should come under one head, these various items should be consolidated and placed under the subhead dealing with the procurement of armaments&#x003F; At the moment we seem to be making provision for vehicles under certain subheads and for the purchase of equipment and spares under other subheads. Seeing that we have the Armaments Board, constituted in the way it is today, I feel it is time to centralize purchasing under one Head. If this were done, I am sure we would get a better deal.</p>

<p>A further point which arises from this very substantial purchasing of vehicles, is the following : When one travels around, one sees large parking lots of army vehicles. One wonders what is done about the maintenance of these vehicles. I was in Europe a few years ago, and was shown one of the large vehicle parks run by the Americans. The park was about 2&#x00BD; miles long and very wide, and it was a pleasure to find that every vehicle there was jacked up, and that there was a system according to which each one of these vehicles was started up periodically in order to check the batteries. One finds that if vehicles stand for a long time, they are susceptible to rust. There is condensation and rusting in the cylinders, the gearboxes and the differentials. If these vehicles are not constantly moved and properly looked after, you are asking for trouble. I should like to ask the Minister how long it will take him to get all these vehicles on the road in the case of emergency. From my own experience, I would say that from the way these vehicles are standing, it would take him an extra two to three weeks to get many of these vehicles on the road. It is very disappointing to find considerable amounts of costly equipment lying there, and not being cared for properly, either as a result of a shortage of staff, or for other reasons. I feel that if the Army cannot look after this equipment, they should have it done on a contract basis. They should make known their specifications and what they want done for the maintenance of these vehicles while they are laid up; I am fairly certain that they would find a contractor who would do the work for them, and look after these vehicles. This equipment must be kept properly so that it can be mobilized at very short notice. As I have said, you find proper maintenance of this type carried out in Europe, in the NATO parks. The equipment is kept practically on a 24-hour alert.</p>

<p>There is a further disappointing feature. I refer to standardization of equipment. I saw one unit moving recently, and I counted six different types of vehicles in that particular unit. Certain vehicles, of course, were fighting vehicles, and I shall not include them. In the case of what one could call second- and third-line vehicles, however, we counted two or three types. We know from experience that to maintain such a unit in the field is well-nigh impossible. Your maintenance units would have to carry an enormous amount of spares and the casualty in vehicles would be extremely high if there were no spares. When I returned from Rhodesia I passed some of the convoys coming back from the last big manoeuvres, and I counted 21 vehicles stranded along the roadside, four of them of different types. There were no spares for them, and recovery vehicles had to be sent all the way from Pretoria to <span class="col_5783-5784" refersTo="page_1355"/>tow these vehicles back. That gives you an idea of the position. One recovery vehicle had spares for only one make. I spoke to these chaps in charge and asked them : &#x201C;Why do you not get these vehicles going&#x003F;&#x201D; They replied: &#x201C;We have no parts; we shall have to tow these vehicles in.&#x201D; All those vehicles were casualties.</p>

<p>Vehicles which break down become non-effective, and in order to maintain an army in the field today, one has to have standardization. Our experiences during the Second World War were that, in order to maintain standardization, we had to withdraw considerable numbers of vehicles from the field, and replace them with other vehicles. This had to be done simply from the point of view of spares maintenance. Therefore I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to bear this in mind. He is building up his equipment resources, and in order to have a high standard, there has to be a high degree of standardization. If this is not done, we are going to find ourselves in trouble. Once again, too. I should like to make an appeal in connection with vehicles which are laid up: every care should be taken with their maintenance. I know it is impossible to use all these vehicles and that they must be put in vehicle parks. At the same time, however, there must be a high standard of maintenance so that they can be made available at short notice. The Minister may say to me : &#x201C;We do not have the staff.&#x201D; That is no excuse. If that is the case, we must either stop purchasing vehicles or we must allow private contractors to undertake this maintenance.</p>

<p>I have been told, Sir, that it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to spread its orders amongst the various motoring firms, in order to ensure a spread of the money which is being spent, and that this is the reason for the purchasing of various types of vehicles. Sir, that is false economy: it is wrong. The Government must find a suitable vehicle and then standardize, whether they can obtain other vehicles of a similar type or not. There is no point in buying different types of vehicles, because if those vehicles have to go into the field, we shall find ourselves in real trouble.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to tell the hon. member who has just sat down that we are doing exactly what he is pleading for with regard to the maintenance of vehicles. There are different types in the Defence Force, and the reason for that is, firstly, that over the years we had a boycott against us and, secondly, up to a number of years ago we did not have the policy of standardization. We have now accepted that policy, and we are doing exactly what the hon. member has pleaded for.</p>

<p>Sir, I wish to express my appreciation for the good wishes extended to Admiral Biermann, since he is not able to speak here for himself. I want to add that the fact that the Government entrusted this important post to him shows that we also have the fullest confidence in his capabilities. I am convinced that, like his predecessor, he will be able to depend on the capable support of the various members of the Supreme Command and the senior officers of the Defence Force. Furthermore, Sir, I am happy to say that just a little while ago we succeeded in retaining the valuable services of Prof. Samuels as the head of our Armaments Organization for a further period of five years. I wish to express my appreciation for the fact that Prof. Samuels agreed to place his services at our disposal for another five years. With Admiral Biermann and Prof. Samuels at the head of affairs, I think we can look forward to the future with confidence.</p>

<p>Hon. members on both sides, especially the hon. members for Durban Point, Stellenbosch and North Rand, referred to the threat against South Africa and Southern Africa as whole. That threat should not be seen as a threat directed only against Southern Africa and as a threat that owes its origin to the actions of the various countries in this part of the Continent. It is a threat against Africa in the first place. It is a fight on the part of communism to control Africa and, through the control of Africa, to overthrow Europe. Furthermore, it is a threat directed through Africa and through Europe against the Western and the whole Free World. Even in his time the late Pres. Kennedy quite correctly stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The greatest threat to the West is of being nipped to death in conditions of nuclear stalemate.</block>

<p>Sir, that must always be kept in mind in dealing with the problem of this threat against Southern Africa and the Republic of South Africa. This threat against South Africa and the broader threat against Southern Africa is part of the threat against <span class="col_5785-5786" refersTo="page_1356"/>the whole Free World; it is part of a greater strategy directed against the forces of civilization. To the north of us we have to deal with the growing effort of forces determined to increase the menace of revolutionary warfare and gradually to undermine our will-power to oppose it. The possibility of an escalation of this revolutionary effort in future cannot be excluded. The hon. member for North Rand quite correctly referred to the possible escalation of this revolutionary effort after the conclusion of the work at present being done on the Tanzam Railways and the different road networks. Moscow and Peking and their satellites, as I have said, are busy with the application of a world strategy. That strategy includes the military threat, the straightforward economic challenge, intimidation by sea-power, the political challenge and diplomatic action, but lastly, there is the revolutionary challenge in most Western countries, while there is no challenge on the part of the West in communist countries. To counteract that strategy, we should dedicate ourselves to the creation of an opposing will. I have pleaded for this on different occasions in this House in the past. We should counteract that strategy by dedicating and preparing ourselves to create an opposing will in more than the military field. To attain that devotion we must educate public opinion and counter communist propaganda, not by competing with communist propaganda in trying to out-communist Communism and its fellow-travellers, but by being prepared to create counteraction and sending out a different message to the world. There are signs, Mr. Chairman&#x2014; encouraging signs&#x2014;in the Free World that the position of South Africa and Southern Africa is better understood today than before. Secondly, it is being realized more and more that the Cape sea route and a stable Southern Africa are of the utmost value to those countries which depend on &#x00BD; million tons of oil carried around the Cape of Good Hope every day. But I do not think it is in the interest of South Africa at this stage to say too much about these encouraging signs. I think we should rather approach these matters in a different way&#x2014;by individual discussions and discussions at Government level.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for North Rand asked what we were doing towards coming to an agreement with countries which have the same interests as we have. My reply to him is, firstly, that we are making facilities available for the defence of our friends as well. While there was a boycott against us and while there was a total effort, on the part of friendly countries as well, to deny us arms, we did not hesitate to take the necessary steps in respect of our maritime defence to create facilities which we regard as essential for the defence of our friends as well. Let me mention a few: the establishment of the Maritime Headquarters, which is an enormous big project involving several millions; the establishment of a submarine base, which is intended not only for us, but which offers facilities to others as well; the extension of our harbour facilities; the improved navigation system; the Decca navigation system, which has been referred to here and about which I shall say more later; the building-up of our Air Force and, within our limited means, the modernization of our Navy. We have taken those steps, sometimes with great sacrifice and sometimes in the face of boycotts which denied us these essential things. But today we can look back upon the success we have achieved over the past years and great milestones we have reached in the sphere of providing facilities to possible friends. Somebody said quite rightly: &#x201C;Our trade routes will continue to be secure only as long as we give clear evidence of our intention to protect them.&#x201D; By its actions and the preparations it makes, South Africa should also place itself in a position where it can convince others that it wants to play its part in the defence of the West and of the Free World. Secondly, my reply to the hon. member was that we were continuing to fulfil our commitments under the Simonstown Agreement in letter and in spirit, and the best contribution we can make in order to convince people that it is in their interests to co-operate with us, is to honour our part of the agreement. Thirdly, we are prepared to conduct discussion on the service level, as well as on a higher level, by exchanging information; this we are in fact doing; and by joint exercises we can encourage mutual trust between friendly countries. In that regard we have also made progress. Fourthly, we let no opportunity pass by of advocating and promoting the possibilities of greater maritime and other co-operation in the Southern Hemisphere, but I do not think it is desirable to conduct a public debate on this aspect either. In my opinion it would be a mistake to spell out everything in detail, except to say that it cannot be expected of South Africa to <span class="col_5787-5788" refersTo="page_1357"/>carry out long-distance sea reconnaissance alone. It is not South Africa&#x2019;s burden alone; the burden of long-distance sea reconnaissance in the Southern Hemisphere is the burden of others as well, and it would pay the West and the Free World to carry out long-distance sea reconnaissance jointly with and with the inclusion of South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Durban Point spoke about delays and the high cost of Decca and Advokaat. The Advokaat project, as is of course well known, is the new maritime headquarters connected with Walvis Bay and Durban as advance bases. The fact is that I think his figures and his statements are not quite correct.</p>

<p>*As far as Advokaat is concerned, this was an undertaking of very great magnitude. As I have said, many millions were spent on it. There has been a delay of six months, which is not long in such a big undertaking. I think priceless work has been done and I am assured that the cost&#x2014;I have the figure here&#x2014;is minimal, that is to say, the extra cost as a result of this delay. The increase in cost is a minimal one. I shall give it to the hon member personally. But if everything goes well, we hope to have the Advokaat project completed by October, and then the hon. member may come to take a look at it.</p>

<p>Then there is Decca. All the construction work has been completed. Receivers have been installed in ships. The installations of the Air Force have progressed far. Maps have reached the completion stage. I am referring now to the maps which may be used by all. I do not want to say anything about the other aspect. There has been an increase in cost and a delay because we tried to use local content for the project, and eventually we had to revert to certain imported parts. I understand the cost involved in the project is still below the figure originally estimated.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it should be the Armaments Board. There again the hon. member is not correct. In the first place there is a vast difference between Armscor and the Armaments Board. The Armaments Board is a board which deals with the acquisition of and the application of several tests in the production of arms. Secondly I am informed that there are no surpluses in the usual sense of the word.</p>

<p>*What happened, was that the money which had been made available to the Armanents Board, the &#x201C;Krygstuigraad,&#x201D; those so-called surpluses, was money in respect of which commitments had already been entered into and which had been temporarily invested with the Public Debt Commissioners to be used as soon as it had to be paid out. There was no question of large-scale surpluses.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There are no large-scale surpluses, as the hon. member suggested. It is wrong to talk of surpluses in that sense. But what I do want to say to the hon. member is this. The principle of building up a surplus is not wrong. The late Mr. Havenga did so in his time already.</p>

<p>&#x2020; He created a Special Defence Account for unforeseen circumstances and during the years we used the money in the Special Defence Account to such an extent that the funds are very low at present, and I am against that. I am all for creating a proper and strong Special Defence Account for unforeseen circumstances, and I hope the hon. member agrees with me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in normal circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But he should make a clear distinction between the Special Defence Account and the money on hand which is to be used to meet accepted commitments as soon as deliveries take place. In regard to the delivery of arms, the hon. member knows that delays sometimes occur, delays of a few months or longer. These things are sometimes influenced by strikes or by delivery problems in other <span class="col_5789-5790" refersTo="page_1358"/>countries. All these things have an effect on the amount that is kept available, and this is the reason why that amount appears there.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to money being spent on men as opposed to machinery or arms. I am glad the hon. member raised that. I want to dwell on that question for a while today. There is a wrong impression in several quarters in the country that we spend money only on armaments and not on people. But let us look at the Budget before us. I have glanced briefly at just a few of these aspects. If you look at Loan Votes M and K, you see that, to begin with, literally millions are appropriated for operational buildings and housing.</p>

<p>The operational buildings and housing are aimed directly at facilitating matters for the people in the Defence Force by creating more favourable conditions for them. In addition to that, the Government has agreed to 100 per cent loans for all members of the Defence Force. We are gradually implementing that principle. In addition to what the Departments of Community Development and Public Works are doing, an amount of approximately R5 million is being spent by the Defence Force&#x2019;s own sections in order to create favourable living conditions for the members of the Defence Force. R94 million has been provided for salaries; almost R2 million has been provided for medical services &#x2014;free medical services are supplied to members of the Defence Force; R1 400 000 has been provided for subsidies and financial assistance. In the course of the debate reference was made to dental services. I agree with hon. members; I, too, think that these services should be provided, and not only temporary fillings. This is a matter we are still attending to and I have full sympathy with it, because I think it is right.</p>

<p>I want to come to another aspect in regard to the treatment of the people. We are making progress with our division for the utilization of leisure time, our sport division, our psychological services division, which falls under the Surgeon-General, and our welfare division. All these divisions&#x2014;sport, utilization of free time, psychological services and welfare services&#x2014;are aimed at making the people in the Defence Force happier. I just want to mention a few examples. In the past two years the sport division offered 100 short courses which were attended by 11 000 members of the South African Defence Force. Since this sport division was established a few years ago, we have already produced 120 Springboks and/or national champions. We have produced 700 provincial sportsmen, and 42 officially recognised types of sport are played in the Defence Force today. Then it is said that we do not pay attention to the way the people spend their leisure time ! Indoor sport is also offered.</p>

<p>The division for the utilization of leisure time is under the charge of an extremely capable officer. I personally went to see what they were doing in order to ensure good utilization of leisure time by the young men in the evenings and after hours, and I was impressed by the tremendous programmes they are carrying out.</p>

<p>There is the psychological services division, which is doing splendid work and which is concentrating more and more on placing the boys in such a way that they follow a natural direction which fits in with their aptitudes. This division is under the charge of extremely capable people. There are our chaplain services; there are fulltime chaplains, representing all denominations, as well as part-time chaplains. These people are of inestimable value to the South African Defence Force. I want to pay tribute today to the chaplains of all the denominations&#x2014;I had the privilege off meeting them at a conference here recently&#x2014;for the great work they are doing in regard to our Defence Force.</p>

<p>Therefore it is not correct to say that we are neglecting the people; the reverse is nearer the truth. Let me give an example. 31 per cent of our Budget is spent on staff services in some or other of these forms. In a country such as Germany, whose armaments are supplied by other countries, because it is not allowed to produce its own, it is 38 per cent. That is a very good comparison. Besides, the morale of the Defence Force depends not only on the services provided to the staff in the personal sphere, but also on something else, namely the quality of the armaments given to them. I want to suggest that in spite of all the obstacles in our way, we have accomplished a tremendous amount in the past year in respect of making proper armaments available to our people. However, this is also the aspect which causes the Budget to increase so much. This is the headache of every ministry of defence in the world today. I am talking now of the high costs of armaments which escalate <span class="col_5791-5792" refersTo="page_1359"/>year after year. It is not our fault, but due to world circumstances. It is the tremendous increase in knowledge in the technological age which is making armaments more sophisticated, which has doubled the price of aircraft within 10 years and which has more than doubled the price of ships. It is this escalation in costs which has caused the Defence Budget to increase quite disproportionately.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Durban Point referred to the question of the notification to parents of their children&#x2019;s illness. I can only say that I fully agree with him. Only a fortnight ago I again requested the Commandant-General to give an instruction in this connection, because I also received complaints. I do not think it is due to commanding officers neglecting their duty; it is due rather to the form in which they notified parents. In serious cases the parents are immediately notified but in less serious cases they do not always tell parents that their sons are in hospital. As far as possible this will be done in future in every case, whether it is serious or not. Instructions in this regard have been given.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of pistol clubs. I am sorry, but we cannot take over the pistol clubs. We have enough work to do as it is; moreover, I think this is a Police matter. I do, however, have sympathy in regard to one aspect of this matter &#x2026;</p>

<p>Can Civil Defence not take it over&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, even Civil Defence cannot take it over. Since January of this year we have reduced the price of ammunition by about 25 per cent and these pistol clubs now share in these cheaper prices. It is furthermore against our policy to do retailing ourselves. I will take this matter up with the Minister of Police, but I would prefer that the hon. member first speak to the Minister of Police, who is responsible for these pistol clubs. As far as we are concerned, I do not think we want to take them over.</p>

<p>*I now come to the hon. member for Potchefstroom, who raised several important matters. In the first place he referred to the encouragement of the art of shooting. In the past few years we have promoted this with the greatest dedication. I personally am very sympathetic towards it and today much more time is spent on it during exercises. Instructions have been issued that the young men should shoot more and that there should be more practices. This is in fact being done. It also keeps our armament factories busy. In other words, I have the fullest sympathy with the basic statement of the hon. member. As regards his reference to shooting ranges, I just want to say to him that I think we in South Africa can consider ourselves fortunate in so far as shooting ranges are concerned, because in Europe the problem as regards shooting ranges is much bigger than here. The particular shooting range to which the hon. member referred, the De Wet range, is one for which I have a great deal of sympathy and I should like to help if I can obtain the money. I cannot always obtain the money, but if the persons concerned want to proceed to drilling the borehole and planting the trees in the meantime, they may do so with pleasure. We shall then come into the picture at a later stage. I realise the necessity of enlarging that range.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the advanced defence college, and I should like to make a brief statement now on the possibilities of having an advanced defence college. The need for a joint Defence Force institution for higher military education has crystallised in the course of time and has been intensified by the new system for the training and development of future officers of the Permanent Force, a system that was introduced in 1970. According to this system, the officer receives his basic moulding and academic training at the Academy and his professional training in the schools of his own arm of the Defence Force. Further development to qualify him for the responsibilities of taking charge of a unit and of doing staff work within his own arm of the Defence Force, takes place at the respective Army, Air Force and Naval colleges. The function of the South African Defence College will be to prepare the more senior officers of all three arms of the Defence Force, from commandants upwards, for senior commanding and staff posts on a joint basis. Two courses are envisaged : A joint staff course of 21 weeks for 24 students for the purpose of extending the training of selected officers for senior commanding and staff appointments by a study of joint operations, advanced military management and related aspects of national and international security against the background of <span class="col_5793-5794" refersTo="page_1360"/>functional strategy. Then there is a second course, namely the national defence course. This course is envisaged for the future. The duration and number of students must still be determined. The aim is to hold a study course in which selected staff from other State and semi-State departments which play a part in ensuring the security of the Republic, will be included. The study course will deal mainly with the functions of military-economic, military-scientific, political and psychological factors in the total strategy.</p>

<p>The South African Defence College was formally established on 1st March, 1972. The following posts were created to make provision for the planning and preparation of the first joint staff course, which we hope will commence in 1973. The commanding officer is a brigadier, namely Brig. H. J. P. Burger of the South African Air Force. He has been appointed as commanding officer and was selected for this post by virtue of his qualifications and experience. He holds a B.Sc. degree and has completed the British Joint Services Staff Course. He served for four years as a senior control staff officer at the Air Force College and from 1967 he was the Defence Force Attach&#x00E9; in the United States of America. In addition, there will be senior control staff officers and a control staff officer from the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. The possibility of using the buildings of the South African Army College or the Defence College and of moving the Army College elsewhere, was investigated extensively, but this proposal, as well as the proposal that the Defence College should be a lecturing unit for the Army College, presents overwhelming practical problems which we have not yet solved. In the meantime we are still trying to house this Defence College temporarily in other buildings. Until such time as clarity is reached about that, I can say no more. In this regard I just want to say that if the hon. member can help me to acquire the land and the old buildings at Potchefstroom, we shall use them in any case, even if not for this purpose.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the question of the abolition of higher posts. For the first time in the history of South Africa a proper inspection has been carried out in all arms of the Defence Force in the past six years, not only of the top structure, but also of the various divisions of the Defence Force. Drastic steps were taken in respect of the revision of the control structure and the command structure. The CDS Division of the Controller&#x2019;s division was inspected; the Air Force division was inspected; and the Army and the Navy were inspected. The inspection of the Air Force and of the Navy was completed only recently. Furthermore, a directorate of management services was created which followed up these basic inspections, and as a result of this certain posts were arranged differently than in the past. Some posts were abolished. In order to give the hon. member an idea, I may just mention that there were more than 150 posts on the establishment of the Civil Defence division, and these were reduced to 30. Large-scale savings were introduced, as was rationalisation. As a result of these inspections, certain posts became redundant. A report on this recently appeared in the Press. It has been asked whether there are posts in the higher cadres as well, namely that of general, which can disappear. The reply to that is &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. It cannot be done on a large scale, but there are a few posts with the rank of general which will not be filled again when the present incumbents retire from them. There are only a few of these posts, but this is the position. In the meantime the inspection is continuing and management techniques are being applied in order to achieve greater efficiency. I want to say this afternoon, and I am saying this with the approval of all the most senior officers, including the Commandant-General, that we shall continually apply self-criticism and see whether we can improve our management methods and efficiency.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of drivers&#x2019; licences. Section 141 of the Defence Act sets out the position in respect of drivers&#x2019; licences clearly. Up to now, the provinces have refused to recognize those licences, and I suspect it is a question of money. Perhaps we shall persuade them later, but at the moment this is the position.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member, as well as the hon. member for Salt River, referred to the question of the variety of vehicle models in the Defence Force. As far as our aircraft are concerned, we also have different models. It is true that we have too many types of aircraft, but this was caused by circumstances beyond our control. Since the establishment and reorganization of the Armaments Board and since <span class="col_5795-5796" refersTo="page_1361"/>the entire purchasing machine was reorganized under the guidance of Prof. Samuels and his Armaments Board, the principles of rationalisation and standardization have been introduced. We are applying these consistently and shall continue to do so in future. It is only a question of time and patience.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for East London North referred to the call-up of young men during January and July, and he referred to the fact that some young men who applied for call-up in the Navy eventually landed in the Air Force or in the Army. That is so.</p>

<p>*I am informed that there are various reasons for that, but I do not want to read out long statements in that regard now. In the first place, it is connected with the fact that young men do not always fill in their questionnaires properly. That is so, and I have satisfied myself of that. I noticed from some of the questionnaires that some young men think they are making jokes when they fill in the questionnaires. The result is that they land up in places where they should not have. Such a person still has the right to request a transfer to a place that suits him. In the second place, the numbers of the Air Force and the Navy are small and limited. The great majority of the young men must go to the Army divisions. I must say today that I get the impression that it has a sort of snob value for some families if a young man is sent to the Air Force or Navy. It seems to me as if they regard the Army as being of less importance. I think this tendency must be eliminated. A boy should go where he fits in best and where he can be absorbed, viewed against the background of the numbers and the problems. The Defence Force, the registration officer and the Defence Force heads do their best to comply with the wishes of these young men as far as possible, but this cannot always be done. As far as the intake of university students is concerned, this may improve now that the Army is going to have three intakes per year. This arrangement may improve the position.</p>

<p>If a young man is unhappy after he has been allocated to his particular unit, he may talk to his commanding officer and may even go to the highest authority. He may go as far as the Minister if he is unhappy. But I want to make it clear that in practice it is sometimes simply impossible.</p>

<p>As far as the question of assignation to the Navy is concerned, I have already replied to questions in that regard on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>I am sorry we cannot deviate from that policy. I must maintain that policy as far as possible.</p>

<p>I have already told the hon. member that, if this were not the policy, the present Commandant-General would not have been in the Navy. He is a man who comes from Christiana. He would have had to swim to the Navy along the Vaal River, and I do not know how he would have managed that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria District raised the question of medals. New medals have been introduced, i.e. the Danie Theron medal and the Jack Hindon medal. At present we are reconsidering the entire set of medals, I shall take a look at the matter. But as regards the extra money in the Budget, my information is that it has to do with the special commendation of the Commandant General.</p>

<p>The hon. member for De Aar referred to the Defence Force as more than a mere military machine, i.e. as a symbol of nationhood. In spite of everything that has been said and in spite of all the gossip, I want to say that I still support the view that the South African Defence Force is a symbol of South African nationhood and that the Defence Force represents the people of South Africa as a whole. I hope we shall be responsible enough not to drag in things here which belong to the political sphere&#x2014;where we attack one another and sometimes have to attack one another&#x2014;and in this way try to arouse disloyalty within the Defence Force. I shall adhere to my undertakings in respect of the Defence Force. I expect bilingualism of an officer. I expect bilingualism of every arm of the Defence Force&#x2014;that is an instruction&#x2014;and I expect loyalty from officers. I expect them to serve the Government of the day. As long as that happens, hon. members will get no politics in the Defence Force from my side.</p>

<p><span class="col_5797-5798" refersTo="page_1362"/>Why may I not say it then&#x003F;</p>

<p>In addition, I should like to make an important, brief statement in regard to armaments and ammunition. It is the task of the Government to ensure that the Republic of South Africa has a balanced Defence Force in order to resist threats, both conventional and unconventional. Prospective industrialists and investors often inquire whether we are really spending enough to resist such threats, with reference to what we are spending on defence in comparison with other countries. In comparison with other countries, we are spending little. When replies are given to such inquiries, it is made very clear that the Republic of South Africa does not intend participating in an unhealthy armaments race and ignoring its real capacity, but that we prefer to concentrate on the maximum utilization of the available funds in order to ensure in this way that the highest degree of efficiency is nevertheless maintained. I think South Africa may rightly be proud of what has already been achieved, and I want to repeat today what I have said before : The Republic can no longer be isolated by arms boycotts. South Africa is absolutely self-sufficient as far as its domestic requirements are concerned, and an intensive investigation is being carried out at the moment with a view to the exportation of such armaments. Because we may embarrass buyers and possible prospective buyers to some extent, it is not advisable that I should furnish more details today on what measure of success has already been achieved. However, if there are countries which are not prepared to supply us with armaments for the defence of the important Cape sea-route, they should ask themselves to what extent their attitude is really In the interests of the survival of Western civilization.</p>

<p>Now I want to say a few words in regard to ammunition. We are engaged in the development of advanced types of ammunition in definite fields. There is reason to believe that we are going to achieve great success in this, but at this stage it is not advisable that more details be divulged. I just want to emphasize the fact that we are manufacturing advanced forms of ammunition.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the question of explosives. In nursuance of the statement I made on 11th February, 1971, in regard to the gradual take-over by Armscor of the manufacturing operations carried out by African Explosives and Chemical Industries, negotiations have progressed to such an extent that we have been able to take over successfully the manufacturing responsibilities in respect of explosives and armaments within a year. At present these operations are being carried out by two separate affiliated companies of Armscor.</p>

<p>Cannons : A further break-through in the sphere of self-sufficiency in our country took place a few weeks ago when firing tests with the first completely locally manufactured 90 mm cannons were conducted successfully. The cannon plant is in full production at the moment and we are able to manufacture calibres which vary between 20 mm and 260 mm bored and 20 mm and 160 mm ground.</p>

<p>Fighting and other vehicles: The Armaments Board is engaged in evaluating available concepts of Infantry Fighting Vehicles. The vehicle which will be chosen, must comply with modern standards and be suitable for local manufacture.</p>

<p>Attention is being given to the design of a second generation wheeled armoured vehicle for use as a successor to the Eland armoured cars. South Africa is already independent of countries abroad in respect of the manufacture of armoured cars, and in collaboration with car manufacturers, the manufacture of soft-shell vehicles with a larger local content as well, is being investigated.</p>

<p>Electronics : In the sphere of electronics he following may be mentioned: Local industry has developed a new man-pack transmitting/receiving communication system for use by the commandos. This system makes maximum use of locally manufactured components and weighs only 1 kg as opposed to the 7 kg of its predecessor. Secondly, I want to say that a radio beacon for our parachute troops has been developed locally and is in production at present. Both types of equipment mentioned above are of note in an international sense, and the latter has already attracted inquiry from another country, with a view to obtaining rights. Pioneering work is being done in regard to the development of a portable radar detection system which compares favourably with the best elsewhere. It is used for guarding places against invasion. An advanced and unique system of identifying aircraft is being developed.</p>

<p>As far as aircraft are concerned, light aircraft and machines are being designed <span class="col_5799-5800" refersTo="page_1363"/>and developed in the Republic at present. Besides a military utilization, such aircraft will have a commercial utilization as well. In order to meet the acute shortage of trained artisans in the aircraft industry, priority has been given to the establishment of effective facilities for apprentices. This has stimulated the training of South Africans in this particular industry, as far as manufacturing and servicing are concerned. At the beginning of this year almost 500 locally recruited apprentices were employed, and in this way the foundations were laid for an industry with a more pronounced South African character.</p>

<p>Commercial production: The past year was also characterized by an achievement in the field of commercial production. For the first time both a hunting rifle and a target-shooting rifle have been designed and manufactured locally. A wide series of calibres and models, to meet all requirements, is being manufactured at present. Although the prices of series and models may differ, accuracy and quality in respect of all remain of a high standard. The success our rifles have achieved in competition with imported products is phenomenal, as hon. members have probably heard through the Press and radio. Consequently, in the pride we take in this achievement we know that in quality our product is equal to or even better than imported products, and I have with me proof by experts in this field. Functional tests carried out with our guns by local experts and also by experts abroad, have resulted in an interest in our products which grows daily. I have complete confidence that in this field South Africa will capture a significant section of the international market. Planning for the manufacture of a shotgun, a 22 rifle and a pistol has reached an advanced stage and will be stimulated as soon as the new factory premises in Bloemfontein are occupied later this year. I think it will take place by September or October.</p>

<p>In regard to commercial central-fire cartridges and rim-fire cartridges and shot cartridges, success has already been achieved in satisfying the major consumer preferences in regard to calibres and bullet weights. Over and above functional and experimental range tests by the factories and the S.A.D.F., the co-operation of other authorities as well is being sought for research and tests with a view to accomplishing ever-increasing quality.</p>

<p>Reduced consumer prices of ammunition, which came into effect as from 1st January this year, have stimulated both the hunting sport and target-shooting sport. Sales of commercial ammunition have surpassed all projections by at least 50 per cent.</p>

<p>I felt I had to inform this House about this. The question of the reply I owe the hon. member in regard to the Citizen Force, still remains, but I first want to sit down for a while so that other hon. members may speak again. In addition, there is the question of civil defence which the hon. member for North Rand raised. I shall deal with it later.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the House has listened attentively and appreciatively to the speech made by the hon. the Minister. I particularly liked his introduction, when he pointed out that the threat to South Africa did in fact imply a greater threat to Africa. At the end of his speech the hon. the Minister also referred to our arms position and to those countries which take pleasure in boycotting us in this sphere. I think South Africa owes the hon. the Minister of Defence and his Supreme Command a debt of gratitude for the way in which they have created confidence in the Defence Force of South Africa. They have succeeded in creating not only the confidence of the population of South Africa in the Defence Force, but also the confidence of the entire Western world in the striking power of South Africa.</p>

<p>Actually, I want to refer briefly to a matter which is very near to my heart and which I believe constitutes our main threat, and that is the danger of terrorism. At the outset I want to make three statements in this regard. In the first place, I want to make the statement that terrorism is a child of international communism, and that it is a phenomenon of the modern world which has come to stay. The reason for my saying it is a phenomenon of the communist world, is that one can find its traces especially in those countries such as Cuba, Algeria and others, in which the communist arm has canned out its onslaughts, and which have been conquered by the communists. Furthermore, I believe that terrorism will become more and more extensive and that the seventy-two countries of the U.N. which at present are directly and indirectly supporting terrorism against Southern Africa, will in due course possibly become its greatest victims. I believe that this is possibly going to be the seed which is sown today and will <span class="col_5801-5802" refersTo="page_1364"/>eventually force the U.N. to its knees and possibly wipe it out. Sir, it is interesting to note that the U.N.&#x2019;s organs and mechanism are set up in such a way that it can cope with the danger of world wars today, wars which may be started, but it does not have the organs or the mechanism for opposing terrorism anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The second statement I want to make, is that in the years that lie ahead terrorism will completely replace the old method of warfare, and that it will develop further as a very fine art in the science of warfare. Let us just take a look at the difference between the two. In the old, conventional method of warfare, we have had, since the Middle Ages, careful definitions, consolidated in international law, of the rights of countries at war and of the rights and commitments of neutral countries Every facet of war and warfare has been defined in it, but as far as terrorism is concerned, the position is different; there is no rule whatsoever, and in the decades ahead there will perhaps be no rule either. According to the old method of warfare, the soldier is brought to the battlefield; he fires the shot and in that manner he defends his country. But terrorism is quite a different science. The terrorist is not only taught to handle the weapon and fire the shot, but also trained in the manufacture of the weapon; he is trained in the finer arts of psychology; he is taught all the finer points in respect of this new weapon of war that has made its appearance in the world.</p>

<p>I want to make a third statement, namely that in its onslaught on South Africa international communism has chosen terrorism merely in order to bluff the West by pretending that this is a so-called freedom movement. Sir, we know that terrorism today is no freedom movement. We know that people are being trained by Cubans, by Russians, by Algerians, etc. What freedom would Cubans and Algerians come to seek here in South Africa&#x003F; Therefore it is merely a pretext by means of which international communism is hoodwinking the Western world today. After South Africa has become the prey, and after Africa has become the prey, as the hon. the Minister indicated, this weapon will be directed further at the free world, as we all know. Therefore I want to make the plea today that in the years that lie ahead South Africa will concentrate on preparing itself for this new method of warfare&#x2014;terrorism. Our men will not only have to receive that subtle, scientific training and acquire those fine arts which the man of the veld must know, as well as the finer points of psychology; the equipment of our Defence Force will also have to be adopted and adjusted to this particular method of warfare. I also want to ask for consideration to be given to the training and sending of members of commandos to the fronts, where they may gain the necessary knowledge for combating terrorism. We shall also have to do more than that. In the years ahead we shall have to demonstrate very clearly to the West and to the Free World that this onslaught is aimed at the Free World, and that as a result of its strategic position South Africa has merely become the first target in this stage; that the onslaught on us will merely be the first step. Sir, I think that at this stage one should also sound a warning to those states which are so keen today to accommodate terrorism and to help against Southern Africa. Terrorism is a double-edged sword. We know that in view of its demographic features, Africa lends itself particularly to a paradise for terrorism. There is not one single country in Africa which does not have to contend with numerous population groups, and for that reason terrorism can be fanned in any country in Africa, with disastrous consequences. As a last resort, I want to ask that serious consideration be given to the possibility of combating the onslaught of terrorism against South Africa by granting assistance ourselves to terrorist organizations in order to pay back in their own coin other countries which are today providing terrorism against South Africa with camps and training. Sir, I think that terrorism constitutes a tremendous threat today. We have merely seen the beginnings of it. But now I want to ask that the hon. the Minister of Defence should give thought to entering into an agreement with other countries which are interested in law and order in this part of the world, in this important strategic position occupied by South Africa, agreement similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that we should include in such an agreement countries such as South Africa, Madagascar, Malawi and others that are involved in the matter, in order that an alliance may be formed which may ensure, in particular, that this particular strategic point of Africa will remain protected for the Western World.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I add my congratulations and good wishes to the new Commandant-General, Admiral <span class="col_5803-5804" refersTo="page_1365"/>Biermann, and wish him a happy and successful term of office.</p>

<p>I want to bring one specific matter to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, and that is the question of the treatment of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses in the detention barracks at Voortrekkerhoogte. Sir, I am not going to go into the sentences imposed by the court on Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses or conscientious objectors, because that is part of the terms of reference (clause 10) of the amending Bill which has been sent to a Select Committee. I am not going to touch on any aspect, therefore, which refers to the repetitive sentences imposed by the courts. What I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is the actual treatment of the men who have already been sentenced, how they have been treated in the past in detention barracks at Voortrekkerhoogte and how some of them are still being treated. I think I am correct in saying that something like 65 young Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses between the ages of 18 and 22 were in detention barracks at Voortrekkerhoogte at the beginning of this month. Some of them may have been released since then, but at that time there were something like 65. I have written to the Defence Department and I have put questions to the hon. the Minister about the conditions under which these young men are being kept in detention barracks at Voortrekkerhoogte. It seems to me, from the answers I have received from the Director-General of the Defence Personnel Department and from the terms of the replies to questions that it is quite possible that the higher authorities are not aware of the savage treatment which these young men have been receiving.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should be ashamed of himself. Every time I bring up any questions of injustice, hon. members tell me that I should be ashamed of myself. What they should be ashamed of is that people come to me with these cases and do not go to them. Sir, a point that I want to make is that conditions have recently improved. I have been informed by the parents of these young men that since a major visited the detention barracks last month, or perhaps early this month, conditions have improved; that, for instance, they have been allowed to have a minister of their own religion visiting them on Sundays and conducting a half-hour service, and that some of the washing privileges, or let me rather say washing facilities because they cannot be called privileges, which had been denied them, have since been restored. Nevertheless, Sir, I believe that a full-scale inquiry&#x2014;an independent one if possible&#x2014;should be instituted and, if necessary, disciplinary action taken against those officers in charge, one in particular whose name I shall not mention, who appear to have been conducting a vindictive vendetta against these people. I want to mention the regulations under which these young men are held, according to a letter which I received from Defence Headquarters. It seems that the complaint has been that these young men who are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court are then put into continuous solitary confinement, while they are in the detention barracks, for refusing to obey a lawful order, which is of course to get into uniform in the detention barracks. But the point is that according to regulations&#x2014; and I now quote from the letter which was sent to me and according to what the hon. the Minister has told me, solitary confinement with spare diet not exceeding six days at a time and of which not more than two days shall be served in any period of seven consecutive days, and of which spare diet shall not be enforced during the 24 hours preceding release may be imposed&#x2014;those are the regulations laid down and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply gave me much the same information. I was also told in the same letter from defence headquarters that solitary confinement without spare diet may also be imposed for a period of 14 consecutive days, at the termination of which the prisoner shall not, within 48 hours, be required to serve any further punishment of solitary confinement either with or without spare diet. Now, according to the information I have received via letters and indeed personal visits from parents of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, the young men are in fact kept in continuous solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Why&#x003F; For refusing to obey orders. But my point is not that they have been sentenced unjustly or outside the terms of the regulations. My point is not that the officer in charge does not have the right to sentence them further in the detention barracks to solitary confinement and spare diet. My point is that he has been going outside the regulations by keeping them in continuous solitary confinement with spare diet every seventh and eighth day. As I say, these people are prepared to sign affidavits to this effect and I think it is high time that a proper inquiry should be conducted into these complaints to see whether there is in fact justification for what has been told me. Not only are they in continuous solitary confinement but they are also&#x2014;and this is within the regulations&#x2014;dented all privileges such as the right to write letters or receive letters or visits from parents. They have had no reading material permitted except the Bible, and as I said earlier on, although not now, pretty primitive conditions of hygiene prevailed.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I know it is not an hotel but perhaps the hon. the Minister will agree with me that certain standards of humanity are also required even in detention barracks. Surely the hon. the Minister could not justify such conditions if they were outside the regulations, which defence headquarters have already spelt out to me in some detail, and which he himself in reply to questions also spelt out to me. My complaint is that the regulations have been infringed and that continuous solitary confinement has been imposed on, these boys. As I say, recently certain improvements have been effected, but certainly as far as the continuous solitary confinement is concerned, I am informed by parents that this is still continuing. What I am asking the hon. the Minister to do is not to accept what I am saying, but equally he should not just glibly accept what he believes to be the truth as told to him by his officers. I believe he should institute an inquiry, and that is all I am asking. There is no need for the hon. the Minister to be so irritated about this. Things happen in every Army throughout the world, things which even people in high places of authority are not aware of, and I think the correct thing to do is to institute an inquiry to see whether there is in fact any justification for the accusations, and if there is, to correct the conditions under which these young men are being held. I cannot take the matter any further, because as I say, the rest of the subject in regard to conscientious objectors and Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, is the subject of an inquiry. Just as an indication of an attitude which, I feel, is vindictive, let me refer to the following instance. On the 17th March, 22 boys, who were already in D.B. serving a sentence which had been imposed on them as recently as 4th February, were again brought to court and sentenced to a further year&#x2019;s imprisonment, but not concurrently with the six months&#x2019; sentence to which they had already been sentenced and of which they had served only five or six weeks. In other words, they have to serve 18 months in all. This is actually while the Select Committee is sitting. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Whenever anybody thwarts the State, she is in the forefront. Then she rides the high horse, not like Lady Godiva, but she imagines herself to be a Jeanne d&#x2019;Arc.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another matter. I know the hon. the Minister has already stated this in this House on several occasions, but it would perhaps be a good thing if the hon. the Minister referred to certain matters repeatedly. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what the Government&#x2019;s approach is in respect of the military position and approach in Southern Africa on perhaps a broader basis than the one on which he stated it here on a previous occasion. In the second place, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what the Government&#x2019;s standpoint is in respect of non-Whites in the South African Defence Force, and the role they have to play in it. I know the hon. the Minister did refer to it before, but I would be grateful if, for the sake of clarity, he would just state to us his standpoint in regard to the matter once again.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the speech which the hon. member for Durban Point made in this House yesterday afternoon. According to his Hansard he used the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whatever the provocation may be, whatever the bitterness or the hurt may be, or however deep it may go, the duty of every South African remains one of dedication to the security of our country and our nation.</block>

<p>The latter part is praiseworthy; I like it very much, but what did the hon. member insinuate by the first part&#x003F; One of the less intelligent members at the back there is welcome to snigger; it does not worry me. I want to know what the hon. member means by &#x201C;whatever the provocation, may be&#x201D;. Who in the Defence Force is exposed to provocation and to what form of provocation&#x003F; Then he said: &#x201C;Whatever the bitterness or the hurt may be &#x2026;&#x201D; What bitterness is there in the South African Defence Force, and who in the South African Defence Force has been hurt&#x003F; What is the hon. member referring to&#x003F; Why does he not tell us in clear language exactly what he means in referring to these things&#x003F; I want to contrast his attitude in this debate with his attitude earlier this year when I moved a private motion on terrorism and communism, when the hon. member took that opportunity to attack the hon. member for Stellenbosch on a pamphlet. When it was possible for us to hold a thorough discussion on a vital topic, the hon. member took that opportunity to attack the hon. the Minister of Defence on the policy of this side of the House and dragged the Prime Minister into the matter as well. However, it is interesting to note that just one by-election could bring about such a tremendous change of attitude, so much peace and calm in this House. The hon. member owes it to us to tell us where in the South African Defence Force &#x201C;bitterness and hurt, however deep it may go&#x201D; are to be found. He should tell us in no uncertain terms who has been hurt. I want to claim that nowhere in the society of South Africa are there better relations between our people than is in fact the case in the South African Defence Force. Furthermore I want to claim that the numerical <span class="col_5809-5810" refersTo="page_1368"/>ratio among the population is reflected precisely in the corps of officers of the Defence Force. I also want to claim that when we come to a matter such as the ratio between Afrikaans- and English-speaking people, we find that in the Defence Force it is just as good, if not better, and I maintain it is better, than it is amongst any other comparable group of people in South Africa. In the South African Defence Force we still have the practise which I learned there years ago, and I understand that this is still the case, namely that one month correspondence is conducted in Afrikaans and the next month again it is conducted in English. Nowhere would one find the same degree of mutual goodwill as is found in the Defence Force. Any hon, member and any person outside who, in referring to the South African Defence Force and saying that bitterness and hatred and hurt people are to be found in it, is doing the Defence Force, not only the Defence Force, but also South Africa, the greatest disservice possible. I want to say this with the greatest emphasis I can muster.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to one matter that was mentioned by the hon. member for North Rand. The hon. member once again expressed the wish for a full-time Permanent Force Brigade. This is a fine thought, and I am sympathetic to the idea that we should have a Permanent Force Brigade, if this is at all practicable. However, I think that the answer was given to the hon. member in this House before, repeatedly. This is simply beyond the means of the South African Defence Force. There are several reasons why this simply cannot be done, irrespective of how convenient and praiseworthy such a brigade would be. In the first place, there is the cost aspect. It would consist of a large number of people who would have to be paid at a high salary scale, who would have to be accommodated and provided with equipment. In the second place, it would mean that a large number of men would have to be withdrawn from the normal man-power pool of South Africa, and at the moment we already have shortages in this regard. Another complaint that we hear very often, is that of boredom, and I want to hasten to add that this is an unfair complaint. However, if one had to maintain a Permanent Force Brigade in readiness for being called up, I want to ask what proportions the boredom factor among those people would assume. How would one occupy them further, after they had been fully trained down to the minutest detail, fully armed and kept in readiness as an effective striking force&#x003F; This is simply the way it is, and we must accept the fact that with our limited manpower in South Africa we have to rely on making use of volunteers. We are very grateful&#x2014;the hon. member for Durban Point expressed his gratitude, and I take pleasure in associating myself with it &#x2014;for the fact that we are leaning heavily on volunteers for duty in our Defence Force and especially in the corps of officers of the Citizen Force. However, it is a fact that the national service system is a system of which we must avail ourselves in the place of a full-time Force as envisaged by the hon. member for North Rand. We must avail ourselves of the national service system, and we shall simply have to accept the fact in South Africa that every citizen will, at some time or other during his lifetime, have to perform military service for South Africa, and that he therefore has a duty to the State and that it must be done. Of course, personally I should like to see our national service system being extended in scope. I should like to see more people being drawn into it. I think that if many of these ducktail monstrosities and long-haired creatures, in respect of whom one cannot tell the males from the females when one sees them in the street, could perform service in the Defence Force from time to time, their looks would at least be a much greater credit to South Africa than they are at the moment [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not really want to respond to the speech made by the hon. member for Middelburg, but I should like to draw the attention of the hon. member for Houghton to the fact that there is legislation before a Select Committee at the moment in regard to the Defence Force. This legislation may make some provision for the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses.</p>

<p>On behalf of this side of the House I want to express appreciation to the hon. the Minister for the calm and statesmanlike manner in which he has replied in this debate up to now and also for the strong way in which he has put the political agitators on both sides of the political border-line in their place. We appreciate it very much indeed, especially coming from the Minister of Defence, because we believe, as he does, that patriotism and not politics should be the first consideration in the Defence Force.</p>

<p>We want to join him in congratulating <span class="col_5811-5812" refersTo="page_1369"/>Admiral Biermann. In particular I want to extend to him my personal congratulations. I do not know whether he is aware of the fact, but some of the members of his family are resident in my constituency. I also have a son and a young nephew who are doing their national service in the Navy at the moment. So I regard him as a neighbour, and not only in name. We also want to express our appreciation to Prof. Samuels for agreeing to stay on in the Munitions Board for another five years. He is of great value to our Defence Force and we appreciate it very much indeed.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister of Defence spoke about the threat of the communist block to Southern Africa and said that it was in fact a threat by the communist block to the whole of Africa for the control of Africa and, eventually, for the control of Europe and the Western world. He spoke about the world strategy of Communism and said that we would have to look at matters from more than only the military field. I believe that in many ways we will have to look at matters in other fields than only the military field. I believe that we will have to adopt our internal policies and strategies in such a manner that we will be able to counteract this threat. I will elaborate on that point just now. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister and the Department of Defence are aware of the misuse of a psychological practice known as &#x201C;sensitivity training&#x201D; or &#x201C;group therapy&#x201D; in South Africa at the present time. This is a psychological practice which is based on a Pavlovian theory that was evolved out of experiments with dogs. It was used extensively by the North Koreans in the Korean War to brain-wash prisoners. At the present time it is being used in the commercial world quite a lot in the training of salesmen. There is a great deal of misuse of this practice. I believe that the hon. the Minister should get together with the hon. the Minister of Health and possibly the hon. the Minister of National Education and bring about legislation to control the trainers in this field: because there are so many amateurs that are playing with the minds of people that it can possibly subvert the morals of South Africa. I make it as a suggestion and I hope the hon. the Minister will go further into it.</p>

<p>Then there are, obviously, ideological differences between the parties in South Africa. However, I do believe that both the major parties are conservative in their outlook and that they believe in the continued existence of a Western type of civilization in this, our country, our only country. I believe we should look further into the threat from the Indian Ocean. The communist build-up in the Indian Ocean to my mind and, I believe, to the minds of all our officers and to all members of this hon. House is something of grave concern to us.</p>

<p>If I may, I want to raise something with the Minister which may appear to fall under another Vote. I want to speak to him about the coastal strip between the Fish River and the Keiskamma River, i.e. between the mouth of the Fish River and the Keiskamma River at Hamburg. At the present stage this coastal strip is White and with the consolidation of the Ciskei, the Peddie district becomes part of the released area. None of the farmers in that district want to remain, not even in the coastal strip. When I interviewed the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, they asked that they should be taken over. These farmers in the coastal strip have South Africa at heart and they suggested that that strip be taken over either by the Department of Defence, or by the Department of Forestry, or by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. I believe it is important that that coastal strip should be defended. We have numerous commandos in the areas and we have numerous regiments in the area. We have the Sixth South African Infantry Battalion in Grahamstown, the First City Regiment in Grahamstown, the Kaffrarian Rifles in East London, the Alexandria Commando and the Midlands Commando in that area. All these are very proud regiments and they work very well together. Good use could be made of that ground in coastal exercises and I believe instilling the patriotism and the co-operation which is necessary in our Defence Force. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would negotiate with his colleagues in the Department of Bantu Administration and Development with the object of taking over that strip of coast for the purposes of the Defence Force and to use it for the further defence of our eastern seaboard against this threat from the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Then I would like to express my thanks to those particular units in the Eastern Cape, and particularly to the Sixth South <span class="col_5813-5814" refersTo="page_1370"/>African Infantry Battalion, for the wonderful work they have done in that area in becoming part of a community. Wherever there is a country show, wherever there is something that is undertaken by the community, this regiment is there. Wherever there is trouble, they are there to help. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to them and to their fellow officers in other neighbouring units for the wonderful work they have done in the Eastern Cape. There are certain little things in respect of which the hon. the Minister could make things easier for these regiments.</p>

<p>I spoke about these little country shows. I believe this is a wonderful place for a Defence Force to go in for public relations with the civilian people around the country-side. At the present time, if they have to travel a distance to a country show, a demonstration, a parade or something like that, they have to pay for their expenses out of regimental funds. I know that money is tight, but I think that that little bit of extra outlay could create such further good relations with the people in the surrounding districts, and, in fact, in the whole of South Africa because every regiment would be doing this, that we would have far less trouble from mothers who cannot cut the umbilical cord when their children go to the army. I believe this is an important factor. It is a small matter, but it is something which I believe the Minister could look into and a matter in which he can assist our regiments. Then, I believe, we should establish a permanent liaison officer between, say, the Department of Public Works and the Department of Defence. I say this, because here, too, you find conflict. I recall an argument between the local inspector of public works and the regiment concerned. They argued about whether a kitchen&#x2019;s walls should be tiled with three feet or with five feet. I believe that the most hygienic thing is five feet. I know what happened at Grahamstown where the regiment was forced to pay the difference between three feet height of tiles and five feet height of tiles because the Department of Public Works disagreed with them.

<p>I do not want to speak to the hon. member for Houghton today&#x2014;I want to enter into a conversation with her great friend, Kaunda. We know one thing, and that is that the Head of State of Zambia&#x2014;this is what I suspect &#x2014;would welcome it very much if we were to retaliate on the other side of his border against the terrorist camps and activities there. We know why: This could be seized upon by him as an incident which would be blown up and misrepresented into an act of aggression. In the second place, in that way the brittle UN would be given an injection, and the noise would be overawing. In the third place, it would be seized upon by him and his militant friends to consolidate their shaky position through sobbing, moaning, accusations and distortions about war aggressiveness from the White South. In the fourth place, it would be seized upon by them to strengthen and illuminate further their lack-lustre influence, and especially that of Kaunda, in the Organization of African Unity. He would look for sympathy. It would also be seized upon by him and his economically weak, militant friends as a golden opportunity for diverting the attention from their weak, vulnerable and even languishing economy and focusing all the attention on an imagined war.</p>

<p>What is the position now&#x003F; This is something they should know. The Republic of South Africa is the super state in Africa. The Republic&#x2019;s gross national product doubles itself approximately every 10 years. By 1980 our gross national product will be approximately R25 000 million, and by the year 2000 it will be approximately R100 000 million. As this gross national product grows and increases, we shall, with a smaller percentage of expenditure on Defence, nevertheless be able to spend fantastic sums of money on Defence. If one takes the potential economic strength of the Republic of South Africa and projects it into the future, the possibility fades away <span class="col_5815-5816" refersTo="page_1371"/>that Zambia, which is so militant today, will even in a 100 years&#x2019; time be able to confront the Republic of South Africa in a military adventure. The hopes which Kaunda places on the Tanzam railway line as a means to increased military and economic mobility, are going to cause him great difficulties. Approximately two weeks ago the leader of the newly established Opposition party in Zambia sounded the warning that that railway line was going to be used by the Red Chinese communists for operating from the new power base which they are developing in Tanzania&#x2014; a power base they have obtained through political, military and economic interference.</p>

<p>I want to say this: Lusaka is no military lure to the Republic of South Africa, but it is in fact so to the Red Communists. I say this to Kaunda in all friendliness: Through his uncalculated, militant, aggressive policy towards the Republic of South Africa, he is doing two things. In the first place, he is robbing his own people and his own country of the benefits and the development aid in many spheres which may be obtained from a non-aggressive economic giant which is becoming progressively stronger, from one of his nearest neighbouring states. In the second place, he is turning loose in his own country forces which will lead to the overthrow of his already shaky political position and which will turn his own country into a defenceless prey to aggressive communists.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we can all say that the Republic of South Africa has never turned its economic and financial means, its power and resources, into military imperialism. In the second place, it has never offered its economic power and aid in exchange for political domination, neither directly nor indirectly. In the third place, it has never harnassed its military power for the purpose of subjecting any state economically or making it a politico-ideological satellite. This is therefore the message of the Republic of South Africa to Kaunda and the people of Zambia:

If you want food, you may come to the Republic of South Africa for negotiations. Bombs will not accompany the bags of maize. Military equipment will not accompany equipment for development purposes. We shall gladly, as good neighbouring states and good neighbours should, send scientists and technical advisers and engineers, but never military experts and training staff. We may tell the people of Zambia that the Republic of South Africa prefers the smoke and the drone of factory chimneys and machines to the thunder of cannon and smoke-filled, burning cities and gunpowder smoke from the barrels of cannons.</p>

<p>This is what we want to say to Kaunda and the people of Zambia&#x2014;and with this I want to conclude : They should strip Lusaka of the garment it is wearing today as a first base of devilish and satanical forces which it wants to set at the White South by force. In the second place, we ask the people of Zambia to learn the lesson of Jordan, which was harnassed as the first base of terrorists against Israel, and which today finds itself stuck in the grip of terrorism, so much so that it cannot move. In the third place, we say to them : Terrorism and orderly, evolutionary development are irreconcilable with each other in a country where poverty, ignorance and diseases are found, as is the case in these newly emancipated Black states. They are propped up by unprecedented militant nationalism, but whereas disease, ignorance and poverty are found there, the Republic of South Africa stands as a non-aggressive, peace-seeking state, which can be of great value to these states in Africa. This is our message to the people of Zambia.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with the exception of the one single false note by the hon. member for Durban Point, to which the hon. member for Middelburg referred, this debate has taken place in a calm atmosphere up to now. In saying this, I am ignoring the hon. member for Houghton completely.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to express a word of sincere thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Defence, and to his officers as well, for the special image they have given to our Defence Force over the past few years. I should like to say that South Africa and every well-meaning citizen of the country are proud of every man and every woman wearing the uniform of our Defence Force. They are wearing it with great distinction, which redounds to South Africa&#x2019;s credit. But, Sir, we are not only proud; we are also grateful, for their readiness is our insurance for stability and peace in this country.</p>

<p>An important aspect in respect of our Defence Force, which we are inclined to overlook, perhaps because it has not yet <span class="col_5817-5818" refersTo="page_1372"/>become very perceptible, is that compulsory military service is giving our nation of the future a very strong element of discipline and diligence. In a few years&#x2019; time, when these young men, in their thousands, will have reached full maturity and hold responsible positions, these characteristics of self-discipline and diligence will come forward very strongly.</p>

<p>South Africa, more so than any other country, if it wants to maintain its position of leadership in Africa, will find the characteristics of discipline and diligence indispensable. If we look to the north, we see here on our threshold a mighty continent, a continent which has already awakened, a continent where the characteristics of diligence and discipline have become a clarion call and, I want to say, have been elevated to a virtue, and quite rightly so. It is a continent where the ordered character of youth organizations with inspiration and enthusiasm has become so striking that even our own esteemed State President, on the occasion of his recent visit to Malawi in March, commended it highly. Sir, we should make no mistake; these virtues of diligence and discipline will become more and more evident amongst the youth of Africa, and if these are combined with the skill of technology and science, industry and commerce, knowledge and experience, and if the full development of black nationalism, of patriotism and national pride is added, it makes me feel uneasy to think that, in contrast, a large part of South Africa&#x2019;s youth are arranging pop festivals, becoming hippies and using drugs.</p>

<p>This is the background against which I want to make the following request to the hon. the Minister for his consideration. I should like to ask him whether it is not possible to have an investigation made into the possibility of subjecting gradually the young women of our country to some form of compulsory national service over a period. What I have in mind, is compulsory training in at least the techniques of nursing and civil defence. I foresee that the civil defence division may act as a coordinating body, and will be able to work out such a scheme for such training in conjunction with the Departments of Defence and Health, our Provincial Administrations, the Noodhulpliga, the Red Cross and the St. John Ambulance Association. The way I see it, is that compulsory training in our hospitals of our young women as nurses, should take place in accordance with the extent to which accommodation is available in our hospitals, just as is the case at present with our national servicemen in the accommodation available at our various military installations.</p>

<p>Here I want to say just in passing that such a scheme&#x2014;this is not the main object of my speech&#x2014;will also be able to meet the chronic shortage of nurses, for I believe that once these young women have done compulsory service in hospitals for one year, they will eventually choose nursing as a career.</p>

<p>The balance of our young women, i.e. those who cannot be accommodated in our hospitals in this manner, should, for a few weeks per year over a period that may be determined, just as is the case at present in our Commando system, undergo compulsory training in nursing and first aid at the various branches of our Noodhulpliga, the Red Cross and the St. John Ambulance Association. Of course, the question that arises immediately is where we shall find the instructors to give the necessary instruction to this large number of newcomers to compulsory service, with the possible exception of our hospitals where the available staff may give the necessary training to these young ladies. But, Sir, the answer for the rest is actually very easy, thanks to the far-sightedness of the hon. the Minister of Defence. These female leaders are already being produced by the Civil Defence College in George.</p>

<p>Sir, in passing I just want to say here that I believe that these young ladies will yet become the pride of our nation&#x2019;s future mothers one day.</p>

<p>Sir, one single training college of this nature is not sufficient at all. At this early stage already there are more applications for admission than the number that can be admitted. One such college cannot produce enough female leaders for the purposes of the scheme which I have submitted to the hon. the Minister for his consideration, and therefore I believe that the establishment of more colleges of this nature is a matter of top priority. In fact, through the hon. the Minister of Defence I want to make an urgent and serious appeal to the Government for positive steps to be taken to make a start with planning for the establishment of at least another one or two or even three such training colleges at places where they may be located conveniently so that the services of the present staff of the Defence Force may be used. <span class="col_5819-5820" refersTo="page_1373"/>Sir, the circumstances in which we are living make it absolutely essential for us to give serious attention to this aspect of compulsory training for our young ladies. I want to go so far as to say that our duty towards the young people in order that they, in turn, may in future do their duty towards our country and our nation, is making an urgent appeal to us to give serious attention to this matter. Therefore I want to ask that our responsibility towards the young people and their responsibility towards our country and our nation should be the final factor which we shall take into consideration in deciding to give attention to the establishment of more colleges such as the one available at George at the moment, for the purpose of bringing in young ladies more extensively with a view to their performing compulsory service in some form or other.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville has made an interesting approach to our neighbouring states not to support the establishment of terrorist camps. He was in fact warning these states that they themselves might be engulfed by the very terrorism which they are fomenting against other countries. He is quite right. There is an old saying that he who rides the tiger will find that he cannot dismount, and that may well be so in the case of some heads of state who are assisting in the development of terrorist training camps.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Odendaalsrus is concerned, I do hope that his plea will fall on deaf ears. I would hate to think that we in this country may find it necessary to institute a system of national service for the women of this country. I believe, and we accept, that it is necessary for some training for service to be done by women, as is being done at the college at George, to provide for civil defence. But I am sure that we in this country can still look to the women to serve as volunteers in organizations like the Red Cross, St. Johns and other such organizations in the case of any conflagration in South Africa, or in case their services are needed in an emergency. There is no doubt that we in South Africa are extremely fortunate in the readiness of our people to defend their homeland. I think it is essential therefore that we should not allow any frustration to creep into the organization of our defence or to allow any legitimate grievance to arise which will adversely affect that readiness. When I look at the position in regard to the S.A. Coloured Corps I wonder whether we are not at this stage perhaps perpetuating a cause of grievance which should really be eliminated. The Coloured South Africans have a very proud military history. They served in World War I with distinction in battle in various parts of Africa and in World War II they served as non-combatants. There are many White ex-servicemen today who owe their lives to the courage and bravery of the Coloureds who served as stretcher bearers, many of whom were decorated for bravery. According to the estimates before us, at page 100, the establishment for the S.A. Coloured Corps totals 572. From the reply to a question placed on the Order Paper by the hon. member for North Rand, it appears that of that establishment at the present time there are vacancies for 78 posts in the Army and the S.A. Medical Corps and 95 posts in the Navy, a total of 173 posts, or 32 per cent of the total establishment, which have not been filled. I believe that this may be due, and I have reason to believe that it is true, to the salary discrimination which applies in so far as the S.A. Coloured Corps is concerned, as compared with the other arms of the Service. We find from the Estimates that whereas the Coloured Corps is restricted to a salary scale from R840 minimum to a maximum of R2 640, the White personnel of our armed forces have a starting scale of R1 110, going up to a maximum of R5 400 for other ranks. By comparison, the commencing salary for the Coloured Corpos is only 60 per cent of the commencing salary for the White personnel and the maximum salary for those below officer rank, including warrant officers and noncommissioned officers, is approximately 50 per cent of the maximum salary of White warrant officers and non-commissioned officers. I believe it is a cause for non-attraction, if I may put it that way, into the Force of Coloured persons, and I hope that the Public Service Commission and the Supreme Command will be able to revise that salary scale very soon. I believe it is necessary and justified and I hope it will be done without delay.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to raise is the fact that the global communist threat&#x2014;I refer to it as a global threat because it is directed at the West&#x2014;requires a calm assessment of the facts in so far as South Africa is concerned, and that that assessment can only be made on reliable intelligence <span class="col_5821-5822" refersTo="page_1374"/>and the correct assessment of that intelligence in regard to its military value. I believe that our ability to deal with this threat is dependent upon calm leadership in our Defence Forces. There has been a remarkable number of veterans of World War II who have remained on on a voluntary basis in the Defence Force of South Africa in the various arms. One is amazed to find, even at this stage, 27 years after the end of hostilities, that there are still men serving in a voluntary capacity in the regiments in South Africa which served during the last war. Their numbers are decreasing. We must realize now that we have reached the transition and that there will be fewer and fewer, and possibly very soon no ex-servicemen who have had war service will be serving in our Defence Force. They have undoubtedly, under the guidance of the Supreme Command and senior officers of the Defence Force, established a deep loyalty to regimental traditions in the various arms in which they have served. I think we in South Africa can be extremely proud of the quality and the dedication of those men who now serve in the capacity of commanding officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers in our various Defence Force units.</p>

<p>I hope that one matter will be kept constantly in mind, namely that by the encouragement of regimental associations, the encouragement of what are virtually old boys&#x2019; associations of the various regiments, there will always be the opportunity for those who have served to be able to work with and to encourage those who are serving at the present time. I believe those facilities are there. I also agree with the hon. member for Durban Point that regimental spirit and <i>esprit de corps</i> in the forces in South Africa would be greatly strengthened if the continuous training periods were condensed into a shorter period than at the present time. In other words, there will be more frequent occasions on which the regiments are together when the men will get to know each other and when, apart from the military aspects of training, they could also begin indulging in sporting and other activities as an entity. I hope that this matter will be carried further and, if found possible, that it will restore the old contact when whole regiments are together more frequently than under the present system spread over so many years.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to congratulate the editorial staff on the publication of <i>Paratus.</i> I think it is a publication of extremely high quality. It is also an extremely interesting one. I would like to suggest, if I may, that from the point again of <i>esprit de corps</i> and background, that perhaps a series of articles could be published in that magazine on the background and history of battle honours which are held by various regiments in South Africa. This could help motivate a greater <i>esprit de corps</i> in the regiments of long standing in this country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>I have an article here in my hand which deals with national service. The author of this article describes national service as an &#x201C;obvious waste of labour&#x201D;. He goes on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The last six months after the completion of the three months of basic training mean a poor utilization of scarce White manpower which we can no longer afford under the present circumstances.</block>

<p>I mention the matter because I think it has become necessary once again for the hon. the Minister to tell South Africa why we have national service in this country, why it was instituted, why the Government decided to institute national service after the Groenewoud committee of 1965, after the report of a Select Committee in 1967 and after missions overseas. I find it a pity that this person found it necessary in this publication&#x2014;the mouthpiece of a large organization in South Africa&#x2014;to disparage our system of national service in this way. It is perhaps necessary for the hon. the Minister once again to tell these people, and South Africa as well, why we have this system of national service. Such a system is not only aimed at military preparedness, but also at ensuring viability in all spheres of life. I should like to discuss another matter here today.</p>

<p><span class="col_5823-5824" refersTo="page_1375"/>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I was shocked and disgusted when I read recently that there is a movement initiated by the United. Nations Human Rights Commission to persuade the International Committee of the Red Cross to give to the so-called freedom fighters in Africa and in other countries the status of soldiers by way of an amendment by treaty to the Geneva Convention. This Red Cross convention is to meet next month in Geneva. At this meeting they will decide what to do about this suggestion. In this regard I want to quote a well-known person in Europe, namely Dr. Clemens Amelunxen, a judge of the high court in Germany, a member of the International Police Association as well as an honorary member of the Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law of the University of South Africa. What did he say&#x003F; He said the following about this proposal I have just mentioned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If this proposal is accepted and becomes international law by treaty, the problem will be to distinguish between real freedom fighters as we had during the Second World War and terrorists whose actions, such as indiscriminate bombing of public places, the hijacking of civilian aircraft and the derailment of civilian passenger trains, are not related to the liberation of a State or a captive nation.</block>

<p>This is what this professor said. Until now, as far as I can remember, no Government has ever formally requested that terrorist forces be accorded the protection of the Geneva Convention or be treated as prisoners of war. I wish to say, Sir, that in not one single respect can modern-day terrorism, such as is conducted by terrorists in Africa and in other parts of the world, be justified in terms of international law. To change existing international law to accommodate these terrorists would be, I believe Sir, to strike at the very roots of the sovereignty of states. It would simply mean that terrorism will be legalized by an international society such as the Red Cross. I mention these facts to plead with the Minister to use his influence to persuade our friends in the Western world to squash this attempt by certain people to accord to terrorists the status of soldiers. We cannot allow this, and we cannot afford it. We cannot allow that the very principles of international law governing conflicts be violated in this way. I do think, Sir, that if this should be allowed in Southern Africa, it could spell disaster.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sure the hon. member for Worcester will pardon me if I do not follow him in the argument he has expounded. I do not want to comment on it, except to say that I think he has a good case. I also want to extend my sincere congratulations to Admiral Biermann on his first appearance in this debate. I subscribe to everything that has already been said in this connection by both sides of the House.</p>

<p>I should like to discuss two matters with the hon. the Minister. The first is a matter which has already been mentioned by the hon. member for Durban Point. Actually I am glad that the hon. the Minister has not yet responded to that aspect of his speech. I am now referring to the period of service which is spread over ten years at the moment. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, and this is what the hon. member for Durban Point also did, to consider reducing the period from ten years to four years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister to consider this matter. He said that he would reply to it. I believe that under the old set-up it was possible for officers to sign on for a longer period before accepting a commission. I believe that it is a good system for serving officers in the Defence Force to stay on for a longer period than the other ranks, because one likes to have continuity of command. In that way you can also keep up a standard for a regiment, something you find very difficult to do if your officers and non-commissioned officers keep changing. I do feel that the ten-year period is a very long period for the ordinary man in the Defence Force, because he gets out of practice, in any case, during the long period between his continuous periods of training. This is not the case with officers, of course, since the introduction of the good system of the annual leadership group training for officers. Since that was introduced we have had a very good position in respect of the training of officers. There is a further problem, however, which the hon. member for Durban Point did not mention, and that is that with this system <span class="col_5825-5826" refersTo="page_1376"/>of ten year training the regiments are becoming very large. The regiments become very large, because for ten years they keep getting new people who have completed their training period of nine months, while almost no one leaves the regiment. This causes several administrative problems because of the administration within a regiment is largely undertaken on a part-time basis by the officers and non-commissioned officers of the regiment. If possible, they have to give up one night a week from their own time in order to undertake this administrative work. From experience I know that it is often difficult to keep such an administration up to date and 100 per cent correct, as it should be. This is one of the problems which I should like to put to the hon. the Minister and which I should like to submit to him for his consideration. In time this leads to an infantry company with five to six platoons, as I have seen it happen myself. Otherwise you even have to establish an Echo company in a regiment.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter to which I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. The hon. the Minister said very clearly in his speech in this House what his attitude is towards politics within the Defence Force. I am delighted at the attitude he assumed in that regard. He said here that as long as he was Minister of Defence he would keep politics out of the Defence Force. I think that is a praiseworthy attitude and therefore I should like to bring certain matters to his notice. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister is aware of them, but I should like to bring these matters to his notice, particularly in the light of what he has just said here. I am talking about a deliberate propagation of the Government&#x2019;s relationships policy within the Defence Force. I am talking specifically about a case of which I have personal experience, not something which I am basing on hearsay evidence. In the instance to which I am referring I was personally present at a leadership group training course on our northern borders. Several years ago they introduced a special division into our Defence Force, a division which also employs ethnologists. The ethnologist gave a lecture before the leadership group, a lecture which was very valuable. It was very valuable because he told us about the people living on the border there and about the Bantu population there. He told us what their customs were, how they should be treated, and so forth. It was very valuable, but what was not valuable was when he started to give us a pseudoscientific explanation of the policy of separate development of this Government.</p>

Even if that hon. members believes that it is right, and I know he believes that his policy is right, it does remain a contentious matter in South Africa and one would not want to see such a contentious matter raised in a lecture before members of the Defence Force and then discussed at length. I asked that officer a few pertinent questions and I can assure the House that his case seemed considerably less convincing after I had asked those questions. [Interjections.] But however that may be, I had this experience before I came to this hon. House. The reason why I have never mentioned it before is that one does not want to mention an isolated case and then make a fuss about it. But my information is that this sort of thing is still going on. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he has heard of similar instances before, and, if so what he is going to do or has done about it. I should like to ask him why it is that such a person could be allowed to propagate a policy in such a way at that stage. I do not think it is something which we want within the Defence Force.</p>

<p>No, he said it in so many words. He began by asking whether we knew to what extent the policy of separate development of this Government was based on purely scientific grounds. From there he elaborated and tried to explain how the matter fits together scientifically. Let there be no illusions about this matter. One would like to know the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in this regard. I hope he will investigate this matter and take very strong action in regard to it. I also hope that if further cases of this nature were to occur, he would take positive action to prevent it, because it is most certainly not the policy of this side of the House ever to allow something of this nature within the Defence Force. If something like this were to happen when we are in power, I hope that hon. members on that side of the House, when it comes to their notice, will also bring it to our notice in the same way as I am now doing.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I want to say to the hon. member for Florida that he has not been told the half of it. What I mean by no politics in the Defence Force is, in the first place, that every member of the Defence Force is entitled to his own convictions regarding the political division in the country, as long as he does not misuse his position in uniform in regard to some other person who differs with him and, in the second place, that there will be no discrimination against persons on the grounds of their political convictions as long as they do not misuse their position. Let me tell the hon. member that we are engaged in a system of citizenship training. As long as this Government is governing, its policy is State policy.

<p>Communism will not be allowed in the Defence Force, although we teach them what communism means. We teach them the methods of terrorists; we teach them the tactics of terrorism. After all, an officer is not a person who must be ignorant. Does the hon. member want our officers to live in a vacuum&#x003F; This has never been the case. Under previous governments officers were kept properly informed of what was expected of them as representatives of the State. I cannot see the hon. member&#x2019;s point at all. I think he has deviated from the point completely. We shall continue to give citizenship training within the Defence Force; we shall continue to do so in an objective way. I adopt the standpoint again that there shall be no discrimination on the grounds of politics against a person who holds other opinions, as long as that person does not misuse his party-political convictions in order to discriminate against others. I hope that is clear now. If it is not clear the hon. member will just have to come to see me so that I can explain it to him.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to quote to you the kind of things these people get up to, these so-called &#x201C;holy&#x201D; witnesses of Jehova. They are not denomination; they are lawbreakers. They are people who evade their duty. That is what they are. They are not people with proper conscientious objections, like other people. The other people with conscientious objections subject themselves to the laws of this country. Although they do not want to do national service, they do other work. They work in the hospitals; they conduct themselves in a respectable and sensible manner. But what do these people do&#x003F; I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When asked for complaints or requests, a negative answer is given, but within five or ten minutes, one of them would raise that same problem. These and many other annoyances are repeated.</block>

<p>But just listen to this&#x2014;I am only reading extracts&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When during chaplain&#x2019;s period, chaplains of other denominations read from the Scriptures, a sudden commotion, apparently sparked off by a Jehovah Witness on look-out, resounds throughout their cell-block occupied by Witnesses.</block>

<p>They disturb other people at their worship services; these are the holy people for whom she has taken up the cudgels. They kick up a row when they are not supposed to. They provoke the authorities in those detention barracks until the nerves of these people are on edge. I have a long report here from the Superintendent. I have a report given to me by the Chief of the Defence Force, after thorough consideration. On 30th March, 1972, three of them complained that they were receiving insufficient physical exercise. This matter was remedied, immediately after they had complained. One other member was not satisfied with the medical officer&#x2019;s treatment of his complaint about having a sore back. Arrangements were then made for him to see a medical officer again, and no further complaints were made by him. The steps taken are strictly in accordance with the prescribed regulations, and those are my instructions. However, I can understand that the people dealing with them are also human beings, and I am prepared to accept that these responsible persons who have been put in charge of them are decent people.

Solitary confinement for a detainee comprises the following: He is locked up alone in a cell, but he is not deprived of his bedding and the necessary clothing. He is not compelled to do any physical or other labour, service or training, but I think he has to do a few exercises. It will do him good if he gets a little exercise and religion as well&#x2014;the true religion. He is obliged to keep his cell, clothing and person clean and neat. They keep their Bibles. They can read their Bibles. He is provided with the rations to which he is entitled in his cell. He is not allowed to smoke, or purchase anything, or receive any visitor except for a chaplain or his legal representative. He is visited at least once a day in his cell by a member of the staff, and as frequently as necessary by the medical officer. Those are all steps which we take.</p>

<p>Sir, the officers of the Defence Force are not a lot of thugs. I will not allow the hon. member to imply this when she talks about the Defence Force. She can settle it with her friends outside. She represents all those people who break laws and want to banish order.</p>

<p>Sir with that I have disposed of the hon. member. Now I just want to tell her this, it is for the information of the House as well: I am discussing with the Chiefs of the Defence Force whether we should separate those who have been placed in detention, because they have acted in a certain way as Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, from those who are in detention for other reasons. We are going to put them apart, completely removed from the existing detention barracks. I want to give notice to this effect this afternoon, for we cannot allow the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses in South Africa to get out of hand as they got out of hand in Europe. Let me mention. Germany as an example. Recently I had another opportunity of discussing this matter with a prominent person from Germany. Originally there were 10 000 posts established for Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses in other undertakings and companies and in State departments. Do you know, Sir, this number grew to more than 25 000 posts, because every Tom, Dick and Harry suddenly became a Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness. Sir, they are not an ordinary sect; they are not a religious group adhering to a specific religious conviction. Everyone is his own minister and everyone interprets the Bible in his own way&#x2014;more or less like the Progressive Party.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand raised the question of civil defence. I find now that I gave a reasonably full elucidation of the whole matter of civil defence here in Parliament last year on 6th May. This was with reference to a speech made by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think the hon. member will remember my reply. I stated that I was glad that he had raised the matter, and then I continued (Hansard, Volume 34, Column 6161):</p>

<block name="quote">To my mind a success cannot be made of civil defence by creating a mass psychosis in that regard. I think it is wrong to conduct evening classes on a large scale and to arouse enthusiasm in people only to find that they have cooled off the next day.</block>

<p>Then I went on to explain to the hon. member the whole approach we have to enable local authorities, city councils and the commandos, and auxiliary services like the Red Cross, the Noodhulpliga and St. John&#x2019;s Ambulance Organization, to participate in a civil defence effort.</p>

<p>*Now, I can inform the hon. member that we held talks with the Red Cross, the Noodhulpliga and St. John&#x2019;s, and all of them are basically responsible for civil defence. After the women who are undergoing training at the Civil Defence College in George, leave the college, they are bound, on a voluntary basis, to help with the rendering of our civil defence services. We try to encourage them to join these voluntary organizations, and to play a leading role in them. In the second place, each of these three organizations was in the past responsible to the Surgeon-General for providing 200 ambulance attendants and 200 male nurses for emergencies, for which each received a subsidy of R3 000. For civil defence all three were involved in a country-wide training programme to educate the general public, at a remuneration, in first aid. As a result of the incorporation of civil defence in the Defence Force, and as a result of the new reorganizations, all three still remain primarily responsible for civil defence services, in collaboration with city councils, from whom we have had a wonderful response. Hundreds of local authorities have already joined this scheme. But the Red Cross and St. John&#x2019;s Ambulance, apart from their obligations to the Defence Force, have other obligations as well. They have obligations to the Railways and to the mines, but they also have obligations to the Surgeon-General, and for that they receive subsidies. Then, in addition, the International Red Cross receives a subsidy from the State, which we pay. We have now gone further and arranged with the Noodhulpliga that they will not be attached to the Surgeon-General, but specifically to Civil Defence only. In other words, we do not want all three to be attached to the Surgeon-General. They are attached to Civil Defence. The Noodhulpliga will retain its identity and independence. This organization retains its existing uniforms, badges and badges of rank &#x2014;we are leaving that severely alone&#x2014;but its members will wear the Civil Defence badge as a cap badge, as an indication that it is an auxiliary organ of Civil Defence, while the other two are attached to the Surgeon-General section. St. John&#x2019;s has agreed to increase its existing obligations to the Surgeon-General to 300 ambulance beds and 300 male nurses, for which it will receive an increased annual allowance. The South African Red Cross Association does not see its way clear to extending its existing obligation to the Surgeon-General, but is prepared, within its means, to render assistance to the Surgeon-General as well as to the Civil Defence without remuneration. Its allowance therefore remains unchanged. But we have again increased the allowance to the International Red Cross, as hon. members can see in the Estimates. In other words, we have done away with <span class="col_5835-5836" refersTo="page_1381"/>mass training. We are concentrating on establishing an organization through these auxiliary organizations, through training leaders and through involving the local authorities, and I think that this has worked well. During the Ceres disaster and the floods in East London, and recently in the Gamtoos Valley, we saw that this new system acquitted itself well of its task under very difficult circumstances, and I think that we will achieve the right results if we continue in this way. Further to that I refer the hon. member to what I said here in the House last year.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Durban Point and Florida raised the question of the Citizen Force here. Sir, we have again considered the whole question of the 10 years. I asked the Supreme Command personally to give me the assurance that they are unable to devise any other plan. But, Sir, as the hon. member for North Rand was quite right in saying, South Africa does not have a substantial force. In the second place we must achieve a certain battle order within a certain time. If we reduce the period to four years, then we are not going to achieve that object. It has been scientifically proved that this period cannot be reduced, and if the hon. member wants it I shall have a lecture read to him on this subject with tables, and with the necessary proof that his theory will fail if this period is reduced [Interjection.] No, one cannot do it. The hon. member is already advocating that I should not only call them up in unit context every three years, but that we should do it sooner, and we are now going to do it every two years. But, Sir, one is then going to come to a dead-end after the fifth or the sixth year, and one is then going to have a Force which one cannot use. This is quite simply the case; it does not work out as the hon. member thinks it will. Sir, with our limited instructors&#x2019; corps and with our limited man-power, do you not think the Defence Force would grab at something of this nature if it were possible for it to achieve its objective with the proposal made by the hon. member&#x003F; It may become possible in future; I do not know, but let us go slowly at first. We have now, by a resolution of this House, which passed the Second Reading of that Bill, reduced the training period in the commandos, which we are now able to control better, to 10 years. Let us now leave this 10 year story alone; I think it causes confusion among our people. The present period has to do with the question of the number of forces in fighting trim; it has to do with the numbers of the Force one is building up. I assure the hon. member that if it becomes practicable, if we can devise a plan, we will consider it, but it is not practical at the moment. The hon. member must take my word for it. I am prepared to have this proved to him, as they proved it to me. Is the hon. member prepared to accept my proposal&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. As the hon. member knows, the geography of our country makes the maintenance of regiments difficult. One member of a regiment may be in South-West Africa, the other one here, and another there. I do not want to lay it down as policy today, but we are considering whether our Citizen Force regiments should not to a greater extent be made up in our densely populated areas, in the rural areas and in the cities, and then the other members in the more sparsely-populated areas can be grouped together in the commandos, on a district basis now that we are bringing commando training into line with that of the Citizen Force. This is not yet the policy, but we are considering the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the weekly parades. Sir, this is not a necessity, and it is not our policy. If commanders do it, then they are doing it unnecessarily. Those few days on which they can be called up, as laid down in the Act, are in fact meant for special occasions such as the Opening of Parliament or ceremonial parades. It is not necessary for them to be called up every week.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Once every month.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Even that is not necessary. They must find special occasions for that.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further and said that there had been large-scale resignations. Sir, I do not think that there have been <span class="col_5837-5838" refersTo="page_1382"/>large-scale resignations. I have the figures here. From 1st April, 1971 to 31st March, 1972 92 officers resigned from the Citizen Force, from the Army, and the increase was 60. Those are not large-scale resignations. Take the Air Force. I am told that there was one resignation. In the Navy, five officers resigned. In other words, in the Army, the Air Force and the Navy there were altogether 97 resignations. These are not large-scale resignations. There were no resignations of men from the Army.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Are these the volunteer officers&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am referring to resignations from the Citizen Force now. I am talking about professional, expert, extended service officers of the Citizen Force, during the period 1st April, 1971 to 31st March, 1972. These did not therefore take place on such a large scale. We have taken steps to ensure that the young officers whom we are training at Heidelberg do not lose their commission appointments when they return to their units. I think the hon. member knows about that. It is a good principle. Now one is able in that way to utilize the services of those people in occupying positions.</p>

<p>The hon. member then referred to remuneration. I can only say that I am a little surprised to hear that our remuneration is not what it should be. On 1st January of last year I introduced large-scale improvements in the remuneration, in the daily allowance of commando officer and men, and Citizen Force officers and men, and in the dependants&#x2019; allowance. This was announced, and is available to the hon. members. These were adjusted to the salaries of Permanent Force personnel. The minimum salaries of Permanent Force personnel were used as a basis. A permanent Force member still has to pay house-rent. This was deducted because these Citizen Force and commando officers and men receive free accomodation, with the result that we cannot allow them that additional amount for house-rent as well. But they were adjusted, so as to compare properly and favourably with those of the Permanent Force personnel. Therefore, they cannot complain about that at present. As a responsible member of the Cabinet I cannot, at this stage, tell the hon. member that we are now going to increase the salaries and allowances of the Permanent Force, the Citizen Force and the commandos out of proportion to the rest of the Public Service. Surely there has to be a correlation. Surely I cannot go to the Minister of Finance and say that he must favour the Defence Force. What about the Police, and what about the Prisons Service&#x003F; Surely there has, at least, to be a correlation. But in all reasonableness I do want to say that I think one has to admit that the salaries and the allowances which are being paid in the Permanent Force and the Citizen Force today, including those of the Commandos as well, compare favourably, and are reasonable under the prevailing circumstances. With that I am not saying that they cannot be improved. They may perhaps be improved in future.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Middelburg and Green Point referred to the question of Coloured persons in the Defence Force. In the first instance, let me say that, as you know, the S.A. Coloured Corps is a Permanent Force unit. I do not think we have had all the success we should have had with the recruiting for the Coloured Corps. The Government is giving its attention to this matter. I think we must consider the matter and I shall discuss it with my colleague, the Minister of Coloured Affairs, and with the Executive of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, to see whether we should not gradually proceed to establish a special service battalion on a voluntary basis for the Coloureds, and then give the members of this service battalion training for 10 to 12 months and then draw from among their number for the Permanent Force, particularly for the Navy and the Army, where there are certain posts in which we can conveniently utilize their services; and that we use the rest, if we succeed in this&#x2014;I say that it has to happen gradually; we cannot begin all at once with a few thousand, because we do not have the instructors, and we shall have to train them as instructors&#x2014;to increase the numbers of that service battalion gradually so that it can comply with the requirements of our eventual demands for mobilization.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>But on a voluntary basis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, on a voluntary basis; and if this succeeds, I have no doubt that we can go further and can apply the same principle, particularly in Natal in respect of the Indians, that we can also establish something of this nature there <span class="col_5839-5840" refersTo="page_1383"/>and in particular utilize the services of part of the Indians at Salisbury Island, where we will have the buildings available in which to accommodate them. I think we can in this way bring considerable relief in certain caderes in the Defence Force where vacancies exist. The Government is giving its attention to this matter. The hon. member for Green Point referred to the question of remuneration. I asked that the figures be sent to me, and I have just received them. Considerable improvements were effected in April 1972 in respect of the members of the Coloured Corps. Under the old scale a warrant officer, class 1, received R1 740 &#x00D7; 90 &#x2212; 2 640. This is now R1 920 &#x00D7; 120&#x2212;2 880 &#x00D7; 240.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Then the figures I was working on, in the Estimates, were not correct&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>These are only since October 1971. There was a substantial increase in salaries. This is a general improvement which has been effected as part of the improvements for the other Coloured State employees.</p>

<p>Then, the hon. member for Middelburg raised a further matter, i.e. our standpoint in regard to the military position in Southern Africa, in co-operation with other states. In order to prevent any misunderstanding. I think I must say a few words about this. I have stated in this Parliament that we will, in the first place, ensure that the idea of co-operation with other neighbouring states in Southern Africa is also taken further in the sphere of security. Let me mention two examples now. The Prime Minister has already stated that we are prepared to conclude a non-aggression pact with any state in Africa, with any state which wants to conclude one with us. That is the first point in our programme. The second is that we are not a threat to any Africa state. We are not even a threat to Zambia. She is herself responsible for any threats there may be because she has enslaved herself to the Chinese Communists, but she has nothing to fear on our part. If she leaves us in peace, we shall also leave her in peace. Thirdly, up to the present and for the foreseeable future. I said, the defence of our country is reserved for the Republic of South Africa, including our Bantu homelands. Let us just consider this matter for a moment. Can you imagine a period, in our lifetime, or in the lifetime of our children, in which it will be possible for one of our Bantu homelands, or even for Lesotho or Botswana, to maintain a durable, effective air force&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It may happen.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it may happen, but then only with assistance from outside, and then they will also have to get their pilots and navigators from outside, and their ground staff as well. The same applies to Bantu areas situated along the coast. Not in our lifetime, and not in the lifetime of our children, will they be able to maintain an expensive Navy. Sir, to maintain a navy is not child&#x2019;s play. South Africa is experiencing this, and we do not even have a very large Navy, but even now we are paying through the nose for it. To maintain a Navy is not child&#x2019;s play. In other words, I am entitled to conclude that for generations to come the protection of the air space in Southern Africa, south of the Limpopo&#x2014;let us first discuss that area&#x2014; must be in the hands of the Republic of South Africa, (a) because we do not want to be a threat to anyone and (b) because our strong air force also guarantees the safety of neighbouring states. In the second place, our Navy guarantees safety along our coasts. The hon. members may ask: What about territorial defence&#x003F; here we have the example of Lesotho, which is itself an independent state, but which is trying to maintain its territorial defence with a &#x201C;police mobile force&#x201D;. She is doing so because there is no threat to her on our part, and because she needs this for internal peace and order. The same applies to our Bantu homelands as well. If they do not want to spend money unnecessarily they will begin modestly, perhaps in the sphere of the police service, to ensure their internal peace and security.</p>

<p>But I want to go further by saying that we have never said that we in Southern Africa will sit back so that Communism can infiltrate without our doing anything about it. That we have never said. In regard to the possible emancipation of homelands we have always adopted the attitude that emancipation or independence is not something which happens overnight, except by way of a revolution, and if it takes place through negotiation and deliberation one will, in one&#x2019;s discussions, request certain mutual guarantees. One of these will be non-aggression pacts. The other will be that one will not allow communist aggressors <span class="col_5841-5842" refersTo="page_1384"/>to use one&#x2019;s territory as a base for attacks on the other. Naturally this is, after all, only ordinary, reasonable, sound common sense. It is the policy of the Prime Minister. Hon. members must not say now that the hon. the Prime Minister said this, that or the other. The hon. the Prime Minister said that he could not prevent an African State from taking the bit in its teeth and wilfully co-operating with communism. After all, he cannot do that. In this case I have already furnished the reply to this House on 28th August, 1970. I then said that if neighbouring states were to lend themselves to forces which made aggression against South Africa possible from the communist or other sides, South Africa would do what any self-respecting country would do, in other words, she would defend herself, not only in a defensive sense, but she would hit back.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I said this again, under my Vote.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister has said this again. I am stating this in order to clarify the matter. In regard to this matter we must stop creating bogeys in the country. The onslaught of terrorism on Southern Africa is not only an onslaught on the White man; it is also an onslaught on the non-Whites. It is an onslaught on the freedom of the non-Whites. If the Chinese get their own way in South East Africa, they will enslave millions of Black people. They will then subject millions of Black people to a dictatorship which will be worse than anything those people have ever before experienced in their history. When we therefore, as a Defence Force, go on exercises such as those at Sibasa, or in other parts of the world, it is an instruction that Defence Force officers must preserve friendly relations with the local Bantu population on the best basis. The exercise at Sibasa proved that those good relations can be maintained. Today there are Defence Force units very near to Bantu areas where the best relations are being maintained, and where we are sometimes even asked, by the responsible authorities, to arrange Defence Force days so that they can see what is being done there to help stabilize their security as well.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Albany referred to the danger of forces trying to control the mind of man. What he said is quite correct, and all I can say is that we are attending to this problem. In due course we will perhaps be able to take more efficient steps in this regard. The hon. member also referred to the taking part of regiments or units in ordinary shows. I am informed that this is the practice at present. In certain instances they can take part in shows at the State&#x2019;s expense, and in other instances at the expense of the host. It all depends on what arrangement is made. If they do not want to go there at the State&#x2019;s expense or at the local committee&#x2019;s expense, they can go at their own expense. This practice is allowed but units must get the necessary leave to do so from the Army or Naval authorities, because in most cases people want the Army or the Navy there. As far as the Air Force is concerned, we have a different arrangement. We allow the Air Force to take part in special Air Force days when a few flying clubs come together and arrange a programme for a special day. The Air Force then usually takes part. If the hon. member wants all the details, I can furnish them to him by way of a letter.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Odendaalsrus referred to the question of more training for women. I wish we had more room for training women, as at the present Civil Defence College. I did not want to say that we should train women on a large scale, but I do think it would be a good thing if we were able to train 400 or 500 per year. This produces wonderful results, but I think we should encourage our womenfolk to support to a far greater extent organizations such as the Suid-Afrikaanse Noodhulpliga, the St. John&#x2019;s Ambulance Brigade and the Red Cross, and play an active part in these organizations. They can receive the necessary training there. At the moment we just do not have the funds to train more women than are at present being trained.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Worcester raised the question of the alleged attempt which is being made to persuade the International Red Cross to regard terrorists as prisoners of war. I hope that such a proposal never succeeds. I think it would be seriously prejudicial to the International Red Cross. As the hon. the Prime Minister has already, quite rightly, said, terrorism is a plague throughout the world. This is the method which is now being utilized to undermine order and stable government. This is organized murder, and nothing else. I cannot imagine a civilized organization ever lending <span class="col_5843-5844" refersTo="page_1385"/>itself to such a terrible undertaking. As far as South Africa is concerned, we shall most certainly adopt the strongest standpoint against such action. That is all I can say. I think that I have, with this, replied to most of the matters which have thus far been raised.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Minister has given the hon. member for Florida a conclusive reply, so there is no need for me to reply to the matter he raised. I have the Hansard report of what the hon. member for Durban Point said about this subject last year. I think I saw the hon. member for Florida with the hon. member for Durban Point a moment ago. Perhaps he should discuss the matter with him since he has now heard the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s point of view.</p>

<p>As Voortrekkerhoogte is situated in the Pretoria West constituency, it is, of course, a great privilege for me to congratulate our present C.G., as we usually call the Commandant-General, and to welcome him to the Pretoria West constituency. The C.G. will have to pardon us for not having all the ships and water in Pretoria to which he is accustomed. I think he should use the Zambesi in the meantime and see to matters on the opposite side of the river. The post of Commandant-General has an interesting history. I just want to mention it here. It actually started in Natal. I think the hon. member for Durban Point will feel very pleased when he hears this, because it is in fact the first place in South Africa where we used the word &#x201C;Commandant-General&#x201D;. The man who occupied that post there, was Andries Pretorius. That post was created after the Battle of Blood River. He occupied it with great distinction. I believe he was a great opportunist, but it had nothing to do with his occupying the post. Andries Pretorius gave us a Blood River. Another interesting case is associated with the post of Commandant-General, which in fact came into its own in the old South African Republic. There was in fact only one person who occupied the post there, namely Gen. Piet Joubert. He was not really a militarist, because he regarded himself more as a president of the South African Republic, but in spite of that he gave us a Majuba of which we in South Africa are very proud. I shall come back to this point in a moment. Gen. Louis Botha was Commandant-General for a very short period. He gave us Colenso and Spioenkop. Subsequently, under the present classification, the post of Commandant-General was occupied by the predecessor of Admiral Biermann and now, of course, it is occupied by Admiral Biermann himself. We wish Admiral Biermann every success in this post. We hope you are going to be very happy and that you will occupy that post with as much distinction as your predecessor did.</p>

<p>While I am addressing a few words to our present C.G., I just want to add that we have sitting to his right a small, exceptional group of officers who have devoted their lives to the Defence Force with great distinction and great results. We hope he will make the best use of their abilities for our country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. J. PIETERSE</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. I want to congratulate you. This morning&#x2019;s <i>Daily Mail</i> says that the hon. the Opposition has caught this side of the House on the wrong foot. According to them, we had allegedly expected the clashing of swords and gunpowder smoke, but what had, we had&#x003F;</p>

<p>I do not care what the <i>Daily Mail</i> says. I do not believe it in any event, but what I do believe, is that it is a good sign if a man with a temperament like the hon. member for Durban Point and a man such as the hon, member for North Rand argue so calmly here about national affairs and reveal such a fine spirit of patriotism. It is not the best thing on earth, of course, to congratulate an Opposition on its patriotism, <span class="col_5845-5846" refersTo="page_1386"/>but now I do so from my heart. I was absolutely pleasantly surprised by their conduct. To this I want to contrast the attitude adopted here by the hon. member for Houghton. I believe the future holds great things for the Opposition if it continues adopting this attitude which it is in the initial stages of adopting. If it grows and grows, there will really be a future for that Opposition once again. I want to thank them for that fine attitude.</p>

<p>While I am discussing this and congratulating them, I want to say&#x2014;and what I am saying now, I mean very positively&#x2014;that I am not completely convinced in my own mind that the hon. the Opposition as a whole shares the sentiments we heard from the speakers on that side of this House. I want to address a small request to them. They should try to influence the other hon. members on their side who do not have as much patriotism; they must cultivate that amongst those hon. members.</p>

<p>I am so pleasantly surprised that hon. members must pardon me for talking about it and if I come back to it a few times more later. In that regard I want to make another small recommendation. Since we are talking about defence, hon. members know that South Africa&#x2014;and. when I speak of South Africa, I, as an Afrikaner, want to refer more specifically to the Republic we had in the North&#x2014;has a glorious military past. If all the great nations of the world could have accomplished so much in the military sphere at that stage of their existence as South Africa did, they would have taken; their places in the annals of history. Take, for example, a battle such as that at Majuba. I know this involves the English, but I want to distinguish between English-speaking South Africans and those living in England. This should be taken into account when they judge these matters, and they should not condemn it. I draw a distinction between the two. Any country could be proud if it achieved as much as the South African Republic and the Orange Free State Republic did in such a short period of their existence. Incidentally, the Free Staters came to the assistence of the South African Republic in a very admirable way. They accomplished everything within a short period of time after the commencement of the Great Trek. It was one of the greatest armed battles I can call to mind. I think there are two nations which can be compared to that. These nations are perhaps Israel, the ancient state of the Jews in the olden days, and perhaps the present Israel, and Rome. The fact that the objective of the particular war could be achieved with one final blow, is something which will make the mouths of the military strategists and the political strategists water. I want to leave the matter at that. I want to tell the Opposition for the last time that this attitude of theirs was a very fine one and that they should please continue adopting it.</p>

<p>There are other matters, of course, in respect of which I agree with the hon. members, matters to which the Minister has already replied. For example, there is the matter of the pistol clubs, and I just want to say I hope more will be done for them. I do not know how many pistol clubs there are in Natal&#x2014;the hon. member for Durban Point may tell us this&#x2014;but I may ask him to encourage them to expand, because they may serve many a good purpose.</p>

<p>Where I do differ from the hon. member, is in respect of his plea for bivouacs to be held over long week-ends, including Sundays. I as an Afrikaner cannot approve of that, because we as Afrikaners believe that on the Sabbath one may do only that which is most essential and cannot be postponed. The fact that one of our greatest facets of arms, i.e. the Battle of Blood River, took place on a Sunday, testifies to that. However, this is done only in cases of emergency, and then only in exceptional cases. In that respect, therefore, I want to differ from the hon. member.</p>

<p>A few moments ago the hon. the Minister raised a matter in this House. He spoke about the building up of the will of a nation against, <i>inter alia,</i> terrorism, and it was in this regard that the hon. the Minister mentioned it. I am very pleased the hon. the Minister did mention it. In fact, I want to address a small request to him in this regard and submit it to him for consideration. Hon. members know that from time to time magazines make some mention of terrorism. I know that a considerable amount was written about it in the magazine <i>Scope.</i> In Pretoria&#x2019;s daily newspaper, <i>Hoofstad,</i> lengthy articles were published, illustrated with photographs. A considerable amount was said about terrorism by a man such as A. Venter. However, it appears as. <span class="col_5847-5848" refersTo="page_1387"/>though our people are gradually becoming more and more lackadaisical. They completely forget that there is an extremely dangerous position on our northern borders and that it is becoming increasingly serious. Then there are occurrences, tragic accurrences such as land-mine explosions, which shock our people into wakefulness and which are given much attention by the radio and the newspapers, but subsequently this feeling gradually sinks away into oblivion once more. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether we cannot do more in this regard. For example, is it not possible for us to make short news films which may be incorporated into cinema shows&#x003F; In addition to this, I want to request that if this can be done, these films should be as realistic as possible and that we should obtain permission from the Department of the Interior, where necessary, to show such films.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to get involved in a Bantustan debate, but the hon. the Minister referred here to the security position in the light of the planned independent Bantustans. I do not know whether words mean anything, but we heard here from the Prime Minister that any Bantu state or any Bantustan may now come to negotiate with him. After they have received their independence, it will mean total and full independence. In a Press statement he went so far as to say that if they should want to play with China or Moscow, he could try to stop them with words, but could do nothing else about it. Now we hear from the hon. the Minister of Defence that in the negotiations for independence there will be no question of full independence, because provision will be made for treaties and restrictions to maintain our security. I am very glad to hear that.</p>

<p>May I ask you a question&#x003F; Does the fact that we have a treaty with Britain make us less independent&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, but then the Prime Minister should not say that these Bantu states could become red if they wanted to or could trade with whom they wanted to, including Moscow or Peking. Now the hon. the Minister says that it will be restricted by treaties. As I say, I do not want to get involved in that argument now, but I want to ask the hon. the Minister this question : Will the hon. the Minister please tell us what his attitude is towards the requests that have now come from two of the Bantustans for a Defence Force&#x003F; I think that is a fair question. There have been two, requests from two different Bantustans in South Africa to take part in defence and to have their own Defence Forces. I am very interested to hear what his reaction is to that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now I want to come back to another matter in the few moments I have left. It is obviously impossible in the time available to deal with this matter properly. I want to come back to the question of the Citizen Force. The hon. the Minister said that my plea was impossible and impractical, but that the interval now would be reduced to two years, instead of three years &#x2014;that means six years total. Now we are on the right road. My proposal was four years. I still believe that with a little calculation and adjustment you can bring it down to four years. But now, having got this far, let us argue whether those extra two years are possible now, or whether they will be possible later. Having brought the time down to four years, I do not suggest that those men be then removed from strength. They would remain on the strength of the unit. They would retain their uniform for the full ten years. They are then available for call-up at any time. So your target force is still there. The fact that they have been better trained, that they have acquired a better unit spirit, makes them far more valuable than the man who has only done two camps and is still waiting for his last camp. These then are fully trained men on the strength of the unit for another six years, but would not be active, not be called up for periodic parades and not have commitments for those six years other than being available and on the strength of the unit. Perhaps they could have one annual bivouac or get-together to check equipment and see that they are still there. Those men, even though on the active strength of the unit but without active commitments, would, I believe, be better trained soldiers than those we are turning out spread over the ten years. Therefore, I hope the hon. the Minister will not just close this matter, but that we will go further.</p>

<p>I was glad to hear his remarks in regard to the non-continuous parades. Those parades are usually held on a Saturday afternoon or in the evening. They are an <span class="col_5849-5850" refersTo="page_1388"/>absolute waste of time. They comprise a roll call, a hair inspection and a lecture. It creates resentment; it interferes with sport, and it achieves nothing. If people have to be interfered with in the interests of a better Defence Force, then I would say: By all means do it. But when it serves no purpose, then I say that it should not be done simply for the sake of getting people together; do it only when there is a purpose, an objective and a need. I again say that I believe that bivouacs would be of far more value in the long term.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister referred to commandos and rural regiments. I want to make a very heartfelt plea to him: Please do not destroy our rural regiments, our traditional regiments.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister indicated that he felt that in the platteland you should have commandos and that you should have your regiments in the cities. Sir, some of the most glorious military history of South Africa has been written by rural regiments. In Natal we are proud of regiments like the UMR and the Carbineers, which have grown up as part of the history of South Africa. Then you have the Middellandse Regiment in the Cape and all the others. I am glad to hear the hon. the Minister say that that is not his intention.</p>

<p>There are various other matters which have been raised here to which the hon. the Minister has not yet had an opportunity to reply. I realize that he cannot reply to everything, but I hope that he will deal in due course with the other matters which have been raised. I do not expect him to reply now, but I should like to mention the points to which he has not yet replied. The hon. member for Salt River raised the question of the maintenance of vehicles and the question of vehicle parks.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I did reply.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. the Minister dealt with the question of standardization. He did not deal with the system of maintenance to ensure that vehicles will be roadworthy at short notice. That is the aspect which the hon. member raised particularly. Then there is the question of pistol clubs, which I do not propose to debate further. I think the hon. the Minister misunderstood me. I did not mean that the Army should be committed to it; I meant a system of registration so that the pistol clubs will be entitled to purchase ammunition at wholesale rates instead of having to pay the high retail profit margin, even though the price has been reduced.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I come to the last issue which the hon. the Minister raised and which I believe remains open, and that is the question of tying the Army to grades, with ranks and pay equivalent to those attaching to posts in the Public Service. I believe that that is something which should be looked at again, so that you do not have to promote a man simply so that he can get a better income, when his new rank does not fit in with the structure of the Army. Then there is the question of the mess-up with apprentices&#x2019; pay at Simonstown. This is the sort of thing that results when you try to put a military force under Public Service Commission control. Then there is the question of call-up of matriculants, the question of the Nuffield Week mess this year, and also the question of allocations, with the last of which the hon. the Minister dealt to some extent. I think those are the outstanding matters which the Minister did not deal with. Sir, I come back to this question of men versus machines. The hon. the Minister was able to quote what had been done in the past. I admit that a lot has been done. But, Sir, if you take a rugby field and a camp with 3 000 men, then only 60 or 90 players out of those 3 000 men can play on that rugby field in one afternoon. It is easy to quote figures and to say that you have done this, that and the other thing; it sounds good in globular figures. For example the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures as to the number of resignations from the Citizen Force sound good. I do not want to bandy figures across the floor of the House; I do not want to ask him what percentage of his officers resigned; I do not want to ask him how many normal retirements must be added to the 97 resignations in the last year. I do not want to ask him to tell us across the floor of the House what the shortfall of officers is. He knows the facts, as I know them. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to break a lance for the commandos in South-West Africa, and point out the sacrifices made by the farmers there for the sake of the commando system. As <span class="col_5851-5852" refersTo="page_1389"/>you know, Sir, in South-West Africa we have to contend with long distances between towns. Consequently national servicemen must travel very far in order to attend commando practices. I have discussed the commando system in South-West Africa with the hon. the Minister on several occasions, and I want to thank him sincerely for the concessions which he made on various occasions which have had such good results. Actually, it has been an encouragement to many commando officers in South-West Africa to think that the Minister and the Defence Headquarters are interested in the commandos in South-West Africa to this extent. But there is nevertheless something which I consider to be a shortcoming, i.e. the spirit of indifference to the commando system. We in South-West Africa have become used to the international position in which South-West Africa finds itself, with the result that they are quite indifferent to the international problems and dangers which this holds for South-West Africa. They say that the international position as regards South-West Africa, is of such a nature that they can do nothing about it. They feel that nothing will happen in any case, and that South-West Africa is in good hands. It seems to me as if there is a spirit of indifference to the commando system as the result of this outlook. I have always felt that there is a certain measure of ignorance amongst members of the public in South-West Africa of the objectives of the commando system, and for that reason I want to plead here for the appointment of a public relations officer between the public and the commandos. I know that the hon. the Minister will tell me that the commandant of the commando in question is the public relations officer and that he will do the necessary public relations work. Sir, I want to tell you that the commandants of the commandos in the north with which I am acquainted, are often not well-off people, and it often happens that their time is taken up by public relations work, and that they cannot give the necessary attention to their farms or to bread-and-butter matters, with the result that they land themselves in financial difficulties and are obliged to reconsider their position in the commando. If, after years of training and personal expense and sacrifice, such a person were to resign from the commando, it goes without saying that the commando system would suffer. I am putting it like this because I have personal experience of the position in which some people land themselves if they are not very strong financially, and I therefore ask the hon. the Minister to consider such a step.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to identify myself with the hon. members who have already congratulated Admiral Biermann on his promotion to Commandant General. I should also be neglecting my duty if I did not avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to Admiral Biermann for all he has meant to the Navy. Under his leadership the size of the Navy was increased. To my mind the present popularity of the Navy among our citizens is to a large extent due to the example set by him as chief of the Navy. Another fact which is of great importance is that very good relations exist between the Navy and the local authorities in the Southern Peninsula at the moment. As chief of the Navy, as a diplomate, and as a link between the Defence Force and the local authorities and the public, he has rendered the people of South Africa excellent services. I am very proud of the fact that the Commandant General is actually a registered voter in my constituency, and I hope that although he will shortly be moving to Pretoria, he will remain registered in my constituency.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We are nearing the end of this debate and I would like to say a few words about some specialized units. Some of these have not been mentioned in this debate so far. First of all I want to refer to the Submarines and I want to congratulate all those responsible for the pre-planning and for the reception of the submarines in France, those people who went over to France and helped with the planning in order to accommodate the officers and men and their wives, and those responsible for the education facilities for the children of the men serving in a foreign country. I have only heard the greatest praise, from all of those who went to France, for the arrangements made on their behalf. The men themselves who went to receive those submarines, from all reports have been excellent ambassadors for the Republic, and I think it is therefore worthy of them and of the services they have rendered to the Republic that they should be rewarded with the excellent facilities that have been provided for them at the Simonstown naval base. South Africa can be very proud of the submarine crews that have been trained here and in France.</p>

<p><span class="col_5853-5854" refersTo="page_1390"/>Then I want to refer to the Paratroop batallion, of which I have had some experience. There you have a dedicated group of officers and instructors. There is an excellent spirit and a fine pride in this batallion, and there is discipline and a safety record which I believe is second to none in the world. The Army gymnasium at Heidelberg is also an institution with which I am acquainted. This is an institution with first-class facilities and a strong conception of discipline, and those who have been through the Army gymnasium, will, I believe, echo what I say, namely that they received a first-class training there as future officers and N.C.O.s.</p>

<p>*Finally, still in connection with these specialized units, I just want to refer briefly to the Naval Band. The Naval Band is doing excellent work, particularly in the capacity of public relations officer for the Navy. It is very popular all over the Cape Province and I want to say this afternoon that everyone should be very grateful to Captain Imrie and the Naval Band.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I also think it is appropriate that we should say that the Naval College at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, like the Army gymnasium at Heidelberg, is doing first-class work, and I should like to pay tribute to the work that was done by Captain Botha, who at the end of last year was transferred to Pretoria.</p>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. member for Durban Point that the danger of the present system regarding the Navy being coupled with the Public Service Commission lies in its becoming top-heavy. I do not want to go into the details. I think the point has already been made, but that is a very real danger. There is also another danger, and that is that too many of the lower ranks are leaving the naval service. I want to say to the Minister what I have said to him most years since I came to this House. One of the main reasons why we are losing people in the naval service is because there is not sufficient housing for them at Simonstown. Until the housing problem is properly tackled, the Navy will continue, as it is today, to be understrength. Not only is there a shortage of funds, but I believe there is also red tape between the Department of Defence and the Department of Community Development. Since Simonstown was declared a White group area, a number of houses and flats previously occupied by non-Whites have been taken over by the Department of Community Development. I believe the time has come for the Department of Defence to take over those houses and to see that they are developed and used by defence personnel. My plea to the hon. the Minister is to give consideration to the Defence Department taking over those houses from the Department of Community Development. Many of the houses acquired by the department are standing empty. Doors and windows have been broken and they are a wasted asset to the Defence Force. The other alternative, to assist with the housing shortage, is as a temporary measure for the Minister to agree to subsidize the rentals of those people who live outside Simonstown. They are paying very high rentals indeed and it is no wonder that many of them feel compelled to leave the naval service because they simply cannot come out on the salaries they are paid. I say that if we are going to build Simonstown up into a great naval base, as I believe we can, the Government must not be afraid to plan ahead for the development of Simonstown as a big naval base, and to spend the money to provide the facilities that will keep the people in the naval service. Not only does this affect the Navy, but it also affects the Dockyard. We have to face the situation that many of the people working in the dockyard live in Bellville, Parow, Vasco and other northern suburbs. They have to come by train, bus and car to Simonstown. It takes them hours to get there and back. If you want to have a full complement in the dockyard, and if you want to keep your navy up to strength in Simonstown, then something has to be done to provide housing facilities for these people near to the naval base. There are still other reasons why I think people leave the naval service. I do not want to go into details. The hon. the Minister knows what I have mentioned before. But there are inadequate fringe benefits and there is the absence of a contract system. He was kind enough to write me a letter after the debate last year, giving his reasons why he felt that there could not be a contract system. I have studied his letter carefully. I do not believe it is very convincing. I believe it is necessary to have a contract system and to have a re-enlistment bonus. In that way you will keep people in the Navy. Once again I appeal to the Minister to give his attention to the lack of recreational facilities, especially off-duty facilities, for the young trainees <span class="col_5855-5856" refersTo="page_1391"/>who come down to do service at the naval base at Simonstown.</p>

<p>Then there are a small number of petty irritations which, with little expense, could, I believe, be eliminated. I do not see that it is beyond the wit of the Minister and the department to arrange with the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs for free postage for those in the naval service. I believe that the old rail concessions could be reinstituted, and I believe that at least two or three times a year those people serving in the Navy should be given a free rail warrant back to their homes. In that way I think we would engender a better spirit among the people serving in the Navy.</p>

<p>Then there are two last matters I want to mention, two causes for complaints that have come to my notice. The first is that some of those young men who go to the university, prefer to do a year of military service first. Many of them seem to choose to go to the Air Force, perhaps because they have a scientific bent and are keen on scientific matters. But many of those young fellows are utterly frustrated because after their three months basic training they are kept on guard duties and other similar obligations. I believe that those who are in the position to do so and who are able and intelligent enough to go to a university, and are lucky enough to go to a university, should not be misused during that period of training&#x2014;but their services be more effectively utilized.</p>

<p>Lastly there is another small matter which I would like to raise. It concerns the question of bilingualism. The policy of the department is bilingualism, English one month and Afrikaans the next month. It is a first-class policy but it is not always carried out in practice. I would like to mention that I have had complaints which I may say I have not investigated, namely that many of the notices emanating from the Castle are only in one language. If the hon. the Minister would look into that matter I would be much obliged.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, notwithstanding the fact that the Commandant General probably feels very welcome and at home in our midst by this time. I too want to congratulate and welcome him. When the Commandant General subsequently traverses the Republic on his travels, he will undoubtedly find that Heidelberg is the most beautiful constituency in our country. He will find that one of the finest institutions of the Defence Force, viz. the Army Gymnasium, is situated in Heidelberg. If he, in his capacity as Admiral, really wants to see a lot of water, he may also come to Heidelberg, because the Vaal Dam is situated in that constituency.</p>

<p>A great mind once said that if you want to make a very good speech, you can do it briefly and succinctly by using just one little word, consisting of six letters, and that is the word &#x201C;thanks&#x201D;. I want to devote a part of my speech to that this afternoon by saying &#x201C;thank you very much&#x201D; to the hon. the Minister of Defence. Six years ago a very fine and historic institution at Heidelberg was closed down. I am referring to the Heidelberg Teachers&#x2019; College. That college was rich in tradition and produced great men. Several of that college&#x2019;s products are sitting on this side of the House today. I have no doubt that the institution that replaced the college, viz. the Army Gymnasium, will produce for South Africa men as great as and perhaps even greater than those produced by the teachers&#x2019; college. We are very proud of the commanding officer there, and I believe that he too will yet make an indelible impression on our military history. We have no doubt that some of the boys who are receiving and will receive their training there will also become great men in the defence of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. the Minister very much for having seen to it that that institution, the Army Gymnasium, is what it is. I want to say to him that the officers, the staff and all the boys there are very happy. How could it be otherwise&#x003F; The buildings and grounds are situated among the historic sugar-bush-covered hills of A. G. Visser. The climate is excellent. There is an excellent relationship between the institution and the public of Heidelberg. I also want to thank the hon. the Minister, in particular on behalf of the town council of Heidelberg, for having been prepared to listen to us whenever we made representations, so that our representations always had very good results. We convey our sincere thanks to the Minister. In spite of what the hon. the Minister said this afternoon in connection with higher training for the Defence Force, we Heidelbergers want to say to him that he must constantly bear in mind having higher training of Defence Force officers taking place there eventually, in addition to what <span class="col_5857-5858" refersTo="page_1392"/>we already have at the Army Gymnasium. Heidelberg is close to the Rand University, should it be necessary for students to take a degree course there. The former Heidelberg Teachers&#x2019; College had its degree students make use of the lectures given by the University of South Africa, and this proved to be a success.</p>

<p>Then there is another small matter that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. In doing so, I am not adopting a critical attitude or professing to have any superior knowledge, but I am doing it solely because I have unshakable confidence in the Defence Force and in its handling of matters. We find for example that boys, after matriculating, still cannot say what direction they want to follow in life. In other words, they have not yet been able to choose a career. I want to state very clearly here that our education departments are giving our boys vocational guidance in the high schools. They are doing this well and we are very grateful for it. However, it seems to me that boys in their high-school years are not yet responsible enough to absorb that vocational guidance fully, with the result that we find today that many matric boys, after matriculating, have not yet decided what profession to follow in life. After matriculating they go to the Defence Force for their military training, and because the Defence Force is inspired and permeated by patriotism and love of the fatherland, is disciplined and is intent on sending motivated citizens into the world, I want to ask the hon. the Minister this afternoon whether the Defence Force, despite its many duties, its many activities and its full programme, cannot perhaps devote some time, an hour or so a week, to giving vocational guidance to the boys who are entrusted to its care for that year. I have said that the high schools are doing this. The Department of Labour on its part is also doing its best to place our people in certain careers. Government departments and business institutions are also giving vocational guidance, but unfortunately that vocational guidance often degenerates into recruitment and is not really vocational guidance. I have the utmost confidence that, if our Defence Force handled this matter, it would do it in such a way that the boys would be able to make their choice with open minds, and that when these boys closed the gates of the Defence Force institutions behind them one day, they would not only leave those institutions as disciplined and motivated citizens of the country, but, with the guidance given to them in this respect by the Defence Force, would also know what to do. If this could be done, we would find that there would not be as large a labour turn-over in South Africa as we have today. I think I may say that one of the reasons why we have this large labour turn-over is that many of the boys, after having matriculated, still do not know what direction to follow and what profession to choose. They flit from one profession to the next, with the result that they are worth less to us as citizens than they would have been had they been able, immediately after matriculating or after receiving their training in the Defence Force, to follow a particular career in which they would have been happy, that they would have been better citizens to the Republic.</p>

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. C. VON KEYSERLINGK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the very limited time at my disposal I crave the indulgence of the hon. member for Heidelberg. I have been instructed to cut my speech short because there is not much time left. We have listened with great interest and gratification to what the hon. Minister has told us today about the developments which have taken place in South Africa&#x2019;s Defence Force. It is a report which fills one with pride and our congratulations go to those gentlemen who are leading our forces and are showing South Africa that unity which we should really have in South Africa. The Minister dealt shortly with the Coloured Corps which is at present in existence and told us of the possibility of extending the formation of a corps also to the Indian population group. I think that our Bantu population is being given a slap in the face.</p>

<p>After all, they are the indigenous people of South Africa and they have proved their loyalty to this country in more ways than one through the last three centuries. My personal experience of them after nearly 40 years in the Police Force is that I can vouch for their loyalty to the Government. This has already been shown by the fact that the Commissioner of the South African Police, no doubt with the Government&#x2019;s approval, has now sent a mixed contingent to our borders. I am sure that when the reports come back they will prove that all of them&#x2014;White, Indian, Coloured and Bantu&#x2014;have served with distinction. We will be proud to call them fellow South Africans.</p>

<p><span class="col_5859-5860" refersTo="page_1393"/>I therefore make a plea to the hon. the Minister to give the formation of a Bantu military corps serious consideration. We have heard today of the communist threat to this country. We acknowledge it. We know that it is something horrible, but we are not afraid of it. We will knock them out. Make no mistake about that. Who will be the peasantry that will knock these people out&#x003F; None other than our Bantu in their Bantu homelands. It is therefore incumbent that we should inculcate them with the loyalty for which the Bantu looks to the White man at all times. The hon. the Minister has, quite rightly, spoken about how the chiefs welcome the Army manoeuvring in the Bantu areas. I know it, because when I went with detachments of the Police into the reserves, chiefs welcomed us with open arms. We have been able to rustle out some nest of wrongdoers, dagga-traders and all the rest. Therefore, I give him the thought that the formation of a Bantu military unit is due and that it should therefore be started now before he goes on to the Indians. Without detracting from the Indians, I guarantee that the loyalty to this country of the Bantu is paramount in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Umlazi raised more or less the same matter as the hon. member for Durban Point. I think I have stated the policy of the Government clearly, namely that on account of the expense involved in the maintenance of defence forces, we cannot for one moment see how it is possible for the Bantu Authorities, whether they are self-governing or whether they are independent &#x2026;</p>

<p>I will come to that. We cannot for one moment see how they will be able to afford the upkeep of an army or part of an army. I think they must start off with Police units to keep order and stability within their country. As far as the employment of Bantu in certain categories of the Army itself is concerned, I want to say that it is the policy to employ them. We still have Bantu people in employment today. We are very proud of the services they are rendering.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as in the past. But I do not think we can start creating a Bantu corps in the Defence Force. I think that would be wrong.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Durban Point put a question to me. He said already two Bantu Authorities had decided to request permission for establishing an army unit. As yet we have not received these requests, although I know about them. I think it is very clear that if a country such as Lesotho, which has been independent for quite some time, restricts itself to its Police mobile unit, this would be the advice one would want to give when such a matter came before one. I think it would be only wise to do so, because the upkeep of an infantry unit, or an armoured unit, or an artillery unit, is not child&#x2019;s play. That is why one would want to advise that such a state start off with the establishment of a Police unit to do its elementary work for it and to assist in keeping watch over its security. I have stated the Government&#x2019;s approach. What I said about our co-operation in Southern Africa, I said with the approval of the hon. the Prime Minister. I referred to column 2918 of Hansard of 28th August, 1970, when I stated this matter on behalf of the Government and said that we were in favour of a better understanding being created among the Southern African States in the economical sphere and in the diplomatic sphere, and of having everyone take up an anti-communist stand. I also said we adopted the point of view that through mutual co-operation these anti-communist Southern African States should forge closer links with one another in order to establish a bloc against Communism in Africa. We do not want to limit this to Southern Africa only, but we want to take it further, as the hon. the Prime Minister said, so as to seek co-operation with other African States as well, and to extend our co-operation to those who want to join us in establishing an anticommunist bloc. I do not know of any way in which I can state this more clearly. What the hon. the Prime Minister did say, was that if an independent state were to leave the fold and were to lean towards Communism, despite our endeavours to persuade it to take up an anti-communist stand, one would surely not be able to stop that State, but, in that case, if it were to place its country at the disposal of an aggressor who became a threat to us, South Africa would do what any self-respecting country would do. In that case <span class="col_5861-5862" refersTo="page_1394"/>it would protect itself and not sit by idly until it was caught napping.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then the hon. member referred again to the question of the Citizen Force and the training which we have given until now. Let me say at once that should the hon. member come forward with positive proposals with which we can deal, I will be prepared to refer it to the Supreme Command to ask for their advice. Then we can go into this matter. I am not bound to one system of training and I have proved it in the past. We started with a certain type of training for the commando&#x2019;s and this year I came to this House with new proposals. If the hon. member can come forward with a proper proposal which we can consider I shall refer it to the Supreme Command. Then they can give me their advice. Then the hon. member referred to the question of tying the ranks with posts in the Civil Service. That, together with the representations made by the hon. member for Simonstown, will be considered. When I was listening to the two hon. members I thought that that was the annual speech I make when I meet the hon. Minister of Finance for a few hours to discuss the problems of the Defence Force. In other words, it was only a repetition of what I have already told him. Seeing that the two hon. members are supporting me, I shall convey their message to him when I meet him next year.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the hon. member for Etosha. That hon. member&#x2019;s commandos certainly have a problem. There are large and vast areas. If the hon. member would just look at what we had done, he would see there was a comprehensive allowance paid out by us to commandants for A Commandos, B Commandos and C Commandos. It varies from R420 to R360 per year, and is paid out irrespective of their daily rate and their dependants&#x2019; allowance. Then we have certain allowances for adjutants and quartermasters, which were increased recently. In this way we are trying to accommodate the men. However. I want to agree with the hon. member that commanders in his area pay a very high price for the service they render. We must express our thanks to them. We shall effect an improvement if we can do so with the assistance of the Minister of Finance, and he provides a great deal of assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to request the privilege of the half hour. Before commencing my speech on tourism, I want to deal very briefly with the Estimates. There is no need for me to spend much time discussing the Estimates. The amount in the Estimates is a very small one. There are very few changes. The only real change is an additional R80 000 in respect of grants-in-aid for the Tourist Corporation. I just want to say that this does not even cover the devaluation of the rand, because the bulk of the money of the Tourist Corporation is used for overseas publicity. So there is no need for me to spend much time dealing with this matter.</p>

<p>Then we also have the expenditure in connection with the Southern African Regional Tourism Council, which has now been reduced by R80 000. The Minister will quite probably tell us at a later stage why this has been done. The amount appropriated for the Hotel Board has been reduced from R600 000 to R100 000. The Minister will probably furnish us with his reply in this connection as well.</p>

<p>Recently the importance of the Tourism Vote has on various occasions in this country been brought pertinently to the attention of the Government and the public as a result of statements made by various organizations, and through the Press, for we are all satisfied that this is an important method of obtaining foreign currency and capital. There is some measure of concern because nothing is being done to strengthen the portfolio as such and make even greater efforts to attract tourists to this country. In addition, the prestige of the Department of Tourism has suffered for the worse because the Minister saw fit to down-grade the post of Secretary of Tourism to that of Deputy Secretary. We should like to hear from the Minister at this juncture whether he thought that this post was of such minor importance to him that he down-graded it, and deprived the Secretary of his post as head of the department in order to appoint a Deputy Secretary in his place. In the third place&#x2014; I do not want to spend too much time on this matter&#x2014;Satour, as far as we know, changed its advertising agency in the middle of a campaign, a project which was to have lasted for three years. In view of that we have to accept that, at this stage, a vacuum exists in regard to campaigns and projects advertising agents have to suggest to Satour, and that activities have probably been delayed in this connection. The Minister may also try to furnish us with a reply to that aspect.</p>

<p>All these aspects I have mentioned do nothing but detract from the prestige of the Department of Tourism and render it suspect in the eyes of the public. In this regard I want to say that we are at our wit&#x2019;s end with this hon. Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the debate was adjourned before supper, I was dealing with the Estimates. I <span class="col_5865-5866" refersTo="page_1396"/>had indicated that the Estimates were not only not more, but that they were actually, less in terms of devaluation. I also indicated that the Department of Tourism had been downgraded as a result of the actions of the Minister, and that there were other matters in regard to of which we have grave doubts. I said that we are reaching the stage where we are at our wits&#x2019; ends in regard to the actions of the hon. the Minister. Last year we were very critical of the Minister in regard to this post and the importance he attached to the post. He took it amiss of me for criticizing him year after year in regard to his actions as far as the Tourism Vote is concerned. When the House was adjourned this afternoon I said that we are reaching the stage where we are at our wits&#x2019; end on account of the actions of the hon. the Minister and that we on this side of the House have considered moving that his salary be reduced. After giving due consideration to the matter, however, we decided, not to do so. We think the hon. the Minister is the victim of circumstances. When I say that the hon. the Minister is the victim of circumstances, I refer to the mistake he made about ten years ago when he agreed to become a member of that Party to be used as window-dressing for that Party. He was appointed to the Cabinet immediately after joining the Party and ever since the importance of his Posts is of such a nature that he has not been able to persuade the Cabinet to appropriate a larger amount on the Budget for an important Vote such as this.</p>

<p>I want to raise a further objection before commencing my speech. This concerns the report of the Department of Tourism we received yesterday. This report was Tabled yesterday and we are already dealing with this Vote this evening. In the first place, I take strong exception on behalf of this Party to the actions of this hon. Minister and his department as far as the reports are concerned. [Interjections.] In the second place. I want to say that it really makes no difference at what late stage this report has been Tabled, because there is nothing in it lust imagine a department which is as important as the Department of Tourism submitting a report such as this! The reports on the various matters comprise a total of only six pages. Yes, they comprise all of six pages! Do you know, Sir, what is being dealt with in this report apart from the usual routine points&#x003F; I quote paragraph 8.4 as an example. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the most important decisions arrived at during the conference concerned the establishment of a permanent body to be known as the Southern African Regional Tourism Council (SARTOC)</block>

<p>This decision was taken in Zambia. No, not in Zambia, but in Malawi. I now quote from paragraph 8.13&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Conclusion: Since finality has not yet been reached on some aspects of certain important recommendations contained in the report of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council on the rationalization and promotion of the South African tourist industry, the department is obliged to leave in abeyance certain projects to which attention had already been given as well as certain proposed lines of action.</block>

<p>There we have the whole version of what is happening in regard to tourism. [Interjections.] Then we have a report by the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister in which twelve specific recommendations are made. We tried last year to discuss these recommendations in this House. Everybody knows what happened on that occasion. We were asked not to discuss the recommendations since there was some confusion as to whether the report was confidential or not. We reconciled ourselves to that and did not discuss the report any further. The only item out of the 12 specific recommendations accepted by the hon. the Minister, is the recommendation that an advisory committee be established. The hon. the Minister then accepted that part of the report and established the advisory committee. This advisory committee is still considering what should be done about the report.</p>

<p>I know precisely what the hon. the Minister is going to do. He is going to hide behind the fact that an investigation was conducted in this regard and that an advisory committee was subsequently appointed. Furthermore, he is going to submit that, on account of this, he could not do any thing and that this is why tourism has been relegated to the background to such an extent. In view of this long delay an <span class="col_5867-5868" refersTo="page_1397"/>appeal is being made from all over the country, an appeal that we should have a dynamic approach in regard to tourism and, in view of our unfavourable balance of trade, for the immediate expansion of the Department of Tourism.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, does the hon. the Minister consider that he is furthering the aims of his department by demoting it to the extent that there is no longer a secretary for the department but only a deputy secretary&#x003F; In all fairness I put the question to the hon. the Minister. Does he think that he is promoting the interests of such an important department by indicating to the rest of the world that the department is demoted and that it is no longer important as far as the economy of South Africa is concerned&#x003F; I put it to the hon. the Minister: Is he playing the game&#x003F; In the past we have consistently attacked the Minister from this side in an effort to spur him on. We have made numerous recommendations now embodied in the proposals of the commission. We have come to the conclusion that it is Government policy to relegate this important department to an unimportant role. Sir, I have reason for saying this. Surely to goodness the hon. the Minister, as a very senior Minister, has some influence with the Cabinet when he puts his approach as far as the Department of Tourism is concerned. He must have some influence, even if it is little. If he cannot succeed in building up this department to play the important role that it should play in the economy of South Africa, then the Cabinet must have decided that this department is to be relegated to an inferior position. Sir, there should be a powerful co-ordinating body or a committee consisting of representatives from the Department of Tourism, the Department of Railways and Airways, more particularly, and the Department of Information, because these departments are all very pertinently involved in creating a better atmosphere as far as tourism is concerned, an atmosphere in which more tourists will come to this country. Mr. Chairman, I am not in a position to talk about the Department of Information at this stage; we will come to that when the Vote of that department is dealt with, but the Department of Information has an enormously important part to play in propagating and promoting tourism internationally. I put it pertinently to the hon. the Minister: Has it never occurred to him that there should be a co-ordinating committee between these various departments to put forward suggestions as to how best to promote tourism&#x003F; It staggers me to think that such an important department should be so horribly neglected. I will mention at a later stage what is happening in other countries and how tourism there is regarded as an earner of foreign currency. I think, Sir, that the South African Airways has an important part to play in promoting tourism and I think the Department of Information has a very important part to play. I think that there should be a co-ordinating committee to co-ordinate the activities of the various departments. We have not got the necessary co-ordination. In this respect, Sir, will you permit me to read out certain comments made by Mr. Human, the president of the Handelsinstituut&#x003F;</p>

<p>*I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the promotion of tourism, particularly in view of the country&#x2019;s balance of payment and the development of the hotel industry, it is essential, according to the president of the Handelsinstituut, that the State and the private sector should join forces. Mr. Human made it quite clear that he would like to see more aggressive marketing and positive actions in respect of tourist promotion. In this connection, consideration should be given to establishing a directorate of tourism promotion with the power to promote tourism on a more balanced, but positive, basis and to have the necessary interdepartmental liaison tighted up speedily and effectively. Mr. Human said that isolated attempts by particularly the various Government Departments could no longer be tolerated. For example, could we invest our capital in five Boeing 747&#x2019;s while numerous other airlines are going to do the same, without a co-ordinated and well-planned tourist traffic programme&#x003F;</block>

<p>It is in view of this that I said that co-ordination of this nature, which we should like to see between the various departments, simply does not exist.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, in view of the adverse trade balance the whole country is looking for avenues to improve the situation, and in this connection tourism comes very much to the fore. At the moment we have an adverse <span class="col_5869-5870" refersTo="page_1398"/>balance as far as out- and in-tourists are concerned. We are still R30 million in the red, according to the report of the Tourist Corporation and one or two other reports that we have. It is calculated that by 1980 we should be able to break square. The present adverse balance can be converted to a credit balance with powerful promotion of tourism, particularly abroad. We know that there has been a substantial increase in tourism during 1970-&#x2019;71, but this is not good enough, More than half the tourists coming to South Africa are still coming from neighbouring territories. Here I should like to quote briefly from Satour&#x2019;s report. Of the 389 000 tourists we had in South Africa in the year 1970-&#x2019;71, 225 000 emanated from Africa and the balance from Furopean countries and Asia. This resulted in a deficit of something like R25 million. Sir, we do not want to make comparisons all along the line, but I would like to cite a few figures. We find that as far as Spain is concerned, tourism contributes 36 per cent of the value of their total exports. In fact, tourism in Spain produces more foreign exchange than our gold output. In Austria the figure was 23 per cent of their exports; in Ireland it was 15 per cent; in Finland, in 1968-&#x2019;69, 30 per cent of their total exports was contributed by tourism; in Greece the figure was 24 per cent. I know that the increase in South Africa has been something of the order of 14 per cent in 1971, but that is not good enough. The debit balance, in the case of South Africa, as far as in- and out-tourists are concerned, is still R28 million. Italy had a credit balance of 1 100 million dollars in 1969 and 1 200 million dollars in 1970. Sir, I mention these figures to the hon. the Minister not because I want to be unduly critical but to show what other countries are doing and what importance they attach to the Department of Tourism in those countries. I lay the charge against the hon. the Minister that either in terms of a Cabinet decision or his own decision, tourism in this country is not considered to be as valuable as it is in other countries.</p>

<p>*We find that in France the hotel industry was granted a loan of 63 million dollars at 5 per cent by the State in 1969, and that Israel invested 77 million dollars in the hotel industry while making provision for an amount of R18 million in its Budget for 1971&#x2014;R18 million as against approximately R2,2 million in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, this brings me to the Hotel Board and the question of hotel accommodation. Other members on this side of the House will discuss the hotel industry and the problems experienced by hotels at this stage because they have now, on account of the fact that they have been encouraged by the Hotel Board to provide additional accommodation, landed themselves in the situation that they have a surplus of beds throughout the country, particularly here in the Cape Peninsula. Because we have not had the influx of tourists the hotels had reason to believe they would have, they are finding themselves in a critical position today. For example, we find that there are many hotels for sale here in Cape Town and what is even more serious, is the fact that there are hotels which are feeling the pinch to such an extent that they had to reduce their tariffs in order to fill their rooms. We find that five star hotels are now competing for tourist trade, particularly block tourist bookings, with two-star hotels and even one-star hotels. To my mind this is a most unhealthy state of affairs. Sir, we find that so many bodies are agitating and raising a cry about tourism at this stage that I am surprised that the Minister has not taken more energetic steps in this connection. For example, we find this kind of report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A call to set up a central South African authority: Leading South African Hoteliers diagnose the organizational troubles of the hotel industry in these words: &#x201C;Fragmentation, lack of central authority and lack of a concerted marketing drive, resulted in our national tourism suffering from parkinsons disease&#x201D;.</block>

<p>They called for the creation of a single centralized authority in South Africa to deal with all matters affecting the hotel industry. At present the chaotic situation was created by the fact that the hotel industry had to depend on five different authorities, three Government departments and two statutory bodies for direction in its affairs. But now we find that the proverbial chicken has been hatched first; we have provided the hotels, but we have not got the tourists.</p>

<p>Hotels are fighting for survival. South Africa&#x2019;s fight against inflation has become a fight for survival for many hoteliers. Among the hardest hit by price increases and other inflationary trends is the Western Cape hotel industry which <span class="col_5871-5872" refersTo="page_1399"/>now shows signs of reeling under the burden of the country&#x2019;s economic problems.</p>

<p>So we can quote one passage after another, from the hotel organization and the Hotel Board and newspapers, describing the predicament in which the hotel industry finds itself at present, and this is solely due to the fact that the hon. the Minister and the Cabinet have not devoted the necessary attention to this important matter of tourism.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should now like to turn to additional attractions for the tourist industry. I am suggesting that we are neglecting as far as our international promotion is concerned the wonderful fishing that we have in this country. When dealing with that I claim that a large number of tourists are going to the Seychelles, Mauritius and to the Portuguese coast and all over the place whereas along the Natal coast and the Zululand coast I have been informed that we have some of the most wonderful fishing grounds in the world. We all know what an attraction fishing trips and particularly &#x201C;<i>block&#x201D;</i> trips, have as far as tourism is concerned. Not in a single instance as far as I can recollect have I seen a splash as far as the South African fishing industry is concerned, either of the East Coast or of the West Coast, where we have wonderful fishing grounds. We have Zululand and the Wild Coast and we have South-West Africa, all claiming to have some of the best fishing grounds in the world but we are not promoting them.</p>

<p>Sir, we have a sport in this country, known as surfing, and we have a wonderful coastline with soft, sandy beaches, where some of the most wonderful surfing in the whole world can be had. I see no reason at all why we should not compete with Hawaii or Sydney in that respect. I think that is a wonderful way of promoting tourism to this country. But are we making the most of it&#x003F; I have already spoken about photographic safaris and I have expressed the view, which I base on facts, that there are national tourists organizations who with national daily newspapers and international airlines are promoting photographic safaris all over the Globe. I have instanced the case where one of the Canadian daily newspapers, <i>The Globe and Mail,</i> in conjunction with the Canadian Tourist Corporation and BOAC, organizes not annual trips, but many trips annually, as photographic safari block tours, where the three partners involved all share the costs. Sir, I ask you whether there is a country in the world which has a better scope for photographic safaris than South Africa has&#x003F; Is there a country with the diversity we have&#x003F; When will we think of these things&#x003F; When will the South African Airways, in conjunction with one of the daily newspapers and the Tourist Corporation, run the same sort of thing and make it possible for block tours to come to this country&#x003F; And let me say that block tourists will always get cheaper accommodation and cheaper air fares. They can all come to this country on photographic safaris.</p>

<p>Dealing with publicity and promotion, we appreciate the work done by Satour, but it can only operate within the scope of its budget. Brochures, press advertising, films, all have their uses, but to have the maximum impact in this sophisticated world, more TV time should be bought. When I say this, I refer to the report of Satour here, which I do not have the time to read now. The TV time they bought last year gave them a total audience, over 12 months of the year, of 38 million. Sir, I know just how expensive it is to buy TV time overseas, particularly in America and some of the other highly sophisticated countries. But I will say this, that one half-hour of TV time bought over the TV commercial channels in the U.S.A., will give you an audience of more than 38 million in one showing. I say that much more virile and positive methods of promotion should be used internationally to build up our tourist trade. Sir, I am going to make a suggestion to the Minister. [Interjections.] All the good suggestions have come from this side of the House, and I am going to make another recommendation to the Minister, and that is that he should create a statutory board, and not the sort of board recommended by his commission or by the Riekert Commission, and not the sort of board that will probably be recommended by his advisory committee. He should create a statutory Board and on this statutory board should serve members of his department, representatives of the hotel industry, representatives of the publicity bodies, representatives of the travel agents, representatives of the transporters and the carriers, and other interested bodies, and the body should have substantial funds to begin with. I claim that if such a statutory body is created they will do what all other statutory <span class="col_5873-5874" refersTo="page_1400"/>bodies are doing and what all other boards under the marketing Act are doing.</p>

<p>No. The hon. member knows that I only have a few minutes. I say to the Minister that all statutory bodies are inclined to levy their own members with a subscription to collect the funds to promote whatever project they have in mind. I would suggest for the Minister&#x2019;s very serious consideration that he now create a statutory body, and when I say a statutory body, I mean a statutory body with all the power to act as far as tourism is concerned, with sufficient departmental financial support to make its job worth-while, and leave it to do the job of tourism and to do it powerfully, vigorously and dynamically, instead of doing it in the sort of haphazard way in which the Minister is doing it at present.</p>

<p>When the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, began speaking last year in the debate on the same Vote, he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When this Vote was under discussion last year, I was fairly critical towards the hon. the Minister of Tourism in regard to his handling of this Vote.</block>

<p>This refers to how the Minister views the Vote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He took it amiss of me. I do not want to repeat it this year. I just want to say that I am filled with sympathy for the hon. the Minister.</block>

<p>He said it again this evening. Initially he forgot about it, but after the dinner break he said it again. [Interjections.] But then he had second thoughts. He said he thought his hon. colleagues would make a proposal about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s salary being reduced, but then he felt sorry for him. He now plays around, hovering between reprimanding a man and feeling sorry for him; reprimand him and feel sorry for him. Under that hon. member&#x2019;s influence, if I do not steel myself, it seems to me I shall also begin to feel a kind of pity, but that is altogether in a different context and I think it goes much further. I want to say honestly that I do not feel sorry for the hon. the Minister. To look at him he is radiantly healthy and he does his work, his work progresses and he prospers. My feeling of pity lies with that hon. member in particular, and with South Africa as a whole. This evening I have been thinking that if the hon. member were to be the shadow-Minister of Tourism and some day accept that portfolio, what would be left of him in the first place, and in the second place, what would then be left of tourism in South Africa&#x003F; I think it would be a good thing if the hon. the Leader opposite gave thought to first making the hon. member a Deputy Minister before he becomes a full-fledged Minister.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member had just arranged his paragraphs a little differently, he could have fitted them in exactly with what he said last year. He began by complaining about too little money for this Vote. He says the hon. the Minister has fallen prey to circumstances, but surely he is also sitting there because he has fallen prey to circumstances. It all began when the hon. member was still a general. He has completely forgotten about the fact, that he was still a general at the time in quite another capacity. The only contribution he and that party ever made to this department is that when the United Party Government began to show signs of convulsions in its closing years they were able to establish the South African; Tourist Corporation in 1947. That is all they did.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member attacked the hon. the Minister and said he is only here as a &#x201C;window-dressing&#x201D;. I do not know whether it is worth the trouble to say something about that. There are a few other matters I want to raise, because I preferably want to try to get away from that negativity.</p>

<p>The hon. member again touched on the hotel industry and the question of accommodation. Before I take this any further, I should just like to refer to the report we obtained from this department. The hon. member may take an example from this report. He also referred to it. I no longer remember what adjective he used in describing these six pages, but it was somewhat shocking. Let me tell the hon. member <span class="col_5875-5876" refersTo="page_1401"/>that there is more in these six pages than the hon. member has said during his half an hour this year and the half hours in the two preceding years. This report is a condensed summary of facts. I should like to express my appreciation for this summary in which everything, which is really necessary, is dealt with. It seems to me the hon. member cannot see this. I do not know why it is treated so shabbily. The hon. member counts the pages, but he must remember that it is expected of him to read the contents. Only small children in Sub-A count the pages.</p>

<p>Let us look at what the newspapers, which support the hon. member, have to say. They made inquiries in connection with the hotel position. They state, <i>inter alia,</i> that it is difficult for the hotel proprietors in the Western Cape to make ends meet. There is one thing they wrote which I find very interesting. They wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hotel development has outpaced the development of tourism resulting in a further increase in the number of empty hotel rooms.</block>

<p>Every year that hon. member complains about hotel development. I do not know why he did not quote what his own newspaper, or one of his party&#x2019;s newspapers, states here, i.e. that after having instituted further investigations it appears that hotel development has completely outpaced tourism.</p>

<p>In addition I have a report here of the Hotel Board. Had the hon. member taken the trouble he could have referred to the second page of this report. There is a full account of how far we have progressed, but the hon. member does not notice this. He comes along here with quotations to indicate what the position is, even in France, for example. What have we to do with France&#x2019;s tourism&#x003F; I do not think the hon. member actually understands very well what this is all about.</p>

<p>There are other data of importance as far as I am concerned. If we look at the report we can see, for example, how the number of tourists have increased in recent years. If we only look at how many there were during the various years, and we look at where we stand today, we see that the latest available figure is 389 000.</p>

<speech by="#vorster">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member did not do so. We obtain this same information in the report of the Tourist Corporation. What I find of great importance is that in 1950, i.e. two years after this Government took over and when this department had not even been established yet, 13 390 tourists came to South Africa from Europe. By 1970 this number of tourists had increased to 116 813. I want the hon. member to tell me what he and his party are actually complaining about. Is there stagnation at the present moment&#x003F; Let the hon. member tell us. Is there stagnation here and are we going downhill as far as tourism is concerned&#x003F; The hon. member keeps complaining and every time he requests half an hour for that purpose. For three successive years the hon. member has been asking for half an hour, but he has not yet said anything about tourism. What the hon. member apparently loses sight of, and his party too I think, is that the development of tourism is something quite new. It is, in reality, in the initial stages. This department is only 10 years old, and at this early stage we are fortunate, under the guidance of the hon. the Minister of Tourism, to have been able to evidence this progress, which we are very proud to be able to point to this evening.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened very attentively to what the hon. member for De Aar had to say but I have great difficulty in finding any continuous thread in his argument. The only conclusion I can come to is that if he is the Deputy Minister for Tourism on that side of the House I think that we would prefer to keep our existing Minister. I would like to support my hon. colleague from East London City in regard to the low priority which the Government is affording the tourist industry in its promotion programme. I am worried because a valuable industry is being neglected. All the main elements that are required to promote such an important industry as this appear to me to be absent. There is a complete absence of any sense of urgency. There <span class="col_5877-5878" refersTo="page_1402"/>is an absence of leadership and an absence of co-ordination and, most important of all, the funds that have been allocated for the promotion of tourism appear to me to enjoy a priority that is way down on the list. As far as, first of all, the lack of urgency is concerned, we in Parliament and those in the industry as a whole are still awaiting a policy statement in regard to the Government&#x2019;s intentions with tourism. The Riekert report to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Advisory Council, which contained recommendations in regard to the tourist industry, recommendations on a broad front &#x2014;in fact a report which can well be called a blueprint in embryo&#x2014;was tabled more than a year ago. The contents of this report have, however, not yet been published. We do not know which recommendations contained in the report have been accepted by the Government nor what the Government intends doing about any of those recommendations. And this despite the fact that the first recommendation in the report was that the Government should make a policy declaration in regard to tourism as soon as possible and that that declaration should be given as wide a publicity as possible.</p>

<p>The report of the Department of Tourism for the year ended March, 1971, was tabled only yesterday, more than a year after the period to which it refers. It gives no indication of what the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to tourism is; it is full of completely trivial happenings and neglects the broad picture of the tourist scene. So far we have had no report of the progress made by SARTOC although we were asked and agreed to contribute R273 000 last year and are now being asked to contribute a further R193 000 this year. These are very big sums of money and we do not even know what SARTOC&#x2019;s functions in detail are. On the information that is available to us we simply do not know what is happening. We do not know what is planned by the Government; we do not know what the Government&#x2019;s intentions are on the broad front of tourism. From the little that we do know, we are entitled to assume that little is happening. If anything is happening, we can only assume that it is happening very slowly and without any sense of urgency.</p>

<p>The industry continues to suffer from a lack of co-ordination, a remedy for which was contained in the Riekert Report. In the public sector we have various bodies, we have the Department of Tourism itself, Satour which is a statutory body, the Hotel Board another statutory body, we have the Department of Justice dealing with liquor licensing, we have the Departments of Transport and Information, we have the provinces and the Parks Boards. In the private sector we have the total industry, liquor and non-liquor, the travel agents, hoteliers, tour operators, we have publicity associations, we have chambers of commerce and industry and the Handels Instituut, all of which are interested in tourism, but all of whose efforts are completely unco-ordinated. The Rickert Report did recommend that the board of Satour should be broadened by adding to it representatives from the public sector and from the private sector and that it should become an advisory body to the Government with some teeth, that it should be a statutory body. It also recommended that national tourism congresses should be held regularly. We on this side of the House prefer that Satour should be left alone as an independent body, but we do support the idea of a broadly based advisory body which would be representative of both the public bodies and private bodies that are interested in tourism. Instead of this the hon. the Minister has appointed a small advisory body, a non-statutory body admittedly&#x2014;and I am glad to say this&#x2014;containing some very able men. But it is a body that is responsible to him and not to Parliament. We have heard nothing of a national tourism conference such as was recommended. I suggest that the hon. the Minister is going completely the wrong way about the co-ordination of this important industry. As far as financing the industry is concerned, it enjoys, as I have said, a very low priority in Government allocations. The grant to Satour which to all intents and purposes has been static for the last four years at under R2 million, is hopelessly inadequate for Satour to do a proper job. I had the pleasure during the last recess of spending some time in Sa tour&#x2019;s Lon don office. I was very impressed by what I saw there. I was impressed with the dedication, the initiative and the hard work displayed by the staff of Satour&#x2019;s London office, but they are acting on a shoe-string budget. If it were not for the fact that the South African Airways has a substantial advertising budget in the U.K. and if it were not that there is close and friendly co-operation between Satour and the South African Airways, I would suggest Satour could not possibly do <span class="col_5879-5880" refersTo="page_1403"/>an adequate job. To me it is obvious that there is a huge potential market in the U.K., in Germany, in America, in Australia and in other countries for Satour to exploit. To do that requires money and I hope that in next year&#x2019;s budget the Department of Tourism is not going to be one of the areas where such financial stringency is going to be exercised. Tourism can be of immense value to South Africa. It can lead to improved international understanding of our problems and to a greater utilization of our hotel capacity, a capacity which at present is under-utilized and which is likely to become more under-utilized as present developments come on stream. In other words, tourism is an industry which can be expanded considerably without further capital investments in it. [Time expired.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a great privilege and an honour for me to be a member of this House, and I want to give you the assurance this evening that I shall always endeavour to make a positive contribution and shall do my utmost to be a worthy member of this House. I also want to avail myself of thus opportunity to express my thanks for the friendly reception I have had as well as for all the advice and guidance I have received. I also want to thank the voters of Oudtshoom this evening for the trust they have placed in me by sending me to this House as their representative. Neither can I omit this evening to mention the name of my immediate predecessor, Mr. P. M. K. le Roux. He was a member of this House for many years and represented the constituency of Oudtshoorn for many years. This constituency wants to thank him very much for what he did for it both as a member and as a member of the Cabinet. It is interesting to note that the constituency of Oudtshoorn was represented by a Le Roux in this House since 1923. In other words, this surname is inseparably linked with the constituency of Oudtshoorn. There is also another name that is closely connected with the history of Oudtshoorn. This name is closely connected not only with the history of Oudtshoorn, but also with the history of the whole of South Africa. I am referring to the late Senator C. J. Langenhoven, a son of the Little Karroo and the author of our national anthem. I believe that the Little Karroo played a very important role in the life of this unforgettable figure. Therefore we are very grateful that we are able to show tourists and visitors to Oudtshoom his house &#x201C;Arbeidsgenot&#x201D; in the town. Indeed, it is visited by a large number of people every year. In 1961 there were 5 663 visitors to this house and in 1971 there were 9 576. We anticipate that this number will be doubled next year during the Langenhoven centenary year. It was also through Langenhoven that Meiringspoort, near De Rust, became well-known. Even though a tarred road winds through this very beautiful kloof today, it still has a very strong attraction and a wonderful charm for the motorist and the tourist. The constituency and its voters are proud of the stately and rugged old Swartberge, surrounded by fertile valleys. It is these fertile valleys that make the Little Karroo such a special place, one that may perhaps be described as a place flowing with milk and honey, and that supplies every tourist with the most flavoursome and delicious fruit.</p>

<p>But then the people of the Little Karroo also play a very important part in attracting more tourists to this area. They are people who know the hardships of life, because Nature has not always been kind to them; but they are also people who have learnt to find solutions to their problems and whom we may describe as people who still display the qualities of genuine friendliness and sincere hospitality. These are also the people who have made a very great success of their farming operations, so that the rough Little Karroo could be converted into a delightful place.</p>

<p>Then there is another very great and important attraction in Oudtshoom, one that received a great deal of attention in he pas few weeks in particular, i.e. the ostrich. We have near Oudtshoorn two very well-known ostrich farms, which attract a great many visitors and tourists every year. The figures I have show that there were 20 000 visitors to these farms in 1960, and no fewer that 80 000 in 1970. I should like to mention here this evening that after the shattering collapse of the feather market in 1914, a fine recovery was made in 1945 and 1946, and that there are now 10 feather auctions every year that may also be viewed by tourists. Since February, 1965, ostriches have been slaughtered in a highly modern ostrich abattoir, the only one of its kind in the world. In 1970 a start was made with the tanning of ostrich skins.</p>

<p>But now I come to the greatest attraction <span class="col_5881-5882" refersTo="page_1404"/>of Oudtshoorn, i.e. the world-famous Cango Caves. It is interesting to note that the municipality of Oudtshoorn took over the control of these caves in 1921, and that this is a local authority to which one can really take off one&#x2019;s hat, because it has done its utmost to make these caves a very great attraction for visitors to South Africa. I should like to mention here this evening the name of the town clerk of Oudtshoorn, Mr. Michael Schultz, who has played a very great and important part in this. Thus an amount of no less than R&#x00BE; million was spent on the development of these caves in the past ten years. In 1961 the number of visitors almost reached 68 000. Last year it was 176 000. There is an increase of 10 per cent per annum. We anticipate that this figure will still rise considerably, because in the course of this year tenders will be invited for the building of a cableway to the summit of the Swartberge, and also for the construction of ski-runs! I may mention that there will be two: one below, where the technique of skiing may be learnt, and one on the summit of the Swartberge. Consequently we anticipate that the number of visitors to the caves will be approximately 250 000 in 1975. I should also like to mention that the very well-known programme &#x201C;Son et Lumi&#x00E8;re,&#x201D; which was recorded in the caves, is already available to tourists in seven languages.</p>

<p>Then we also have in Oudtshoorn the C. P. Nel Museum, which attracts many tourists every year. I also wish to mention the hot springs near Calitzdorp, which are now being developed by the Divisional council at a cost of R&#x00BC; million. In the immediate vicinity there is the Kwagga Park, and Ladismith is proud of its Seweweekspoort.</p>

<p>In short, Mr. Chairman, I am grateful that I may represent a constituency in this House that has a very beautiful environment, an environment with an exceptional climate that it can offer and sell to tourists, that it has hospitable people and that, as far as the future of the tourist industry in South Africa is concerned, Oudtshoorn will always play a very important part. Therefore I am glad to serve such a constituency and shall do everything in my power to see the people of that constituency happy and to make them happy. I believe&#x2014;and this is my philosophy of life&#x2014;that man must be happy in his immediate surroundings and in his home and that he must create happiness there for himself, so that we may have that happiness in the greater whole, in the greater South Africa. I wish to conclude by saying that the Almighty blessed Oudtshoorn and its surrounding area with many beautiful things. May these things in the years to come be and remain a permanent blessing for its inhabitants and for the visitors to that area.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is my agreeable privilege to congratulate the recently elected member for Oudtshoorn on behalf of this side of the House, and I think on behalf of all the members of the House, on his maiden speech. I venture to say that it is one of the best maiden speeches I have yet listened to in this House. I think that if the hon. member for Oudshoorn continues to state his constituency&#x2019;s case, and that of the party he represents, as he did here this evening and during the election in Oudtshoorn, there are still many good years ahead for Oudtshoorn and for the hon. member. The hon. member brought a new atmosphere to this debate with the contribution he made. I shall tell hon. members why. Apart from the merit of the hon. member himself, he indicated this evening what can be done by people with initiative. He mentioned the name of Mr. Schultz, the town clerk of Oudtshoorn, who is known to many of us. He is a person who campaigns particularly vigorously for tourism. What the hon. member has sketched of the plans and achievements in Oudtshoorn, can be ascribed to the initiative of those few who inspire others. This is not happening in a densely populated urban spot, but in a part of our country which an hon. Senator on that side of the House called the &#x201C;deep&#x201D; platteland. It is there where people ostensibly live in so-called isolation. With respect to this I want to say that it is specifically the platteland and areas such as Oudshoorn with their attractions, together with the necessary initiative of the locals, which entices tourists. Tourists are not drawn by hotels that all look like those one finds in large foreign cities. Hotels are necessary and there must be accommodation. Tourists are not lured by amusement parks such as one can find anywhere abroad, but rather by typically individual tourist attractions such as one finds in Oudtshoorn.</p>

<p>We have been listening to this debate since 8 o&#x2019;clock. The hon. member for East London City requested half an hour &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; to state the standpoint of that side of the House. But what in fact have we heard from him&#x003F; The hon. member for De Aar quite rightly said that it was largely a repetition of what he has said the past three years. One sometimes gains the impression that some hon. members on that side of the House have the idea&#x2014;and here this has also been stated as such on occasion&#x2014;that the tourist industry in South Africa must eventually take the place of the goldmining industry in South Africa. This is a completely unrealistic approach, but what is even worse is the fact that hon. members, including the hon. member for East Lond City, come to light with a string of objections and complaints about the functioning of this department. In a lamentation the hon. member for Constantia, who was the next to speak, referred to this department&#x2019;s &#x201C;low priority&#x201D;. The hon. member for East London City said that the Minister has virtually allowed his department to be de-graded so that a deputy secretary is now in charge of it. Here they are advocating greater expenditure. This is the same party whose people, day after day in recent weeks, have reproached the Government here and outside for having too many government departments.</p>

<p>The objections of hon. members on that side, about there being too many Government departments, are ringing in our ears. They present to us the fact that in the United States of America there are only 12 departments. However, what is happening here&#x003F; Because we are dealing here with a small Government department which has only a limited role to fulfil&#x2014;it fulfils that role very well&#x2014;and operates on its limited scale, we have had to listen to the complaints that have come from that side this evening.</p>

<p>What we also have in other spheres has again come to light here this evening with the hon. member for East London City trying to compare non-comparable aspects. The hon. member would like our tourist influx from abroad to be comparable at this stage with that from Spain, Greece, Austria, etc. This is surely an impossible comparison the hon. member has tried to make here, because Spain and Greece are poor countries chiefly dependent on tourist traffic for their revenue. With them it is an industry. They are countries with large populations. What draws tourists to those countries&#x003F; In the first place it is the fact that those countries have a character all their own.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Do we not have one&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I want to tell the hon. member that we also have one. However, I am afraid that some days he wants to relinquish it.</p>

<p>I say those countries draw tourists because, in the first place, they have individual, characteristic features. In the second place I mention the fact that these countries are situated near the rich countries of Western Europe which are looking for holiday and tourist opportunities. For that reason there is inevitably a large tourist traffic from the rich European countries to those countries adjacently situated. Have those hon. members ever thought that a tourist&#x2019;s stay in those countries is a very brief one. It is only a matter of a few days. On the other hand, the tourist who take the trouble and incurs the cost of coming here inevitably pays a much longer visit to South Africa. If one therefore wants to compare numbers, one must multiply the number of tourists that come to South Africa a few times to be able to make comparisons.</p>

<p>However, what is of importance, as far as I am concerned, is that one should look at the statistics which indicate the extent to which tourist traffic to South Africa has increased. When I look at the statistics I cannot <span class="col_5885-5886" refersTo="page_1406"/>understand the hon. member for East London City&#x2019;s lamentations. He intimated last year that we only had a growth rate of 9 per cent. It must have been clear to him that, as far as tourist traffic is concerned, we had a growth rate of 18 per cent. Here the numbers speak for themselves. If those numbers are projected on this scale, they indicate that by the year 1980 we will have 750 000 tourists. If one compares this with the fact that we have a White population of almost 4 million, I say that this is an excellent traffic figure, because I want to state very clearly this evening&#x2014;I do not know how the hon. member for East London City, who asked me whether we do not also have individual characteristics in our country, feels about it&#x2014;that if a tourist scheme were to be launched in this country, with our population composition&#x2014;which amounts to the fact that we would be swamped by tourists who outnumber our population by two or three to one&#x2014;we would not retain that character which we do have. [Interjections.] The hon. member who can see into the future says I am becoming afraid. Was it not the hon. member who spoke of the &#x201C;White backlash&#x201D;&#x003F; I am not becoming afraid. I am not becoming afraid at all, but I am saying that my country means something to me and it means something to the tourist because it is what it is. If an excessive number of tourists were to change it in the course of a few years, my country would no longer be what it is. It will no longer have the same significance for me and neither would it have the same significance for those tourists.</p>

Do hon. members on that side think this is not a sufficient number&#x003F; Do they think that three-quarters of a million tourists in relation to a population of just more than 4 million Whites, are too few tourists&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I do not want to waste time on that hon. member, who does not understand the difference between an investment and expenditure and who has repudiated one of his own colleagues. He says that we have not got the attractions of Greece, but he has just been told what attractions we do have; we have caves that people can crawl into; we have big birds that people can come and look at.

<p>Sir, my task this evening is to deal with hotels, but before dealing with hotels I want to refer to the hon. member for De Aar, who said: &#x201C;Alles is in the verslag&#x201D;. Because I am interested in hotels, I read the report of the Department of Tourism, which we received yesterday afternoon. I managed to read it this afternoon during another debate. The hon. member says that everything about hotels is to be found in the report. I read Chapter V which deals with the grading of hotels and complaints received from tourists. Paragraph 5.1 deals with the grading of hotels. There they tell you how many hotels have been graded&#x2014; 1 218. I thought I would see what the Hotel Board thought about it. I found that they had only graded 1 213, so the hon. the <span class="col_5887-5888" refersTo="page_1407"/>Minister of Tourism and his department managed to grade a whole five more hotels than his own Hotel Board had been able to grade. But that is just in passing, Mr. Chairman. Paragraph 5.2 is headed &#x201C;Complaints received from tourists&#x201D; and deals with complaints received during the year. Paragraph 5.3 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Complaints about registered and graded hotels are referred to the Hotel Board &#x2026;</block>

<p>Paragraph 5.4 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the period under review, the department received 29 complaints &#x2026;</block>

<p>It then breaks them down into the different grades. Paragraph 5.5 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Complaints about hotels and accommodation establishments related mainly to to the following &#x2026;</block>

<p>It then deals with all the things that people complained about. We have had a column so far, Mr. Chairman. Paragraph 5.6 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The following is an indication of the nationalities of the persons from whom complaints were received : Rhodesians, 14; South Africans, 11; Britons, 9 &#x2026;</block>

<p>Which should please the hon. the Minister of Defence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Americans, 3; Canadians, 1; Portuguese, 1.</block>

<p>Paragraph 5.7 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from the above-mentioned complaints, the department also received complaints about the following matters &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then we go on the Chapter VI, with another heading. I have therefore learned from the report of the Department of Tourism that 1218 hotels were graded&#x2014;, a figure which does not agree with that of the Hotel Board&#x2014;, and I have also learned about complaints which have been received, and not another single word. But that hon. Minister and his Deputy say, &#x201C;Alles is in die verslag.&#x201D; How right he is, Sir! Everything is in the report. I then decided, Mr. Chairman, to have a look at the Estimates. After all, that is what we are discussing here. We are discussing the Estimates in which provision is made for money to run the Department of Tourism. I had a look at the Estimates and I found that the first item dealing with administration, lists one Minister, one Secretary, who has now become a Deputy Secretary, and the rest of the staff. Sir, this Government obviously has great faith in the hon. the Minister of Tourism. They have given him control over 71 staff members, 71 people earning R245 000. They obviously have confidence in the hon. the Minister. Then they make provision for R21 000 for motor transport. Provision is made for just under R2 million for grants-in-aid to various bodies, and for R71 000 for advertising. I then searched this Vote, which runs into four pages, and I found that after those three items, the next highest cost to the taxpayer of South Africa in the whole Department of Tourism is the salary of the Minister at R19 000. He is the fourth most expensive item, for which the taxpayer of South Africa pays, in the whole Department of Tourism. Mr. Chairman, he is a senior Minister. Near him sits the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, so I had a look to see how many people he was entrusted with. I see that he is entitled to control 8 452 people. Then I thought to myself: Let us see what the hon. the Minister of Defence handles. I found that the hon. the Minister of Defence handles 31 995 people. I thought in my heart that the hon. the Minister of Defence, when he quietly looks at the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Tourism and thinks of this 31 995, will say to himself : &#x201C;Kyk wat hulle vir die Engelsman gee&#x2014;71.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then I thought I would like to have a look at the report of the Hotel Board itself, and what do we find&#x003F; We find that under this Minister, with the 71 people that he is entitled to control, whole chains of hotels are being priced out of the market and have had to cut their tariffs because of empty rooms. A whole company of hotels cut their tariffs in order to fill their rooms and still had to sell out, and this pattern has been repeated over and over&#x2014;empty rooms, debit balances, the collapse of companies, sell-outs and reduction in price.

<p>If tourists come here from overseas it is, of course, also necessary to supply them with entertainment, and if there is perhaps a tourist in this House this evening, I think he has already had good value for his money. But we <span class="col_5889-5890" refersTo="page_1408"/>know the hon. member for Durban Point as a happy-go-lucky person who can crack jokes, but this evening I think he took a little bit too much advantage of that. This is the first time since I have been in this House&#x2014;and I have been here quite a few years&#x2014;that I have heard an hon. member, in congratulating an hon. new member, actually doing so with quite a bit of sarcasm and mockery. But that is what happened here this evening when the hon. member congratulated the new member for Oudtshoorn. I cannot but imagine why this is so, because I know that the hon. member &#x2014;and he said so himself&#x2014;lost quite a lot with the Oudtshoorn election. It cost him quite a bit.</p>

<p>I listened here to the hon. members for East London City and Constantia. The hon. member for East London City&#x2019;s speech put me in mind of a rooster pecking at a grain of corn. He pecked here and he pecked there and then the accusation that the department and the Minister are neglecting tourism stuck in his throat. To use his own words, if I have written them down correctly, he said: &#x201C;This important department has been horribly neglected.&#x201D; Although the words differed, this was also the drift of the hon. member for Constantia&#x2019;s speech. Harsh statistics and hard facts surely disprove this claim of these two hon. members. In the short time at my disposal I should like to prove this.</p>

<p>In all respects we accept that the tourist industry is regarded as an important part of the world&#x2019;s economy. It is indisputably an industry that makes a considerable contribution to South Africa&#x2019;s economy and can do so even more extensively. Although there are those who would like to see the tourist industry developing much more rapidly&#x2014;and the hon. members also revealed this in their speeches&#x2014;so that the Republic can thereby earn more foreign exchange, I am convinced that too rapid a growth would be wrong. Here I associate myself with what the hon. member for Stellenbosch said in this connection. I say it would be wrong to artificially stimulate tourism <i>en masse</i> to the Republic. In the past 10 to 15 years in the tourist industry there has been an orderly and constant growth, and in respect of numbers one finds that the pattern of the last 20 years is such that the tourist industry has doubled every 10 years. In 1960, for example, the number of visitors totalled about 169 000; in 1970 there were virtually 390 000. Over the past half decade we find a particularly constant increase of tourists from both overseas and from countries in Africa, and in the past two years this rate has accelerated markedly. In 1968 there was an 8,8 per cent increase. In 1969 there was a 9,5 per cent increase, as against the previous year. In 1970 the grand total of tourists from beyond our borders increased to 389 694, i.e. 18,7 per cent above the 1969 figure. This is regarded as a record figure. But this tourist influx was not merely a matter of luck or chance. The 1971 figure indicates that 459 478 tourists visited this country, an increase of 17,9 per cent on the phenomenal growth of the previous year. In the past two years the increase of tourism in South Africa was twice as great, i.e. double the increase in world tourism. Since 1970 the long-distance tourists, i.e. tourists from areas other than the countries of Africa, have constituted 45 per cent of our tourist traffic. It is estimated that 48 per cent of the 1971 number came from overseas. Authorities who have a better knowledge of these matters than I myself do, are convinced that tourism from the countries of Africa, i.e. from our neighbouring areas, has more or less reached a saturation point. The increase was about 5 per cent or 6 per cent last year. At this stage England is still our foremost source of tourism from abroad; hence the increase in 1971 of 17,5 per cent in comparison with 1970. The most rapid growth and increase in tourist traffic was from Western Germany and the U.S.A., i.e. 65 per cent and 45 per cent respectively, in 1971. If this growth rate continues along the present lines, the tourist traffic from beyond our borders ought to exceed the half-million mark in 1972, i.e. this year, and in 1980 it ought to reach three-quarters of a million.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the criticism from some quarters, South Africa and the bodies dealing with this matter can look with satisfaction at the growth of the tourist industry. There is now a great possibility that devaluation can be an additional stimulant for the sound increase in the number of tourists. It is thought that devaluation will help the industry because accommodation and travel in South Africa will be cheaper. This will, in fact, be a greater encouragement to the visitor from abroad to visit South Africa and stay here for a longer period. His French franc and German mark will be able to buy him more in South Africa. According to authorities the present exchange rates make the Republic one of <span class="col_5891-5892" refersTo="page_1409"/>the cheapest countries in the world for the tourist. The middle and even lower income groups in many countries have now become a tremendous tourist potential for us; even more so than the visitors of status were in the past. After devaluation the Republic could possibly turn out to be a tourist mecca, and this also applies with respect to the average man who calculates that here he can get the best value for his money.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to refer to a small paragraph on page 4 of the department&#x2019;s report. I want to express my thanks to the Railways, because here it is stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After the department had made representations to the South African Railways about this, it was decided to provide plastic bags in train compartments for the passengers to put their rubbish in.</block>

<p>In Railway debates years ago I lodged that plea with the Railways, and I am therefore very glad that there has been positive reaction to this. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>He pecked at this and pecked at that, and in the end did not really achieve anything. After having had the opportunity now to listen to three speeches from the Government side, it does not surprise us, either, that the hon. the Minister finds himself in such a predicament, because if this is the sort of advice which he gets from that side and on which he must act, he will naturally not be able to accomplish much. Therefore we on this side of the House would rather be positive and constructive and bring matters to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice, matters which we believe are of material importance. We hope he will take our advice, as he has done in the past.</p>

<p>We all have a particular interest in tourism, because it is a matter which holds far-reaching implications for South Africa. What I want to concentrate on is trying to determine whether South Africa is getting is rightful share of what is generally regarded as an explosion in the field of tourism. There are countries in the world which draw literally millions of tourists a year and which earn literally millions of rand in that way. If we compare with that the 400 000 tourists who came to South Africa last year, we are, of course, low down on the list. I accept that we are isolated. We are fairly isolated because we are not on the main air routes of the world. I am not trying to draw a direct comparison, either, but tourism has become a worldwide business enterprise today.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this hon. member has never been more than 50 miles away from Vanderbijlpark; so I do not know what he knows about this. What I want to insist on is that tourism has become a world-wide business enterprise and we would like to see to it that South Africa gets its fair share of it. The demand and the explosion in tourism do exist. The reasons for that, of course, are obvious. In the first place there are more and more people who have more and more money and leisure to visit other parts of the world. In the second place the local tourist attractions have already reached saturation in most countries. In the third place tourism has to a large extent become a matter of prestige. People like to come back and say : &#x201C;I have been overseas.&#x201D; In the fourth place there has been such tremendous development in the field of transport that even remote parts of the world can now be brought within the reach of the tourist.</p>

<p>So there is this explosion in tourism, but in our own specific case it is essential for us to draw tourists to this country, in the first place for social or cultural reasons. We are isolated from the rest of the world and we should like to have that contact with them &#x2026;</p>

What the hon. member for Stellenbosch and others do not understand, of course, is that tourism is also an economic necessity for South Africa. We do happen to have foreign exchange problems, and we do happen to have problems with our reserves. At this moment already there is a negative balance as far as tourism is concerned. Two years ago they spoke of R10 million; last year they spoke of R15 million, and now my colleague has spoken here of R28 million. We should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what that negative balance in respect of tourism is and how large that gap is. More important than anything else is not only the foreign exchange which can be earned, but also the fact that for political reasons and for reasons of international relations it is essential that we should draw tourists from abroad. Every time I have had the opportunity to go overseas it has been so striking that people who have visited South Africa as tourists usually have a better knowledge of our country, a better understanding of South Africa and in almost all cases also a greater measure of goodwill towards South Africa. At the moment we are spending R7 million a year on the Department of Information, of which R4 million is set aside for publicity. Here we can advertise and get publicity for South Africa free of charge if we would only make use of these opportunities.</p>

<p>I come now to the statistics to which the hon. member for Koedoespoort referred. He just accepts things which I feel he should not accept without some thought. In this report it is said that we had 400 000 visitors from abroad last year and we are told that this represents a 19 per cent improvement on the previous year. When we look at this report, however, we see that we suddenly had 10 000 tourists from Botswana, which we never had in any previous year. From Lesotho we had 3 000 visitors, while not a single Basotho ever came to South Africa in any previous year. All of a sudden there are 14 000 from Swaziland, but never before have we had anyone from Swaziland. What happened here, of course, was that the system of book-keeping was changed. This figure of 19 per cent seems to be an artificial one. Previously these visitors whom I have mentioned were probably classified as domestic visitors, but now they have suddenly become visitors from abroad. This figure of 60 000 more visitors in South Africa last year we should, in fact, correct by deducting 28 000 from it. Then we are left with only 33 000, which is only a 10 per cent improvement on what we had before and not, as they are trying to make out to us, and 18 per cent or 19 per cent increase. This is what one would call a form of statistical inflation. We do not only have it in our economy, but in our Department of Tourism as well.</p>

<p>What worries us about the number of people from abroad who visit South Africa, however, and I take cognizance of the fact that 10 000 more people from Britain visited South Africa, is that the number of visitors from the Americas remains comparatively small. It is true that approximately 5 000 more people came from America itself, but America still only accounts for about 10 per cent of the number of tourists who come to South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I believe this is an important issue. We want to draw tourists from America, because they are inverterate travellers; they are spenders, and normally come here to stay for quite some time and to spend quite a lot of money. I am anxious to discuss with the hon. the Minister ways and means of increasing the number of tourists that we could draw from America. It is the national ethos in America to think in terms of big things. They like doing things which, in their own terminology, are &#x201C;great&#x201D;. They like things that go around the world. They have around the world flights, and the North Pole flights, and so on. At the moment South Africa is isolated as far as America is concerned. The thought I would like to put to the hon. the Minister is that he should use his department and his prestige in the Government towards the development of around-the-world tours in the Southern Hemisphere. This would have an immediate appeal and have a considerable attractiveness as far as the Americans are concerned. Already the framework is there. There are many flights down to South America; from South America to South Africa we have direct fights, some of them operated by the South African Airways. South Africa could be the centre from where we could organize further tours in Southern Africa. We also have direct air links with Australasia. The same sort of thing could happen there. From Australia tourists could return to America either via the South Sea Islands or via Hawaii. Here. I believe, is an immense field from which we could draw tourists. If Americans could <span class="col_5895-5896" refersTo="page_1411"/>see this as part of a big package tour, around the world tours in the Southern Hemisphere, it would be something that would have immense impact and appeal to the Americans. From our point of view, this kind of tourist development is necessary. It will take some time to plan it, to promote it, but this hon. Minister is known for the dynamic action that he normally takes. I think that this is a suitable opportunity for him to establish himself fully in the Government as the man who could organize this type of activity. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to take the opportunity to offer heartiest congratulations to Mr. Wessels, who is at present the head of this department, on the responsibility that has been entrusted to him. We want to give him the assurance that he will obtain the utmost support from this side of the House to let this department also come into its own in all respects. Similarly we should also like to express our thanks and appreciation to all members of this department. In mentioning these officials, I should also like to make an exception by including the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s private secretary, Mr. Cas Bothawho is also doing very good and specially appreciated work in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this evening we have listened here to a group of speakers on the opposite side of the House who spoke with contempt of this department. The hon. member for Hillbrow, who has just resumed his seat, said at the beginning of his speech that he wanted to be positive this evening. But let us see in what respect that side of the House was, in fact, being positive. This report, which was published by the department, was spoken of with contempt. The hon. member for Durban Point referred to it humorously. He made fun, <i>inter alia,</i> of the merely 71 officials of this department. But if he and the hon. member for East London City had read through this report, they would have found that in the past year these 71 officials have dealt with no less than 203 000 people. They had dealings with these people in the interests of tourism and in the interests of South Africa. But there is a further reason&#x2014;and this is a fact the United Party cannot explain away&#x2014;why this department and this hon. Minister are spoken about with so much contempt. The reason is that this hon. Minister was previously a member of that party. But that is not all; he is also referred to contemptuously because he is an English-speaking person on this side of the House. It is not necessary for me to prove this, because that side of the House has already proved it this evening. When he compared this hon. Minister with the Minister of Defence, the hon. member for Durban Point said mockingly, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Minister of Defence could have stated: &#x201C;Look what they are giving the Englishman&#x201D;. But that is not all. When the hon. member for De Aar attacked the hon. member for East London City, the hon. member for East London City said by way of an interjection : &#x201C;I am not the only Afrikaner on this side, but he is the only Englishman on that side&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>You said it by way of an interjection. We all heard that ridiculous remark. If that side of the House wishes to imply that they want to serve South Africa with love and goodwill, as they implied in the debate on the Defence Vote, this can also be done in respect of this department. The hon. member for Hillbrow referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the hon. member for Stellenbosch and said that we are afraid of tourists from abroad. We are not afraid of those people.</p>

<p>But I want to mention another factor. The hon. member for Durban Point also mockingly said that this Government must have a tremendous amount of confidence in the hon. the Minister. That is true. We have sufficient confidence in this hon. Minister because he is strong enough to tell tourists who want to come along here <i>en masse</i> that what they sometimes want here does not always suit South Africa. [Interjection.] That hon. member is now laughing, but I want to ask him if he is in favour of casinos being established in South Africa. Is he in favour of strip-tease dancing being freely presented in South Africa generally&#x003F; That is what the masses want. That is what a large sector of the masses overseas want, and this hon. Minister was strong enough to say no, and we praise and thank him for that.</p>

<p>I should like to come to another thought. One of the most colourful figures we had in the Department of Agricultural Technical <span class="col_5897-5898" refersTo="page_1412"/>Services was a certain Mr. Jack Brewis. When addressing farmers he made a habit of beginning with the words : &#x201C;Farmers, do you know your land&#x003F;&#x201D; I fear that if the question &#x201C;Friend, do you know your country&#x003F;&#x201D; were asked of the tourist enthusiasts in South Africa, very few would be able to give a positive answer. I think that one of the reasons for that is the fact that our local authorities do not let the tourist attractions in their respective regions come into their own. I want to refer to a few instances overseas. Volendam in the Netherlands is a tourist attraction merely because of the fact that they retain the traditional dress and customs. The city of Haifa has become famous as a result of the remains of an old nearby fort, which has a very interesting history. Fortunately we in South Africa also have one particularly good example, and the hon. member for Oudtshoorn referred to it this evening in his maiden speech, i.e. Oudtshoorn. I think it is time our local authorities adopted a new approach for utilizing and giving substance to our tourism. I know the department cannot be blamed for that, but I should like to suggest to the Minister that he should consider establishing a board or committee consisting of his public relations officers, who will trace these undeveloped tourist attractions and incorporate them in a specialized tour policy, tour programme or tour route. Those who are interested in geology, for example, can be supplied with a tour guide in which all the geological wonders of our country are indicated. For those interested in history, all the important historical places can be indicated. We should like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider that. In furnishing these examples of towns or local authorities which do not make full use of their sources, I want to mention two simple instances. Both these examples are, it so happens, in my constituency, but I should like to refer to them. In Senekal there is a square which is completely surrounded by fossilized tree stumns. One of those tree stumps is about 100 feet long. The main route from Cape Town to Durban passes that tourist attraction at a distance of about 400 metres. I think very few of the people know this. In Bethelehem, about 50 metres from the main route, there is the bird sanctuary where, <i>inter alia,</i> we encounter the royal swans we received from King George V in 1947-&#x2019;48. These swans were later supplemented with swans from the royal gardens. Very few people know about that, and we should like to ask that this committee, consisting of the liaison committees, should do this introduction work if it is possible.</p>

<p>I think that Golden Gate is reasonably well known generally in South Africa. In the past there was the complaint that Golden Gate was more often than not closed as a result of the few facilities available. I think that we can now rightfully claim that the Golden Gate has now swung open for South Africa. I am referring to the recent opening by the Prime Minister of the new Brandwag Tavern, a project which cost about R1,2 million. I want to auote to hon. members what the Prime Minister said about Golden Gate on that occasion, and I quote from a report (translation) :</p>

<block name="quote">He predicts that Golden Gate will become the biggest holiday resort in the interior of South Africa when the public discovers what a jewel this is &#x2026; In his wanderings he has never encountered a lovelier place than Golden Gate.</block>

<p>This evening we should like to pay tribute to the National Parks Board for the work they are doing, on such civilized lines, not only to preserve South Africa&#x2019;s natural scenery, but also to make it available in the way they are doing. To those who do not know South Africa, we should like to say that they never will know South Africa if they have not seen Golden Gate in all its glory, as it looks at present.</p>

<p>I think this beauty also places a responsibility on us as tourists in South Africa, i.e. that we can only enjoy and appreciate this when we take upon ourselves the responsibility of keeping these tourist attractions clean and tidy. One appreciates the fact that there are some groups and newspapers who launch campaigns to promote tidiness: but this ought not to be necessary. We in South Africa must ensure that this exquisite country of ours is also kept clean by us when we are enjoying its attractions. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. H. VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, several members on the other side of the House have expressed their annovance this evening at the report which the department has made available to us. I do, however, want to remind members on that side of the House that this report is written for intelligent people. As such this report is a deeply penetrating comprehensive <span class="col_5899-5900" refersTo="page_1413"/>report. For people who have the desire to examine the activities of this department, I believe this report is a very informative one.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow spoke of inflationistic statistics which were made available to us, as if to say that the visitors from Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland were previously listed under &#x201C;foreign visitors&#x201D;, while at present this is not the case. I do want to point out to the hon. member that the number of international tourist arrivals decreased by 3 per cent in the past year, while here it increased by 18,7 per cent. Therefore, the tourist industry of the Republic reflects a very good increase, as far as we are concerned.</p>

<p>But there is something else the hon. member for Hillbrow mentioned, i.e. that the Republic has become a caricature. I do now want to state that in this respect I must agree with the hon. member. We have, it is true, become a caricature with such an Opposition of so many years standing. An Opposition of so many years standing does indeed make a caricature of the Republic, with an Oudtshoorn thrown in for good measure. This country, the Republic, has a great deal to offer us and to offer the tourist, because it is an international resort which is held in high repute by the tourist abroad. It is a country with a rich variety of recreational facilities and, as far as the natural scenery is concerned, it is a country with the greatest number of hours of sunshine in the world, even exceeding the 2 700 hours of sunshine on the French and Italian Rivieras. In Pretoria we have 3 400 hours of sunshine per year. It is those particular facets of the Republic of South Africa which have contributed to the tourist industry increasing by 18,7 per cent, while internationally it has increased by only 7 per cent. For this fact the hon. the Minister of Tourism, together with the Secretary and the members of the departments, receive the utmost appreciation from this side of the House. But likewise the Director of the Board of Control of the South African Tourist Corporation and the members of that department have also, in our estimation, reflected a fine team effort. We have here a team effort by several departments in the Republic.</p>

<p>I mention here the team effort, incorporating the Department of Tourism and the Departments of Information, Agriculture, Water Affairs, Transport, etc. Each of these departments is making an outstanding contribution to the establishment of tourist attractions in the Republic of South Africa. Sir, I have said that as a tourist country the Republic is unique. It is unique, not only as far as its natural beauty is concerned, but also for the thousands of kilometres of beaches we have along our coasts, but in addition for the nine national parks, the beautiful mountain ranges, the blue of our skies and our colourful wealth of flowers, with 11 000 varieties of wild flowers having been recorded in the Cape alone. To a large extent the Republic&#x2019;s potential as a tourist country is as yet undeveloped, and therefore I believe that the Department of Tourism, with the team it has, has a special task to perform. I am thinking, for example, of the coast that stretches from Port Elizabeth on the East Coast up to Port Alfred, which is virtually completely undeveloped and is awaiting that development that we need very badly in the Republic. I am not thinking only of the beach resorts, but also of the need we have for facilities for our holiday-makers in the interior, people who, for a short while, want to get away from the noise of the city and its polluted air, and who have a longing and a hankering for the silence the rural areas have to offer the holidaymaker in that respect.</p>

<p>Sir, here I want to lodge a plea with the hon. the Minister and the department for the development of that potential in the interior. I am thinking, for example, of the Nuwejaarsdam at Alicedale near Port Elizabeth, which is still completely undeveloped as a result of a lack of supply facilities, etc. I am also thinking of the Mentz Lake with its exceptional plant growth and that exceptional climate, which many of our inhabitants have a very great need for. I am also thinking of the Boesmans River, where there is the potential of a beautiful dam that can still be developed, and I am also thinking here of the various departments involved in that.</p>

<p>Sir, if I have a plea to make here, it is one for co-ordination in particular. I am thinking of the co-ordination of various bodies involved in the development of our territory, including holiday resorts and places of historic significance. I am also thinking of those 21 associations in the Republic which, each in a particular area, are devoting themselves to nature conservation. With all these associations and the <span class="col_5901-5902" refersTo="page_1414"/>various departments in mind, there is surely a need for co-ordination as far as the development of the tourist potential of the Republic is concerned. I therefore want to advocate that this co-ordination be extended, not only as far as the development of this potential is concerned, but also with respect to the planning which must frequently be done by local authorities. As far as local authorities are concerned, one finds a lack of planning with respect to local potential, and here the department can surely furnish a great service, particularly in the rural areas, where such a great need exists. I therefore feel that this department, with its fine achievements and all the fine things it has established, also has a very big task as far as co-ordination is concerned.</p>

The hon. member for Somerset East said that the Republic of South Africa was unique. I quite agree with him. It is indeed unique.

<p>For some reason, known only to the hon. the Minister of Defence, that post was abolished and Mr. Vladimir Petrus Steyn was appointed as Secretary for Tourism in 1966. That post was specially created for him. He took over what was a comparatively new department with a very small staff. Let me deal with some of the things about Mr. Steyn that</p>

<p>we know. We know that Mr. Steyn was a dedicated public servant, that he was a strong personality, a man with drive and initiative, a man of originality and ideas. In fact, he was a dynamic character.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>We know also that five years later this dynamic personality, after 36 years as a public servant, was kicked out of the Public Service. He was the man who built up the department to what it is today, a department with seven branches and, as one of the previous speakers said, a personnel of 71. He was also the chairman of Satour. Despite that, he was kicked out of his job on 31st August last year at half an hour&#x2019;s notice. A note was delivered to him by the Minister&#x2019;s private secretary, and in that note he was informed that the post of Secretary for Tourism was to be abolished the very next day. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This much we know. We know this from the hon. the Minister, because he replied to questions which I asked him in this House. We know this also from Press reports. I want to ask the hon. the Minister for what reason Mr. Steyn was dismissed from his post. [Interjections.] <i>Die Burger</i> of 3rd September, 1971, reported as follows under the heading &#x201C;Steyn en Waring het vasgesit&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit was in klaarblyklike geval van botsende persoonlikhede dat mnr. V. P. Steyn feitlik summier uit sy pos gesit is.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister if Mr. Steyn had any right of appeal against the decision. It is apparent that he made no appeal. In the case of appointments, the Public Service Commission makes recommendations to the Minister concerned and in the case of dismissals, the Public Service Commission also makes recommendations to the Minister. But in this particular case his post was abolished and the <span class="col_5903-5904" refersTo="page_1415"/>post of secretary of the Department of Tourism was in fact downgraded. This could only have been done by the Cabinet and it must have been done by the Cabinet on the strength of the recommendations and the suggestions of the hon. the Minister.</p>

If there were personality reasons&#x2014;I admit that Mr. Steyn is a very outspoken man with a strong personality&#x2014;what did Mr. Steyn say that was wrong&#x003F; Whom did he criticize&#x003F; Did he disagree with the Minister and, if so, on what grounds did he disagree with the Minister&#x003F; I want to ask the Minister specifically whether he had any complaints about the conduct of Mr. Steyn. If he did have any complaints about the conduct of Mr. Steyn, did he lay those complaints before the Public Service Commission&#x003F; Or, Sir, did the Minister advocate the downgrading of the head of his own department&#x003F; If he did, why did he do so&#x003F; It was a bigger department than ever before and it had more staff than ever before. There was a need for strong leadership in that department, a need for drive and enthusiasm, and there was a greater public awareness in the Republic of the importance of tourism. Why then was that post downgraded&#x003F;</p>

<p>What else do we know, Sir&#x003F; We know that Mr. Steyn, after 36 years of public service, was prematurely put on pension at the age of 58 years, seven years before the official date of retirement, at a considerable financial loss to himself and at a loss to himself of the various benefits that go with the important post of Secretary for Tourism. He was given a public slap in the face. What else did Mr. Steyn say&#x003F; If I may say so, Mr. Steyn seems to have conducted himself with considerable dignity in the face of considerable provocation. Mr. Steyn said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Al wat hy hieroor wil s&#x00EA;, is dat dit die eerste keer is, waarvan hy weet, dat iemand op so &#x2019;n manier afgesit word in die 36 jaar dat hy in die Staatsdiens is. Was the Minister dissatisfied with this man, with his very distinguished record, with such a long record of service, with such a strong personality&#x003F; Did he ever speak to Mr. Steyn about his dissatisfaction&#x003F; Did he ever express his displeasure to Mr. Steyn&#x003F; Did he ever speak to Mr. Steyn and ask him whether he felt that the post of Secretary for Tourism should be downgraded&#x003F; Apparently not, because Mr. Steyn says, according to <i>Die Burger,</i> that he knows of no reason why his services should be terminated. Did the Minister call Mr. Steyn in his right-hand man, for a farewell chat on the afternoon that he was dismissed at a half hour&#x2019;s notice&#x003F; No, Mr. Chairman; he sends him a note by way of his private secretary, giving him half an hour&#x2019;s notice to vacate his post because the post was being abolished the very next day. I say that this is a scandalous thing, unless the Minister is able to give us a very convincing reason for the way in which he has treated this very senior and very popular public servant. I want to ask him : If the post of Secretary for Tourism is so unimportant as to be down-graded, does he not think that the Minister of Tourism should also perhaps be down-graded&#x003F; Has he not read what was said on 5th February this year by one of the Dutch travel publications published in the Netherlands, namely that Mr. Steyn was one of the strongest and best known personalities that these Dutch visitors to South Africa had ever met&#x003F; Has he not read what <i>Travel Time</i> said about Mr. Steyn&#x003F; In October, 1971, they said&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">He could, we suggest, appoint that experienced and practical and talented administrator, Mr. Vladimir Steyn, not as secretary, but as Minister of Tourism. A safe seat, (says the journal) could surely <span class="col_5905-5906" refersTo="page_1416"/>be found for Mr. Steyn, a man with drive and imagination, or he could even be made a Senator.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the Minister to take this House into his confidence and to say why it is that this man, with 36 years&#x2019; service, first of all with the Department of Defence, should have been relieved of his post. He held a very responsible post; that post was abolished, for reasons known to the Minister, after he had done wonderful service for the Republic. He built up this department from a department which was a new department, with a small number of personnel, to a larger and more important department.

<p>I would point out to hon. members on that side of the House that they on many occasions do not refer to us as &#x201C;hon. members&#x201D;. However, let me take up this issue which was raised by these two hon. members. I want to tackle this issue now, but let me, in passing, say to the hon. member for Durban Point that he made a big song and dance about the fact that &#x201C;ek &#x2019;n Engelsman is en dat die Afrikaners aan hierdie kant van die Raad voel dat daardie R16 000 of R19 000 darem baie is vir &#x2019;n Engelssprekende&#x201D;. I would like to say to him that I think that the shadow Minister of Tourism on that side, the old Ossewa-Brandwag-generaal &#x2026; [Interjections.] I say that because I am used to this sort of cheap gibe. I think the gibe can just as well be placed upon the head of the hon. member for East London City as it can be on mine. Now, let me get to the matter that was raised by the hon. member for Simonstown. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>He said it was a scandalous thing on my part. He used that sort of language. I now want to give the whole background to the situation. I am not going to mention the person&#x2019;s name. I will refer to him as the incumbent of the position of Secretary. The hon. member for East London City never mentioned the person&#x2019;s name and I respect him for that, but the hon. member for Simonstown did. Let me put it to the House this way: On the establishment of the Department of Tourism in 1961 and up to October, 1966, the Secretary of the department had the rank of deputy secretary. Members will remember that in October, 1966, because of a redundancy that occurred in the Department of Defence &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am sorry, the commandant-General. He became redundant. He then became a full Secretary to the Department of Tourism.

<p>The third recommendation was that he should be retired from the Public Service. I accepted the recommendations and that is the position as it stands.

I as Minister had to make a decision as to what I thought would be in the best interests of the department, and that was the decision I reached. I know the hon. member for Simonstown. The hon. member for Simonstown will create an unpleasant atmosphere about anything, and he will do it if he thinks he can score a point against the Government; he will do anything and he is known for this in this House. I want to say another thing and that is that I am prepared to show confidential papers to a man in the Opposition benches for whom I have always had the greatest regard. I am referring to the Leader of the Opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition would like further information and further confidential papers I will show them to (him.

On the other hand, the hon. member will appreciate that the Hotel Board&#x2019;s report reached him well in time, and the same applies to Satour&#x2019;s report.

<p>I gather that this is a major issue with the hon. member for Durban Point. I have just asked the department and they tell me that it must be due to an error by the Government Printer. The hon. member made a big issue out of the fact that the number of registered hotels is shown as 1 218 instead of 1 213. I know why he is doing that. He is trying to pull a red herring across the floor of the House, because this is the hon. member who said on previous occasions that no hotel, or very few hotels, would ever register with the Hotel Board.

<p>I would like to tell him that the Hotel Board will not register a hotel which is not up to a certain standard. If I remember correctly, it was those members on that side of the House who complained about the standard of some of the hotels in this country. Now, because they are not registered, he asks whether I am proud of the fact that certain hotels have <span class="col_5911-5912" refersTo="page_1419"/>not been registered. They have not been registered, because they have not been able to conform to the minimum standards laid down for a one-star hotel.</p>

<p>I said 95 per cent of the hotels are registered with the Hotel Board. The hon. member for Durban Point knows what he said previously.

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My time is up; I will answer tomorrow.</p>

<p>I want to say to hon. members that one of the troubles they have is the fact that they are very disappointed with the figures of tourists that have come to this country. I have just been given the figures for 1971 by Satour. Just listen to this. During 1971 our overseas market sectors yielded a 34 per cent increase, compared with a world increase of 7 per cent. They mention that from the areas adjoining South Africa, for example Rhodesia&#x2014;, the term they use is &#x201C;overborder countries&#x201D; as against &#x201C;oversea countries&#x201D;&#x2014;the increase has only been 6 per cent. But this was something that we expected; because we realized that in the case of Rhodesia we had reached almost the optimum. We are now pulling in more and more people from overseas. When I tell hon. members that in 1960 the ratio between tourists from overborder countries and tourists from oversea countries was four to one, and that now it is practically one to one, they will realize what a tremendous increase there has been in the number of oversea tourists who come to this country. These are the facts. That is why they find themselves in great difficulties in criticizing the development of tourism in South Africa. [Interjections.] The total figure of tourists who came here in 1971 was 459 000. In their days the number of tourists was under 100 000. Naturally they object to and criticize the fact that this Government has increased the tourist figure to 459 000. This year, on the basis of the monthly figures that we get, it will reach a figure of &#x00BD; million before the end of the year. That, in our opinion, is a satisfactory figure, regardless of all the talk of explosions and that sort of nonsense that we get from that side of the House.</p>
